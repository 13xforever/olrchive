14039	19642	Tonight, January 18, 2009, could we see the DSi released in April for the US?
19943	23805	Circuit City goes under, and are the .hack games set to make a comeback?
31977	36021	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36061	42386	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42446	44008	We are back after a little bit of a break.
44628	51154	Took a little break last week because I was in Hawaii taking a little vacation, but I'm back now.
52168	53529	and refreshed and feeling better.
54010	54890	My name is Rob Roberts.
54910	56372	I'll be joining you for the next several hours.
56792	61076	Not joining us tonight, sadly, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61596	62377	She has the night off.
62958	66861	It's her last week before going back to school, so she's taking care of some things around the house.
66901	68322	But we have somebody filling in tonight.
68783	72266	I called the other woman that I know, the other female gamer I know.
72306	74107	So say hello to Rice Princess.
74468	75368	I'm your mistress.
75669	75949	That's right.
75969	76750	How you doing, Rice Princess?
77230	77951	Oh, I'm okay.
77991	78732	How about yourself?
78892	79593	I'm doing great.
79854	80535	It's good to hear.
81396	83879	I see you're wearing a Silent Hill t-shirt showing your love for Pyramid Head.
84139	89046	Yeah, because I thought the camera was going to be working tonight and I did my hair and everything.
89146	90047	Well, here's the funny thing.
90127	91489	I know you look very cute, by the way.
91649	92090	Thanks.
92350	94251	I can take a picture and post it to the website or something.
94271	94731	All in vain.
94932	95292	I know.
95312	96753	Well, I get to see you and that's important.
96953	99194	Yeah, because you're not gay at all.
100315	100555	Okay.
100995	101455	Here's the thing.
101495	109620	I was going to say you and Jamie both have Silent Hill shirts that you wear to the show, so we need to get you both here sometime and you can be twinsies.
109780	110961	Are they the same shirt?
111421	111601	No.
112022	112322	Oh, okay.
112362	113523	I think she has a slightly different one.
113843	115324	Mine's thermal, so it keeps me warm.
115524	115804	I see.
115904	117305	That's good because we have a cold garage.
117915	118556	Kind of, yeah.
118576	119216	A little bit.
119396	120737	So I'm going to survive tonight.
120777	121058	All right.
121098	122579	Well, I'm going to get the heater on in just a minute.
122599	124500	But thank you also for bringing Snickerdoodles to the show.
124520	124821	You're welcome.
124841	127403	Because you know bribing us with food always freaking rocks.
127743	128083	Yep.
128684	128884	Always.
128904	129104	All right.
129625	133128	Say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's joining us tonight.
133308	133568	Hello.
133828	134409	How you doing, Loki?
134609	135209	Doing fine.
135490	135750	Great.
135830	136771	How was your week off?
136791	137391	What did you end up doing?
138532	140614	Trying to get Grand Theft Auto PC to work.
141314	141575	Yeah.
141815	143256	It's taken a turn for the worst.
143336	143756	It's like...
145393	145913	I don't know.
146833	147754	It was doing so well.
147794	148914	It was working just fine.
148974	152955	And all of a sudden, Rockstar's like, ah, fuck this shit.
152995	154715	We're not going to work no matter what you do now.
155615	159136	I've reinstalled it like eight times now.
159296	163737	And I've uninstalled all the other things that remotely might be related to it.
164157	166398	And it just does not want to work.
166518	167658	And apparently I'm not alone.
167738	168498	And yeah.
169909	170489	Thanks for watching!
189868	190469	I just don't know.
190929	192150	So, I give up.
192991	197355	I actually bought this game, and see, that teaches me for not pirating this shit.
197836	198696	See what happens?
199017	201819	If I buy it, it breaks, and it sucks.
202380	207144	If I had just downloaded it like I should have, wouldn't be having this problem.
207524	208065	Seriously.
209870	230025	Okay, well alright, well hey, you had tuned in, because also last week we missed, you know, our buddy Bobby, Bobby Blackwolf does a show before us here on All Games Radio, and he does the Bobby Blackwolf show on Sundays, but he just launched a new Friday night show, right, Friday Night Gaming, and you tried to play Grand Theft Auto with us.
230285	231686	Oh yeah, that was even more fun.
231766	232166	Let's see.
232566	239749	Yeah, for some reason then Xbox Live said, no, you're never going to connect to this game ever if you even want to.
240190	241810	I tried four different times.
241890	248634	I even reset my system a few different times and it just said, no, I'm sorry, you just cannot connect to this game ever.
249614	251475	So fuck Grand Theft Auto.
253403	257586	That being said, still been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto 4.
257886	261729	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 4, I have to bring this up.
261769	262670	This is pretty awesome.
262710	263571	I gotta rub this in.
264131	273398	While I was in Hawaii, I got Grand Theft Auto 4 for $30 on the Xbox 360, and I got Metal Gear Solid 4 for $20 for the PlayStation 3.
273838	275059	Both new and wrapped.
275259	277980	It's like getting them for $5 in Hawaii.
278060	278640	Kind of.
278660	280081	Really cheap.
280661	281922	Radio Shack, apparently.
282082	293747	I had forgotten that they had gotten in the market of selling games, but then when I saw that they were clearing them out, because I guess I hadn't been performing very well, I suddenly remembered, oh yeah, I think we reported that on the show once, is that Radio Shack was selling games.
294367	295667	And not anymore.
295808	298149	You know, actually, I was going to say that...
299729	301330	Best Buy was clearing out some games as well.
301350	306854	They had Ninja Gaiden 2 for $10 for the 360.
307855	308155	Nice.
308375	310196	I wouldn't buy it because I don't have a 360.
310716	312197	You should get one one of these days.
312237	312858	You really should.
313578	315560	Are you still on your anti-Microsoft thing?
315660	318061	I thought you finally caved and you were going to get one.
318081	319162	I'm not anti-Microsoft.
319302	322704	I'm just anti-Xbox because it's a piece of crap system.
324185	324906	You guys missed it.
325806	328448	Bryce, Princess, and Loki were getting into it before the show about Nintendo.
329268	330369	Maybe we'll talk about it later.
330429	338995	Yeah, well, why don't you just tell them what you said and I won't even need to do anything because, you know, it was so asinine that, you know.
339195	339976	We'll get to it later.
340016	344238	I've got to introduce someone else because she's been sitting there very quiet and patiently, which is so unlike her.
344959	345559	Fuck you.
345619	348141	Is that going to be your first words on the show?
348161	349382	Yes, it is going to be my first words on the show.
349442	350002	Fuck you.
350122	350382	All right.
350482	352063	She has never been on the show before.
353761	354441	Miss Victoria
373345	377127	See now, I'm looking, the chat room is going crazy right now for two reasons.
377527	384271	The earlier, and of course you can always join us in chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com The chat's not working on the laptop, so we can't see it.
385030	386451	We'll get it working somehow later on.
386731	388252	But Loki and I can see it.
388292	388692	They're there.
388952	389613	They're freaking out.
389633	391554	They want pics of Rice Princess.
391694	394575	So I'll try to get something on the Twitter because, you know, OMG woman.
395076	401159	So I'll try to get Rice Princess and Victoria to pose and maybe I'll get them to make out a little bit.
401179	404881	I still have that one jello shot in the refrigerator from New Year's.
404901	406282	All right.
408347	420537	Also, they're freaking out because right now in chat, a brand new Orange Lounge Radio website is being previewed.
420957	426362	It's been made by our buddy Deekman, and he's posted the preview link there in chat, and it's amazing.
426622	432386	I am so excited that finally our website that looks old is going to be going away and looking new.
432547	434248	I am so freaking excited.
434448	437412	Do you know why that's why I love our listeners?
437512	440696	Because it's like, which one is giving them the bigger boner?
440856	444780	Like women on the show or the new website layout?
445682	446843	That's awesome.
447324	447504	All right.
447524	447744	All right.
447784	448465	Back to Victoria.
448525	449646	She's never been on the show before.
449907	451128	We have to interview Victoria a little bit.
451428	451789	More about me.
452509	453530	It's all about you, isn't it?
453610	453970	Duh!
455251	457092	So what kinds of video games do you like?
457172	458253	What kinds of video games do you play?
458273	459154	Do you play a lot of games?
459214	459874	It's okay if you don't.
459974	461255	I don't, unfortunately.
461315	463316	I play Rock Band when I come over to your house.
464077	466659	And the only video... Well, we have a PlayStation 2 at my house.
466739	467959	My roommate plays Kingdom Hearts.
468039	471241	But the only thing I play is on my GameCube.
471302	473483	And I play Mario Party 7 because that's the only game I have.
473503	474544	Because I stole it from my brother.
474564	476905	Okay, so she knows a little bit about her games.
476965	478026	She knows what she's talking about.
478046	479347	So she's got some stuff that she plays.
479367	479587	Kind of.
479867	480347	DarkSakura.com
500837	502258	What is it that you write, bitch?
502758	504098	Well, I'm a Harry Potter role player.
504658	505759	I'm a big Harry Potter nerd.
507399	507859	I admit it.
508460	509120	I'm proud of it.
509420	510060	I'm proud of it.
510700	511441	Okay.
511461	515922	Rob, you need to shut the fuck up because you used to be the vice president of the Star Trek Club.
516442	516923	And what?
517663	518043	Yeah.
518203	519664	Like 15 years ago.
519704	520004	I know.
520044	522865	He has such a boner when the movie is going to come out.
522885	524645	He's going to drag my ass to the midnight premiere.
524945	525846	I can already tell you.
526346	529367	So what exactly do you mean by... Or like...
530291	552548	role-playing basically I take on one of the roles of one of the characters in Harry Potter and somebody else takes another role or make they make up their own and we just plot and we don't I'm not like no no no no no no no no no no no yeah basically that's that's that's it and we just plot and make our own little storyline it's glorified fan fiction basically
553570	562495	Okay, alright So you do other nerdy stuff too though, like I know you watch Lost religiously All the time, oh my god, Wednesday, I'm so excited!
563916	578664	The thing I love about Victoria is she's so animated, this is great I gotta read some comments from chat about the whole roleplay thing Chat.orangelawnsradio.com, we have GS68 says she puts on a robe and wizard hat Fuck you!
580482	581564	I do not.
582104	583166	I do not.
583566	583887	All right.
584728	587291	That's only for the premieres.
587672	589013	Are you going to dress up for the next premiere?
589174	589654	I might.
590255	592838	If it comes down to it, I'll just buy a t-shirt and wear my Harry Potter jacket.
593099	593399	Okay.
593459	593820	That's all right.
594180	594540	That's all right.
594560	595402	There's nothing wrong with that.
595842	596042	Really?
596082	599587	What else was I going to say about you being a nerd?
599687	600989	Oh, you went to Comic Con last year.
601009	601810	I go to Comic Con every year.
601830	602811	I'm from San Diego.
604012	605735	So I go to Comic Con every year.
606536	606936	I love it.
607016	609119	It's going to be huge this year.
609159	610981	I can already tell you it's the 40th anniversary.
611442	614345	I haven't bought my tickets yet, but I should do that soon.
615974	617655	What is it you like to see when you're at Comic-Con?
617675	620057	I go for the movie premieres and stuff like that.
620317	624980	Last year, I saw the panel for The Day the Earth Stood Still.
625100	637568	I unfortunately went to the Twilight panel and wanted to kill myself because all the little screaming 12-year-olds were creaming their panties over Robert What's-His-Face.
638469	639510	I go for the movie premieres.
639830	642071	I've met so many celebrities because of Comic-Con and
643412	647214	You know, met Matthew Fox, who I kind of creamed my panties over.
648834	653796	Well, all right then.
655957	661619	Suddenly the chatters are lining up to roleplay Matthew Fox in your next Harry Potter thing.
662439	663299	That's amazing.
665345	667328	Okay, we've got to take this back to video games at some point.
667368	672136	But my buddy Shane, an old friend of the show, Miklatov, is listening, and he's sending me private messages.
672517	674781	Tell Irene and Victoria hi, and they need to make out.
674881	675382	Tell them now.
675442	676604	Hi, Shane!
678086	678387	All right.
679102	680063	We'll have to get the liquor out.
680123	680903	Maybe that'll happen later.
681824	682044	All right.
683445	686246	Anyhow, let's actually get back to some gaming here real quick.
686606	686847	Oh, wait.
686947	688808	I do want to ask you one other question, though, speaking of video games.
688828	689748	I can't take it back to gaming.
691069	697012	I love World of Warcraft, as you know, and Rice Princess also dabbles in World of Warcraft once in a while.
697073	697873	Really funny story.
697893	703096	She played her boyfriend's account last night and out-DPSed another character because she didn't even know what she was doing.
703136	706318	But anyway, you are what we call a WoW Widow.
706718	708718	I have a little bit of a grudge against WoW.
735885	737106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
757629	758150	All day long.
758170	759432	I would stop doing Orange Lawns Radio.
759492	761374	You know, I have a friend in San Diego.
761454	764979	One of my gays in San Diego plays WoW just so he can dress his characters up in pretty outfits.
765600	766121	He told me this.
766141	770827	He's like, it's a guild of nothing but women, and we dress our characters up in pretty outfits.
771408	771728	So...
775916	778878	There's so many great things to say, but first off, Victoria has her gaze.
779819	780400	She has.
781440	781681	Yes.
785304	787445	And there really is just a guild of women that dress up.
788506	796733	A guild of women and Patrick that just dress up and they run around and like, I don't know what he says, they run around and just, I don't know, do things.
797739	798099	All right.
798659	800080	Yeah.
800420	802961	Do you know what it was your ex-boyfriend was doing in WoW that took so long?
803201	804841	Was he dressing up in princess outfits?
805261	805861	Serving the castle.
805881	807662	What is it you do when you play for four hours?
807722	808082	Raiding.
808182	808662	Yes, that.
810283	810483	That.
810983	811283	Okay.
811363	813404	And so, yeah, that's what he would do.
813664	814344	And so when...
814904	817286	Yeah, I broke up with him, to say the least.
817546	819468	Did you tell him that that was the reason you were breaking up with him?
819488	820829	Well, it wasn't the main reason.
820889	822391	He was a douche, but, you know.
823872	828296	But that had a pretty big influence on why I am no longer with this person.
828976	829277	All right.
829717	830398	All right, fair enough.
830938	834801	So, I'm sure we'll get into it later if we're talking about Warcraft stories and you hear a big, Ah!
835242	835842	Oh, hell no!
836563	837103	From the corner.
837143	837884	Stop talking about that shit!
839346	839726	Grand Theft Auto 4
860811	861752	Thanks for watching!
883288	888672	There's other sandbox games that have come out on the PC, like Saints Row 2 just came out, but that sucks on the PC.
889173	890134	Horrible port.
890994	892235	It's just sad.
894357	898020	Rockstar, unfortunately, is not doing anything to fix Grand Theft Auto 4.
898540	902824	To be honest, I've never seen a game where I can reinstall it and it still doesn't work correctly.
903757	904758	Except for Crysis.
904898	908260	Crysis also didn't work correctly when I reinstalled it, but that was a whole different way.
908861	919549	I couldn't finish that game because, you know, I would get to the general or whatever and he'd be standing there like a mannequin and couldn't progress any further because the event didn't trigger.
920590	921110	Well, that sucked.
922551	926034	Other than that... Um...
927625	930168	I think I watched Nellie play more Animal Crossing.
930889	932271	Oh, I forgot I had that game.
932291	932671	What?
932871	934393	You guys have Animal Crossing?
935514	936295	Well, not anymore.
936335	938959	I ruined it for her, apparently, because I cheated.
939619	940881	Were you time-traveling?
942037	942958	No, we did that before.
943438	946722	No, this is actually pure cheating now.
946902	955210	They have devices that you can, you know, hack the memory and stuff and give yourself all this crazy shit.
956351	957652	Including download content.
958993	960434	Because it's pay for unlock content.
961776	961816	Um...
964505	967186	Yeah, the game's really boring because it's just Animal Crossing.
967987	969127	But they had some fun codes.
969147	970127	Let me put it this way.
970528	977350	They had a code where you can go into the characters' houses and you can steal their furniture and move it around and stuff.
977731	979051	That is pretty awesome.
979291	980872	And you can also do it to the stores, too.
980892	982093	You can just go and pick up stuff.
983093	992117	And see, that was funny because we had maxed out money and there were some characters that were pissing us off so we just trapped them in a corner and surrounded the furniture around them.
993135	995298	And that was mildly satisfying for a second there.
997621	1001465	Yeah, really what I've been doing with my consoles lately is I've been streaming movies.
1001766	1002747	That's pretty much what I did.
1002767	1005971	I actually downloaded a bunch of the Rift Track shorts last night.
1006011	1007192	We were watching some of those.
1008093	1008794	They're awesome.
1009655	1011417	But yeah, the PS3 actually works really good.
1012839	1013820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1034492	1036394	and it's really nice actually.
1036654	1038255	Very, very nice looking.
1038275	1040957	It makes full screen video really easy.
1041077	1048023	The layout of it's really big so that you can see it on your TV and it works great.
1048283	1054348	So definitely something to check out especially if you're just browsing YouTube stuff or you want to show your friends something.
1054709	1062755	I just happened to show them the new shorts that they did for YouTube Live for Charlie the Unicorn.
1064136	1064897	Oh, God.
1080970	1084774	They're going to actually show us everything and they're bringing me a turntable I get to keep.
1084894	1086516	So that's pretty cool.
1086816	1087097	Nice.
1087177	1089899	That's the one that Newark's actually doing the turntable for.
1090420	1095165	And the only thing I don't like about it though is it's all urban and hip hop music.
1095225	1099650	But it makes sense in that game because there's not a lot of scratching in techno music.
1099750	1101452	Yeah, I was going to say that's kind of...
1102012	1102253	Yeah.
1102373	1105276	The music that is produced by Turntables.
1105396	1106917	I just wish there was some more house music.
1107138	1107818	And maybe there is.
1107978	1109300	But I'll find out more this week.
1109340	1110441	I get to see it on Thursday.
1110521	1112203	So I'm pretty psyched about that.
1112383	1114845	So definitely tune back in next week for Loki's review.
1115206	1115386	Yes.
1115686	1115927	Sweet.
1116067	1116307	Sweet.
1116807	1117068	All right.
1117688	1119210	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
1119991	1121112	Victoria grabbed your boob.
1121592	1121813	I know.
1121853	1123174	I just didn't want to acknowledge it on air.
1123214	1124075	But thank you for doing that.
1124802	1134664	I totally downloaded Samurai Shodown 2 on Virtual Console and I was having good times with that because that was one of my original fighting games that I loved to play all the time.
1135365	1136685	So I was playing that for a while.
1137625	1138285	Who's your character?
1138545	1140286	Galford because he has a dog.
1140906	1144387	It's the only reason I ever played it because Galford was on there and he was hot.
1146067	1146367	What else?
1146747	1148028	PopCap games.
1148208	1153009	Oh, I got Silent Hill Origins for Christmas kind of late because it came out.
1153129	1153749	Oh, on the PlayStation 2?
1154350	1154550	Yeah.
1154990	1155510	Oh, how is it?
1156471	1159833	It's not the best Silent Hill.
1160153	1162415	It's not bad, but it's different.
1163535	1165376	Yeah, because it was made by some European team.
1166257	1166957	But it's not bad.
1166977	1169279	Did you ever play Silent Hill 5?
1170159	1170480	No.
1171240	1172241	I want to, but no.
1172341	1173802	Technically, it's Silent Hill Homecoming.
1174462	1175062	But whatever.
1175302	1175903	Homecoming 5.
1176383	1180305	Isn't it only on the... Silent Hill The Room, you know, that's 4, whatever.
1180325	1181106	I don't give a crap.
1181297	1183438	Yeah, isn't it on the Xbox?
1183858	1184138	360 and PS3.
1184158	1184418	PS3, yeah.
1184438	1185519	I don't have any of those.
1185639	1187620	Oh, yeah.
1187680	1188280	I keep forgetting.
1188700	1189180	You're stubborn.
1189260	1189601	I don't get a 360.
1189641	1190881	But you have friends.
1190981	1191581	Yeah, you know me.
1191701	1191982	Yeah.
1193022	1194403	Do I have to come over here and play?
1194423	1196223	Because I am so fucking lazy.
1196243	1197364	I'm not going to drive here.
1198264	1201866	I love Silent Hill, but I also love not driving places.
1204507	1205647	One of these days, I'm sure.
1205847	1208808	Maybe I'll pull a Victoria and stay the weekend at your house.
1209229	1210509	Can we tell that story real quick?
1210549	1210809	Can we?
1210829	1211109	Can we?
1211129	1212790	The reason why Victoria is here on the show tonight.
1213110	1215731	Victoria, why don't you tell our listeners why you're here on the program tonight?
1215851	1217072	So, I'm kind of dumb.
1217732	1219333	I'm opening a hotel right now.
1220053	1221554	There's a new hotel opening out in...
1222814	1223374	www.DarkSakura.com
1242226	1246950	Yeah, and my roommate isn't home because she's in Sonoma seeing her boyfriend.
1247410	1248811	So she's not going to be home until tomorrow.
1248871	1254115	So I'm basically stuck at Rob's house until tomorrow imposing on his good hospitality and all that nonsense.
1254996	1257237	And I'm very grateful to him for letting me stay here.
1257377	1258058	That's right, bitch.
1258378	1259699	You better gush.
1259999	1261180	If not, I'd be sleeping in my car.
1261320	1262761	Tell the listeners about how wonderful I am.
1262921	1263242	Oh, yeah.
1263342	1264303	He's so good to me.
1264763	1266124	All right.
1266144	1267325	Anyway, I just thought that was my story.
1268699	1271843	I was going to say, there was one game I did forget about that I actually played this week.
1271903	1272483	Ninja Blade.
1272724	1273785	I played the demo for that.
1274766	1275647	Which is pretty cool.
1275987	1279171	The game looks kind of like a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden 2.
1279932	1282876	It's actually more of a rip-off of Conan or God of War.
1283176	1284297	The game plays very similar.
1284477	1288022	You have three different weapons with varying speed and damage.
1289003	1291206	and, um, you know, it's all ninja themed and stuff.
1291547	1299318	But then, there's a lot of, like, quick time event, um, cutscenes that are in the game, which are pretty cool looking, just very cinematic and action packed.
1299599	1303725	There's one scene where you're actually running down the side of a skyscraper, and, uh,
1305172	1309795	Killing these dragon-looking monster things, which are pretty awesome.
1310596	1311657	It's definitely worth checking out.
1311697	1312557	It's not crap.
1312717	1315039	It's definitely not Vampire Reigns.
1315479	1316700	That'll be a good one to check out.
1317100	1319002	I think it's coming out at the end of March now.
1320223	1324105	It's one of those secondary FromSoftware games that Microsoft's publishing.
1325286	1326307	Good times, good times.
1326327	1326447	Yeah.
1328260	1334383	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp So Victoria, you know how you can extend your stay here at Rob's?
1335263	1343887	Do his laundry, do his dishes, clean his house The guy that I was seeing told me to cook for him, but you know, he's all diet-y and stuff
1344187	1346508	I wanted to give Loki the presents I got him from Hawaii.
1346668	1347409	What did you get me?
1347529	1351931	So I got him an authentic dashboard hula girl doll because I thought he'd like that.
1352251	1353252	I got Jamie one too.
1353312	1354433	She'll find out about that next week.
1354453	1358755	And then I got some, since you like food, I got you some macadamia nut covered toffee which is really good.
1359235	1360036	So eat it.
1360416	1360896	It's amazing.
1361016	1362057	I'll give this to Nellie.
1362417	1362777	Eat it.
1363397	1364178	Nellie will like it too.
1364338	1364518	Yes.
1366522	1367043	So there you go.
1367743	1368564	Thank you very much.
1369044	1369505	Sorry about that.
1370185	1370986	I just remembered that.
1371266	1373929	So you were done with your gaming week too then, Rice Princess?
1375810	1378633	Victoria, I don't know if there's been anything you've been playing, but why don't you share?
1379253	1381035	I played Rock Band with Rob yesterday.
1382516	1384358	We made a band, The Shrieking Beavers.
1386720	1391424	And then I have a game on my phone that I've been playing, but that's as awesome as it gets.
1392298	1392998	What game on your phone?
1393038	1393999	It's called Pump Jack.
1394279	1396360	It's like a little, you're like a little... Sounds dirty.
1396420	1397140	I know, right?
1397301	1397961	I know, right?
1398001	1398161	Wow.
1398421	1399842	No, it came with my sidekick.
1400882	1407065	So, like, it's like your little wheel and you have to go collect all the gas cans and you have to avoid the little cactuses that can explode and kill you.
1407466	1408566	The new Pump Jack!
1408786	1409927	Pump Jack, yeah!
1410407	1415929	No, and I've been playing it since I got my damn phone, which is almost a year, and I still haven't beaten it.
1416109	1418410	I'm on the last level, and it's driving me crazy that I can't win.
1418890	1422912	Which goes to show you why I don't play video games, because I get frustrated, and then I just don't want to play anymore.
1422932	1427534	Well, we have an interesting story later on that might appeal to you.
1427694	1428354	I'll talk about that.
1428634	1430335	What they're doing for frustrated people like you.
1430615	1431576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1446309	1448009	The old school one for PlayStation 1.
1448189	1449250	I was playing that like crazy.
1449270	1450990	I haven't really touched it since I got back from Hawaii.
1451250	1453571	Because I got to a part of the game where it actually got hard again.
1453651	1456851	So I'm getting to the Victoria level of frustration with it.
1456891	1458492	But I'll go back and try to beat it at some point.
1459592	1461352	And then as far as new stuff I've been playing.
1461632	1463573	The new stuff I've been playing is on the iPhone.
1463953	1464813	Which is kind of interesting.
1464853	1466694	Konami put out some interesting games this week.
1467034	1469534	They put out a demo for Dance Dance Revolution.
1469594	1471155	The new iPhone DDR game.
1471975	1472355	Which is...
1473777	1474498	Interesting.
1475218	1477640	Its biggest problem is it's choppy.
1477900	1482243	Seriously, if you think the Xbox frame rate thing is an issue, try playing DDR on your iPhone.
1482303	1483043	It's pretty horrible.
1483383	1484344	But it's very pretty.
1484604	1493370	For a cell phone game, it's actually very pretty looking, and the sound's very good, because obviously iPhones are iPods, so the music is obviously full quality, which is kind of nice.
1493810	1497993	And basically what it is, a little dance pad shows up at the bottom of your screen, and you play with your fingers.
1498133	1502997	You dance with your fingers to the music, which is cute, but I don't know how...
1503937	1504958	I mean, luckily it's free.
1505098	1505558	It's free.
1505739	1506499	So you can't complain.
1506659	1507420	Totally free.
1507620	1509141	But it's just the one song for free.
1510062	1511163	Just one song?
1511243	1512044	Yeah, it's one song.
1512084	1512804	Wow.
1513465	1516467	But it's like a preview of what they're working on or something.
1516907	1517128	All right.
1517368	1520250	The other game I got on the iPhone is Silent Hill.
1520390	1521811	They actually have on the iPhone now.
1522191	1523653	It's a new version of it.
1524293	1527075	I think it's called Silent Hill The Revenge.
1527135	1528316	I can't remember the name of it.
1529237	1530638	I'm actually looking it up on my phone right now.
1531339	1532319	It's called...
1533374	1534976	Silent Hill The Escape Silent Hill The Escape
1556789	1559790	I have no idea if they can hear that over the air, but a little bit of what it sounds like.
1560370	1562090	No, you actually... It uses the touchscreen.
1562110	1563730	It's a whole new interface that uses the touchscreen.
1563750	1573272	You can slide back and forth to move through the maze, and you turn left and right, and then to fire your gun, you tap on the crosshair to fire the gun, and the crosshair is all tilt-sensitive.
1573652	1575373	So if you want to aim up and down, you tilt.
1575713	1579994	So you will run across these nurses in the maze, and you can blow their brains out, basically.
1581394	1583655	It's not really a Silent Hill game.
1583835	1588738	It's basically a dungeon-crawling game that they've slapped Silent Hill graphics onto.
1589238	1590579	Surely you just, Rob.
1590619	1593540	Well, Silent Hill is all about avoiding things.
1593600	1596242	You don't necessarily have to shoot everything in the face, you know what I mean?
1596702	1598203	But this game kind of encourages that.
1598463	1599223	Thanks, Rob.
1599263	1602125	I have never played Silent Hill, so I appreciate you explaining it to me.
1602145	1603766	But I'm telling you, for the listeners, you know what I mean?
1603786	1604286	I know, I know.
1604766	1605547	I don't know what it's about.
1605587	1606908	I've seen the movie.
1607128	1608229	And you didn't like the movie, did you?
1608530	1609430	I was pissed at the end.
1609450	1610431	I was like, what the fuck is this?
1612393	1614735	But it's more one of those things that's much better if you've played the game.
1614755	1617077	That's what I was told.
1617097	1620160	So, yeah, Silent Hill on the iPhone is kind of eh.
1621301	1621821	I mean, it's only $8.
1622041	1623062	You can be honest.
1623903	1624484	You know what?
1624544	1625084	Here's the thing.
1625224	1627386	It's actually a really smooth running game.
1627666	1629507	The controls are kind of interesting.
1630528	1632690	Compared to DDR, the frame rate is much better.
1632710	1633630	It runs a lot smoothly.
1633971	1637433	For a mobile phone game, the graphics are actually pretty good.
1637593	1641396	And if you play with headphones, the sound and stuff is actually kind of neat.
1641857	1644679	So it's actually not a bad game.
1645359	1648242	It's just kind of short and not really Silent Hill.
1648942	1649903	That's the thing.
1650524	1658311	So, I mean, if you want to get kind of an interesting maze exploring game that you shoot things in, get this game.
1658531	1661895	Or if you want like a, you know, just, it's a cute little time waster.
1662375	1665018	I mean, there's only like six levels, so I don't know if it's necessarily worth $8.
1665218	1669402	I think maybe $5 would have been a better price point for this, but, you know.
1670815	1699959	whatever, I guess yeah, when I think of Silent Hill I totally think of shooting my way out of a maze they had to come up with they have these little story elements that are in it too, although not much I haven't seen Pyramid Head yet, but I might not have just played far enough it's alright, you have to remember it's a mobile phone game, if your expectations are high, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment I know, why don't they just make it a generic game or something it's nothing like Silent Hill well it is
1701727	1703488	We have a Victoria mic because we can't hear it.
1703508	1705710	Because then it wouldn't get sold if they didn't put Silent Hill on it.
1705950	1707211	That's pretty much it right there.
1707631	1713075	But what's interesting about this is that, hey, there's a Metal Gear game coming out and a lot of people are like, OMG, Metal Gear on the phone.
1713115	1714976	Well, if it's anything like this, don't get your hopes up.
1714996	1715696	It is exactly.
1715856	1716637	Actually, it's worse than that.
1716677	1717478	It's a real shooter.
1718198	1720359	Then it's not even going to be anything.
1720439	1724862	And then a pad comes up and you just use your fingers to hit the buttons and it's only one song.
1724942	1725123	Yeah.
1725823	1726303	Yeah.
1726724	1727124	There you go.
1728718	1729439	Alright, so there it is.
1729499	1733102	That was my quick review on the Silent Hill The Escape, the iPhone game.
1733743	1736845	Otherwise, I don't think I've really been playing a lot of new stuff.
1737586	1739588	You know, just playing the same old stuff.
1740108	1741710	Well, there's console games too.
1743982	1744803	I'm the best warrior ever
1774863	1776646	So we'll do that a little later on.
1777146	1778488	And she'll be back next week.
1779049	1784395	And apparently also in housekeeping tonight, we have a brand new Orange Lounge Radio website coming soon, it looks like.
1784876	1786879	Because the beta looks great.
1787139	1789642	And if you're in chat right now, just ask Deakman.
1789682	1790824	He did awesome.
1791482	1791822	He did.
1791862	1794064	It doesn't look like it was made in the early 2000s.
1794144	1794685	It doesn't.
1795045	1796386	It looks very modern.
1796446	1798908	It's still simple, though, is what I like about it.
1798928	1799869	It's sophisticated.
1799929	1802371	He didn't load it up with a bunch of crap.
1802472	1805294	It still looks efficient, which would be cool.
1805734	1806875	So I'm very excited.
1807496	1807976	It's attractive.
1808156	1809297	Big thank you to Deakman.
1810218	1812760	And we'll find other ways to thank him later on when the site goes live.
1813061	1817164	Maybe we'll send Victoria out there to babysit because he's married.
1817565	1818986	So Victoria can go babysit.
1822768	1824949	I have a 10-year-old brother and I want to kill him every time I see him.
1825649	1827029	I can't stand children.
1827049	1829910	I'm reporting you to the authorities.
1829930	1830430	No, I don't hurt him.
1830450	1836071	I just kind of pull his hair a little bit and smack him in the head and tell him to quit looking like a little girl with his John Lennon hair.
1839232	1841113	Doesn't your 10-year-old brother play Grand Theft Auto?
1841173	1841833	Yeah, he does.
1842293	1846774	He called me on Christmas Day asking me to find him cheat codes for Grand Theft Auto 4.
1847434	1849375	And I said, God damn it, you have the fucking internet.
1849415	1850095	Look it up yourself.
1851089	1851990	To your 10-year-old brother.
1852010	1852651	To my 10-year-old brother.
1852971	1853552	He knows I love him.
1854052	1856175	He shouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto 4 anyway.
1856215	1858377	He's been playing Grand Theft Auto since he was like 6.
1859939	1862582	My dad thought it was appropriate to buy him GTA 3 when he was 6.
1863283	1863563	Okay.
1864244	1864624	Yeah.
1865025	1868249	So, fabulous parenting on my parents' part.
1869190	1869490	Yes.
1869670	1871713	Wonder how I turned out so normal-ish.
1874841	1876301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1895246	1896427	Thank you for watching!
1911994	1916198	Cuckoo, Kudo, Kodo, Bunko, whatever.
1916258	1917219	Okay, so Kodu.
1917639	1922243	Anyways, it's basically a very simplified game-making program.
1923324	1925105	They're comparing it to LittleBigPlanet.
1925225	1936996	I don't think it's anything like LittleBigPlanet at all, but it's kind of object-oriented programming stuff, and you can use the characters and stuff in there to basically create your own little games.
1937036	1938957	They're all kind of pixelated-looking because of the...
1939818	1940298	and so on.
1963775	1964375	Thank you for watching!
1982120	1984381	One of these days, I want to get Aaron back on the show.
1984421	1985861	I'm hoping he'll listen at one point.
1985961	1987402	He's the guy who did Snake 360.
1987442	1990903	I want to talk to him now, like six weeks out after his game's been released and see how it's been going.
1990923	1995464	I saw him respond back to, there was an IGN review of his game or something.
1995484	1995624	Really?
1995644	2001006	They were talking about the hot or not of community games, and his was actually in the not section.
2001366	2003766	And the reasons that they gave are retarded.
2003786	2005407	They're all, oh, it's Snake game.
2005467	2005847	Yeah.
2006323	2009304	And it totally looked like the guy did not play the game at all.
2009424	2011785	So it was retarded, but it was funny.
2012445	2014365	Because he called him out on it.
2014385	2017526	He's like, doesn't sound like you played this at all.
2018766	2020847	Actually, there's a lot of features that you didn't mention.
2022307	2025808	There's some other games that were just crap that they gave good reviews for.
2026109	2027549	But remember, it's just one person's review.
2028609	2030810	Just because they happen to be behind a website...
2032088	2033108	UGO bought the 1UP Network
2056078	2064604	This week, and basically, it caused, you know, long story short, it caused EGM to go under Electronic Gaming Monthly.
2064644	2065685	The magazine is no more.
2066266	2070208	And lots and lots of folks that were working at 1up.com, goodbye.
2070328	2077253	Including the people that were doing the 1up show, and 1up was 1up Yours, was the video show.
2077634	2078494	I'm going to be honest, guys.
2078534	2078994	It's so funny.
2079875	2080355	Here's the thing.
2081396	2083698	There's not a lot of extra news to talk about with us.
2083738	2085579	I'm sure you guys all read it in the week we were gone.
2085959	2087660	So you all are probably pretty familiar with it.
2087700	2091743	If not, go look on any blog that was running last week, and I'm sure you'll read about it.
2092284	2100810	It's very interesting, like, really how much love was out there for these shows and this site, which was interesting to me because, honestly, I've never...
2101550	2102110	And no offense, but...
2128724	2131845	Um, and to be honest, I don't even know who Yu-Gi-Oh is.
2132225	2136047	I mean, I've never heard of them as a website.
2136107	2140208	Don't they run a lot of other websites for entertainment, movies, things of that nature?
2140589	2151573	They're trying to be like a one, not one, an IGN type of service, but I've never visited them ever, and you know, I don't know, I just have never heard of them.
2151913	2157135	It's, you know, maybe that's my own ignorance, but I've never heard of them at all, and
2157881	2158582	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2185683	2202587	How much these guys that were producing these shows and doing this stuff were really into video games and really into their craft because as many independent podcasts have shown for years and years and years, you don't have to get paid to do this stuff if you really, really enjoy it.
2202967	2206308	So my kind of thing was I was going to say, well, guys, here you go.
2206448	2211490	Here's your chance to keep doing what you do just because this may not be the day job anymore.
2211570	2212910	You can still keep it going.
2213510	2214050	And they have.
2214430	2215311	So props to them.
2215351	2218472	Because now there is the whole Rebel FM, I think it's called.
2218693	2221314	And I think there's another one called Geekbox.
2221914	2224195	So props to them for continuing to do it.
2224655	2228157	So I'm kind of curious to see how much this is going to go.
2228197	2229798	And kind of where some of these guys end up.
2229818	2231318	I think... Well, this is the same thing that's going to happen.
2231358	2234040	Remember, you know, that's how we got This Week in Tech.
2234260	2235701	I mean, you know... True.
2235761	2238462	Fallout from Tech TV, so...
2240322	2241543	I don't know.
2241683	2247887	And I'm sure that they'll make it just as well and probably even better now that they're away from 1UP.
2248907	2249628	Why do you say that?
2250088	2250628	Just because.
2250888	2251869	Look at this week in tech.
2251889	2261075	I think they're doing very well and I think that if they were still part of G4, the whole tech TV thing, I think they wouldn't be doing as well as they are now independently.
2262175	2266578	Less influence from other things that are more corporate oriented.
2268078	2268498	Interesting.
2269058	2269639	Well, good luck.
2269679	2274421	I mean, it's never fun to talk about job layoffs, but good luck to those folks.
2274521	2280223	And good luck to 1UP too, staying kind of on top of things now.
2280884	2283705	Of course, they've taken a lot of negative press over this whole thing.
2283805	2284825	So I don't know.
2284865	2288807	I've got to ask you, Rice Princess, because you were on 1UP for quite some time.
2289187	2292989	Years ago when I was posting on there and participating on the site, you were kind of the one that got me into that.
2293009	2295150	And I think you kind of hung out there for a little while after that.
2295510	2297231	What do you think about all this news about it closing?
2297531	2299012	Is 1UP a site you would still visit?
2299113	2300513	Or are you like, eh, the people are gone?
2300834	2301754	Whatever.
2301834	2309680	It's interesting because, yeah, I actually did revisit my 1UP account a couple weeks ago, actually, before any of this ever happened.
2309720	2311521	And I still have the same friends and stuff.
2311541	2313222	I didn't really do anything.
2313282	2320187	But, I mean, it's always sad when a community, a group of people, just can't meet at the same place anymore.
2320227	2324089	It's like having your favorite local coffee shop or something close down.
2324129	2325290	It's just like, oh, that sucks.
2325770	2326971	You just moved to a new coffee shop!
2327291	2327911	I know, that's what I'm saying.
2327931	2336576	People can get each other's information, go to another place and do it, but you can go to another coffee shop, but it might not be as cool or as quirky or whatever.
2337137	2342059	Now, the thing is, in defense, I guess you would say to UGO, print
2346175	2347276	Game Informer, something like that.
2356294	2357915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2379111	2380292	Electronic Gaming Monthly News
2403109	2404691	has been dead to me for 10 years.
2405752	2408754	I remember that magazine back in the day.
2409235	2415421	Oh my God, that issue where they actually had the Shang Long lie in it for the April Fool's.
2415521	2417603	I freaking had that issue with the magazine.
2417663	2418544	I remember that.
2419104	2425410	I remember some of that stuff happening, but honestly, I stopped subscribing to that a long time ago.
2425430	2426331	A lot of people did.
2426571	2430372	So for me, it was more the news of, oh, well, you know, that's too bad.
2430412	2432852	That's an icon of my youth that's going away.
2433373	2435073	But I'm not surprised.
2435213	2453637	Yeah, I mean, with the advent of, you know, internet news outlets and especially blogs, blogs are becoming more popular than, you know, normal media sites because people like to identify with other people who are on their level, who are normal, who can give, you know, a perspective, you know, that's not like corporate.
2453917	2458260	And a big purpose for magazines now in this day and age is to read when you're on the toilet.
2458380	2462083	But now that they have iPhones, you can look at blogs when you're on the toilet now.
2462263	2462884	You can?
2463064	2463364	Yes.
2464445	2465225	That's what I do.
2466166	2468768	So, I don't even need magazines anymore.
2468828	2470129	I can look at websites.
2470969	2471910	Only, oh wow.
2471950	2473071	What, Victoria, what?
2474130	2475390	You a nasty hoe.
2476851	2478972	We don't want to know what you do when you're taking a dump.
2479152	2480792	Look, everybody poops.
2480872	2482153	Haven't you ever read that book?
2482353	2483853	Everybody poops.
2485154	2492856	If you wipe your butt and you get a little bit of poop on your finger and you put it on your thing, you can't throw it away like a magazine.
2493036	2493677	Stop it.
2493997	2496878	I'm down with the old school magazines being in my bathroom.
2496898	2497538	You know that.
2497658	2500239	You see all the Maxims lined up on my toilet.
2501099	2502019	La la la la la.
2502179	2503380	We can move away from that now.
2504040	2510406	But what I'm talking about is that, you know, people used to have the magazines or the, what was it, the bathroom reader books or whatever.
2510726	2514309	But now we can have the internet even when we're pooping.
2514690	2515130	We could.
2515150	2517132	So we can look at blogs and all that there.
2518293	2519654	I guess you're right about that.
2520984	2522426	It's gross, but yeah.
2523046	2527912	So magazine, I'm just saying magazines are, you know, it's one last use.
2527932	2531196	Did you take your, oh, I'm holding your laptop right now.
2531256	2533479	You've had this in the bathroom with you, haven't you?
2533979	2534120	Oh, yeah.
2534140	2536102	There's poop somewhere on here, isn't there?
2536422	2536582	No.
2536983	2537844	Oh, damn it.
2538525	2540027	Why are the keys so sticky, Rob?
2541823	2542763	You're disgusting.
2542923	2544284	Somebody burn my hands off.
2544384	2544764	Alright.
2545864	2547004	Please let's move on.
2547024	2548264	Yes, please.
2548924	2549265	Alright.
2549445	2553005	Well, there's a rumor coming from IGN.
2553045	2563508	They have multiple sources close to Nintendo that have told the site that the DSi will be out in the US on April 4th at $179.
2567443	2568944	I somehow don't believe this.
2569545	2570906	And why is that that you don't believe this?
2570926	2573728	Well, there's just a few things that strike me as weird.
2574148	2579271	Nintendo, for some reason, likes releasing their stuff, especially hardware, on Sundays.
2579592	2581253	And the 4th is actually a Saturday.
2582234	2582554	For one.
2583314	2584155	Actually, that's my only thing.
2584595	2585876	It's a Saturday, not Sunday.
2586737	2588378	Therefore, I am calling the whole thing bunk.
2588438	2589058	Now, I don't know.
2589239	2590099	It doesn't really matter.
2590239	2593582	And I think, if anything, they would want to hold off on...
2594848	2616865	Selling the DSi because they've been selling tons of DSs already and you know I think if they bring the DSi out it's just going to cut into their DS sales and they're not really having trouble selling DS systems and I don't know there's not really any DSi software out even in Japan right now I mean other than the download stuff but
2618462	2618862	I guess.
2618882	2619782	I don't know.
2619862	2626144	Of course, they could always just cut the price of the DS that's out there right now by like $20 and release the DSi.
2626184	2626384	For $99.99.
2626444	2630385	Yeah, then people will start making love to DSs like crazy or something.
2630425	2630985	Exactly.
2631105	2636766	And then they'll sell both because you'll have the more high-priced ones for folks that want the camera and all that stuff.
2637386	2638026	They could do it.
2638246	2642147	But yeah, what Loki says about the date is especially interesting because Nintendo does usually do Sunday.
2642447	2644468	I wonder if it doesn't mean maybe shipping on April 4th to...
2645188	2645809	Thank you for watching!
2664722	2669003	I don't know, it just doesn't really seem like there would be any reason to release this now.
2669184	2672585	I mean, there's just a few download games and that's it.
2672685	2675806	It's just not really that worthwhile.
2675846	2680267	I don't know if the DS was kind of tanking a little bit.
2680287	2687690	Not really tanking, but like if sales are starting to drop off a little bit in Japan and maybe that's why they released the DSi, but I don't think they're dropping off at all.
2687750	2687970	I mean...
2689298	2692699	We're still selling tons of DS systems, not having a problem whatsoever.
2693220	2694740	Some comments from chatroom on this story.
2694840	2701643	Sai says, I think their strategy is that Nintendo fans will buy the 179 DSi and most people will buy the DS Lite at regular.
2701843	2703423	Kind of similar to what I was saying.
2703583	2705804	Oh yeah, so the DSi is for hardcore gamers.
2705864	2706905	Yeah, uh-huh, sure.
2707745	2709947	or people who want the extra garbage that it's going to have.
2710827	2712669	X-Link says, and you can take it to the bathroom.
2713149	2716271	You can indeed play your DS in the bathroom, and I'm sure there's people that do that.
2716351	2718933	It has a really crappy web browser.
2718973	2720414	No pun intended.
2720715	2723156	It has a horrible web browser built into it as well.
2724477	2730642	Bobby says, Activision Blizzard doesn't want the DSi released because their best-selling DS game won't be compatible.
2731052	2733653	Guitar Hero on tour.
2733813	2737994	Well, Activision and Blizzard don't have a say in it, so poop on them.
2738334	2738714	I don't know.
2738814	2741555	It's just... This show is really poop-filled.
2741595	2748457	They'll just come out with another peripheral to plug into the SD card slot and then they can make their crappy games.
2748477	2751058	They're going to have some stupid drum peripheral.
2751118	2751478	I don't know.
2751538	2754198	All their DS guitar games suck.
2754618	2755299	I'm sorry.
2755399	2755679	It's just...
2756559	2757260	Thanks for watching!
2773280	2774721	I have to concur with you on there.
2774921	2781607	Even though I used to play DDR with the remote control when I couldn't afford to go to the arcade.
2781647	2788033	What's one of the biggest iPhone games right now, in fact so big that Apple actually displays it on a big banner inside their store?
2788373	2789654	Silent Hill The Escape.
2789754	2790795	No, not Silent Hill The Escape.
2790855	2791936	Tap Tap Revenge.
2794370	2797232	Tap Tap Revenge is like a somewhat DDR clone.
2797432	2798473	Hit the buttons.
2798533	2800975	No, it's a clone of Amplitude.
2801635	2802116	No, it's not.
2802196	2802896	I've played the game.
2802956	2805478	It's like Guitar Hero, if anything else.
2805639	2807340	The notes scroll down and you tap.
2807700	2809922	That's what it's closest to, is Guitar Hero.
2810602	2812164	But still, though, you're not dancing, though.
2812264	2812824	That's the thing.
2813485	2814566	You are tapping.
2814706	2820610	If it's like a Beatmania game or something like that, then yeah, it's a little bit more acceptable, because...
2821567	2824850	DDR on a DS DDR on a DS
2843464	2848071	Alright, well, hey, speaking of some systems, there's still some love for the old systems too.
2848131	2852677	In fact, systems so old that Victoria actually owns them because she can afford them.
2852697	2856002	You are such a bitch!
2856162	2856883	Oh my god!
2857705	2858486	Shut up!
2859187	2859727	I love you!
2860799	2861239	Yes, I do.
2861979	2866221	PlayStation 2 reaches the 50 million sold mark in North America.
2867522	2875805	PlayStation 2 has actually hit that mark, 50 million, and I believe that is more than any other system, if I'm not mistaken.
2876765	2879447	So, that's a lot.
2879467	2882788	Because they keep breaking, and you have to keep rebuying them.
2884293	2889315	By the way, there is a note from John Kohler, the marketing head of Sony Computer Entertainment.
2891256	2893977	We don't intend on discarding the system anytime soon.
2894437	2897438	Yeah, they still sell like hundreds of thousands of units each month.
2897458	2898679	Yeah, because they can't play the games on my PS3.
2898699	2903560	They're going to release the PSI on April 4th for a price tag of $159.
2903700	2903920	Perhaps.
2906369	2906969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2929619	2934060	But, you know, people are saying the PS3 needs to come down in price and they might actually sell some more units.
2934240	2934560	Who knows?
2934881	2935481	It'll be too late.
2936341	2936981	Too little, too late.
2937121	2937922	Yeah, I think so.
2937942	2938862	It's just a little too late.
2938982	2944163	It's just, might as well give up this console generation, just, you know, work on the next one.
2944664	2947584	I don't know.
2947604	2955587	So, we talked a little bit before about the video download service that they have in Japan for the Wii, which is kind of
2956937	2957297	I don't know.
2957657	2961199	It's very family friendly, I guess.
2961479	2966041	They have cartoons and other Japanese programming stuff on there.
2966522	2971964	Well, something similar may be coming to the US this year, actually.
2972644	2972804	And...
2974345	2983852	Apparently, Fujisoft, the company behind it, was at CES and told GamerSight that they are planning on bringing the WiiWare video service to the U.S.
2984493	2993099	It says, we can't quite tell at the moment, but if the negotiations are a success, maybe within the year.
2995441	2999504	Which is cool, but we still need some better storage on the Wii.
3001195	3002418	Or an SD memory card What's that, Victoria?
3011514	3012255	I can't work the Wii.
3012275	3013015	I'm, like, retarded.
3013055	3021542	I've tried playing and it's just... You know what's funny is that the Wii is, like, made for, like, people to be able to understand very easily, but you can't figure it out.
3021782	3023363	Well, I can, but I'm just not good at it.
3024143	3025685	I like having a little control in my hand.
3026005	3031709	Well, I guess it's kind of good if you're one of those people who, like, you know, moves the controller to the left when you want your little person to go to the left.
3031729	3033450	You know, when you're playing Mario Brothers, old school.
3033931	3036393	You know, just jump right, right, right.
3036473	3037433	Yeah, no, I don't know.
3038214	3038694	Yeah, you do.
3038834	3039275	Yeah, exactly.
3039315	3039635	Exactly.
3040583	3043105	Yeah, but I fail epically at the Wii.
3043666	3044787	What games do you enjoy on Wii?
3045147	3049030	I like that Wario one where you have to go through the little movements.
3049130	3049911	I don't know what it's called.
3050131	3050631	WarioWare.
3050851	3051232	That one.
3051692	3055155	Yeah, that's like one of the only games I've ever played on the Wii.
3055655	3058077	Other than Guitar Hero because my cousins have it on.
3058898	3059198	All right.
3059538	3059999	Good times.
3060239	3062060	So you're a Wii-tard is what you're basically saying.
3062080	3062701	Yes, I'm a Wii-tard.
3062741	3063642	Yeah, exactly.
3063662	3064082	There you go.
3064702	3065003	All right.
3066249	3072552	Well, hey, if you want to get a wee cheap, you might want to run over to Circuit City because Circuit City has gone under.
3072592	3075133	And you know, so many of these companies are going under recently.
3075173	3075853	It's kind of sad.
3076193	3079874	I almost feel like we need a theme song on the show for when companies go under.
3080435	3083296	So let me try reading the story to this music.
3094938	3102081	Circuit City has announced that they are going to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
3103001	3106863	Actually, no, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy already and closed 155 stores.
3107143	3107903	That wasn't enough.
3108183	3112665	Now they are unable to find a buyer to keep themselves afloat.
3113305	3114465	They are being liquidated.
3115006	3117987	So basically, sadly, and I...
3119338	3123842	I apologize to any listeners we have who work for Circuit City because this news has got to suck.
3124944	3129108	And we really hope somebody else will come in and buy up some of these old stores.
3130329	3132030	But they are going under.
3132411	3138397	And from what I'm hearing from people who do work for them that I know on LiveJournal and stuff, apparently the company was horribly managed.
3139017	3140499	And it's finally come back to get them.
3140659	3143081	They kind of had an old business model, too.
3143221	3143822	I mean, like...
3144302	3146784	with places like Fry's and Best Buy and stuff.
3146804	3148605	Circuit City was just kind of the little guy.
3149386	3151007	And they just can't keep up.
3151147	3153629	And they kept building them next to Best Buy's.
3153889	3156531	Yeah, or Best Buy's kept building them next to Circuit City's.
3156631	3159474	So, like, you know, they kind of didn't have a chance.
3160554	3161435	And here's the interesting thing.
3161455	3165838	Of course, the way liquidation sales usually work is that they will be... By the way, this doesn't affect Canada.
3165938	3169961	Circuit City Canada is still going because it's not the U.S., so you don't have a U.S.
3169981	3170601	bankruptcy thing.
3170641	3172162	So Circuit City Canada is still fine.
3172522	3175684	But Circuit City U.S., they're going under.
3175885	3179807	And when a store liquidates, usually they're going to have sales for the first week 10% off.
3180087	3181568	Then in the second week, 20% off.
3181608	3182569	Third week, 30% off.
3182809	3188113	Well, here's the thing is that people are already snatching up the TVs, the Xboxes, and all this stuff because they're like, OMG, 10% off.
3190254	3194137	Church of City was marking half this shit up to begin with, which is probably part of the reason they're going under.
3194638	3196920	So you're really sadly not going to say much.
3196940	3201243	Actually, they're doing some stuff 10, some stuff 20, and some stuff 30 all in the same week.
3201503	3202164	Oh, interesting.
3202224	3203505	I haven't been to the one here yet.
3203525	3204666	Did you check it out already?
3204706	3205146	Nathan went.
3205166	3207809	That's where he was going to look for his RAM or whatever.
3207829	3208869	Oh, okay.
3208910	3209330	Interesting.
3209770	3210391	Good luck with that.
3211551	3213012	All the good stuff is going to be gone already.
3213132	3214833	I'm sure it went this weekend.
3215453	3220315	All that's going to be left is DVD and CDs of bands you've never heard of.
3220455	3225357	We went over to Circuit City the other day to look at their... This is before I got my new car stereo.
3226687	3229009	They actually had less stereos than Walmart did.
3229389	3232612	I mean, and Walmart has a pretty pathetic car stereo section.
3233173	3235775	I mean, I think Circuit City had like eight.
3236195	3238617	I didn't know that Walmart had a car section or car stereo.
3238637	3241560	Yeah, they're very, they're, they suck.
3241920	3247785	You know, I was like looking for a price for one of them and the woman's like, it'd be on that shelf over here.
3248306	3249547	Just like, what the fuck?
3249787	3250667	DarkSakura.com
3276278	3280101	I mean, honestly, I hate to be rude, but it was actually kind of a selling point to me.
3280121	3286967	Remember that one time back when they were selling Wheeze and stuff and we drove by the Circuit City and there was like no one there?
3287548	3288909	Yeah, it was the night the Wheeze came out.
3289189	3291631	And Best Buy had a line going around the block.
3291651	3293272	Remember we went out when the Wheeze came out?
3293312	3295254	We were giving out, what was it, orange soda?
3295494	3297276	We were trying to sell our show to locals.
3297956	3299978	And so we did that, went to Best Buy.
3300018	3302240	And then Circuit City had like five people.
3302950	3304810	Wow, that's great.
3304890	3305570	Poor guys.
3306411	3306931	I feel bad.
3306971	3313092	You know there's someone who listens to this show who works for Circuit City, who just left their job, who's a little pissed that we're riffing on him a little bit.
3313712	3314812	And it does suck.
3315072	3320373	You know, I have friends actually from school that worked at Circuit City, but they kind of knew it was coming.
3320813	3323714	You know, they've been looking for a little while for another job.
3323774	3325274	You know, like they had something lined up.
3325454	3326514	They knew this was going to happen.
3326594	3328635	So, I mean, it sucks, but they prepared.
3329055	3329615	You know, they've known.
3329972	3330913	Well, I hope that's the case.
3332034	3333656	Good luck to all those that were impacted.
3334437	3342224	Unless you were part of the reason Circuit City went under, like you're one of these upper managements that didn't know what you were doing, then, well, sucks, doesn't it?
3342725	3343005	All right.
3344386	3352655	Well, apparently there was a story about this dog that was as dead as Circuit City for at least a moment.
3353536	3353776	Wow.
3355598	3363500	Apparently a woman in Michigan nearly killed her dog when she accidentally struck it on the temple with a Wii Remote.
3363660	3376584	Yes, she was busy doing some Wii Sports bowling, didn't have the wrist strap on or something like that, and the Wii Remote went straight and hit the dog in the temple, killing him instantly.
3377544	3377644	Um...
3379214	3392503	But then, but luckily though, the dog, Ozzy, was not moving and stuff, so they called a neighbor who apparently had some veterinary training and she was able to revive the dog using mouth-to-mouth.
3393244	3400889	But the dog had to be taken to the real vet where, you know, apparently had some severe brain swelling due to cardiac arrest.
3401410	3404031	But the dog, you know, apparently is fine now.
3404352	3405472	Yay!
3405532	3407454	Wait, she had to kiss the dog on the mouth?
3407958	3410221	Not kiss.
3410361	3411923	No, it's not mouth to mouth.
3411963	3413786	It's actually nose.
3413966	3417771	You have to blow down the dog's nose.
3417831	3419593	I love dogs, but not that much.
3420955	3423298	Hey, if my cat was dying, I'd do that.
3424192	3425313	Fuck that, it's my cat.
3425553	3426174	Fuck that.
3426254	3426994	It's family.
3427014	3430377	I don't care if there's boogers on its nose.
3430417	3431658	No, I understand.
3431678	3435722	Oh, Irene's dying, but her breath kind of smells.
3437383	3439345	Hey, I wouldn't blame you, Matt.
3439405	3441367	I think I'm just going to let her die, you know?
3441547	3444329	Rob, I'm never going to give you mouth to nose.
3444409	3446752	I mean, you're dear to me, but that's nasty.
3447252	3448213	Just let me die, right?
3449517	3452358	Maybe your mouth, but your nose, hell no.
3452478	3455879	And then when I wake up, I'd be like, ew, why are you trying to kiss me, pervert?
3455919	3459221	And then I'd throw a Wii mode at your temple and hope you die.
3459261	3459781	That's wrong.
3459801	3460761	You shouldn't joke about that.
3460861	3461262	I know.
3461302	3462202	It's a cute puppy.
3462342	3462682	All right.
3463382	3472146	Well, I'm sure pretty soon there will be video of these Wii accidents as if there aren't enough already of people destroying their TVs and stuff showing up on YouTube.
3472806	3477668	And the ironic thing now is it'll be much easier to watch someone break their Wii on a Wii.
3478288	3479449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3507851	3508772	DogKillByWeRemote
3532583	3534485	Wait, but the dog actually lived.
3534605	3535245	The dog lived.
3535525	3537447	He was only dead for five minutes.
3537707	3539168	Which makes him a zombie!
3539769	3541670	Wait, he was dead for five minutes?
3541750	3542071	Yes.
3542671	3546274	I thought you could start getting brain damage after three or four minutes.
3546644	3554030	I don't know if it's a border collie, it's like a miniature collie I don't know, because border collies are a little bit bigger
3575711	3576032	I don't know.
3585353	3588454	So, there's some other interesting stuff.
3588834	3593216	A little bit more positive, I guess, for Nintendo.
3594016	3601879	There's a new patent that shows Nintendo is possibly working on a motion-sensing DS card.
3603820	3608621	Perhaps something that was similar to what they had for the Game Boy Advance, for different games.
3608701	3610202	I think one of the WarioWare games had it.
3610682	3613583	But it's a DS direction-sensing card.
3615046	3615266	Hmm.
3616907	3622271	No word on what it's going to be used for, but it's something that has built-in direction and motion tracking.
3622371	3624833	So I can get my iPhone's games ported to my DS?
3624873	3629896	Because that's what I see happening when this comes out, is that now we'll just get ports of iPhone games on the DS.
3630757	3632118	With that whole little tilty thing.
3632378	3634099	I can get Silent Hill The Escape on my DS.
3634339	3634980	Wouldn't that be fabulous?
3635000	3635120	Wow.
3635340	3636741	That's exactly what you wanted.
3637021	3637341	I know.
3638362	3638782	Okay.
3638802	3641624	Didn't they do... No, they didn't do a Silent Hill game on the DS.
3641644	3644046	They did a Resident Evil game on the DS, and that was not very good.
3645370	3650576	Was there like a play novel or something that was on the... That's it, but a motion sensing card.
3650596	3653999	I mean, those DS cards are not exactly that big, so that's pretty impressive.
3654159	3661788	I would think that they would just do... Well, the actual chips that do the motion sensing are really super tiny, so it could be done.
3661888	3663650	It's just... I don't know, in...
3665254	3675078	Really, I mean, you can have those things kind of hang out of the slot a little bit, you know, because remember with like the WarioWare one that they had, it was pretty big.
3675118	3684262	I mean, I guess technology was a little bit older then, but, you know, the card itself was huge compared to what normal Game Boy Advance, you know, cards look like.
3685182	3685882	Very interesting.
3686142	3687283	I like this comment in chat.
3687583	3688824	Sai says this in the chat room.
3689004	3689544	What the hell?
3689904	3691325	Why not have that in the DSi?
3691465	3694306	A new system is just out and already an add-on that should be built in.
3695106	3704044	Yeah, exactly, just like the Wii Motion Plus Something that should have been done in the first place Because Nintendo really cares about its customer base Damn it, we're not getting into that argument
3708379	3712481	Well, alright, I guess we'll see what comes of this or what possible game they could be making with this.
3712621	3713322	Who knows?
3713542	3715723	It's going to suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.
3715863	3719565	It's going to be like Wii Sports for the DS or something.
3719605	3720285	Can you imagine that?
3720345	3722867	Wii bowling, people throwing their DSes.
3723247	3724728	Oh no, I broke my DS light.
3724908	3727409	Guess I gotta go buy a new DSi.
3727849	3729971	I see conspiracy here.
3731431	3738054	Final Fantasy Legend 2 is being remade for the DS.
3738354	3740935	Wait, is that the Game Boy one?
3741235	3741435	Yes.
3741735	3745637	Okay, the one that's not really like Final Fantasy, the one that's more like part of the Saga series?
3745657	3746157	You got it.
3746237	3752039	It was actually Saga 2, Hiho Densetsu, and that was Final Fantasy Legend here.
3752219	3781120	I love when you pronounce Japanese shut up but yeah it's getting the full 3D little views and things kind of like Final Fantasy 4 and the Dragon Quest games have had so that's being released here awesome I actually think I still have Final Fantasy Legend 2 or 3 on my old Game Boy cartridge yeah and in this Japanese magazine they are definitely selling it as Saga too so awesome I liked the Saga series I'm like the only person in the world maybe they'll call it Saga when it comes out over here instead of Final Fantasy
3781981	3789783	Maybe, because it would be very weird to have Final Fantasy Legend 2 come out over here, you know, and it would be kind of like, well, whatever happened to the first two?
3789823	3791984	Because who remembers that far back of the Game Boy, you know?
3792164	3793344	Yeah, I guess that's true.
3793844	3796205	Let's just hope that they never do a Mystic Quest remake.
3797125	3798385	I somehow don't see that happening.
3799185	3800866	Mystic Quest wasn't terrible.
3801546	3802746	But it wasn't good.
3802766	3804967	Yeah, I'll just leave it at that.
3805007	3805787	It wasn't terrible.
3807127	3808327	Anyhow, that's it.
3809388	3810008	So, yes...
3811135	3816981	It figures that the homebrew community of course is doing something that Nintendo isn't doing on their own.
3817782	3830994	A new device has come out, Matrix Wii Z. It's being prototyped right now, but it basically is sort of a mod chip that plugs into your...
3831875	3833156	Thank you for watching!
3847225	3847866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3867319	3875784	and so I can put... So, well, they say that you can put ISOs on there and stuff like that and actually run pirated games from it, but you can... Oh, we wouldn't want to encourage people to do that.
3875824	3876405	No, no, no.
3876545	3885770	You can also... The system itself will look at it like it's part of the actual storage on the device, so you can use it for storing games.
3885890	3890093	But this, yeah, you can actually store ISOs and stuff, so...
3892509	3893610	Rob just tried to rape me.
3893870	3896032	Well, you were falling asleep, so I went over there to give you a lap dance.
3896232	3897373	And I was getting a cookie.
3898894	3899735	I'm frightened.
3900135	3902957	All I hear is blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah.
3902977	3906080	You shoved your dong in her face, okay?
3906160	3907421	I not shoved my dong in her face.
3907441	3909363	You were like, how many licks does it take?
3909383	3912345	And you were like, waving your dong in her face.
3912425	3914487	No, I waved a snickerdoodle in her face.
3914727	3916608	Yeah, that's what they call it, your snickerdoodle.
3916869	3919451	And that's why you thrusted your nutsack in my face.
3920427	3921367	I was like, oh my goodness.
3921387	3923688	You make it sound like I'm not wearing pants or something.
3923948	3924488	You're not.
3926989	3931811	But yeah, it's basically this device will allow super fast loading of ISOs in homebrew.
3932011	3933032	So, yeah.
3933332	3933692	Awesome.
3933712	3934032	Hooray.
3934052	3939654	I'm sorry, I was just hearing blah, blah, blah, Wii, blah, blah, blah, system that doesn't have any games out on it I care about, blah, blah, blah.
3941435	3941995	But Rob.
3942155	3942335	What?
3942927	3946148	They're doing, you know, the new play control.
3946548	3948628	Yes, that's a title that they stuck with.
3948868	3952809	You know, for instead of play on the Wii, you know, new play control.
3953569	3958070	Mario, was it Mario Power Tennis and then new play control Pikmin.
3958830	3960130	Aren't you excited about those?
3960150	3963391	I mean, those games are totally new and not ever been out on the GameCube.
3963511	3964271	Oh, wait, no, they have.
3965932	3966152	Sad.
3968012	3968872	Irene, care to comment?
3969192	3969472	Anything?
3970192	3971953	What Wii games are you looking forward to, Irene?
3971973	3972573	I'm dying to know.
3974067	3975548	You know, things and stuff.
3977889	3980171	That's probably actually a Wii game that's coming out.
3980211	3981311	Things and stuff.
3981331	3982632	Things and stuff.
3982772	3984693	When it's a collection of mini games.
3984913	3985613	That's what it is.
3986294	3987294	Things and stuff.
3988375	3989696	Sounds like a dream game to me.
3991096	3991717	You too?
3992057	3992837	Oh my gosh.
3993538	3993838	Shut up.
3994178	3995499	Is that coming out on the Wii in April?
3996485	3996865	On April 4th.
4020600	4024223	5 million consoles sold by Nintendo in December.
4024303	4026424	Although that's a little bit, it's actually not Wii's alone.
4026585	4031128	It was actually the DS sold 3 million and the Wii sold 2 million.
4031148	4034870	So you put it together, they sold 5 million systems that Nintendo moved.
4034890	4036632	That's a lot of dead collies.
4039093	4039514	Matt!
4040984	4046166	That's going to wipe out the Kali species off this planet.
4046206	4047167	You are terrible.
4047327	4050128	Lassie will be just a memory.
4050949	4052169	Well, she is, but she's dead.
4052590	4054891	Look, that's okay.
4055671	4058272	And Timmy will be stuck in the well forever.
4058292	4060873	Where's Jamie here to yell at you?
4062234	4065035	But look, the reason why this is newsworthy is December.
4065316	4066476	Hello, Christmas.
4066656	4069778	So these are the numbers that were going into the Christmas and what ended up under people's trees.
4071076	4099694	3 million DS's 2 million Wii's 1.5 million Xbox 360's 1 million PSP's 3 quarters of a million PS3's big surprise and not even half a million PS2's but still going in there it's kind of an old system so that's actually pretty good DarkTetsuya says OLR is going to get an angry email from PETA I hope we do because Jamie would have to read it
4101633	4105355	and Jamie is very opinionated when it comes to PETA.
4105495	4108377	I welcome them to write the email.
4108477	4109398	Please, by all means.
4110038	4110838	Come on the show.
4111899	4118022	In fact, I totally encourage people going out and murdering animals with Wii remotes and controllers.
4118763	4120304	And why stop at the Wii?
4120364	4123145	I mean, hell, look at the original Xbox controller.
4123165	4126367	That thing is like a blunt object of death.
4128990	4131372	Try dropping an original Xbox on a dog.
4131913	4133255	Oh, they'd never survive.
4133295	4135137	You can take out like three dogs with that thing.
4135257	4137720	Am I really here right now?
4139221	4141484	If we get sued, I don't want any part of this.
4141764	4143346	I'm distancing myself.
4143366	4146230	Did you ever see that Mythbusters where they were...
4146550	4147911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4172585	4175667	I like to chop a frozen turkey on Miley Cyrus I don't know about anybody else out there
4198599	4199840	Thank you for watching!
4226281	4226841	Oh, perfect.
4227182	4230403	Anyways, so this week we've got a few things coming out.
4230463	4231204	I mean, it's January.
4231244	4232244	It's pretty slow still.
4232584	4233385	There's some good stuff.
4234245	4236226	Star Ocean 2nd Evolution for the PSP.
4236646	4238127	That's going to be a pretty good game.
4238167	4241268	Some of these Square Enix PSP games are doing very well.
4242569	4245512	Jumble Madness for the DS Big Bang Mini for the DS
4263522	4264743	Something that needs to die in a fire.
4264763	4266045	Imagine Fashion Party.
4267466	4268147	Yeah, no thanks.
4269468	4270048	Let's see here.
4270068	4273672	These are the games I'm going to get for Victoria because she'd love this type of game.
4273732	4274593	Imagine Fashion Party.
4274773	4275213	Okay, look.
4275273	4276034	No, no, no, no.
4276114	4276895	This bitch right here.
4279017	4284342	We were walking through Walmart and we got to the section with the top model clothes and she was like, oh, top model.
4285163	4287365	I got a top model tank top for Christmas, so bite me.
4288854	4293177	Can you imagine the possibilities with that game?
4294678	4295018	Shut up.
4296539	4297900	Let's see here.
4298100	4303804	I was going to say also the Ultimate Shooting Collection on the Wii.
4304064	4306926	It's three Japanese arcade shooter games.
4306946	4308047	They're actually pretty good.
4308387	4309328	I'm trying to remember what was in it.
4309408	4316733	It was Coriolis, Radio Allergy, and I don't remember the last one that was in there, but...
4318132	4320255	Really, like, bullet hell shooter games.
4321176	4321276	Oh.
4322357	4322618	Okay.
4323278	4323759	That's cool.
4324940	4327163	Wonder World Amusement Park for the DS.
4327343	4328745	A bunch of mini-games on there.
4329946	4334392	R-Tonalico 2, The Melody of Melifacisha, I guess?
4334552	4334852	I don't know.
4336618	4337619	Was that a Disney villain?
4338799	4339279	No, I'm sorry.
4339339	4340300	I totally butchered that.
4340440	4343842	The melody of Metafalacia, I guess.
4343902	4344222	I don't know.
4345803	4347304	Falatio?
4347384	4348965	I'm totally good too, okay?
4349025	4350626	With some extra crap.
4350766	4352446	It's on the PS2.
4353447	4353887	Wow.
4354348	4356489	The subtitle to that, none of which I just said.
4356669	4357269	So there you go.
4359010	4359270	Anyways.
4360151	4363072	Skate 2 is coming out on PS3 and 360 this week as well.
4364433	4364513	Um...
4365813	4367074	and let's see here.
4368895	4379761	To tie in perfectly what we were talking about just before I started talking about release dates, Sim Animals, another sim game where you get to control the wonders of nature.
4380041	4386525	In fact, they actually have this hand, which is the pointer, and you can poke badgers and stuff and they will attack your hand.
4386625	4387305	It's awesome.
4387625	4391407	Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, mushroom, mushroom.
4391427	4392708	Is it football or mushroom?
4393589	4394009	Mushroom.
4396171	4396532	I don't know.
4396872	4397933	I think it's Mushroom.
4398373	4399615	Yeah, it's okay.
4399935	4403158	But that'll be out on the Wii and the DS, so awesome.
4403198	4407101	Can you simulate, you know, dropping stuff on your animals?
4407261	4408342	You can throw animals.
4408723	4413067	I saw them shaking a squirrel violently, so I'm sure you can throw rocks at them.
4414729	4416550	or maybe feed them to other things.
4416590	4418071	Are you done with US release dates?
4418091	4423633	We need to take the bear in that game and just feed it all sorts of animals and it'll become rabid and just eat things.
4424733	4425614	Very rare bear.
4425734	4427515	I'm trying my hardest, okay?
4428975	4430076	It just never works.
4431587	4434088	Moving on to the UK and the release dates over there.
4434108	4435868	Do it in a British accent, British accent.
4435928	4437849	Oh, you want me to do it in British accent?
4437869	4439049	Do, yes, please.
4439109	4442290	But I really annoy everybody overseas when I talk like this.
4442330	4443990	It's a really bad British accent, I'll give you that.
4444210	4445050	It's a really bad one.
4445290	4447211	Do you want to read these in a British accent, Victoria?
4447231	4448471	No, I don't want to read them in British accent.
4448551	4449151	Why not?
4449191	4449492	Because.
4449552	4450232	I think you should.
4450292	4450532	Why?
4450712	4452852	Well, do you want me to get you some tea and some crumpets to put you in the mood?
4452872	4453713	I don't like tea and crumpets.
4454113	4454453	Okay.
4454533	4455173	Okay, knock it off.
4457044	4460505	If you're going to talk in an accent, talk like you're from New York, alright?
4460745	4462605	Don't be such a wanker.
4462625	4463285	You're a wanker.
4465406	4468606	On the 20th... I'm going to get so much hate mail this week.
4470767	4472447	On the 23rd... British.
4474187	4474987	No.
4476188	4482249	On the 23rd... Football Manager Live is coming to the PC.
4484694	4490055	and Neopets Puzzle Adventures coming out as well on the DS and the PSC and the Wii.
4491015	4494376	I don't know who's playing Neopets, but somebody is for sure.
4495796	4502058	And Skate 2 comes out for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
4504758	4508159	I'm not doing a Japanese accent for the Japanese releases.
4510996	4511457	Stop it.
4511617	4516240	Left 4 Dead comes out, the Japanese version, on January 22nd on the Xbox 360.
4516280	4517961	Oh, that's very good.
4518542	4519543	The PlayStation 3.
4520323	4522585	See, she can do that because she's actually Asian.
4522825	4524647	I do it and I'm a racist.
4525807	4526408	Well, you are.
4527809	4538357	PlayStation 3, Prince of Persia, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw, and Juice 2 all getting releases in Japan.
4539017	4539138	Boo.
4541392	4553901	And on the Nintendo Wii, Rayman, Raving Rabbids, TV Party, like anyone cares, Fragile, Sayonara, Tsuki no Haikyuu, Suzumiya, Harui no Gekidu comes out as well.
4554021	4554302	What?
4554802	4555402	You want to read them?
4555542	4555723	No.
4555823	4556603	You think you can do better?
4556823	4557204	Probably.
4559165	4560726	I think anybody could do better.
4561066	4561887	I'm sorry.
4561907	4568112	PlayStation 2, some price reductions for Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.
4570788	4575932	On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer comes out as well as Rayman.
4576172	4576413	What?
4576593	4583438	When you said that, you said destroy all humans and Jews too, but I thought you said Jews too.
4585099	4588222	It sounded like destroy all humans and Jews too.
4589163	4591364	I'm like, but they're humans too.
4591725	4596248	You know, I don't even think that would be acceptable in Japan, let alone here.
4597249	4599031	I know they get away with some pretty crazy stuff.
4600131	4601993	It's mine and Irene's fault It's awful
4616420	4627168	On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer, Rayman Raving Rabbids, TV Party, Teguato DS Series 1, Tetsudo Datafile.
4628049	4629230	Oh, what the hell that is.
4630231	4632833	But a game called Zubo is coming out in Japan.
4632853	4633854	I bet that's pretty awesome.
4634654	4635235	So there you go.
4636996	4637396	Zubo?
4638777	4642921	I think that's a music game that's from EA.
4643801	4644522	They look like crap.
4646821	4652625	And on the Sony PSP, we have Patapon 2 comes out.
4652965	4655927	At least the Chinese version comes out in other Asian territories.
4656547	4658308	Ratchet & Clank gets a price reduction.
4658368	4659269	Looks like the only new game.
4660169	4665632	Hokuto no Ken Rao Gaiden Ten no Hawa comes out.
4666293	4667253	That's what it's called.
4667814	4668794	Totally.
4668914	4669235	Sort of.
4669435	4671916	It's a fighting game coming out on the PSP.
4673917	4674198	Okay.
4674218	4674618	There you go.
4675526	4677287	Guitar Hero World Tour Travis Barker Track Pack
4699083	4722799	and featured in there will be What's My Age Again by Blink-182 Low, the Travis Barker remix by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain and it looks like Lycanthrope by Plus44 and that'll be available for 160 Microsoft points per track and
4725668	4728714	or $440 for the entire bundle.
4729636	4731581	And no word on what the real money is.
4731881	4732483	I think $160 is $2 per.
4736496	4742339	Rock Band, Steve Miller, Space Cowboy, Take the Money and Run, and The Joker.
4742359	4747082	All of those will be available for 160 Microsoft Points each or $2.
4747282	4748883	The pack will run you 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49.
4763550	4777541	And then the individual songs, you'll be getting I Stand Alone by Godsmack, Feed the Tree by Belly, Wind Me Up by Ghost Hounds, Typical by Mute Math, and Warzone by Rob Zombie.
4777561	4780102	And if I remember correctly, I think Warzone says new single.
4781123	4783125	And all those will be available for... Where's Dragula?
4783165	4784346	That song's awesome.
4784486	4786147	And I want to play that on Rock Band.
4786227	4788629	It's back in the 90s, Rob.
4788949	4789590	Shut up, I hate you.
4789610	4790050	That's where it is.
4792161	4817368	Warzone wasn't that good from what I remember I actually bought that so it was okay not worth the single though it's a shame finally Lips the karaoke game has some stuff coming out for the rest of this month available actually came out earlier this week when I Grow Up by the Pussycat Dolls
4818564	4842658	you've lost that love and feeling by the Righteous Brothers and Erased Rewind by the Carnigans those all came out on the 16th I love that song next week we've got let's see on the 23rd here Hate That I Love You by Rihanna featuring Neo and Thanks For The Memories by Fall Out Boy
4844775	4846637	Yes, they're so hip that they don't use vowels in there.
4846657	4849159	We need to have Victoria just sing these songs as Loki reads them.
4849479	4850159	Yes, awesome.
4850179	4851821	I'm doing it anyway.
4851961	4855283	And then finally, Look What You've Done by Jet.
4857485	4858686	I don't know that one.
4858726	4860027	Look What You've Done.
4860047	4860968	No, I don't think that's it.
4860988	4864831	All right, and then finally on January 30th, Sunday Morning by Maroon 5.
4865191	4868013	I don't know that song.
4868093	4872177	Take a Bow by Rihanna and Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men.
4873294	4877917	Wow, what is up with these random old songs like Belly Feed the Tree?
4878457	4881519	Like, oh man, I was so glad that made a comeback.
4881719	4886161	And then like Boyz II Men, one of their songs that was not even all that popular.
4886222	4887322	Like, wow.
4887622	4888023	Okay.
4889083	4889403	I guess.
4889423	4891044	Some comments from chat I gotta read.
4891585	4897188	Redertainment says, why pay for tracks from Lips when I can steal them from BitTorrent sites, plug in my iPod, and play them for free?
4897208	4901370	Because it's not quite the same, and I think these actually come with the videos and stuff.
4902311	4902431	And...
4904267	4908129	Leo Shen says, where the fuck is my Love Fool and my favorite game?
4908469	4913573	Love Fool is in SingStar, for whatever it's worth, and it has the original video, not the one they did in the US.
4913733	4914713	It's like the old school one.
4914733	4915754	I like it, Race and Rewind.
4915774	4916154	That's a good song.
4916174	4916395	I do too.
4916795	4919937	I like my favorite game too, but I don't know what a good karaoke song that would be.
4920117	4925140	That's more of a, that other series, the racing series had that in one of their ads.
4925260	4926181	Gran Turismo?
4926221	4926741	Gran Turismo.
4927061	4927202	Yeah.
4927382	4927582	Two.
4928262	4929583	My favorite game was like in the commercial.
4929683	4931684	Yeah, it was a song in the game, wasn't it?
4931945	4932145	Mm-hmm.
4932345	4932505	Yeah.
4933760	4939921	My favorite game was also, I think, one of the Euro DDR games.
4939961	4942482	I don't know, I could be completely wrong on that, but that's a guess.
4942702	4947062	Speaking of awesome music games, this news has me very, very happy.
4947322	4956284	The Harmonix CEO, Alex Rigopoulos, was interviewed with Ars Technica recently, and he has basically professed his love for Amplitude.
4956704	4957524	You might remember that game.
4957584	4961805	Harmonix, these are the games they did before Guitar Hero, Amplitude and Frequency.
4962265	4966287	Well, he was basically confirming that he does want to eventually revive the series.
4966767	4967327	Yay!
4967407	4967907	Excited!
4968008	4968488	That'd be awesome.
4968528	4971909	Except the only problem is, Sony actually owns that property.
4972089	4973950	Harmonix developed it, I guess, for Sony.
4974370	4976151	So, you ain't gonna see this on Xbox.
4976211	4979713	It would probably be like a PlayStation Network type game.
4980033	4981673	But hell, I don't mind.
4981793	4984895	I would love to see this game make a comeback because, you know, there's certain songs...
4985635	4987078	That you can only get in these types of games.
4987118	4989222	You're not going to get in a rock band type game.
4989263	4990946	So I am definitely for this.
4990986	4992249	I hope they do it.
4992537	4999001	They really need to revive some of those older rhythm games from the 90s and early 2000s.
4999301	5002723	Like Guitar Freaks, and then they'll make a game called Rock-O.
5003563	5006745	GS68 says, didn't Harmonix also do Karaoke Revolution with Konami?
5006845	5007125	They did.
5007645	5007905	They did.
5007965	5009426	They developed the first couple versions.
5010107	5015690	And then by the time I think they got to Karaoke Country, I think finally Harmonix split off and Konami did it themselves.
5015710	5016970	Okay, we're not doing Country.
5017070	5017511	Fuck that.
5018671	5019612	Something like that, yeah.
5019652	5020132	Just kidding.
5020172	5021433	That's exactly how it went down.
5022426	5026710	Alright, so we're going to get into the classic video game of the week.
5027070	5032736	It's a little part of the show where we like to pay homage to a game from yesteryear, a game from the past.
5033176	5036980	And DarkSakura is not here tonight to do this, so this is the part where Loki and I will fill in.
5037000	5039722	So Loki, I guess we're going to do your game tonight, because I did it last time.
5040203	5045127	So Loki is going to pick a game for us this week, a classic video game that he thinks...
5046028	5048849	Everybody out there on the internet who listens to our show should be playing.
5049129	5051230	Loki, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
5051330	5052830	You know, I didn't know.
5053090	5055991	But actually, I just came up with one last minute.
5056231	5057511	Hooray for me!
5058932	5062513	No, actually, I want to pay homage to... It's not even that old.
5062533	5066674	I mean, I hate thinking that a PlayStation 1 game is considered retro now.
5067234	5073196	But I think one of the greatest in this game series, except for maybe...
5073976	5075857	Twisted Metal Black, but Twisted Metal 2.
5077357	5081098	Twisted Metal 2, as it was known in Europe, as Twisted Metal 2 World Tour.
5082078	5090440	The second game in the Vehicle Combat series, Twisted Metal, still one of my favorite games, and they've remade it a few different times.
5091121	5096002	On the PSP, they had Twisted Metal 2 head-on, or Twisted Metal head-on, I guess it was called.
5096542	5100083	But, you know, basically this game, very over-the-top, just, you know,
5100703	5101243	Thank you for watching!
5126992	5129413	Paris, you can actually destroy the Eiffel Tower.
5130834	5137116	LA, they had some ruins left over, I guess, from the previous Twisted Mel game.
5138137	5145720	In, let's see here, New York, they had the rooftops, which I think was my favorite map of the entire game there.
5147221	5149143	Antarctica, Glaciers, Icebergs, Hong Kong Crunch
5162099	5166723	Of course, there was some different characters that were added in the game.
5167083	5172188	They had Sweet Tooth, Dark Tooth, and Minion, which could be unlocked with different codes in the game.
5174450	5182877	I guess Dark Tooth was only playable on the PC version, or if you had a cheat device for the PlayStation 1, you could play Dark Tooth that way, which is kind of cool.
5183818	5188203	and he was a giant ice cream truck.
5189204	5193129	Yes, with a clown on top, because he was Sweet Tooth's father, if I remember correctly.
5194150	5195411	Victoria actually played this game.
5195852	5197874	I heard her speak up, going, I remember this game!
5198755	5205601	Yes, because Darktooth was Charlie Kane, and then of course Sweettooth was Needles Kane, and he had the ice cream truck.
5206021	5216029	Some of the other characters, Axel, which was a guy that was trapped in a vehicle, I guess, by his father with two giant tires, and so he was playing that.
5216409	5225997	And then Grasshopper, which was a dune buggy, which apparently was Calypso's daughter, and Calypso, of course, was the guy that was running the entire tournament.
5226937	5227057	Um...
5228018	5233649	Mr. Grim, which is on a red motorcycle, and he consumes souls.
5233889	5234330	He's kind of...
5236223	5237144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5258081	5265986	And of course, I think that for Twisted Metal 2, they had some levels that they cut out that they brought back for Twisted Metal head-on.
5266727	5270429	The PS2 version, they brought some that they had cancelled, actually.
5270449	5275712	I think they were making, I don't know, more levels for Twisted Metal Black that were added into that game.
5276113	5281356	And it was kind of a remake of Twisted Metal 2 and the Twisted Metal Black engine, which is pretty cool.
5282711	5286072	But, unfortunately, we still haven't seen another Twisted Metal game since Black.
5287113	5288733	And I don't really count the PSP ones.
5290694	5299158	But hey, you know, they were talking about remaking, and these are making a new one for PS3, and I think they should do it, because it was probably one of the best series that was on the PlayStation.
5300578	5302079	That's my classic game there.
5302319	5303039	Alright, there you have it.
5303059	5306041	Twisted Metal 2, your classic game of the week.
5306081	5306641	That's a good pick.
5307341	5308182	That's old enough.
5308202	5310763	That was pretty good for a last minute one, yeah.
5310783	5311243	Yeah, it was good.
5311503	5314885	DarkSakura's done Dreamcast games, and that was later in PS1.
5314985	5320028	Yeah, you can tell that I totally remember all the backstory on this, because I totally butchered everything.
5320108	5320508	That's alright.
5320528	5321188	That's alright.
5321208	5321868	It was the last minute.
5322089	5322469	You did good.
5323149	5323470	You did good.
5323910	5324171	All right.
5325052	5328898	So that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but that doesn't mean the show's over.
5329318	5330780	We're just going to take a break, and we'll be back.
5330800	5332263	There's plenty more where this came from.
5332723	5335387	Your calls as well we'll get to a little later on in the show.
5335467	5337430	We have some more news in the next segment.
5337450	5338312	We're going to be talking about...
5338852	5343174	Some updates with the Pandora battery, the controversial device for the PSP.
5343775	5345596	Also talk about some other PSP news.
5345616	5346216	We have quite a bit.
5346596	5350678	As well as a very controversial Nintendo patent that was discovered this week.
5350718	5353520	It was something I kind of referred to earlier to try and...
5353720	5356821	and help those people that are really bad at video games.
5357061	5359401	But is it a good thing or is it going to be a bad thing?
5359801	5360221	Who knows?
5360962	5368243	Anyhow, with all the talk about Silent Hill this week, for the live listeners, I'm going to play some music from Silent Hill Games because who doesn't love the Silent Hill music?
5368843	5373704	But for those of you listening to the podcast, you don't get that because we're not allowed to play copyright music.
5374005	5376465	But we'll be right back in just a few seconds for you guys on the podcast.
5376725	5380326	For those of you listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5386673	5391976	And we're back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast, taping live here on January the 18th of 2009.
5392036	5396459	To those of you guys who are just tuning in live on allgames.com, thank you guys for tuning in.
5396499	5397560	Tonight's kind of a weird night.
5397920	5398940	DarkSakura is not here.
5399000	5400481	She's on vacation just before school starts.
5400962	5402503	So we brought in two girls to replace her.
5403243	5403923	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5429301	5430361	So that's cute.
5430962	5431422	So anyway.
5432222	5432462	All right.
5432502	5433542	But no more flirting.
5433602	5434182	Back to business.
5434543	5436823	We're back to work here on Orange Launch Radio.
5436843	5438744	We've got more gaming news to talk about.
5439364	5441285	And yes, we do.
5441365	5443065	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
5443125	5443325	Oh, no.
5443845	5444546	Are you starting us off?
5444626	5445126	Yes, I am.
5445366	5445786	All righty then.
5446626	5455813	Guitar Hero Metallica has been announced by Metallica that it is coming out in the U.S., or North America, I guess, March 29th.
5456594	5459676	May, pretty much everywhere else.
5461357	5472665	It's interesting, though, is the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions are coming out on the 29th, but the PS2 and the Wii version, though, are coming sometime this spring, most likely early May.
5474201	5476383	And this is according to the band's website.
5478004	5489614	And of course, it's going to have Expert Plus, 28 songs from the group's discography, as well as other tracks from Alice in Chains, The Food Fires, Slayer, Machine Head, Queen.
5490514	5519495	and stuff like that what's interesting though this is a little bit late news here but they're going to have a special pre-order bonus actually being done through GameStop which is surprising they're going to be giving away with Guitar Hero Metallica another drum pedal because apparently you're going to need to have two pedals for the kick drum to be able to play some of those songs or you're probably going to want to have two kick pedals
5520964	5521344	First of many.
5521364	5525789	How long before the series jumps the shark?
5525809	5525949	Oh wait.
5525970	5526050	Done!
5539878	5546084	Hey, Sony is going to be delivering, of course, more PSP and PlayStation 1 old titles on PlayStation Network.
5546124	5546644	And guess what?
5546684	5551388	There is a PSP game that just came out, I believe, this week on the PlayStation 3.
5551829	5553590	It's Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
5554251	5556653	I believe Jamie spoke very highly of this game when she was here.
5556733	5561297	It's kind of a put-together compilation of some of the old Ghosts and Goblins titles.
5561778	5563219	It's now available for download for $20.
5564400	5564780	There you have it.
5564800	5573929	You can't play it on the PlayStation 3 because it was a PSP game, but you can use your little transfer device and put it on your PSP if you have a large storage stick for your PSP.
5574409	5574829	There you have it.
5575070	5576291	If you have a large stick.
5576831	5577312	Shut up.
5578112	5578613	Shut up.
5581496	5582998	Thanks for watching!
5602217	5612242	Light Blue Tool, which is their service mode battery that they've made, is just basically a fancy name for the Pandora battery.
5612682	5617185	They basically stole the idea for it and decided they were going to put it out.
5617565	5624668	However, due to legal action by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, they are not able to put out said battery.
5625309	5625449	And...
5627386	5628706	Yeah, they will not be releasing it.
5628906	5639649	But that's okay, because if you remember that there is an exploit now that's being used that will eventually allow the PSP-3000 to be hacked using GripShift.
5640210	5642990	So that is coming along nicely.
5643070	5645191	They already have some homebrew games available for it.
5645851	5649372	And soon enough, a homebrew and firmware loader.
5651573	5651913	Cool.
5652613	5652853	Yeah.
5654073	5656034	What do you think will happen as a result of the lawsuit?
5656837	5657277	Thanks for watching!
5677718	5690201	It's not too difficult if you just follow the instructions, but the fact that they were kind of making this and claiming it as their own is kind of a rip-off because they did not come up with this idea.
5691854	5692154	Dothack Games
5707929	5710150	But, you know, I think they had two different series.
5710170	5713591	They had the .hack series and there was .hack.gu, which was the later series.
5714031	5719392	Now .hack.link was announced by Famitsu Magazine as coming to the PSP in 2009.
5719432	5721913	So now it's going from PlayStation 2 to PSP.
5723234	5729755	The interesting thing, though, they're saying is that, you know, part of what made .hack kind of interesting is that it was sort of like an MMO, but it wasn't.
5729936	5733697	It was a single-player experience that was like an MMO, if that makes any sense.
5733737	5734777	Like, you know, all the characters...
5735097	5735998	DotHack is making a comeback.
5754975	5755395	on the PSP
5783463	5785924	and some of the stuff that they were suggesting here.
5787445	5787945	Let's see.
5788025	5805173	Possible features include smaller yet retain most of the current PSP screen size, offered social networking functionality in the cross-media bar, included a keyboard for easier internet browsing and communication,
5806353	5831549	Offered Bluetooth wireless support for easy pairing with other devices, had a touchscreen, had an improved screen for more dynamic graphic displays, offered the ability to find others near you who want to connect for online gaming, offered an e-comic book or book download service through the PlayStation Network, and included a hard drive for memory storage.
5833900	5835162	and some other things.
5835202	5838006	They were also talking about a built-in GPS.
5839127	5841871	Yeah, interesting.
5843513	5845776	I have a feeling that they're going to do a touchscreen at the next one.
5845936	5848359	They kind of have to at this point, if you think about it.
5850122	5850262	Hmm.
5850896	5851736	and Motion Censoring.
5871340	5876087	I don't know though if they would just put a touch screen on a new PSP or something like that.
5876107	5881894	A lot of these, I mean, other than like social networking, that wouldn't be too bad, or like a book download service.
5882535	5886380	I mean, you can do e-books right now through Homebrew stuff, so that could be done now.
5888823	5893584	and even the ability to find others near you that want to connect for an online game.
5894304	5908227	I don't really see that as kind of a necessity because that would require a lot of hotspots and stuff like that and it wouldn't really make sense that you would need to know if there's someone nearby to connect with because you're connecting with anybody over the internet.
5908327	5910027	So it doesn't really matter.
5911927	5914148	Maybe Bluetooth support for like...
5916121	5919004	Using, like, say, your 6-axis controller might be kind of cool.
5921627	5922908	Let's read some comments from the chat room.
5922928	5925831	Chat.orange.trader.com We've had a lot of PSP different stories.
5925911	5929474	I want to kind of read through some of these because lots of diverse comments from our chat.
5930115	5935040	Redertainment says, Why is Datel getting sued for selling something that you can hack the PSP with?
5935400	5938804	People who sell rocks don't get sued for possibly causing car break-ins.
5939807	5942468	But this is the case with a lot of these companies that get sued, right?
5942488	5950150	I think it has to do with infringing on some sort of stuff, probably information that was written on the ROM of the battery.
5950170	5955352	Because the actual batteries that Sony uses actually have data written onto them.
5955712	5965675	So if, for example, they use that to reverse engineer something to create a program, that would violate copyrights and then they could stop them, I guess.
5966812	5974895	And also probably, you know, Datel's not really a large company, and Sony is a lot bigger, and they could probably bully them into doing whatever they want.
5975776	5987681	But more likely the prior, that they actually reverse-engineered something, and because of that, you know, it's not licensed, so they've got to put a stop to it.
5990154	5992016	Also, some other things I want to read here.
5992216	6000905	Giovedea, who's very excited about a new .hack game coming out, says, I wish those fuckers would have brought the actual .hack MMO over, even if it sucked balls.
6001866	6005410	And X-Link confirms there was a .hack MMO in Japan, but it was shut down.
6006772	6011296	D5T says .hack Link for the PSP is going to be the last game, FYI.
6012193	6015475	So I don't know if it's going to... I guess not a series, because all the other .hack games were in series.
6015515	6018017	I think the first one had four games, the other one had three.
6018917	6021519	So that's kind of weird that this would be a one-off game.
6021859	6026862	Hopefully it's a lot of game, because .hack got a big... I guess a very cult-type game.
6026942	6033947	There's a lot of people who've never heard of these games, but then I think there's enough of our audience who like the anime and all that stuff, too, that I'm sure know about these games and are pretty excited about it.
6033967	6040871	Well, you know, Monster Hunter, they're trying to basically recreate Monster Hunter over, you know, find anything that would work as a Monster Hunter game, because...
6041872	6044034	Those are insanely popular in Japan right now.
6044774	6046896	Especially the new Monster Hunter game coming out on the Wii.
6046976	6048617	That's going to probably take off really well.
6050319	6053241	They're trying to find more stuff that's kind of similar to Monster Hunter.
6053861	6055743	They try to make their game more like Monster Hunter.
6055783	6060006	Then maybe they'll try to get that same type of appeal that that game had.
6060546	6062628	There was some other game that they were trying to make like Monster Hunter 2.
6062808	6063969	I can't remember what it was.
6065090	6067271	Some other series game that they're changing up.
6068132	6072417	Interesting speculation in chat, too, by Alpha Cananagram says, maybe .hack//Link has DLC.
6074412	6075033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6101216	6103637	It was apparently a very popular after school hangout.
6103757	6107600	It had games, snacks, cards, clothing of all things.
6107620	6111663	So it was kind of like a little hodgepodge of cool stuff, sounds like, a place for kids to go hang out.
6112563	6114805	The proprietors were Bob and Gina Pearson.
6115145	6123491	Apparently a $250 annual tax per machine on these games, they had to get rid of the 10 games that they had.
6124431	6126631	Glow in the Dark Air Hockey, NASCAR Racing, Ms.
6126651	6129772	Pac-Man all bit the dust because of this new tax in the town.
6130712	6132553	Here's a quote from one of the owners.
6132933	6137253	We didn't renew the licenses because the machines didn't even make what you charge in these astronomical fees.
6137573	6140294	The game companies tell us this is one of the highest fees in Illinois.
6140574	6144595	We wonder if the village really researched how big this should be or if they just slapped a number on it.
6145055	6151876	We had become a pretty big hangout for kids after school and weekends but not having the video games this year has made a big impact in just the first two weeks.
6152956	6163983	So apparently somebody who works for the town told the local news that they set the fee high with the understanding that the game machine distribution companies would actually pay the fees.
6166064	6171147	But one of the proprietors said that only happens when you actually serve alcohol in the establishment.
6171968	6177231	Wait, so what was the purpose of this tax or whatever it was supposed to be?
6177711	6178592	Just to get money.
6178792	6179692	I guess, why not?
6179712	6181053	It's like the most random thing ever.
6181133	6182434	Oh, and by the way...
6182694	6183954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6204062	6208227	Let alone, you know, enough... I don't know of many at all that wouldn't be independently owned.
6208287	6210790	Maybe at that pool place I've never been to up the street.
6210810	6211511	They probably have some.
6211591	6212692	But see, that's the thing, though.
6212712	6214334	That's random and arbitrary.
6214414	6217417	Like, why... Oh, yeah, and all of a sudden, let's just pull this out of our ass.
6217437	6218479	There has to be something behind it.
6218499	6218899	Well, it sounds like...
6218979	6219559	Thanks for watching!
6238493	6254957	you're paying taxes on your revenue that you bring in so why tax it again there has to be something behind it there has to be maybe it was like targeted at that place or something are the places like this where kids like hang out maybe they think they're gonna become like delinquent or something if they spend their time doing that instead of like other stuff
6255765	6263496	TigerClaw says, if you read between the lines, there was this way of getting rid of video games in these places so kids go home and do their homework.
6263877	6264658	I don't know, TigerClaw.
6264698	6265499	I kind of disagree.
6265579	6271108	I think some of these kids, if they don't have another place to go, they're going to turn to graffiti and murder.
6272699	6273199	I'm just kidding.
6273219	6274119	But more of the latter.
6275120	6276660	But you know what I'm talking about?
6277140	6284682	At least in these types of places, it's... Yeah, that's exactly what these establishments are there for.
6284762	6291604	If parents aren't enforcing their kids to do their homework and stuff, they're going and at least playing video games or something like that.
6291624	6293224	They're not out on the street or anything.
6293285	6294685	So I just think that's kind of...
6296226	6302751	In other words, kids hanging out at this place is because their parents aren't making them go home and do their homework.
6302811	6306314	So if they're not here at this place hanging out, they'll be somewhere else.
6306354	6307655	Yeah, they're not going to be going home.
6307675	6308515	They're not going to go home.
6308796	6310057	Oh, shucks.
6310117	6310577	No more Ms.
6310617	6311277	Pac-Man for me.
6311318	6312358	I guess I'll go do homework.
6312378	6314400	Good golly, because that's what my brothers and I did.
6315000	6318543	Our parents didn't give a shit if we came home and did our homework after school, so we went to the arcade.
6318563	6318743	Yeah.
6320592	6326276	We probably would have become druggies and murderous convicts were it not for video games.
6326476	6327217	I don't know.
6327237	6328738	That's just kind of wacky.
6328818	6329119	I don't know.
6329399	6332722	SSJ100Matt says, so things are going to turn into Jet Set Radio, basically.
6333082	6333382	Yeah.
6333642	6334103	There you go.
6334263	6335184	It's all going to start in Hampshire.
6335204	6339307	We're all going to strap on rollerblades and go around and spray paint shit.
6340468	6340688	Yep.
6341889	6343070	So, kind of...
6344653	6345234	Kind of sad.
6345554	6345874	I don't know.
6346014	6348297	Maybe we should try to email these people and get them on the show.
6349217	6351340	These are the types of stories I want to dig into.
6352688	6357809	Are you going to be like Call Rob or whatever, not the local show?
6357909	6359429	Like the local news and stuff?
6359549	6360330	Well, here's the thing.
6360650	6364530	All the other shows, they're trying to get the one-up guys and all that on their show.
6366611	6367131	I don't care.
6367191	6369151	I'm over all that stuff.
6369211	6375113	Let's get these little niche stories and get them on the show and talk about why was your town out to screw you?
6375673	6376373	We want answers.
6376433	6378173	We demand to know.
6378773	6379994	Asking questions, getting answers.
6380014	6381214	We're never going to leave you with answers.
6382826	6383771	Oh my god, Rob.
6384052	6385058	You're going to make an impact.
6385569	6387750	Alright, we'll see.
6387970	6389171	Alright, let's move on.
6389611	6391212	Loki, do you have some other news for us?
6391452	6391952	Maybe happier news?
6391972	6397055	Maybe this is why they're getting rid of the arcades for games like Mortal Kombat.
6397595	6398395	Yes, that's right.
6398495	6402157	The Mortal Kombat killer has gotten 36 years.
6402657	6410101	Lamar Roberts, the teenager convicted of beating to death a 7-year-old, will be sentenced to 36 years.
6410141	6412002	Apparently, this happened in 2007,
6414564	6414887	I guess...
6416365	6425948	They beat up Zoe Garcia, a 7-year-old who was described by prosecutors and law enforcement in Greeley, Colorado.
6426509	6431150	They were beating her up as a reenactment of the fight moves from Mortal Kombat.
6431950	6438753	And it says Robert and his 17-year-old girlfriend were supposedly supposed to be babysitting the child.
6438773	6439973	They uppercutted a baby?
6440053	6445115	And said the two kicked, hit, and slammed his half-sister to the floor.
6446563	6449686	Did they confuse their babality with a fatality?
6451528	6452489	I can't even joke.
6452589	6453129	This is terrible.
6453149	6457013	I know, that is awful, and I probably shouldn't have said that, but wow.
6458295	6460117	They must be stupid.
6460157	6462419	Honestly, only 36 years?
6462819	6464061	Just 36 years?
6464301	6464841	I mean, really?
6465502	6465782	Really?
6466663	6467204	Seriously?
6467384	6469166	Are prisons that hard up for cash?
6471192	6471913	XBOX TACO ASSAILANTS
6490006	6496572	Yes, apparently law enforcement near Orlando, Florida... This is one of the stories that I've read so far, so it's good.
6496932	6506801	They have in custody a 19-year-old who refused to stop playing games to join his family for dinner and threw a taco at his mother after she unplugged his Xbox.
6508083	6514428	Apparently, this was reported as a domestic disturbance and is...
6517561	6529716	And apparently there is some name calling that says, seems his mom went upstairs and demanded he stop playing that Sega or Atari or whatever you call it and come down to be a contributing member of the family.
6530297	6533100	And he was all, whatever, bitch, she said.
6534682	6536723	And he flung the tacos.
6536823	6537784	Is this for real?
6538344	6544327	Yeah, he says they actually have a screen capture from the news thing and he's making a weird little face on it.
6546848	6550270	WFLTV is the news station covering it.
6550951	6555913	And she says she was going to let him sit in his jail cell for a few days and teach him a lesson.
6556914	6559015	They need to show no mercy to this kid.
6561234	6561635	It's funny.
6562155	6574184	You know what they should do as punishment is make him work at Taco Bell and see what exactly it takes to get in to make a taco because I don't know anybody who's ever worked at Taco Bell that really enjoyed their job.
6574244	6575485	Here's the quote from Dina.
6576185	6584931	A few minutes later, Dina says she was in the kitchen cleaning and cooking tacos for dinner when Zachary showed up.
6584951	6588794	That's when she says he slapped her arm and threw a taco in her face.
6590015	6591076	I said no fucking tomatoes!
6591096	6591577	That's taco side!
6591617	6592417	No one commits taco side!
6592437	6594359	I can imagine Eric right now like, nooooo!
6616522	6619663	Alright, and finally, this is a little bit more recent.
6621224	6625826	There's a 17-year-old Daniel Petrick of Ohio.
6626126	6632228	He's been found guilty of shooting both of his parents, which led to the death of his mother.
6632268	6633889	His dad survived.
6634569	6637231	Apparently, he has been found guilty.
6637591	6641972	This was because they took away Halo from him, Halo 3.
6642313	6643513	He's a 15-year-old, by the way.
6644273	6644433	And...
6645814	6647036	I have a surprise for you.
6647216	6647877	Close your eyes.
6647897	6648979	And he shot them both in the face.
6648999	6649039	Oh!
6663021	6663541	That's terrible.
6663561	6664121	With a taco.
6664141	6664822	No, I'm just kidding.
6665222	6666202	That's awful.
6666322	6667343	That is so bad.
6668823	6669164	I'm sorry.
6669184	6669844	I have to say this.
6669904	6671264	I know this is like a horrible story.
6671304	6674626	I have to go back to the taco thing because this is one we could actually laugh at, right?
6674646	6675706	The other ones are terrible, right?
6676046	6677607	But comments from chat.
6677627	6681529	D5T says, if I went to jail every time I threw food at my mom.
6682729	6686213	And I'm thinking, my mom and I did get into a fight over M&M's once when I was younger.
6686233	6686794	I remember.
6686834	6688255	You didn't throw them, though.
6688295	6688856	You broke the bag.
6688876	6691019	I didn't throw them, but it was a different story.
6691499	6694322	Deekman says, I see nothing wrong with tacos getting thrown in my face.
6694522	6697326	Like, if you open... It could be like a game if you open your mouth trying to catch them.
6697746	6701510	Okay, but here is the huge, huge news.
6702752	6703352	Apparently...
6704229	6704729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6727717	6746542	and then here's the best part about the Halo murder thing apparently the judge James Burge told the courtroom it's my firm belief as a human being and not just as a jurist that Daniel does suffer from a serious defect of the mind and apparently believes
6747222	6747722	What was it?
6747843	6750304	He believes that games are somehow involved.
6750845	6758750	He says, I firmly believe Daniel had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents, they would be dead forever.
6759891	6765515	That he was so far into the Halo 3 world that he separated himself from reality.
6765635	6767777	Would he be like that Kali from earlier?
6768117	6769778	So would they like respawn?
6769838	6771359	It's like parents respawn?
6771379	6773301	It would be like that Kali from earlier.
6773841	6774201	You know?
6774542	6775883	It died and came back to life.
6777830	6778290	Mom?
6779231	6786793	Oh my god, this is... There's a special place in hell where this show is waiting.
6787053	6790254	I don't know who's stupider, that kid or that juror.
6791555	6792815	No, that's a judge.
6793436	6793916	Wow.
6794716	6795756	Okay, disbarred.
6797537	6798957	Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.
6799858	6803679	I mean, I'm sure that kid's stupid, but I don't know if he's that stupid.
6803699	6805640	No, I think he knew exactly what he was doing.
6805680	6805940	Yeah.
6807182	6810025	But now he figured out, I gotta go to jail forever.
6810745	6811866	I'm insane!
6814589	6815530	Please don't kill me.
6815930	6816410	In the face.
6816831	6817431	In the face.
6820114	6820474	I don't know.
6820554	6821475	I don't even know what to say.
6821495	6824257	This isn't even really a story about video games at this point.
6824317	6826319	This kid obviously has a ton of issues.
6826980	6828541	Can we just talk about the Taco Kid some more?
6828681	6830203	Yes, the Taco Kid's awesome.
6830823	6831244	Sorry.
6833188	6836971	But I just wanted to point out that, you know, here live in studio.
6837891	6839152	Oh, my titty.
6839352	6841114	I'm now the snickerdoodle assailant.
6842234	6843075	Open your mouth.
6843175	6843435	Oh, my God.
6843455	6844616	You messed with my cookie.
6844656	6845617	Pick it up and eat it.
6846377	6847378	It's been on my boobie.
6847959	6848759	I'll eat your cookie.
6849099	6850841	I threw a snickerdoodle and it hit Irene in the boob.
6850861	6851641	Oh, eat my cookie, Victoria.
6851661	6851701	Oh.
6851721	6851821	Oh.
6851841	6856585	That was going to hurt, too, man.
6856625	6857085	Yeah.
6857105	6858846	Make it flat.
6858886	6860567	It's deliciously painful.
6861008	6861048	Oh.
6862210	6866275	All right, look, we're going to dedicate a certain segment of our show we do here.
6866415	6866696	Love you.
6866956	6876808	We're going to dedicate a certain part of our show here we do every week to these guys who are ruining the image of video gamers everywhere with their stupidity, and it's a segment called the FUs of the Week.
6891960	6896402	Since we don't have DarkSakura tonight to start us off, we'll let Loki start us off with the FUs of the week today.
6896902	6903345	Fuck you, Rockstar Games, for making a really crappy port of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC.
6903385	6908567	There's no reason whatsoever that the game should work for a while, then all of a sudden just stop.
6908727	6913169	I didn't install anything, I didn't change anything, it just said, I'm not working no more.
6913990	6919012	And just stopped working, now I reinstall it, I've uninstalled everything, including secure ROM,
6919492	6945765	all my video drivers every little bit of crap that would possibly affect this game I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it, nothing it's just broken this is bullshit, why should I pay for an actual game and have it not work that's it, never doing it again I am never buying a PC game ever again especially Rockstar Games never again don't do it my FU of the week, if you're done
6946767	6949271	My few of the week goes to my tooth, because it hurts.
6949892	6953016	And I have to go to the dentist tomorrow, and I just... I don't like going to the dentist.
6953056	6954218	I think I've mentioned this on the show before.
6954258	6957663	It's like going to a used car salesman, because then they're going to tell me, oh, you need to have this done.
6958064	6959406	Oh, and by the way, you need to get this done.
6959446	6960488	You need to replace this crown.
6960508	6961429	It's going to cost this much money.
6961449	6961749	And it's like...
6962236	6964077	I thought you had an awesome dentist, though.
6964557	6964817	No.
6965037	6965638	Do that crap.
6965758	6965978	No.
6966878	6967499	No.
6967519	6968739	Okay, you want to hear something funny?
6969099	6969640	What?
6970380	6971861	I'm horrible when it comes to oral hygiene.
6972421	6973922	Like, they tell me to floss.
6973962	6975923	I'm like, yeah, I'll floss, and I totally forget.
6976363	6978904	But, okay, so, yeah, nobody flosses.
6979224	6985047	So, anyways, they keep telling me, yeah, you gotta floss because your gums are all, you know, they're gonna get fucked up and that kind of stuff.
6985428	6989009	So, I haven't flossed for years since I saw them last, and they said that it looked better.
6989450	6989770	I'm like...
6990450	6992611	I'm like, yeah, sure, I've been flossing all the time.
6992791	6994271	Oh, well, it looks like it's doing a good job.
6994511	6995551	So, yes, they're full of shit.
6995631	6996492	That's basically it.
6996672	6999592	I've seen more unicorns than people flossing.
6999992	7001993	Like, nobody flosses.
7002173	7005794	SSJ100Matt wants to point out that his dad's a dentist, but he's not a dentist.
7005834	7008335	Look, if I lived in New York City, I would happily go to your dad.
7008375	7011215	Like, I need a friend who's a dentist.
7011495	7012676	I have a friend who's a dentist.
7012696	7012936	Really?
7013256	7014456	Yeah, he started his own practice.
7014596	7017397	I want to go see them because I want to go see somebody I trust.
7018004	7020606	Yeah, you could go to a dental school.
7021006	7021427	Blah.
7021747	7022387	Blah.
7022728	7023548	At least they're honest.
7023588	7024749	That's what poor people do.
7025329	7026510	I'm just kidding.
7027131	7028512	At least we ain't paying for every shit.
7028552	7029473	We've all been there, Victoria.
7029493	7032415	We've all been there, okay?
7032435	7033936	You're a young 21 still.
7033996	7034937	You're in that phase.
7035177	7037799	A young, beautiful, single 21-year-old gal.
7037819	7038900	With big titties.
7038980	7039280	Yes.
7040381	7041622	Quit trying to pimp me.
7043291	7047516	I want to say there is somebody in chat right now with the nickname that says, I love Victoria.
7048217	7050239	Aww, I hurt you too, whoever you are.
7052983	7054705	Alright, so my FU of the week goes to my tooth.
7055045	7056567	Victoria, do you have any FUs of the week?
7056607	7060091	My FU of the week is to the person who didn't turn my keys in.
7060871	7080444	whoever found my keys at work and didn't turn them in because I've been locked out of my apartment for the past three fucking days not really, that's the biggest FU of the week that I have and to my phone that's flashing an evil red color at me because it needs to be charged that's it and RicePrincess, do you have any FUs?
7080764	7090051	yeah, FU to you for hitting my titty you wasted a snickerdoodle you liked it a little bit I'll give it to John when he gets back I'll put it on a plate and say we saved you a snickerdoodle
7091018	7092959	Just, you know, brush off the little bit of dust.
7092979	7093599	That's what I'll do.
7094880	7097241	Oh my god, if he ever finds out it touched my boob, he'll die.
7097261	7100863	He'll be like, oh my god, I had a woman's breast in my mouth.
7100883	7102885	I'm going to put it back on the plate when no one's looking.
7102945	7106006	And then it's like a game of Russian snickerdoodle roulette.
7108288	7110449	One of these was on Irene's boobie.
7111789	7113350	Do you want to eat one and take a chance?
7113450	7116632	Or do you want to possibly inadvertently lick her boob?
7118193	7119814	Let's not talk about licking my boob.
7120764	7121267	All right.
7121830	7123317	Anyway, that's going to do it for the FUs of the Week.
7123619	7124021	On that note...
7124767	7126328	So, let's get back into some gaming news.
7126609	7128810	And this is actually some big news that came out this week.
7128851	7130132	A patent that was revealed.
7130252	7133054	Now, this is what I was kind of talking to Victoria a little bit about before.
7133174	7137338	She was talking about how video games get too hard and she gets too frustrated and throws a controller, right?
7138318	7139139	Here's what's interesting.
7140220	7143843	Apparently, Miyamoto has filed a patent.
7143923	7152410	And I don't know if it's him or his company or whatever, but basically Nintendo has filed a patent and it has been discovered for a computable, readable storage medium.
7152570	7152791	But...
7153331	7159333	What the medium is, is basically kind of a hint system.
7159974	7167977	And the game that they kind of show pictures of is a work in progress called Legend of OO, which could possibly be a Legend of Zelda game.
7168417	7169697	But here's the interesting thing.
7169998	7172679	This patent is very, very, very wordy, kind of goes on.
7173039	7175860	It talks about these different gameplay features that include...
7176340	7185989	Hint videos that are actually already there inside the game that would unlock if you've been stuck on a puzzle for so long, then a hint video will show up.
7186350	7195238	A mode called the Digest, which will actually just show the game's cinematics and gameplay sequences just as a movie, and you can take control at any point you want.
7195719	7200263	And then a Scene menu, which lets you choose exactly where you want to go into the story.
7201124	7208548	So it's kind of like this extreme hybrid of mixing a video game with DVD features, almost.
7208869	7209549	Kind of interesting.
7210930	7219115	And then you just add on to this the fact that Miyamoto has said before that he wants to make Zelda Wii titles more accessible to a broad audience.
7220055	7224578	Could this actually be something that they are going to implement in a future Zelda title?
7225489	7226530	Possibly.
7226950	7227811	But what do you think of that?
7227851	7231695	I mean, is that dumbing down the game too much?
7231935	7234477	Is that taking the game out of the video game?
7236199	7246348	I think it's kind of... For us, the hardcore gamers, the gamers who've been playing games all of our life, we're probably not going to be big fans of that.
7246448	7248971	But yeah, it's going to bring new people into games.
7248991	7249331	I don't know.
7249713	7253375	So let me ask Victoria, even though she's typing away on the laptop at somebody else right now.
7254895	7260578	What if they had a game, like one of these games you get really frustrated at, but you can just say you throw the controller because it's too hard.
7260918	7263439	What if suddenly the game said, hey, it looks like you're stuck.
7263519	7265460	Let me show you a video of how to get past this part.
7265940	7267461	Would that make the game more appealing to you?
7268342	7272143	It would probably help, but I'd probably get annoyed because I wouldn't be able to be like, what the hell?
7272163	7272603	What's going on?
7273583	7274343	How do I get up there?
7274363	7275043	You know what I mean?
7275303	7280024	That's usually my problem with games is I have to get up somewhere and, you know.
7280604	7283465	What if the game said, press this button and I'll take you past this point?
7284145	7284605	Then I'll play.
7284985	7286245	Then I'll be like, all right, bring it, bitch.
7287025	7288245	What would draw you to that, though?
7288285	7290726	What would draw you to play the game if there's no challenge?
7291566	7292506	I'm sorry.
7292566	7293946	I just read something funny.
7294206	7294807	I'm sorry.
7295407	7295787	I don't know.
7295807	7296807	What was the question?
7298298	7305863	What would draw, if you could just hit the button and skip that part to get up the ledge or get to where you need to go, you know, fast forward or whatever, what's the draw to the game to you?
7306244	7317793	Well, then I just, I think it'd make it easier for me to play it because I'm not very video game savvy as I've, you know, said already, but I just think it would make it, I think it'd make it easier for me to play it.
7318353	7326159	I think, you know, me and the four-year-olds who can't, you know, play video games very well, I'm assuming there are four-year-olds out there who can't play video games very well.
7328500	7331042	But yeah, I think that's the biggest appeal.
7331162	7333903	You just say, oh, you two can play video games.
7334203	7337504	You don't have to be as awesome as Rob or Matt or Irene to play video games.
7337624	7342046	Which is funny because people assume because we host this show that we're actually good at video games, but that's so not true.
7342086	7342907	I've seen you play video games.
7343567	7344647	You've seen me play Rock Band.
7345188	7347208	Oh yeah, he's pretty badass at Rock Band, guys.
7347489	7348229	But here's the thing.
7348249	7348909	I don't know.
7350210	7350850	No, Loki, please.
7351670	7352451	Here's my issue with it.
7353371	7364733	If the game is designed well in the beginning, you shouldn't have problems figuring out what you need to do because it gradually teaches you the skills in the game that you need to learn and teaches you how to solve different puzzles and then says, go do it.
7365493	7368834	And you should know how to do it if it's been done right.
7369274	7376015	Now, if you're going to put together a game that's poorly done, then yeah, you're going to need this stupid cheat system and stuff.
7376035	7380116	And I think it's a waste of time anyways because it would be like showing...
7380936	7381817	Thanks for watching!
7399227	7400288	Thank you for watching!
7416697	7422983	I think it's a horrible idea and I see what they're trying to do because they're still having this dilemma.
7423323	7428048	How do we sell games to people that only want to play Wii Sports and now Wii Fit?
7428989	7430210	How do we sell games to them?
7430310	7431111	And they don't know.
7431311	7436676	And this is a problem because they're never going to figure this out, this console generation, and they're going to
7437822	7443284	I have a feeling they're going to sell millions of systems, but they're not going to sell millions of games.
7443544	7449187	And that's a problem because the only things they're selling right now are the things that they're making hard to find.
7449207	7453949	Because trust me, I'm sorry, Mario Kart's been out since last April.
7454729	7457330	We're coming upon almost a year of it being out.
7457950	7460532	There's no fucking reason that should be a shortage right now.
7460672	7462452	It's a game and a goddamn steering wheel.
7462512	7463393	It's a piece of plastic.
7464618	7466378	They make plastic toys like crazy.
7466519	7467799	They're in supermarkets everywhere.
7467979	7469399	It's a piece of fucking plastic.
7469979	7470739	I mean, come on.
7471080	7476021	So there's no reason that the stuff is, they're selling out of it because they can't make enough.
7476121	7479781	No, they're not making enough on purpose so that there's not enough on the market.
7480042	7481262	So demand's always high.
7481522	7482962	So people are always looking for it.
7483422	7486683	So Wii Fit's always popular because people think, oh my God, it's out there.
7486723	7490864	But once they buy it, like I do, you go, oh my God, I'm not using this thing.
7493504	7494806	I have an argument for it.
7495548	7495668	Yeah.
7495688	7495948	Okay.
7497572	7498554	Number one, we have...
7500652	7507316	Not only strategy guides, but we have a huge website dedicated to, you know, FAQs and walkthroughs and stuff like that.
7507336	7509898	So, obviously, people are going to need help with games.
7510218	7511119	That's why those exist.
7511579	7513480	Number two, there are going to be parts of games.
7514021	7518044	Like, not every part of every game is hard, but there are going to be very hard parts.
7518104	7522607	I remember a part in Resident Evil 4 that I just could not get past, and I wish I could have done that.
7522947	7527330	Just press a button and just gotten through that one small section of the game, and then continued.
7527450	7527590	So...
7528170	7536819	I personally probably would not use it to just skip through every part of the game, but if I have a chance to get through a hard part of the game, bring it on.
7537119	7537640	I'd like it.
7537860	7545167	This has been done before, not necessarily to the fact that there's stuff that you can skip parts of the game, but
7545808	7546568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7576323	7584727	And that may turn away people from playing those games, but you're not going to buy the game in the first place if you aren't remotely interested in it.
7584787	7587768	It's like someone spoiling the ending for a movie or something.
7588108	7588288	Why is...
7590975	7593137	For example, The Sixth Sense or something like that.
7594097	7597440	Why is it that his wife doesn't see him?
7597500	7598381	What's going on?
7598521	7599562	It's because he's dead!
7600022	7600763	Spoilers!
7601443	7606948	If someone spoiled that for you so that you figure out the puzzle there, it ruins it.
7607168	7607748	That's the thing.
7607849	7616435	Well, see, gamers like us, regular gamers that have hand-eye coordination and all that stuff, we're not going to want to skip over the story parts.
7616475	7618316	We're going to want to play the game as is.
7618456	7619817	But there are people who suck.
7620257	7622679	Just plain, flat-out suck at video games.
7622719	7625761	They just can't make their character jump or whatever.
7626162	7627402	They can't put two and two together.
7627823	7629184	They're going to want to be kind of like a...
7629884	7630785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7649014	7663788	I have to say my piece because I haven't said anything on this yet and I haven't stated my opinion and you know I'm one of Nintendo's biggest critics as of like 2008 and everything Nintendo's kind of been pissing me off a lot lately that being said I actually think this is a really good idea
7665691	7669856	For Nintendo and its audience, I think this is a really good idea.
7670557	7674962	As long as they make a feature to turn it off and you hit the nail on the head.
7675282	7676264	Exactly what I was thinking.
7676344	7682051	This is for those people that like to watch other people play video games because they're too intimidated.
7682111	7683733	They don't want to really play them themselves.
7684113	7689537	because of the fact that they feel like they suck at video games, they can't get past these hard parts, they want to just get past this stuff.
7689557	7701286	And I think a game like Zelda, especially, that has such pretty awesome cinematics, these things that you get into, the towns, and the story behind these games, I think it actually is going to work really well.
7701666	7712455	I kind of think about how many times we've kind of hoped that there was a game like Final Fantasy X or something, where you could just like, I don't want to grind, I don't want to do this dungeon, I just want to run past all the monsters,
7713115	7720823	I'm going to equip the run boots on my character so I can just run really fast through the dungeon so I don't have to grind here because I just want to get to the next part of the story.
7721083	7724747	Do you know how many games I've quit because I couldn't get past one certain part?
7725187	7726189	Fucking Alundra.
7726749	7728791	Oh my god, that game pissed me off.
7728971	7732915	I spent so long trying to do one puzzle I could just never get it so I quit the game.
7732935	7733676	My thing though is
7735818	7743503	I think as we start to blur the line even more and more as games become more and more realistic between games and movies, this actually kind of seems like a logical progression to me.
7744244	7747145	These video games are slowly becoming Blu-ray movies, in a way.
7747526	7748726	It's fascinating.
7748947	7757192	And again, for the hardcore gamers, that can be a little off-putting at first, but I don't think this necessarily means that games that you and I enjoy are going to go away.
7757732	7760114	I think this is just something they're going to start in Nintendo.
7760894	7762235	And it's a very Nintendo thing to do.
7762295	7763035	It's not surprising at all.
7763115	7763656	Okay, sorry, Matt.
7764537	7767979	My thing is, is that a fault of the fact that you can't finish something?
7768019	7772163	Is that a fault of the person or is that a fault of the game design?
7772803	7774405	I think it's a fault of the game design.
7774705	7777267	The fact that they made that many random battles.
7777507	7782732	You know, they've tweaked it in future Final Fantasy games where there aren't that many random battles.
7783232	7785534	And they've gone back and fixed different things like that.
7786254	7788256	Because people complained about it and they listened to it.
7788356	7789897	But I don't think that necessarily...
7791416	7795737	It's a bad thing that there should be some difficulty in there because it makes it worthwhile to figure it out.
7795777	7800979	If you want to just go from story to story to story, seriously, go read a book.
7800999	7801679	Go watch a movie.
7801839	7804720	Well, of course, but they're making it an option for you.
7804980	7806740	Yeah, work at it.
7806860	7810401	If you really want a sense of accomplishment from beating this game, do it normal.
7810501	7812882	But for those people who don't want to, they're giving them the option.
7812902	7818383	I just have a problem, though, with someone pushing a button, having the game play itself, beginning to end, and just...
7819984	7820444	What's the point?
7820704	7823585	Here's what you can't do with a movie, Loki.
7823805	7825206	There's going to be some people like this.
7825466	7831928	All they're going to do in a Zelda game is go around and talk to the villagers and then fast forward through the action sequences and dungeons of the game.
7832228	7840290	But they're going to feel like a part of the game and they feel that more emotional attachment because it was more interactive and they just walked around and talked to villagers and that's all they ever did.
7840390	7842071	And they're going to be like, this is the greatest game I've ever played.
7842091	7843631	And you know what's also awesome about that?
7843651	7847873	The fact that they're going to be done with the game now and they have to buy something else.
7848673	7851014	That's their own choice.
7851094	7852035	That's their prerogative.
7852075	7853496	They can do that if they want to.
7854056	7858939	And you can go on to themoviespoiler.net and look at the ending to all your movies without having to pay $100.
7859279	7860079	Alright, fine.
7860119	7861320	I'm going to say this here and now.
7861740	7865282	This game, whenever it does come out with this feature, I'm not buying it.
7865622	7866043	I'm sorry.
7866603	7871265	This feature right here ruined it for me, and the fact that they're putting it in this game, I am not buying this game.
7871365	7872126	Even though it's optional?
7872786	7875027	I don't give a shit, I'm not buying it.
7896775	7902899	There have been plenty of kids, plenty of people that have figured out the Xbox controllers, figured out the PlayStation 2 controllers.
7902979	7904080	I'd like to meet them.
7904100	7906121	Figured out how to use the Wii Remote.
7906281	7908183	There's people that still don't know how to use the Wii Remote.
7908343	7916028	Unless you come out with a game that's one fucking controller that's a big giant button that says, push me, and even then they're not going to figure it out.
7916048	7918510	They're going to throw it on the floor and go, I don't know how to play this.
7918890	7920731	These people do not need to be playing games.
7921011	7923073	And I don't care if you want to introduce them in the games.
7923493	7926595	They think they need to be playing games, but they do not need to be playing games.
7926937	7929413	And keep them away from my goddamn games!
7931058	7931378	We 2.0, push me
7961202	7962443	Uh, Rice Princess.
7962563	7970428	Oh, no, I was just gonna say, I, the way I see it, I liken it to, um, having an easy, normal, and hard mode in a game.
7970908	7974450	Like, you just, there's gonna be, like, dumb fuck mode, you know?
7974690	7978052	Like, don't know how to do anything in the game, just gonna watch it play itself.
7978092	7978693	Whatever, you know.
7978713	7979173	It's just another mode.
7979253	7981695	I'm not surprised it's the Wii, you know, great.
7981715	7984656	They're gonna have this feature, but I bet you anything they're gonna be able to turn it off.
7984736	7985277	And you know why?
7985477	7989539	Because that's a feature, and Nintendo doesn't add features that people want.
7989800	7990160	Okay, so...
7990660	7995001	we're getting back into that Matt we don't need to have that argument on this show no seriously
7996084	7998245	They're not going to have it.
7998365	7998705	Whatever.
7999606	8002067	There's a second half to this I want Loki to get into here.
8002087	8003107	Yes, there's a second half.
8003127	8008309	Apparently, the game developers were asked to comment on this.
8009510	8010310	They have different things.
8010750	8015032	For example, Ben Matz from Ubisoft.
8015152	8016973	He was saying he read through it quickly.
8017413	8019734	Not surely they fully understand the...
8021055	8021736	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8047819	8053263	Yeah, it's kind of interesting because Ubisoft kind of already started going this direction where, you know, you don't die.
8053644	8054725	The chick always saves you.
8055305	8058868	And in every battle, at least that I've played so far, it pretty much tells you how to fight it.
8059148	8061450	And you just press buttons and it does cool stuff.
8061890	8063732	But, like, it's not a bad game.
8063832	8064473	It's really not.
8064553	8065954	I have a lot of fun with the new Prince of Persia.
8067731	8068832	Can I read this in chat real quick?
8068912	8069774	I'm sorry, this is too good.
8070054	8080589	GS68 says, I guess talking about getting irritated at games, my face turns beet red, I throw my controller on the ground, start swearing, fucking game, long chains, swear to never play a shooting game again.
8081069	8083853	And SakuraMax follows up and says, and then you throw a taco at someone.
8087403	8094225	Todd Howard from Bethesda says that most people stop playing certain games because they get frustrated or confused by what the game wants them to do.
8094685	8098326	It becomes work and frustration as opposed to playtime.
8099087	8101267	This idea clearly tries to alleviate that.
8101687	8107729	It's much like passing the controller to someone that knows the game really well so that you can move ahead or simply enjoy the story.
8109230	8112811	It's a classic challenge or entertain issue that designers will often deal with.
8117584	8134362	Um, and then finally, uh, let's see here, Jonathan Blow from, um, the creator of Braid says, based on just reading your posting, I don't know, I mean, it's an okay idea for a developer to have a way to show you through various parts of the game, I guess, to show you the side quests that you missed or whatever.
8134863	8138687	I'd like to see someone try that, uh, but as a general, um...
8139708	8140128	What was that?
8140168	8140609	Paradigm.
8141089	8143830	For playing games, there are a lot of problems.
8143930	8146351	The defining characteristics of a game is that you play it.
8146491	8163500	And if in order for games to be accessible to a wide audience, we need to make sure that so that most people can skip over the playing part of it, then what that really means is that our medium sucks.
8164280	8165201	And if you have...
8166809	8175052	If you have to elude the basic property of your medium to make experiences in the medium desirable, then the medium itself is questionable at a very deep level.
8176553	8178554	Apparently our stream went down for the live listeners.
8178874	8183396	The podcast listeners won't notice the thing because we've been recording the whole time, but our stream went down in the middle of you reading that.
8184316	8185216	I don't know what's going on tonight.
8185256	8187477	There's some weird things with our internet stream.
8188358	8191939	But somebody in the chat room had to say, who threw a taco at the stream?
8193379	8194840	Sorry, that's never going to get old.
8194920	8197082	I'm sorry to derail the other thing you're talking about.
8197443	8201326	The live listeners didn't even hear what you were just saying, which is unfortunate.
8202327	8203869	Kind of some varied opinions from developers.
8206294	8210577	I mean, definitely it's all over the place, but I think it's something that's only going to be used in Nintendo games anyway.
8210597	8212198	It's not something that they're requiring, I don't think.
8212319	8216141	I wonder if any of these developers are secretly already working on something for this new system.
8216261	8217362	That's what I'm curious about.
8217382	8217883	I doubt it.
8218423	8219944	You think this is a Nintendo-only thing?
8220164	8224448	I think this is something they're going to push, and it's probably going to be one game, and I don't think you'll see it ever again.
8225568	8235376	I really don't think... I mean, honestly, with this in here, the problem is if this is... We're expecting this to be implemented in a Zelda game.
8236525	8241747	And really, are you going to be able to tell what kind of an impact this had on a Zelda game?
8241867	8245649	I mean, this is a title that's going to sell like crazy anyways.
8246169	8251571	I mean, I would think that they would want this something on, you know, something that doesn't sell very well.
8251591	8253672	Like, even Mario Galaxy didn't sell that well.
8253992	8256873	You know, maybe something like that is where we can see an actual impact on this.
8256913	8260474	But with Zelda, it's just going to sell like crazy and be like, oh, it worked.
8260674	8262695	You know, I mean, it's just stupid.
8263655	8263956	I don't know.
8264116	8264916	I don't think it's...
8266459	8272989	They're just going to sell tons of copies anyways because people are dumb and they'll buy whatever people tell them is good.
8273550	8276735	And Zelda is going to get tens out of ten because...
8277776	8278236	That's a good franchise.
8278256	8280898	Because there's fanboys out there that are reviewing that stuff.
8280958	8285041	And even though, like, you know, Twilight Princess, in my opinion, I don't think that's a 10 out of 10 game.
8285081	8286402	Or not even an 9 out of 10 game.
8286802	8287403	It was okay.
8287943	8289664	It was the first Zelda game.
8290225	8291286	Actually, the GameCube one.
8291626	8293787	Or the, not the GameCube, the Nintendo 64 ones.
8293827	8295268	I didn't care for it too much either.
8295348	8300412	But the... I just was not interested.
8300772	8302493	It just didn't hold my interest in...
8303843	8306204	That's sad because I'm really interested in the Zoli games.
8306744	8310144	Yeah, but they don't have an objective perspective on the game.
8310384	8311505	Yeah, I think that's it.
8311945	8312405	Perfectly.
8312585	8314165	You know, there's going to be like Grand Theft Auto.
8314325	8314985	Oh, 10 out of 10.
8315025	8317226	You know, Gears of War, 10 out of 10.
8317606	8319306	Yeah, they don't even have to work on it anymore.
8319346	8319987	It's guaranteed.
8320047	8320807	I mean, that's what you do.
8320847	8325008	You build up a franchise and you get to the point where it's like, you know, you can do whatever and people are still going to buy it.
8325028	8325508	I don't know.
8325588	8325888	It's huge.
8326548	8327089	All right, then.
8327129	8328170	Check out some emails from the listeners.
8328190	8328270	Sure.
8328290	8328510	All right.
8354045	8359629	Every week we invite you to send us emails at mailbag at orangelunchradio.com and usually DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads the emails.
8359709	8362251	However, she's not here tonight, so I am filling in.
8362631	8367314	And we actually have quite a few emails tonight, so I want to try and get through these as fast as I can.
8368355	8369475	Let's read this first email.
8369515	8370256	It's from Chaz.
8370996	8372597	Hey, OLR gang.
8373038	8375679	I'm a long-time listener of the show, but it's my first time writing in.
8375860	8379702	I listen to you all every Monday at my desk while hard at work here in the frozen tundra known as Chicago.
8380243	8383785	I listen to a lot of the other video game podcasts out there, and OLR is by far the best.
8384025	8384425	Well, thank you.
8385365	8389347	I don't really have much to say in the way of video games today, but consider this my love letter to the show.
8389467	8391027	How hard does OLR rock?
8391107	8391848	Let me count the ways.
8392228	8394208	Number three, real gamers with real opinions.
8394268	8395029	Nothing commercial here.
8395449	8395709	Thank you.
8395749	8396849	That's one of the things we pride ourselves on.
8396869	8403031	Yeah, we're definitely not commercial, based on the comments and, like, crap that we... Brought to you by Nintendo.
8403111	8405252	By the way, have you checked out GameTap this week?
8405332	8405732	No, just kidding.
8406232	8408293	Number two, awesome segments.
8408373	8410694	Classic Game of the Week and FUs of the Week rock my world.
8410934	8411274	Well, thank you.
8412274	8414015	Number one, good friends with great chemistry.
8414115	8419697	Loki with his blistering honesty, Jamie's hilarious interludes, and Rob's fun-loving and sincere take on gaming culture.
8420518	8424139	These are just a few of the reasons I am and will continue to be an OLR fanboy.
8424339	8427501	Also, on a personal note, I'd like to give a special shout-out to Rob.
8428843	8439648	I think it's so great and so important to have an openly gay gamer's voice being heard in the community.
8439768	8451453	As a gay man myself, you know as well as I do how severely underrepresented and occasionally maligned gay sexuality has been portrayed through the games we've played and how rampant homophobia continues to be in the online gaming sphere.
8452053	8454915	Thanks for letting listeners know your stand on these issues.
8454995	8459339	It means a lot to me and also to those who are unable for whatever reason to speak up for themselves.
8459559	8460219	Keep up the great work.
8460259	8461160	Ooh, is he single?
8461300	8463001	And not a minor?
8463101	8463522	Shush.
8464222	8464543	Shush.
8465483	8466924	No, that was very nice.
8467725	8472849	You know, it's letters like those that make me feel good about doing this show for free for seven years.
8473109	8473709	I mean, honestly.
8473809	8474750	Tear, tear.
8475110	8477532	But, you know, when one says it's right, it's tough.
8477732	8479574	It's really tough sometimes because, you know.
8479594	8479994	It's so hard.
8480274	8486077	No, no, I'm saying, you know, the nice thing is being gay is getting more and more accepted.
8486117	8486798	We're getting there.
8486938	8491840	You know, even though Prop 8 in California didn't pass, it was just, yeah, I know, I know, Victoria, don't get me started.
8492120	8496423	It was a very slim margin compared to Prop 22 of several years ago.
8497083	8497783	We're getting there.
8497844	8500885	You know, more and more, especially in the youth, no more gay people, what have you.
8501325	8504948	But it's funny because in the gay world, it's like, oh, you play video games?
8505408	8506448	That's like a kid thing.
8506468	8509210	You know, why don't you listen to Madonna or do fashion shows?
8509850	8511671	Like, seriously, you know, like, it's hard.
8512132	8521497	Like, there was a long time where I didn't feel comfortable when I met guys for the first time, like, telling them, yeah, I do an online radio show about video games on the weekends because it's like, whoa, nerd alert, but now I don't give a shit.
8522919	8530130	I'm to that point where I've kind of seen there's enough out there that, you know, there's people out there that
8532102	8535143	are going to like me for both elements, if that makes sense.
8536623	8538704	Anyhow, I don't want to get too into it.
8538724	8539824	We can relate to you, Rob.
8540064	8540364	How so?
8540884	8551247	Because girl gamers, I mean, like, you know, a lot of them are kind of, I guess, not really tomboyish, but they kind of shun, like, female convention.
8551807	8557889	You know, not all of them are bottle blondes that get their nails done every day and wear a lot of makeup, so it's kind of the same.
8558969	8559870	Interesting perspective.
8560110	8560290	Yeah.
8560650	8561130	True, true.
8561750	8563591	Alright, let's get to another email.
8563971	8569652	And, okay, this kind of ties into a story we reported on earlier, but obviously we weren't here last week.
8570313	8575154	Spazinator writes in, Hey everyone, I thought I'd email you folks about some news that I received the other day that you might want to share.
8576194	8587238	I have heard via both 1up.com, Greenspeak.com, and G4 that Ziff Davis has sold the 1up network of sites along with EGM to UGO, not to be confused with Yu-Gi-Oh!, for some undisclosed sum.
8587638	8589138	Subsequently, Yu-Gi-Oh!
8589198	8590499	is, now I want to say Yu-Gi-Oh!,
8590959	8597042	has fired approximately 30 1UP employees, including some of the more well-known and popular personalities.
8597462	8606046	Additionally, EGM has been officially killed off, and although no one mentioned them specifically, it looks like the audio and video podcasts have been axed as well, including 1UP FM, Retronauts, and so on and so on.
8606626	8610027	On a personal note, I really feel bad for those that got the ax earlier this week.
8610347	8618411	The ones I recognize, I know they produce top-notch material, whether it be for the sites, podcasts, or the magazines, and inject their own personality into said material to keep it from going stale.
8618951	8626016	I hope for the best for them, but given the particularly craptastic economy as of late, I'm afraid there's the potential they may leave the video games journalism biz.
8626356	8628618	If that's the case, the industry would suffer a great loss.
8628998	8632860	Additionally, it really sickens me that they killed off EGM, a long as hell running magazine.
8633201	8637463	Isn't it bad enough that OPM was killed in 06 and Game for Windows earlier this year?
8637944	8641146	I mean, come on, websites are fine and dandy, but magazines still have a place though.
8641486	8643487	Case in point, which would you rather bring to the can?
8643547	8644728	A mag or a laptop?
8644848	8645809	Or worse, yes, a desktop.
8646049	8647790	Wow, it's like this guy read my mind from earlier.
8647850	8648391	That's amazing.
8649631	8654393	Not only that, but for some people such as myself, we like the feel of holding a mag in our hands.
8667159	8676626	Hell, I still have every single solitary issue of OPM, original PlayStation Magazine, all 112 and every single issue of EGM since my OPM subscription rolled over to EGM.
8677086	8678787	I was wondering, what are your opinions on this?
8678947	8685372	I know that based on user-generated comments on various sites, blogs, etc., that most people are uber-pissed and vowed never to visit 1up.com again.
8685732	8689035	Additionally, what other podcasts, websites, and mags would you recommend to fill the void?
8689455	8696400	Honestly, I want to avoid GameSpot because of their reputation and credibility has been severely tarnished early last year over that Army of Two firing debacle.
8698464	8699105	Thank you for the email.
8699345	8709595	Obviously, we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show, but the point that he brought up that I thought was interesting was that last paragraph was based on everybody complaining, vowing never to visit 1up.com and all this stuff again.
8710717	8711417	But here's the thing.
8711557	8714858	EGM has really gone through a lot of changes since the beginning.
8714918	8717779	Do a lot of people that worked there in the first couple years work there now?
8718019	8719379	Very, very few.
8719579	8723840	And I know that because most of the people working at 1up.com were in their early 30s or late 20s.
8724001	8727822	So they would have been like teenagers when the magazines first came out.
8727962	8728002	So...
8729682	8733365	These magazines have already changed the guards a few times.
8733565	8745573	So my question back to you guys is, yes, these guys integrated their personalities into the show and everything, which in turn probably ended up being bad for 1up.com because this would have never happened had they never had those podcasts.
8745593	8746013	Think about it.
8746473	8750496	If they never had those podcasts, if they never built up that personality, it's kind of like a double-edged sword.
8750836	8754198	It probably really helped sell their site, but at the same time, now they're having to deal with this.
8754539	8757341	What if you'd never really gotten to know those writers as well as you did?
8757741	8759202	Would you have cared so much about this news?
8760103	8760684	Kind of interesting.
8761305	8763248	Because I bet this kind of stuff has happened before.
8763568	8768777	You didn't care because you didn't feel that connection to them from reading their Twitters, looking at their podcasts, so on and so on.
8770039	8770159	So...
8771394	8772695	Thank you for watching!
8790086	8790707	Thanks for watching!
8806448	8807409	There's what?
8807549	8809530	Gamercast Network, I think they're called.
8809951	8811192	Especially if you like Xbox.
8811212	8813333	They have a lot of Xbox-centric shows over there.
8813533	8815094	Look for some of the networks of shows.
8815234	8820918	Because that's kind of what 1UP was, was a network, except it was a little different because they were all still produced in-house.
8820998	8825721	Whereas, I think in the case of all games, Gamercast and whatever other networks you can think of.
8826182	8826622	What's the other one?
8826642	8827943	Platform Nation, I think, is another one.
8830424	8831585	Is Evil Avatar a network?
8831865	8832666	I don't know off the top of my head.
8833086	8835408	But, you know, all these kind of networks are
8836948	8839269	I think the difference is that 1UP produced all those in-house.
8839449	8843630	These are more, everybody produces their own little silo show and they come together on these networks.
8843830	8846410	So, you know, check out.
8847070	8850631	There's lots of people that love games that would love to talk about them with you out there on the internets.
8851171	8855632	And, obviously, if you still feel connected to the 1UP guys, it sounds like they're doing their own show.
8855712	8857633	So, maybe it'll last for them.
8857673	8858033	We'll see.
8860339	8860580	Alright.
8861521	8864407	Platform Nation is the... I said them right?
8864807	8865288	I don't remember.
8865308	8865769	I think so.
8868411	8873793	By the way, just for the live listeners only, and I apologize, I'm too lazy to edit this kind of stuff out of the podcast.
8874494	8876354	Apparently the stream is skipping now.
8876394	8878295	It sounds like a CD that's skipping or something.
8878355	8879556	It's not on our end, guys.
8879676	8880616	I don't know what's going on.
8881496	8882737	I have had cable issues.
8884037	8888659	I did not get to go to a WoW raid on Thursday because of Comcast cable issues.
8888739	8891841	God forbid you miss your story of the castle.
8891861	8892381	For real.
8892561	8893001	For real.
8893221	8896943	And by the way, it was the dragon battle, Malygos, that I missed.
8897563	8901886	and I was the only one attuned for it so the whole guild didn't get to go because I couldn't sign on because of Comcast.
8901926	8903207	So it was big drama.
8903567	8904007	Big drama.
8905368	8906449	But anyway, I don't know what's going on.
8906469	8907229	I don't know if it's us.
8907289	8908270	I don't know if it's the server.
8908830	8909330	Something's up.
8909591	8914674	But the podcast will be up in its entirety along with last week's podcast this week on the stream.
8915274	8915735	Promise.
8917996	8918796	More emails.
8918897	8920478	Except I just closed the mailbag.
8920518	8920758	Whoops.
8921258	8922419	Way to go, Ron.
8922459	8922959	Sorry about that.
8923319	8924920	Anything else you guys want to say on that last email?
8925281	8925801	About other...
8927476	8928717	I think you touched everything.
8956226	8959171	When the line reaches the end, it continues on the other half of the screen.
8959852	8962457	I feel that this game is the right step for the rhythm game genre.
8962477	8968127	There's always two to three people waiting to play the game at Sunnyvale Golf Land, which shows that Technica just might keep arcades going somewhat longer.
8969025	8969405	I doubt it.
8970086	8973208	I mean, I hate to be the pessimist, but one game ain't gonna happen.
8973488	8975389	But, I appreciate your enthusiasm.
8976210	8982934	The touchscreen in the EBA meets luminous gameplay allows for more freedom of movement and play styles as opposed to, say, Beatmania 2DX or DDR.
8983374	8987737	I've seen players use one hand, both hands, one or two fingers, all of their fingers, and so on.
8988792	8989812	Thank you for watching!
9013504	9019769	And of course, being a touch-the-notes game as opposed to hit notes as they pass a red line game, it's harder to sight-read a song.
9020090	9023893	I've seen otherwise good players fail a song because of the offbeat notes.
9024353	9030219	Songs that are faster tend to be also harder than slow songs because the notes are more spaced out and you have less time to survey the notes.
9030819	9032680	I'm hoping something good comes out of having a card.
9032980	9041466	I have one myself, and so far it's only apparent features are modifiers, which you use max points on, and Platinum Crew mode, which is some sort of online mode I'll discuss later when it's activated.
9042087	9044228	Also, our machine is looking to get an update in a few days.
9044288	9045629	Hopefully we'll get some new songs about it.
9046089	9049532	Also a minor but nice touch, there's a headphone jack below the touchscreen.
9049552	9051773	If it's hard to hear the game, using headphones can help.
9052273	9052714	Take care.
9052754	9054195	Maybe I'll see some of you at Sviggle.
9054595	9054855	P.S.
9054895	9059258	This email was brought to you by Beat Rock 3 from Papa Music, home of the never-ending Falling Books.
9060979	9061519	So there you go.
9063740	9064781	It sounds interesting.
9065081	9066982	I want to try this touch game.
9067022	9067842	It sounds interesting.
9068543	9073065	Actually, I'm supposed to be in South Bay February 7th anyway, and I'm taking Victoria with me.
9073125	9077187	So maybe I'll take Victoria to the arcade because we have Rocky in the South Bay on the 7th.
9078427	9080328	So maybe we can swing by and check out this game.
9080708	9082709	Don't you want to go play video games, Victoria?
9083750	9084730	OMG, totally.
9085210	9085490	Alright.
9086371	9087171	She just rolled her eyes.
9087471	9088852	You don't want to play DDR, Victoria?
9089540	9090740	I'm an epic fail at DDR.
9090760	9093041	Am I fat ass on the damn thing?
9093101	9094942	I'm like, on easy, I'm like, oh girl!
9095482	9095942	Oh girl!
9096582	9097162	I need a break!
9098543	9100323	You can play pinball or something that's less stressful.
9100384	9101324	Holla!
9102164	9105205	Also, Victoria's ass is not fat, it's just round.
9106846	9108266	I like big butts and I cannot lie.
9109166	9110927	Actually, I don't think Victoria's fat, but whatever.
9110947	9111667	No, she's not at all.
9111907	9114468	She's beautiful and single.
9115388	9117189	Stop trying to pimp me, Irene.
9118604	9120568	I'm not at all.
9122191	9125116	Let me read another email here from...
9127052	9131353	RJ, because I don't see another signature here, so I'm just going to say RJ.
9131753	9136354	Hey, OLR, I'm using my lovely iTouch to send this email, so be warned, Jamie, if the grammar Nazi bar is high.
9136674	9137154	You lucked out.
9137174	9139815	You read me tonight, and I have terrible grammar, so I don't judge the others.
9140375	9149197	I've just finished Infinite Undiscovery and Lost Odyssey, and I'm planning on getting The Last Remnant next, which I've heard is a slightly generic story, but a robust and interesting battle system, so I'll tell you what I've experienced next time.
9149517	9150457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9173585	9177426	Nevertheless, both leave you satisfied at the end and don't suffer from rehashed plot points.
9177846	9179546	If you wish, story is better.
9179826	9180186	Oh, I'm sorry.
9180326	9181987	If you wish, story is better.
9182087	9184487	Lost Odyssey is and has superb presentation.
9184787	9189028	With Infinite Undiscovery gameplay, in my opinion, fun yet repetitive at parts.
9189388	9191529	Don't hesitate on getting either.
9192269	9196890	So interesting because I gave up on Infinite Undiscovery because the beginning is terrible.
9197270	9197550	Really?
9197570	9197650	Yeah.
9197910	9199510	PS, Rob, Queen was the better 70s band than ABBA
9224309	9225049	I love Queen.
9225329	9226410	Queen is amazing.
9226530	9227250	Queen is amazing.
9227290	9229690	Freddie Mercury was... I know.
9229750	9231471	Freddie Mercury is a god.
9231911	9233511	Freddie Mercury was a god, really.
9234171	9235552	But, I'm sorry.
9235672	9236652	Abba's still number one.
9236692	9238392	But Queen is like seriously two or three.
9238732	9239153	Seriously.
9239193	9240073	Two or maybe three.
9240133	9240673	Maybe two or three.
9240693	9245574	Because Bowie's kind of... Oh, from Labyrinth.
9246014	9246494	He's awesome.
9246574	9246894	There you go.
9246914	9247595	That's my thoughts on that.
9249195	9250295	And just a couple more here.
9250675	9252416	Sorry, I know we have a lot of emails tonight, but that's alright.
9252436	9252976	We don't have a lot of...
9254176	9258684	This one's for Fart Princess, which we haven't called it that tonight, but Fart Princess.
9259044	9262990	No, since Rice or Fart Princess, which, by the way, can I say this about Fart Princess real quick?
9263611	9264713	I was on WoW last night.
9264994	9267017	Okay, do you have to bring this up?
9267097	9267217	Boo!
9267498	9267958	Thank you.
9268487	9272150	And for an hour, she was talking about farts in guild chat.
9272230	9275313	It was not an hour, it was like five minutes.
9275654	9276434	It felt like an hour.
9276454	9277315	It was incidental.
9277335	9281459	You were talking about farts for an hour.
9281639	9283040	And Vlad kept talking to me.
9283681	9285943	So obviously someone was interested in what I had to say.
9287444	9294326	Since Rice Princess is here tonight, this is from Amaze Satsuma, I'll go ahead and ask, how did you all like the latest Battlestar Galactica episode?
9294346	9301948	We all know the BSG talk is in, was going to happen sooner or later with her here, so I thought I'd give it a helping hand.
9302328	9305309	No spoilers, I haven't watched it yet because I'm still on season 3.
9305629	9309810	This doesn't spoil anything, but I am depressed beyond belief.
9310931	9314572	I want to elaborate more, but I can't because then I'll start getting into the spoilers.
9315592	9317473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9336053	9337633	I thought it was stupid.
9338354	9349556	I hope that's not a spoiler, but I'm hoping that it wasn't an actual revelation of the final Cylon, that it was just speculation on behalf of one of the characters in the show.
9350336	9351536	But I don't know.
9351596	9357218	I mean, I think it pretty much is confirmation that it is the last Cylon, but if that is the last Cylon, I'll be upset.
9358798	9359338	That's all I have to say.
9361218	9361598	That's enough.
9361638	9362279	We won't say any more.
9362299	9362459	No BSG.
9366026	9371691	One other email from our old buddy DMN who wants to update you on the March Madness competition that's going on.
9371751	9377015	Remember this was the controversial one last year where Super Metroid beat Chrono Trigger and I got hate mail for a year because of it?
9377335	9380158	Yeah, as you deserve.
9380518	9382960	Here is your chance to write what has been wronged.
9383320	9384401	You can send your top 25 to...
9387403	9388923	Breast Lull, I guess is his name.
9389183	9392024	But there's a specific email address you actually want to send those to.
9392884	9393844	I know it's a Gmail address.
9393864	9394745	Let me look it up real quick.
9394785	9396305	And this is the last week to do so, by the way.
9396325	9397385	There's like six days left.
9398025	9401666	uslmadness, all one word, at gmail.com.
9402226	9405407	You want to send those into Breast Lull as fast as you can because you only have six days left.
9405867	9408108	Here's the rundown of the top 25 so far.
9408188	9413689	Keep in mind, this is only determining the seeds for the head-to-head competitions that will happen later on.
9413729	9414249	This is not...
9415354	9415974	25.
9415434	9415974	Paper Mario 24.
9416235	9417435	Earthbound 23.
9417535	9418076	Mega Man 2 22.
9418196	9418876	Super Mario Galaxy 21.
9419316	9419997	World of Warcraft 20.
9420037	9420657	Ace Attorney 19.
9420697	9421177	Street Fighter 3 18.
9421237	9422518	Tetris Attack and Puzzle League 17.
9422598	9423558	Super Mario World 16.
9423638	9424059	Legend of Zelda
9434904	9435745	15 Super Mario Bros.
9436065	9453253	1, 14 Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 13 Final Fantasy 7, 12 Super Mario RPG, 11 Street Fighter 2, 10 Tetris, 9 Pokemon, 8 Dance Dance Revolution, 7 Super Metroid, at 7, excuse me, excuse me.
9455070	9457691	6.
9455370	9457691	Super Mario 3 5.
9457871	9458552	Final Fantasy 6 4.
9460113	9461214	The Ocarina of Time 3.
9462455	9463355	Link to the Past 2.
9465136	9475644	Chrono Trigger And the current number one game of all time, according to people who have emailed, Big Rigs.
9477201	9479823	Rock Band is the number one game of all time.
9479983	9484546	But if you consider that music game fans is our roots, I'm not surprised.
9485146	9490830	But if you would disagree, here's your chance to send in your list to make Super Metroid number one so it gets a little higher.
9490990	9492552	Why the fuck is Pokemon on there?
9494073	9495574	I don't like Pokemon.
9495614	9496154	So there you go.
9496334	9498236	If you disagree, again, get those lists in.
9498256	9499096	You have six days left.
9499376	9499677	That's it.
9500337	9501378	Because they're closing the polls.
9501718	9502899	So are you going to send in a list?
9502959	9503619	Your top 25 of all time?
9503639	9504120	Probably not.
9505049	9507350	I already know my... I'm secure in my decision.
9507951	9509432	My top five games of all time.
9509612	9511613	I don't need to validate it.
9511913	9513054	Alright, just stuck up, bitch.
9513134	9515015	Alright, that's going to do it for the emails.
9515175	9520598	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send your own email in for reading.
9521359	9522440	I don't know, Rob.
9522480	9523940	Speak English!
9525097	9527298	Thank God Jamie's not here, I would have just got a fail award.
9527318	9528900	She would have thrown a taco at you.
9529200	9536845	Back to some gaming news, and then we're going to take some calls on the Skype line at 1-877- You mean Victoria's going to take calls?
9536865	9537805	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9537905	9539306	In a little bit, we still have some stories.
9539567	9539847	Loki?
9540867	9546071	This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we'll be getting the brand new game, The Maw.
9547071	9550432	And the Maw is being put out by Twisted Pixels.
9550712	9563695	It's an adventure platformer that places you in the role of Frank, an alien stranded on a strange planet with the Maw, a strange blob-like creature that acts like his only friend and ultimate weapon all at the same time.
9565036	9569257	And let's see, it will be available for 800 Microsoft Points.
9569337	9571397	It will be out on the 21st.
9571597	9573398	And if I remember correctly, I think the Maw was...
9575063	9579688	it was a winner of some award during PAX but I can't remember what it was
9580939	9581219	Oh well.
9581579	9584100	Was it one of those indie games that was featured in the center?
9584120	9584600	Yes, it was.
9585660	9586541	I remember hearing about that.
9586781	9587161	That's cool.
9588761	9589121	Very neat.
9589521	9589901	Awesome.
9590742	9595943	Fable 2, which I'm finally going to get a chance to play this week because Loki helped me get hooked up with a copy of Fable 2.
9596603	9597664	So I'm going to check that out this week.
9597704	9600724	And I know this is a game that DarkSakura has been playing a lot.
9600784	9603945	I haven't seen her on Xbox Live a lot until this game came out.
9604065	9606206	And apparently she's been playing with OLR people and stuff.
9606246	9609407	So I'm going to get on there and finally get to play some Fable 2.
9609447	9610107	You're not a big fan?
9610587	9611167	It's okay.
9611268	9613789	I actually have to go back and play because I want to finish it.
9614549	9615490	It's short.
9615690	9617911	I'm thinking about getting the download content though for it.
9618111	9619212	Then I can start Fallout 3.
9619252	9621974	Or maybe Lost Odyssey.
9621994	9623254	I might have to go back to Lost Odyssey.
9623274	9624635	Well, I think I'm going to check out Fable 2.
9624915	9627557	I might even play it tonight and force Victoria to watch some of it with me.
9627937	9628357	But we'll see.
9630739	9631139	Victoria?
9631159	9632059	I just caught Victoria's attention.
9632280	9633660	I'm going to play some Fable 2 tonight.
9633760	9634321	It's a video game.
9635570	9637191	She's going, yippee.
9637331	9638131	You'll have my laptop.
9638151	9640352	You can chat with your hoes on AOL.
9640372	9640852	You'll be fine.
9640892	9646474	You can marry people of the same sex or have multiple husbands and wives.
9647114	9651395	I've been watching Sauce, or Tiara, whatever you want to call her.
9651455	9652756	She's been on this show a couple times.
9652796	9655837	I've been watching her tweets that have been updating us on the progress of her.
9655997	9657157	It sounds like she's having a lot of fun.
9657457	9660778	I think she has two husbands and a wife and a child named Optimus Prime.
9661258	9662859	So I want to check this out.
9662879	9663019	Wow.
9664318	9669943	So, anyhow, speaking of Fable 2, the download content, not Whole Island, finally came out.
9670423	9674807	Apparently, there's a weapon in it called HAL's Rifle.
9675728	9679731	The funny thing about it, it looks exactly like the assault rifle from Halo.
9680231	9680552	Get it?
9681012	9681432	HAL?
9681953	9682393	Halo?
9683794	9688799	59 damage per shot, 24 shots per clip, and it has an empty augment slot.
9688819	9692702	So, basically, they kind of made a little Halo lol joke in the download content.
9693735	9694395	Hey, lol.
9696096	9696336	Nice.
9697497	9700298	Redertainment says, Sky, why are you forcing Victoria to do things?
9700358	9701378	What is she, your girlfriend?
9702579	9704059	No, but kind of.
9704079	9706080	I mean, she's like one of my hags.
9706180	9707861	And she has to crash here all weekend.
9708581	9710482	I've got two of my hags here tonight.
9710522	9711162	I'm very special.
9711182	9715864	It's the least I could do for him letting me stay here and not sleep in my car.
9717699	9719619	It's the least that she can do as his hag.
9719739	9722240	We have hag duties, you know, that we have to do.
9722440	9723680	And this is some of it.
9724521	9725181	What did they say?
9725641	9731042	If the hag don't like you, the fag... If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you.
9731062	9732482	But that goes the other way around, too.
9733803	9734043	It does.
9734603	9736883	I have to approve if anyone Victoria or Irene dates.
9737083	9737543	This is true.
9738264	9738884	I have to approve.
9739264	9740324	Pretty much.
9741524	9744885	Well, don't ask that on the radio, for God's sake.
9746913	9748695	If I didn't, I would have said something already.
9749555	9753078	And you, Irene, have been your man a long time.
9753138	9754199	I've been with my man.
9754459	9757201	So if I disapproved, I would have said something a long time ago.
9757361	9758762	You would have bitch slapped the shit out of him.
9758782	9759683	I would have bitch slapped you.
9760403	9763706	Alright, because Irene makes no qualms if she dislikes somebody I'm dating.
9763726	9766688	Yes, we know.
9767909	9773973	Now he was saying that she wants to get a second wife to do all the cleaning and cooking because she doesn't do any of that.
9774273	9774634	You should.
9774654	9774914	You should.
9776926	9778747	Alright, anyhow, I'm sorry, we got derailed.
9778847	9781228	Matt, if you become a gay man, that will be easy.
9781248	9783749	Because you'll get a bunch of hags who will do that for you.
9784209	9785409	Why can't I have straight hags?
9786130	9788271	Because there's no such thing as a straight hag.
9788311	9788971	Are you ridiculous?
9788991	9790491	Well, I am going to pioneer this.
9790511	9792572	You can't have your cake and eat it too, Matt.
9792592	9793633	Yes, I can.
9794053	9795393	What else do you do with cake?
9795473	9796674	You should take applications.
9798223	9799824	Loki, you have a radio show.
9800104	9802464	You should solicit applications for some straight hags.
9802744	9807906	Nah, because, see, street hags, that's actual real hags, and no one likes real hags.
9809667	9812227	You should just put on the application, four-toothed minimum.
9812368	9813588	No fat chicks.
9816943	9817204	All right.
9817584	9822229	Anyways, SSJ100Matt says, Loki needs to find a girl who's into airsoft.
9822470	9822910	Wait a minute, though.
9822930	9824172	We're not trying to set him up on a date.
9824232	9825994	He's very happily married.
9826054	9827035	Him and Nellie get along fabulously.
9827055	9829698	He just wants a maid that works for free.
9830959	9831619	Thanks for watching!
9848286	9852389	for Nellie to nag so that she gets it out of her system before you get home.
9852669	9855291	Oh, thank God.
9855411	9856492	That would be awesome.
9858473	9861856	Speaking of the airsoft stuff... It doesn't even have to be a woman.
9862176	9864538	I haven't been good when it comes to the airsoft stuff.
9866176	9870679	I think that, sorry, OLR Studio Drama, you know how we tape in the garage basically, very thin wall.
9870979	9873321	I think I can hear the neighbor like yelling at a dog or something.
9873421	9874822	We can hear it all the way here in the garage.
9875082	9877304	Oh my god, I hope he's not throwing his weed out.
9877504	9880426	I think somebody just threw a taco across the street at the dog.
9880506	9880726	Really?
9880766	9881227	I'll be back.
9881587	9881927	Alright.
9882548	9882848	Anyways.
9883863	9884303	I'm hungry.
9884923	9885383	Sorry, Loki.
9885404	9886384	Back to game news here.
9887104	9897987	We talked about last week how there was a game that possibly will get removed off of the App Store relatively soon if Nintendo caught wind of it, and that was the Game & Watch game.
9898007	9899728	Well, now there's another Nintendo game.
9899888	9901909	Duck Hunt is now available for $1.
9901969	9903809	Damn, I forgot to download the Game & Watch game.
9904209	9904509	Shit.
9905250	9905550	Oh, no.
9905590	9907750	Well, I don't know if it's... It might still be up there.
9908030	9909511	I mean, you just better check.
9911712	9914815	Duck Hunt is available now for a dollar.
9915576	9916697	One dollar.
9916957	9917958	Yes, one dollar.
9918798	9921180	And you have everything in the game.
9921341	9923222	Ducks and no annoying dog.
9923883	9925744	You move the cursor around and shoot ducks.
9927105	9927966	All for a dollar.
9928246	9928927	All for a dollar.
9929467	9930008	What a bargain.
9932110	9934712	But the laughing dog isn't in it, so what the hell's the point?
9936199	9937380	You shoot ducks.
9937681	9940323	Well, you know, maybe they didn't like the dog.
9941545	9943807	So, you know, who cares?
9943887	9948191	Hence the reason he prefaced that statement with annoying.
9948211	9952455	Alright, sorry, I'm looking for the Game & Watch games right now to see if they're there.
9952475	9953116	I don't think they're there.
9953156	9953977	What was the name of it?
9956191	9958191	Um... Crap.
9959192	9961173	I searched for Game & Watch and didn't find anything.
9961233	9962733	Here, just one second.
9962793	9963634	I can find it for you.
9963874	9967475	It is... It's not called Game & Watch.
9967535	9970156	It's called... Alright, you look while I talk about the next story.
9970176	9970696	Here it is.
9970896	9974758	It's GW Chef, GW Parachute, GW Fire.
9974778	9975758	Just look for GW.
9975798	9977079	GW, thank you.
9977239	9981521	Alright, I'll look at that after I read you this story because this is pretty exciting, okay?
9982501	9983441	I love the Commodore 64.
9984482	9985582	Didn't you love the Commodore 64?
9985802	9986602	Some of it, yeah.
9986742	9991044	Do you remember, if I start talking this, you are standing in front of a White House.
9991444	9992624	There is a mailbox here.
9992884	9994105	Is that Zork?
9994405	9995085	It is Zork!
9995285	9996286	Exactly right.
9996546	9998026	You have been eaten by a Gru.
9998406	9999407	Oh, I knew you were going to do that.
9999707	10004268	Okay, and obviously Zork actually had a couple other games that came out later, like Zork Grand Inquisitor.
10004288	10005869	They were kind of cute, funny games.
10006369	10009750	Well, apparently Zork is coming back as an MMO.
10010816	10010976	What?
10011096	10012397	Legends of Zork.
10012998	10013778	Wiggity what?
10014178	10017180	Joel Online is resurrecting the Zork franchise.
10017240	10018701	It's a game called Legends of Zork.
10018761	10021063	It's a casual browser-based MMO.
10022004	10029549	I don't think it's up just yet, but they actually were interviewed by Grandma Sutra recently, and they have mentioned that the game is going to feature microtransactions.
10029849	10032190	You can play it on the computer or the iPhone.
10032871	10033631	So that's kind of cool.
10034112	10034472	Sweet.
10034592	10035773	So there you go.
10035793	10036654	What are you so upset about?
10036674	10038615	My phone just died.
10038855	10038975	Oh.
10038995	10039836	Victoria's phone died.
10039856	10040256	Big drama.
10040848	10042349	Maybe we could bring it back to life.
10043590	10046892	I'm wondering how fast it's going to be before people get eaten by a Gru.
10047192	10047593	Yeah.
10047913	10049294	I want to push Irene in front of a Gru.
10049354	10049894	No.
10050554	10055238	I'm going to push you off the edge of something from Impossible Mission.
10055558	10057579	No.
10057699	10060681	I almost did that for the classic game tonight, but it was Loki's turn.
10060701	10061962	Oh my gosh, I love that game so much.
10061982	10062522	It was Loki's turn.
10062683	10066625	And I actually found another Commodore 64 game I wanted to do first before Impossible Mission.
10066745	10070668	You need to get the sound bites from that game and use it like sometimes in here.
10071095	10074218	Stay a while, stay forever.
10074438	10074999	Hold on a minute.
10075499	10079644	I love that game so much, but I couldn't ever play it because I was only like 10.
10082006	10085129	You know, I never realized what it was he was saying in the beginning of the game.
10085389	10086450	Another visitor.
10086851	10089193	Yeah.
10090034	10093617	Stay a while, stay forever.
10095393	10095653	Anyhow.
10095953	10097034	What else does he say?
10097354	10099075	Get him my robots or something.
10099115	10099395	Shut up.
10099435	10100495	Let's move on to the next story.
10101276	10102876	Two more stories before we open up the sky blind.
10103917	10104157	Hurry.
10104317	10104477	Go.
10104557	10104737	Do it.
10105898	10106238	Loki.
10107438	10109959	Well, there's other fun stuff.
10109979	10112340	We talked about Klonoa coming out on the Wii.
10113141	10115502	It's actually been out on the Wii already in Japan.
10115702	10120464	And, of course, will be coming out over here pretty soon, actually.
10120584	10124706	It's been announced that sometime in 2009 it will be available.
10125521	10126803	or possibly April.
10128625	10129426	Then it might move.
10129546	10129986	Who knows?
10130367	10131028	April 4th.
10131849	10132890	No, not April 4th.
10133190	10133671	Why not?
10134632	10136174	It's a great day to release stuff.
10138590	10139171	April 4th.
10140452	10143676	And, you know, when these games come out, you can rent them at Game.
10144277	10144718	That's right.
10144858	10147161	Game is not here in the US.
10147201	10149043	So if you're looking confused, like, what the hell is Game?
10149323	10154991	It's actually a big competitor for the GameStop EB behemoth over in Europe, and it's also in Australia and parts of Asia.
10156292	10161717	They actually are only in the business of selling new and used games right now, but soon they are going to rent games.
10161757	10171986	They partnered up with a group called Swap Game, so they're going to be offering folks over in the UK the option of paying a monthly subscription fee that will allow them to rent two games at a time.
10172386	10173627	Like a GameStop employee.
10174788	10176730	Yeah, interesting business model, though.
10176990	10178651	Do you think that's going to make them a lot of money?
10179332	10181274	Rental, it couldn't hurt.
10181894	10183816	I mean, I think it, well...
10185071	10185331	Why not?
10185371	10186532	A lot of those sites are making money.
10186632	10190794	If they're going to do a mail service where they're going to mail out the games or something, I don't know.
10190854	10194615	I was just thinking that if I ever opened up a game store, I'd want to name it Store.
10194635	10198517	You know, because let's just get it as broad as possible.
10198717	10199197	Store.
10199278	10201759	Good luck getting any new releases, though, from a place like this.
10201839	10210603	You know, I always wondered, like, because movie rental stores always rent games, but it never made sense that game stores never rented games.
10210743	10210903	Like...
10211363	10211603	GameCrazy.com
10231283	10231984	Yeah, I don't know.
10232024	10235427	I think of GameCrazy as not like an independent thing.
10235467	10238270	I think of them as like part of Hollywood video.
10238470	10238670	Yeah.
10238871	10240652	I mean, you know, that's a movie.
10241293	10251343	And GameStop wouldn't do it because they would cut into their used game sales because, you know, why bother paying $30 for, you know, a $40 game or something like that when they can rent it for $7 and beat it?
10253344	10258227	They could still do the buybacks of the used games and then rent out those games as a buyback.
10258267	10260308	And besides, those games they consider new.
10260648	10261968	Remember, they put a little sticker on them.
10262128	10262689	I want to say this.
10262909	10267271	Misty in chat says it sounds more immediate than Gamefly if it weren't a mail-based return system.
10267551	10268131	And that's true.
10268471	10270232	And some people don't like to do the mail thing.
10270252	10279176	I mean, Netflix is huge, but they're still blockbuster because sometimes, you know, just like even last night, Victoria was over, I was here, bored, done with WoW, let's watch a movie.
10280257	10280577	But
10281297	10281577	Game Rentals
10309531	10312614	available over Xbox Live or something like that.
10312634	10314996	You download the game and you have it for seven days or something.
10315476	10316897	Probably just a matter of time.
10318198	10322061	If they could make money off renting the game then selling the game, that would be amazing.
10322642	10324684	That would be a smart business move.
10324724	10324924	Next.
10326618	10342751	Alright, that's it for stories tonight We're going to get into some last minute stories But first we want to take your calls on the Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you have the Skype program and want to talk to us that way Let's go to the phone and take some calls Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10343631	10345132	Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?
10345192	10346293	Hey, not much, how you doing Ranma?
10347434	10351958	I'm doing good So I've got a couple of things I want to discuss Alright
10353214	10355197	I got a quick question for you, though.
10355237	10357982	When was the last time you bought EGM?
10369809	10387234	about a couple of months ago I still had a subscription okay that's cool I'm just curious because I bet there's some people that are sad you know I was sad to see EGM go but I haven't bought it in like 10 years you know what I mean so but I'm just kind of curious on what side of the fence you're on there so you were still a regular reader of it so okay you're sad to see it go
10387950	10388550	Yeah, pretty much.
10388650	10392111	It was that, Die Hard, Game Fan, and GamePro.
10392151	10395772	Those were the three magazines I read all throughout high school.
10395792	10396472	That was it for me.
10396652	10397633	Isn't GamePro still around?
10398393	10402154	Yeah, that's still around, but Die Hard, Game Fan died after like two or three years.
10402274	10408256	I love that because at the time, it was the only magazine available that had an in-depth review about import video games.
10410945	10412906	Weird, obscure fact about GamePro.
10412926	10413687	I've got to say this.
10413727	10414688	This is what a nerd I am.
10414888	10416489	I don't know if you remember way back in the day.
10416549	10418450	If you read GamePro for a long time, you'll remember this.
10419111	10433520	A long, long time ago, they had a contest to get, I think it was 250 people, or maybe it was 50 or 250 people that were going to be part of an exclusive club that would get to write reviews for games or something like that for possible inclusion in the magazine or something.
10433540	10434881	This was a long time ago, so bear with me.
10435141	10436062	But this is what I remember.
10436122	10439044	I was in the fourth grade or fifth grade or something, and I wrote in a letter.
10439444	10440425	I got picked as one of them.
10441205	10441465	Nice.
10441505	10442846	Wow, in fourth grade.
10442946	10444027	But they never did anything with it.
10444907	10445868	Boo.
10446608	10451191	I never got anything else other than the letter that said, you know, congratulations, you got selected, and then they never did anything with it.
10451791	10452892	So, it's just funny.
10453132	10453712	Sorry, just a rant.
10453913	10455353	Whenever I think of GamePro, I think of that.
10455514	10456374	Wow.
10456654	10459776	From when I was like, maybe it was a little late, like sixth grade, but I was young.
10459836	10460396	I know I was young.
10460717	10461157	Dork.
10464279	10464999	Yeah, kind of sad.
10465279	10470002	But, you know, some of those magazines are still around, but I sadly don't think this will be the last one to fold.
10471892	10482935	Well, I wouldn't be surprised if any more fold because, honestly, I mean, as many video gaming sites there are, it's getting to the point where it's like video gaming industry with news and stuff is getting very saturated.
10482955	10490776	It's like every other site someone has a video game review site or blog or something like that, whereas me, I'm on the opposite spectrum for what I cover.
10490796	10492497	It's kind of hard to get that kind of information.
10492897	10495598	Yeah.
10495618	10496598	What else did you want to talk about tonight?
10497469	10500350	You know, I have a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I totally forgot.
10500490	10503710	But I will do a brief review about The Last Remnant.
10503750	10505251	It's a game I just picked up yesterday.
10505531	10506191	Ah, yes, please do.
10507271	10517074	Basically, it plays like Final Fantasy XII, but when it comes to the battle sequences, it turns into a complete tactical-style game, which I'm really enjoying a lot.
10518314	10518594	Really?
10518614	10519414	What about the story?
10520314	10523315	I've heard kind of mixed reviews on this game, so I'm kind of curious.
10524488	10540696	If I remember correctly, the story is about a brother and sister who are going to meet up with their parents, but the sister is kidnapped, and he goes through his travels to find his sister, and you're discovering what these last remnants are, or these relics, for all types of different types of power that you can get.
10542257	10542517	Hmm.
10544558	10551842	And right now, I'm like four or five hours in, and just like a regular tactics game, if you're not fully prepared, you will get killed on the first quest.
10553443	10553983	Interesting.
10556771	10561932	So is this something for like a hardcore tactical game fan only or can anyone get into it or what?
10562933	10563453	It's like this.
10563513	10572515	If you're not really into tactics games but there are some tactical games that are very simple and you want something simple like that, this would be a good game to pick up.
10572555	10577196	But to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't pay the $59.99 retail price tag for it.
10577676	10578836	I got it on sale for $39.
10579036	10581717	I would say when you see it for $39, then pick it up then.
10583017	10583377	Gotcha.
10584438	10585378	Yeah, definitely.
10586070	10588151	Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
10588812	10590373	Now I remember one more thing and I'll get out of here.
10590413	10590613	Yes.
10590713	10595416	Remember a long time ago I sent in a letter, an email about which games I should get for my 360?
10597237	10599999	Um... Yes, I think so.
10600239	10603641	Yeah, I actually picked up each of the games that you guys recommended for me.
10604982	10605383	Oh, really?
10606003	10607304	I finally got around to doing so.
10609845	10610806	Um, what did you think?
10611747	10612007	Okay...
10613305	10614725	BlueDragon I'm still playing.
10614765	10615725	I really enjoy that.
10615905	10621126	Loving Saints Row and I'm loving Crackdown and Marvel Ultimate Alliance is definitely a fun party game.
10623627	10625007	Cool, cool.
10625047	10625347	Well, good.
10625367	10626667	I'm glad our reviews did some good.
10628048	10628728	You guys are awesome.
10628748	10629328	What can I tell you?
10629868	10630628	Oh, I do love you.
10630668	10631928	It's almost like we pay you to say that.
10633649	10634809	Just wait until you come out here again.
10636049	10636369	Alright.
10636629	10637829	Hey, hopefully soon.
10638049	10640490	It is one of my goals for 09 to get back to New York City.
10640530	10641950	It just probably won't happen until later in the year.
10642861	10643542	We'll be waiting.
10643822	10644563	Alright, have a good one.
10645144	10645404	Alright.
10646145	10646426	Later.
10646526	10646826	Bye.
10646866	10647607	Bye, Ranma.
10649630	10650872	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10650892	10651252	Who's this?
10652074	10653596	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
10653636	10656720	It is Jason coming to you with one less tooth in his mouth.
10656912	10662794	Well, hey, I know we've both been having dental drama this week, except yours sounds a little more severe, so I'm really sorry to hear it.
10662814	10667355	Yeah, mine went a little bit crazy, but my mouth's been fine ever since Thursday.
10668055	10669175	That's what it's all about, then.
10669475	10670476	So, isn't it the worst?
10670496	10672616	Alright, I don't want to think about my mouth, because then it's just going to hurt more.
10673997	10677878	By the way, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen what Deakman's done for the OLR beta?
10678398	10679358	Yeah, he was giving it to me.
10679738	10682359	He showed me the link just a couple minutes ago, and I was...
10683320	10683940	and Run with it.
10684000	10686981	It's a lot more attractive pretty instantly, I gotta say.
10687101	10687841	I know, I know.
10687901	10688742	He did a nice job.
10688902	10695524	I gotta get you kids to work together behind the scenes to help make it happen so we can launch the new website because I'm all excited now.
10697805	10699265	Anyhow, we gotta show it to Jamie though.
10699305	10701726	She's not here tonight to give it her okay, but she'll love it too.
10701766	10702146	I know she will.
10703206	10708548	There's not gonna be... How can you look at the current site and go, oh, the current site's better.
10708888	10709668	You really can't.
10709688	10710909	And the new site's pretty awesome.
10711569	10711849	I cannot
10712009	10712610	I can agree with that.
10735809	10736290	Pac-Man?
10736670	10738471	No, he changed it, I think, to a Space Invader now.
10739072	10739372	Oh, okay.
10739392	10747378	Because somebody else uses a little... Like, the Pac-Man is right next to this little radio-looking thing, and it looks way too similar to another show's logo.
10747458	10749280	So I was like, eh, we don't want to do that.
10749380	10750861	So we don't want to ruffle any feathers.
10750901	10753924	So I suggested a Space Invader, and I guess he ran with it.
10753964	10754964	I haven't seen the new logo yet.
10755064	10756586	Anyway... I just completely lost you.
10756646	10758107	Don't tell me I just completely lost you.
10758427	10759968	Well, we'll open up... No, I'm here.
10760028	10760289	Hello?
10761449	10761870	Can you hear us?
10763735	10765516	Are we having internet issues going on?
10766097	10767898	Yes, I blame you and nobody else.
10768238	10769279	I did not dump him.
10769359	10776545	Anyway, Jason, if you can hear me, why don't you tell us what you really called in for tonight before I hijacked website talk.
10777525	10778486	You can't hear me now, right?
10778506	10779567	Yeah, there's my echo.
10780628	10781908	Okay, two questions.
10782349	10783930	Yes.
10784490	10788473	This is a question from Ryan, but she's too shy to get on the microphone because she's like that.
10789674	10791836	How long did EGM 2 last?
10793388	10793889	EGM2!
10793989	10795450	That's right!
10795470	10797912	They had a spin-off magazine for a little while, didn't they?
10798592	10800174	That's retarded.
10800254	10801014	No, I remember.
10801375	10809161	Famitsu was a weekly magazine, so they felt, I think for a short time there, that there was going to be like... Didn't EGM2 come out in the middle of the month or something?
10809522	10810322	To offset it?
10811263	10812864	I never... She had it.
10813305	10814326	FYI, you went off the air again.
10814366	10815747	It was not very long.
10815827	10816567	Maybe a year.
10816968	10817548	Maybe a year.
10819150	10819330	So...
10820782	10822964	Just ignore the complaints about the stream in chat, Jason.
10822984	10824265	We're going to just keep going with the show.
10824505	10828168	I have it in the background, and I noticed a very specific loop.
10829189	10829670	Sorry about that.
10829690	10830670	So about a year.
10831151	10831571	I think.
10832012	10832352	I don't know.
10832392	10833353	I'm definitely not the source.
10833913	10834193	Let's see.
10834273	10834534	Oh, no.
10834634	10834974	Here we go.
10835434	10839198	EGM2 ran from July 1994 to July 1998.
10839298	10841379	So it was actually four years.
10841620	10842080	Wow.
10843061	10843942	I was way off.
10844850	10850714	She had a subscription to both and I've never heard of it but she wanted to know so I am making you people do it for me.
10851055	10851675	There you have it.
10852315	10856218	I got that from Wikipedia and I believe everything I read on Wikipedia so there you go.
10856278	10858100	That's just because I'm older than Jason.
10860782	10861182	Thank you.
10862213	10863034	Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams.
10863094	10864256	It's apparently something on the PS2.
10864776	10864896	What?
10881242	10883243	They released a little later on.
10883323	10886084	I don't know if it was on the PS2, but there was two versions of Silent Hill 2.
10886665	10892787	The second version, Restless Dreams, has an additional scenario where, don't you play as Maria or something?
10893448	10894268	It's really short.
10894368	10894868	It's short.
10894988	10895789	It's not a lot.
10895849	10897329	It's not like you're getting a whole second game.
10897649	10902111	It's just like another little quick scenario that just gives some additional insight to the story.
10902512	10906493	So it was like a little bonus disc add-on that they released slightly later.
10906513	10906733	You got it.
10906753	10907834	Like a bonus chapter.
10907874	10909254	I wouldn't even think of it as a full game.
10909295	10910195	It's very short.
10910215	10910295	Yeah.
10910515	10911636	It's not even really a game.
10911676	10914238	I don't even think you really do much.
10914298	10915479	You do one thing and that's it.
10915599	10919082	Restless Dreams, I believe, was originally for the Xbox expansion.
10919402	10922545	And then I think they re-released it on the PS2 with the Restless Dreams thing.
10922585	10923065	Interesting.
10926542	10950870	I went through and I replayed all the Metal Gear Solids and then that led up to the time that we got the PS3 and I played Metal Gear Solid 4 all the way through and our next run through series is Silent Hill and I'm barring the dental madness I've been playing through Silent Hill 1 and I think I might be finishing that off tonight and since obviously Silent Hill 2 is the next one in line and I came across that I had never heard of it before
10952915	10954304	You'll like Silent Hill 2 a lot!
10957310	10985031	She was wondering if we were just going to skip the first one and as much as I want to because the game plays like hell and it really looks really bad I don't know if it's the PS2 doing something back in Pat but it has some really weird effects on our TV We were both thinking of just skipping the first one but she doesn't remember much of it and I fell asleep through some of it when I wasn't the one who played it in the first place so I kind of wanted to go through it the whole way and see it
10985471	10988055	I'm admittedly using a walkthrough all the way through it.
10988335	10992039	So that hint system is actually viable to some situations, Loki.
10992340	11002092	Yeah, I'm cheating all the way through it, but I'm getting the entire story in the manner it was supposed to be presented to me.
11003362	11023396	and I'm playing the game to some extent so that's kind of enough for me nice yeah yeah and you want to play through one because it's not necessary but it's good to play through one when you play through three because it'll kind of give some insight into three's story also so I watched Silent Hill the movie what do I need to play the game for because it's
11024545	11029487	Because if you're like Victoria, you'll think it's crap unless you give some insight to the series.
11030007	11034509	Alright, I have to admit, if I'd never played the games, I would have thought the movie was kind of random.
11034709	11035709	You know what I mean?
11035769	11037210	What the hell is this pyramid thing?
11037470	11040171	Really, the movie was made for the fans.
11040811	11043252	I really wish they would do this sequel.
11043732	11044593	On that same line.
11045653	11047974	One of the better video game movies, amazingly enough.
11048014	11050155	My favorite video game movie, I ain't even gonna lie.
11050535	11051875	I kind of want to watch it right now.
11052276	11053336	I do too, I've been wanting
11053496	11055738	We should go get it on Blu-ray and then watch it.
11056178	11057079	Is it on Netflix?
11057099	11059381	Because then we could party watch it or something like that.
11059401	11060922	They don't have that built in yet.
11060942	11063684	I don't think they have that feature built in yet.
11065206	11069409	We'd call each other and try to press play at the same time and do it that way or something.
11069469	11069849	I don't know.
11070190	11070810	That'd be fun.
11071150	11074293	Do it on Justin.TV or something.
11074613	11075554	Jason, we've got to let you go.
11075794	11076835	Take some more calls.
11078016	11079417	Thank you for all you do for the website too.
11079437	11080318	Between you and Deakman...
11080978	11083679	2009 is going to be the best year ever for our website.
11083739	11084199	I'm so excited.
11084219	11084999	I sure as hell hope so.
11085039	11085720	It's been long enough.
11086220	11092122	I am so excited because I'm all jazzed to write again for the website and I know TR has been wanting to do reviews.
11092162	11095082	We're actually going to have a functional website and I'm so excited I could tinkle.
11095263	11095863	You're jazzed.
11096883	11098103	Alright, so we're going to let you go, Jason.
11098404	11107206	Give me a month to move as we're closing on Tuesday and then I'll do my best to be really on top of it.
11107466	11108006	You got it, buddy.
11109207	11109687	Alright, take care.
11110410	11111331	See you.
11111351	11111751	Bye.
11113132	11113393	All right.
11113433	11115234	Dang, we got calls coming in back to back.
11115314	11118057	I think this is going to be the last one, though, because we're running kind of long tonight.
11118097	11119037	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
11119057	11119398	Who's this?
11121058	11121518	It's GS68.
11144491	11151153	So about the whole hint system of how the game pretty much plays for you, there's always something like that in arcade games.
11151253	11152613	It's called unlimited continues.
11154554	11157055	Yeah, but you have to feed it a quarter every time you want to continue.
11158755	11164637	Well, but at home, if you have free play, you just keep pressing start and you eventually get to the end of the game.
11164977	11166337	I mean, no need to use any skill.
11166798	11171279	Like playing the Ninja Turtles game on the Xbox, you can just get all the continues you want?
11172403	11174829	Yeah, or unlocking free play in Ikaruga.
11176199	11177820	You can even just let the bosses time out.
11178720	11192907	That's true, but you know, I also think of the old, you know what you're talking about, kind of reminds me of, could anyone, and I gotta ask Loki this, I've gotta ask Loki this, could you actually beat Contra on the NES without up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start?
11192967	11193688	No, it's fucking hard.
11194528	11198650	But that's the point, though, you have to be good at it to, it can be done.
11199250	11202032	It's just that, you know, I need to play it more.
11202984	11206387	I need to play more to be able to learn the patterns and that kind of stuff.
11206767	11208008	And that's the whole point.
11208148	11210209	It shouldn't be just like, oh, look at this.
11210610	11213532	Because even when we did that, we still didn't beat it.
11213652	11214813	It was fucking hard.
11215994	11216454	I don't know.
11216494	11223379	The continue system was kind of an antiquated method to have gamers feed quarters into the machine.
11223399	11224060	That's the whole point.
11224080	11229724	You have to start all over again, unless you put it in a quarter, and then it just carried over onto consoles.
11229744	11230604	That's what people were used to.
11230624	11231325	I suppose it's like,
11233897	11242879	I don't know if the internet is acting up again, but you're kind of cutting in a little bit in and out.
11242899	11244139	So go ahead and say what you wanted to say.
11244159	11250460	I was going to bring up DJ Max Black Square, which I got this week.
11263440	11265701	Um, it's alright, I guess.
11265821	11273624	I mean, the songs are pretty good, and they're pretty hard, but I hate the club tour mood, because some of the missions are, like, really stupid hard.
11274324	11277166	And then one feature, and then there's two other features that really piss me off.
11277986	11284128	One, sometimes, the... Andy just dropped.
11284629	11285149	Oh, no, you there?
11285789	11287410	Is this, I'm gonna ask real quick.
11287690	11289050	We're having these weird problems tonight.
11289271	11292812	Is this the American version that you're talking about, or is this the new one that came out in Korea?
11293985	11294265	Korea.
11295486	11295927	Oh, my bad.
11296127	11296647	Okay, I didn't know.
11298289	11304854	Yeah, basically sometimes the music will cut out and continue, but it will lag really badly.
11306715	11308216	Or it'll lag like a few seconds.
11310919	11313761	Are there any crazy-ass videos like there were in the earlier games?
11318305	11321307	Sure, the physics in the office is all the correct feature.
11321507	11322448	Basically, if you press...
11323482	11330067	I wonder why they don't do DJ Max on the DS They are, and it is the arcade one that they don't do on the DS Arcade one, like, sometimes
11355014	11358797	DJ Max One of my friends is really into it and keeps begging me to check it out, so I probably will at some point.
11374211	11396782	at least when it comes out in America but I do want to try this arcade version that's at Sunnyvale Golfland hopefully it's not gone I guess GS68 was saying in chat earlier that it looks like it's probably going to be gone by the time I get there so that would suck because I guess it's in this weird beta test or whatever so we'll see anyhow Loki do you have any last minute stories for us before we wrap up the show yes that's what I've been doing
11398533	11399253	Some interesting ones.
11399373	11403234	Apple has actually rejected a game from Yut Saito.
11404074	11406375	You remember him from the Seaman series.
11406935	11408975	Well, he had a game coming out.
11408995	11414376	I think it was like Seaman 2 on the iPhone.
11414756	11416217	It was Gabo.
11416577	11420077	It was a spiritual successor to Seaman, but with a caveman instead.
11421478	11428079	Unfortunately, they said due to unpleasant gameplay, they axed the game and they're not allowed to put it on the App Store.
11429133	11430053	I heard about that.
11430873	11434894	There's a lot of crap on the App Store, so I'm kind of surprised, actually.
11434974	11436215	Which is why apples suck.
11437615	11438835	You just had to work that in there, didn't you?
11438855	11439336	Yes, I did.
11440596	11443977	This isn't really a gaming story, but it has a game addict with it.
11444317	11456540	Apparently, there's a game addict in Beijing who was 23 years old and was rushed to a hospital after swallowing five pieces of saw blades in order to attempt to commit suicide.
11457760	11466064	and apparently he had been talking incoherently about how to win his favorite computer games after being sent to a Beijing hospital ICU.
11466184	11473187	Yeah, that was another one of those cases where he was a gamer and that's about the extent that it was related to video games.
11473407	11475087	This guy had issues way beyond video games.
11475107	11478149	Well, I just want to talk about swallowing saw blades and that was kind of neat.
11478269	11479469	That's pretty extreme.
11479489	11481030	That's pretty extreme, I'll give you that.
11482196	11483656	House of the Dead Overkill
11500762	11519712	1299 euros or pounds or something like that I think it's euros and it's um part of they're also going to have a big bang box um set that's going to have both that and uh two of those guns which they're calling the hand cannons and they look like pretty sweet guns so that's kind of cool um
11521383	11522664	And this is pretty big news.
11523224	11527087	Final Fantasy XIII is coming to Japan in 2009.
11527747	11532651	Of course, we'll be making it out overseas and everywhere else April 2010.
11533471	11537494	So April 2010 is the earliest that we'll see Final Fantasy XIII.
11538014	11546060	However, I hope that we'll see it a lot sooner because I will be importing the Blu-ray Special Edition for Advent Children.
11546120	11547421	I want that so bad, but...
11548717	11550717	If we have to wait until 2010, then we have to wait until 2010.
11550757	11551718	I guess it's not surprising.
11551758	11552758	It's just a little disappointing.
11554018	11558519	Especially because we do these things on the OLR forums, the annual predictions.
11559620	11566121	Rob with 2Bees does this thread every year, and he does a really good job tabulating and everything, and everybody makes their predictions for the year, and we see how many of them come true.
11566441	11568342	I've already lost on two of my predictions.
11568462	11570222	I said there'd be a new Rock Band game this year.
11570322	11573843	There's not going to be, they've already said, because of the Beatles game, which makes sense.
11573883	11577584	I should have been smarter and known that, that they don't need a new Rock Band game with the Beatles game.
11578164	11579985	and also now this.
11580085	11585207	I said that Final Fantasy XIII would finally come out this Christmas and now it looks like it's going to be next year.
11585567	11587887	I might get half credit for the Japanese release date though.
11588248	11595270	Yeah, and like I said, I'll try to import the Blu-ray for Advent Children because it's going to have a demo on it.
11596044	11597605	Yeah, I totally wanted to check that out too.
11597645	11598705	I might even import it for that.
11598725	11599425	We'll see.
11599686	11601666	Because the demo is supposed to be like two hours long, they said.
11601686	11602907	Which is pretty crazy.
11603567	11605148	CES09.
11605228	11609029	Microsoft has been... Apparently was talking to somebody.
11611331	11612191	Thanks for watching!
11635001	11643363	and let's see here also there's going to be a special edition Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children PS3 coming out in Japan.
11644083	11650065	It's in cloud black and it's got a nice little symbol there etched into the front of it.
11651165	11653946	It's one of the 160 gigabyte PS3s.
11654046	11661468	It'll also come with it's got a Final Fantasy 13 trail version set which is with
11663960	11665562	The Final Fantasy XIII demo, I guess.
11665642	11668766	And then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Blu-ray Disc Set.
11669326	11671068	Which will be available for 49,980 yen.
11671088	11671969	Approximately $551 US.
11671989	11672390	And... Very cool.
11672430	11672770	And apparently...
11683035	11685440	FFVII Advent Children Complete English Language Options
11694469	11694790	Awesome.
11694910	11695150	Nice.
11697292	11698473	This is some funny stuff.
11698553	11703057	Duke Nukem Critical Hour is coming along quite well, says 3D Realms.
11703878	11705920	You may not remember what these are, actually.
11706180	11711505	Critical Hour was the game that they're putting out on the PSP.
11712045	11715068	It's a new game trilogy, I guess.
11715629	11718731	They're also having some on the DS as well.
11719571	11723886	But all I have to say is, finish Duke Nukem forever first!
11723986	11725892	Stop going on to new things!
11726906	11729587	Finish one, then you get to work on new games.
11751401	11759749	and then the last thing EA is prepping a new game called Spore Hero and of course it will be related to Spore it's coming out on Wii and DS alright
11760501	11760761	Awesome.
11761662	11766343	We're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then and get everybody's final thought and get on out of here.
11766384	11770245	Unfortunately, our stream is crashing left and right and we're starting to lose listeners because of it.
11770325	11773587	So I think that's a sign that we've probably been running too long.
11773607	11774927	So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.
11775247	11777308	But first, we're going to go get around everybody's final thought.
11777328	11780489	But I do want to say thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.
11780609	11783771	If you've enjoyed what you've heard, please tell two friends about our show.
11783991	11788713	It's how we spread the word about our show and get it out there, the little program that we do.
11789133	11790774	I'm Victoria and I'm young and I'm single and I'm sexy I'm beautiful
11802407	11808491	and giving her opinion and everything, especially in the first part of the show, although she started to tune out during the second half of the show.
11808511	11808992	Shut up.
11810252	11811734	So thank you, Victoria.
11812454	11814135	Rice Princess, thank you for being here tonight.
11814475	11814956	Thanks.
11815276	11818258	And you said quite a bit tonight, especially in regards to Nintendo.
11818278	11819559	So thank you for your input as always.
11819959	11820259	Sure.
11820379	11822801	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11822941	11825103	I want to know when the website's going live.
11826021	11827382	The website, I don't know.
11827602	11828903	Don't get too excited.
11828923	11830004	It might not be until next month.
11830044	11833546	I got to make sure Deepman and Jason get it worked out.
11833826	11835547	But we will try to get it up fast.
11836008	11837609	I will do whatever I can to get it working.
11838349	11838990	Okay.
11839430	11839650	All right.
11840351	11841371	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11843233	11843833	It's cold in here.
11844690	11845770	I know, I haven't been running the heater.
11846030	11846691	It's getting cold in here.
11847211	11847451	Sorry.
11847891	11848251	That's all right.
11848891	11852652	And my final thought is I need some Orogel.
11853233	11853833	Wah.
11854173	11854733	Boo-hoo.
11854893	11855293	Cry.
11856033	11856293	All right.
11857054	11857434	That's it.
11857534	11863396	Thank you guys once again for staying with us all night long, especially you live listeners that have suffered through several outages tonight.
11864136	11866557	Thank you guys as always for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.
11866657	11868797	You know we would just not do this if it weren't for you guys.
11869197	11870378	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
11870498	11871238	Have an amazing week.
11871258	11874599	We'll see you again next week with Jamie back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
11874639	11876160	Thank you for watching!
11903958	11904766	See you next week!
