00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Molok.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, January 18, 2009.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Could we see the DSI released in April for the U.S.?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Circuit City goes under.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And are the.hack games set to make a comeback?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are back after a little bit of a break.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Took a little break last week because I was in Hawaii taking a little vacation.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But I'm back now and refreshed and feeling better.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you for the next several hours.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She has the night off. It's her last week before going back to school.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So she's taking care of some things around the house.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But we have somebody filling in tonight.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I called the other woman that I know. The other female gamer I know.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So say hello to Rice Princess.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm your mistress.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right. How you doing, Rice Princess?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, I'm okay. How about yourself?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm doing great.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's good to hear.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see you're wearing a Silent Hill t-shirt showing your love for Pyramid Head.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, because I thought the camera was going to be working tonight.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I did my hair and everything.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, here's the funny thing. I know you look very cute, by the way.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thanks.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I could take a picture and post it to the website or something.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All in vain.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I know. Well, I get to see you and that's important.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, because you're not gay at all.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay. Here's the thing is that I was going to say you and Jamie both have Silent Hill shirts that you wear to the show.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we need to get you both here sometime and you can be twinsies.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are they the same shirt?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, okay.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a slightly different one.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mine's thermal so it keeps me warm.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I see. That's good because we have like a cold garage.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Kind of, yeah.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A little bit.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm going to survive tonight.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right. Well, I'm going to get the heater on in just a minute.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But thank you also for bringing Snickerdoodles to the show.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're welcome.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because you know bribing us with food always freaking rocks.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yep. Always.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All right.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us tonight.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How are you doing, Loki?

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Doing fine.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Great. How was your week off? What did you end up doing?

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Trying to get Grand Theft Auto PC to work.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah?

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's taken a turn for the worst.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's like, I don't know.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was doing so well.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was working just fine.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And all of a sudden, Rockstar's like, ah, fuck this shit.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're not going to work no matter what you do now.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've reinstalled it like eight times now.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I've uninstalled the other things that remotely might be related to it.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it just does not want to work.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And apparently I'm not alone.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And yeah.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, I'm sorry to hear that Grand Theft Auto has not been cooperating with you.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you looking forward to just hacking the game to your heart's content?

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, that's what I was doing.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then it caused the crash.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then I had to reload it or something because it wasn't working correctly.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then it just hasn't worked correctly since.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And there's no reason that it shouldn't be because I just still know.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I give up.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I actually bought this game.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And see, that teaches me for not pirating this shit.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
See what happens?

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If I buy it, it breaks.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And it sucks.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If I had just downloaded it like I should have, wouldn't have this problem.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let that be a lesson to you all.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Seriously.

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, all right.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, hey, you I had tuned in because also last week we missed our buddy Bobby.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Bobby Black Wolf does a show before us here on All Games Radio.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And he does the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sundays.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But he just launched a new Friday night show, right?

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Friday night gaming.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And you tried to play Grand Theft Auto on the first show, right?

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, yeah.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, yeah, that was even more fun.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's see.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, for some reason then Xbox Live said,

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, you're never going to connect to this game ever if you even want to.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I tried four different times.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I even reset my system a few different times.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it just said, No, I'm sorry.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You just cannot connect to this game ever.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So fuck Grand Theft Auto.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And you know, still been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto IV.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All right, there you have it.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto IV, I have to bring this up.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is pretty awesome.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I got to rub this in.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While I was in Hawaii, I got Grand Theft Auto IV for 30 bucks on the Xbox 360.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I got Metal Gear Solid IV for $20 for the PlayStation 3.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Both new and wrapped.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like getting them for $5 in Hawaii.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Kind of.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Really cheap.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Kind of.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Radio Shack, apparently, I had forgotten that they got into the market of selling games.

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But then like when I saw that they were clearing them out,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because I guess I hadn't been performing very well,

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I suddenly remembered, Oh yeah, I think we reported that on the show once,

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is that Radio Shack was selling games.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And not anymore.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, actually I was going to say that Best Buy was clearing out some games as well.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They had Ninja Gaiden 2 for 10 bucks.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For the 360.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Nice.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I wouldn't buy it because I don't have a 360.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You should get one one of these days.

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You really should.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you still on your anti-Microsoft thing?

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I thought you finally caved and you were going to get one.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not anti-Microsoft.

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm just anti-Xbox because it's a piece of crap system.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Geez.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You guys missed it.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Bryce Princess and Loki were getting into it before the show about Nintendo.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Maybe we'll talk about it later.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, well why don't you just tell them what you said

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and I won't even need to do anything because, you know.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was so asinine that, you know.

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We'll get to it later.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've got to introduce someone else because she's been sitting there very quiet and patiently

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
which is so unlike her.

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fuck you.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is that going to be your first words on the show?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, it is going to be your first words on the show.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Fuck you.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Alright, she has never been on the show before.

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But this is Miss Victoria, everybody.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hi guys.

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How are you, Miss Victoria?

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How are you, Miss Victoria?

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm fabulous as always.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's why I decided to call you on the show, Miss Victoria.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, you can call me Miss Victoria.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
See, what I'm doing is I'm advertising that you're single and unmarried.

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, I'm single and unmarried.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, I'm looking, the chat room is going crazy right now for two reasons.

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The earlier, and of course you can always join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
if you want to join us in chat.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The chat's not working on the laptop, so we can't see it.

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Alright, we'll get it working somehow later on.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But, Loki and I can see it.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They're there.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They're freaking out.

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They want pics of Rice Princess.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, I'll try to get something on the Twitter because, you know, OMG woman.

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, I'll try to get, I'll get Rice Princess and Victoria to pose

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and maybe I'll get them to make out a little bit.

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I still have that one jello shot in the refrigerator from New Years.

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Alright, and also they're freaking out because right now in chat,

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
a brand new Orange Lounge, I don't even know the name of my show,

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
a brand new Orange Lounge radio website is being previewed.

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's been made by our buddy Dekeman and he's posted the preview link there in chat

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and it's amazing.

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like, I am so excited that finally our website that looks old

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is going to be going away and looking new.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I am so freaking excited.

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you know why that's why I love our listeners?

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because, it's like, which one is giving them the bigger boner?

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Like, women on the show or the new website layout?

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Like, that's awesome.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alright, alright, back to Victoria.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She's never been on the show before.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We have to interview Victoria a little bit.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
More about me.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's all about you, isn't it?

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Duh.

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright, so what kinds of video games do you like?

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What kinds of video games do you play?

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you play a lot of games?

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's okay if you don't.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't, unfortunately.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I play Rock Band when I come over to your house

195
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and the only video, well, we have a PlayStation 2 at my house

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and my roommate plays Kingdom Hearts,

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but the only thing I play is on my GameCube

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and I play Mario Party 7 because that's the only game I have

199
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
because I stole it from my brother.

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, so she knows a little bit about her game.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She knows what she's talking about.

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So she's got some stuff that she plays.

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Kind of.

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But yet you wear a shirt that says,

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
right now you're wearing a shirt on it that says nerd.

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So you do call yourself a nerd.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What makes you a nerd if you're not much of a gamer?

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm a role player, an online role player.

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Get out.

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, fuck you.

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Get the fuck off this show.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey, I have talent, okay?

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't be jealous.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You just sit in front of a computer and push buttons.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I actually write, bitch.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Alright.

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is it that you write, bitch?

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I'm a Harry Potter role player.

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm a big Harry Potter nerd.

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I admit it.

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm proud of it.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm proud of it.

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Rob, you need to shut the fuck up,

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
because you used to be the vice president of the Star Trek club.

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And what?

229
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like 15 years ago.

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know he has such a boner when the movie is going to come out.

232
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's going to drag my ass to the midnight premiere.

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can already tell you.

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So what exactly do you mean by cos, or like role playing?

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Basically, I take on one of the roles of one of the characters in Harry Potter,

236
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and somebody else takes another role, or they make up their own,

237
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and we just plot.

238
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not like, no, no, no, no, no.

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, no, no, no.

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Basically, that's it.

242
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And we just plot and make our own little storyline.

243
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's glorified fan fiction, basically.

244
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

245
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Alright.

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So you do other nerdy stuff, too, though.

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like, I know you watch Lost religiously.

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
All the time.

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh my god, Wednesday.

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so excited.

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And the thing I love about Victoria is she's so animated.

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is great.

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I've got to read some comments from Chat about the whole role play thing.

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Chat.orangelandsradio.com.

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We have GS68 says, she puts on a robe and wizard hat.

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Fuck you.

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I do not.

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I do not.

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Alright.

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's only for the premieres.

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you going to dress up for the next premiere?

262
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I might.

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If it comes down to it, I'll just buy a t-shirt and wear my Harry Potter jacket.

264
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's alright.

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's alright.

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Really?

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What else was I going to say about you being a nerd?

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, you went to Comic Con last year.

271
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I go to Comic Con every year.

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm from San Diego.

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So I go to Comic Con every year.

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I love it.

275
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's going to be huge this year.

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can already tell you it's the 40th anniversary.

277
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I haven't bought my tickets yet, but, you know, I should do that soon.

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So what is it you like to see when you're at Comic Con?

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Before the movie premieres and stuff like that, like last year I went, I saw the panel

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for The Day the Earth Stood Still, and I saw, I unfortunately went to the Twilight panel,

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
unfortunately, and wanted to kill myself because all the little screaming 12-year-olds were,

282
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you know, creaming their panties over Robert What's-his-face.

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And, yeah.

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So, I mean, I go for that.

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, the movie premiere.

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've met so many celebrities because of Comic Con and, you know, met Matthew Fox, who I

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
kind of creamed my panties over.

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, all right then.

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was thinking that roleplay is Matthew Fox.

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Suddenly the chatters are lining up to roleplay Matthew Fox in your next Harry Potter thing.

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's amazing.

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, we've got to take this back to video games at some point, but my buddy Shane, an

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
old friend of the show, Miklotov, is listening, and he's sending me private messages.

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Tell Irene and Victoria hi, and they need to make out.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hi, Shane!

296
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
All right, we'll have to get the liquor out.

297
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe that'll happen later.

298
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
All right.

299
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Anyhow, let's actually get back to some gaming here real quick.

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, wait.

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I do want to ask you one other question, though, speaking of video games.

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't take it back to gaming.

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I love World of Warcraft, as you know, and Rice Princess also dabbles in World of Warcraft

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
once in a while.

305
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Really funny story.

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She played her boyfriend's account last night and out-DPS'd another character because she

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
didn't even know what she was doing.

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But anyway, you are what we call a WoW Widow.

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was a WoW Widow.

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You were a WoW Widow.

311
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is a WoW Widow?

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Basically, I lost my boyfriend to that goddamn game.

313
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Basically, he would sit in front of his laptop for hours and hours and hours, and we were

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
supposed to be going out, and would basically ignore me, and I'd sit there watching Will

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and Grace, and he'd be sitting there storming the castle, whatever the fuck you do on that

316
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
game.

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, so I have a little bit of a grudge against WoW, so I refuse to play it, and every time

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I see Rob playing it, I give him shit.

320
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I give Shane shit, too, because, you know, they both get boners every time they're running

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
around in their little princess outfits or whatever the fuck it is they're doing.

322
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Excuse me, excuse me.

323
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Miss Sassy Pants over here.

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Excuse me, excuse me.

325
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They do not have princess outfits in WoW, because if they did, I would be playing all

326
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
day long.

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
All day long.

328
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I would stop doing Orange Launch Radio.

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know, I have a friend in San Diego.

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
One of my gays in San Diego plays WoW just so he can dress his characters up in pretty

331
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
outfits.

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He told me this.

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He's like, we have, it's a guild of nothing but women, and we dress our characters up

334
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in pretty outfits, so.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There's so many great things to say, but first Victoria has her gays.

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And there really is just a guild of women that dress up.

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A guild of women and Patrick that just dress up and they run around and like, I don't know

340
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
what, he says they run around and just, I don't know, do things.

341
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
All right.

342
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

343
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you know what it was your ex-boyfriend was doing in WoW that took so long?

344
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Was he dressing up in princess outfits?

345
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So I'm in the castle.

346
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What is it you do when you play for four hours?

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Raiding.

348
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, that.

349
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That.

350
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And so, yeah, that's what he would do.

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So when, yeah, I broke up with him, you know, to say the least.

353
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Did you tell him that WoW was the reason you were breaking up with him?

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, it wasn't the main reason, he was a douche, but you know, that had a pretty big

355
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
influence on why I am no longer with this person.

356
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
All right.

357
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
All right.

358
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Fair enough.

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So I'm sure we'll get into it later if we're talking about Warcraft stories and you hear

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
a big, ah!

361
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh hell no!

362
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
From the corner.

363
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Stop talking about that shit.

364
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
All right.

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's talk about, because we're getting really into the show here, we got news to get to,

366
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
let's talk about our gaming week.

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, Loki, you've been awfully quiet through this whole thing.

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Welcome back, and how was your gaming week?

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
My gaming week was fine.

370
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like I said, I've really only been playing, or trying to play, Grand Theft Auto IV.

371
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really, I've been seriously trying to get Grand Theft Auto IV PC to work.

372
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because I, there's a lot of cool mods out there now, and it's kind of sad, because I

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
was having fun jumping around with no gravity and stuff, and I wanted to put, like, custom

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,700
weapons in that did really crazy shit, like make huge explosions or shoot fire and stuff

375
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,000
like that, and now I can't do that.

376
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,240
And, you know, I mean, there's other sandbox games that have come out on the PC, like Saints

377
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Row 2 just came out, but that sucks on the PC.

378
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Horrible port, which, it's just sad, and Rockstar unfortunately is not doing anything to fix

379
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Grand Theft Auto IV, and to be honest, I've never seen a game where I can reinstall it

380
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,900
and it still doesn't work correctly, except for Crysis.

381
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,700
Crysis also didn't work correctly when I reinstalled it, but that was a whole different way.

382
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,900
I couldn't finish that game because, you know, I would get to the general or whatever and

383
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,500
he'd be standing there like a mannequin and couldn't progress any further because the

384
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
event didn't trigger.

385
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, that sucked.

386
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:31,300
Other than that, I think I watched Nellie play more Animal Crossing, because now that

387
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I have that game.

388
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
What?

389
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Yeah.

390
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
You played some Animal Crossing?

391
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Well, not anymore.

392
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,800
I ruined it for her, apparently, because I cheated.

393
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,300
How'd you, were you time traveling?

394
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
No, we did that before.

395
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,900
No, this is actually pure cheating now.

396
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,900
They have devices that you can, you know, hack the memory and stuff and give yourself

397
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,900
all this crazy shit, including the download content, because it's pay for unlock content.

398
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:08,400
Yeah, the game's really boring because it's just Animal Crossing, you know, but they had

399
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
some fun codes.

400
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay, let me put it this way.

401
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,900
They had a code where you can go into the characters' houses and you can steal their

402
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,800
furniture, move it around and stuff.

403
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
That is pretty awesome.

404
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
And you can also do it to the stores, too.

405
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,100
You can just go and pick up stuff.

406
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,300
And see, that was funny because, you know, we had maxed out money and there were some

407
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,300
characters that were pissing us off, so we just trapped them in a corner and surrounded

408
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
the furniture around them.

409
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,300
And that was mildly satisfying for a second there.

410
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Yeah, really, what I've been doing with my consoles lately is I've been streaming movies.

411
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
That's pretty much what I did.

412
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
I actually downloaded a bunch of the Rift Track shorts last night.

413
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,600
We were watching some of those and they're awesome.

414
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,340
But yeah, the PS3 actually works really good as a movie streaming thing, except for Windows

415
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
Media files.

416
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,340
I had trouble with that.

417
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,800
I had to actually do that with my 360 for some reason because it just did not want to

418
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,660
work on the PS3.

419
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,020
And then, also, I got the tryout, and I know we have a story on this later, but the new

420
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,620
YouTube that's enhanced now for TVs.

421
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,900
And it's really nice, actually.

422
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,700
Very, very nice looking.

423
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,820
Makes full screen video really easy.

424
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:28,300
The layout of it's really big so that you can see it on your TV, and it works great.

425
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,020
So definitely something to check out, especially if you're just browsing YouTube stuff or you

426
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,620
want to show your friends something, as happened with showing them the new shorts that they

427
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:46,820
did for YouTube Live for Charlie and the Unicorn, or Charlie and the Unicorn.

428
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,220
But yeah, that's all that's pretty much going on.

429
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,380
This week, though, and hopefully I'll have more to talk about next week, I'm actually

430
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,060
getting a preview of the new DJ game coming out, Scratch.

431
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,300
They're going to actually show us everything, and they're bringing me a turntable I get

432
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
to keep, so that's pretty cool.

433
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,580
That's the one that Newark's actually doing the turntable for.

434
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,260
And the only thing I don't like about it, though, is it's all urban and hip-hop music,

435
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,780
but it makes sense in that game because there's not a lot of scratching in techno music, so

436
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,780
I mean...

437
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,300
Yeah, I was going to say, that's kind of the music that is produced by turntables.

438
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,900
I just wish there was some more house music, and maybe there is, but I'll find out more

439
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,400
this week, I get to see it on Thursday, so I'm pretty psyched about that.

440
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,060
So definitely tune back in next week for Loki's review.

441
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
Yes.

442
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
Sweet.

443
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,060
Sweet.

444
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,980
Alright, Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

445
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,440
Victoria grabbed your boob.

446
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,500
I know, I just didn't want to acknowledge it on air, but thank you for doing that.

447
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,340
Glad I would.

448
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,980
I totally downloaded Samurai Shodown 2 on Virtual Console, and I was having good times

449
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,940
with that, because that was one of my original fighting games that I loved to play all the

450
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
time.

451
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,660
So I was playing that for a while.

452
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Who's your character?

453
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
Galford, because he has a dog.

454
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,140
That's the only reason I ever played it, because Galford was on there, and he was hot.

455
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
What else?

456
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
PopCap games.

457
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,220
Oh, I got Silent Hill Origins for Christmas, kind of late, you know, because it came out.

458
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
On the PlayStation 2?

459
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Yeah.

460
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
Oh!

461
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
How is it?

462
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,500
It's not the best Silent Hill.

463
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's not bad, but it's different, yeah, because it was made by some European team, but it's

464
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
not bad.

465
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,940
Did you ever play Silent Hill 5?

466
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
No?

467
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,300
I want to, but no.

468
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,420
Technically it's Silent Hill Homecoming, but whatever.

469
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Homecoming 5.

470
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,860
Isn't it only on the- Silent Hill The Room, you know, that's 4, whatever, I don't give

471
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
a crap.

472
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah, isn't it on the Xbox?

473
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
360 and PS3.

474
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,380
PS3, yeah.

475
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I don't have any of those.

476
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,780
Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting.

477
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
You're stubborn.

478
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
But you have friends.

479
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
Yeah, you know me.

480
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Yeah.

481
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,660
Do I have to come over here and play, because I am so fucking lazy, I'm not going to drive

482
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
here.

483
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,820
Like, I love Silent Hill, but I also love not driving places, so.

484
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
Alright.

485
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,020
One of these days, I'm sure.

486
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,780
Maybe I'll pull a Victoria and, like, stay the weekend at your house.

487
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,180
Can we tell that story real quick, can we, can we, the reason why Victoria's here on

488
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,180
the show tonight?

489
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,900
Victoria, why don't you tell our listeners why you're here on the program tonight?

490
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,900
So I'm kind of dumb, and I just, I'm opening a hotel right now, there's a new hotel opening

491
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:28,040
out in, about, you know, maybe 20 miles from where I live, and so basically we're going

492
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,940
in and out and cleaning all the hotel rooms, big issues, no sawdust, all that shit.

493
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,220
And I'm a genius and lost my keys at work, and so I basically had to search high and

494
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,780
low through all the hotel rooms that I cleaned on Friday.

495
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,820
Yeah, and my roommate isn't home because she's in Sonoma seeing her boyfriend, so she's not

496
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,580
going to be home until tomorrow, so I'm basically stuck at Rob's house until tomorrow, imposing

497
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,040
on his good hospitality and all that, all that nonsense, and I'm very grateful to him

498
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,500
for letting me stay here.

499
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
That's right, bitch.

500
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
You better, you better gush.

501
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,380
If not, I'd be sleeping in my car.

502
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,780
Tell listeners about how wonderful I am.

503
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,620
Oh yeah, he's so good to me.

504
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Alright, anyway, I just thought that was my story.

505
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,060
I was going to say, there was one game I did forget about that I actually played this week,

506
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Ninja Blade.

507
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,980
I played the demo for that, which is pretty cool.

508
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,020
The game, I mean, looks kind of like a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden 2.

509
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,380
It's actually more of a rip-off of Conan or God of War, I mean, the game plays very similar

510
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
to that.

511
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,220
You have three different weapons, you know, with varying speed and damage, and it's all

512
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,540
ninja-themed and stuff, but then there's a lot of quick-time event cutscenes that are

513
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,700
in the game, which are pretty cool-looking, just very cinematic and action-packed.

514
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,420
There's one scene where you're actually running down the side of a skyscraper and killing

515
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,380
these dragon-looking monster things, which are pretty awesome.

516
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,700
So it's definitely worth checking out.

517
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,740
It's not crap.

518
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,900
It's definitely not Vampire Reigns, so that'll be a good one to check out.

519
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,060
I think it's coming out the end of March now, but it's one of those secondary From Software

520
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,300
games that Microsoft's publishing.

521
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Good times, good times.

522
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,260
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

523
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,820
So Victoria, you know how you can extend your stay here at Rob's?

524
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,260
Do his laundry, do his dishes, clean his house?

525
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,060
The guy that I was seeing told me to cook for him, but he's all diet-y and stuff.

526
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,260
I wanted to give Loki the presents I got him from Hawaii.

527
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,540
Why didn't you get me?

528
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,100
So I got him an authentic dashboard hula girl doll, because I thought he'd like that.

529
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,460
I got Jamie one too, she'll find out about that next week.

530
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,780
And then I got some, since you like food, I got you some macadamia nut covered toffee,

531
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,220
which is really good.

532
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,420
So eat it.

533
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
It's amazing.

534
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
I'll give this to Nellie.

535
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
Eat it.

536
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Nellie will like it too.

537
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,540
Yes.

538
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
So there you go.

539
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Thank you very much.

540
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
All right.

541
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Sorry about that.

542
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
I just remembered that.

543
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,460
So you were, what, you were done with your gaming week too then?

544
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Rice Princess?

545
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
What else?

546
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,120
Victoria, I don't know if there's been anything you've been playing, but why don't you share?

547
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,820
I played rock band with Rob yesterday.

548
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
Oh yeah.

549
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,100
We made a band, the Shrieking Beavers.

550
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Yeah.

551
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah.

552
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,940
And then I have a game on my phone that I've been playing, but that's as, you know, awesome

553
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,340
as it gets.

554
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
What game on your phone?

555
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,340
It's called Pump Jack.

556
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
It's like a little, you're like a little-

557
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
It sounds dirty.

558
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I know, right?

559
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
I know, right?

560
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Wow.

561
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
No, it came with my sidekick.

562
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,140
So like, it's like your little wheel and you have to go collect all the gas cans and you

563
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,500
have to avoid the little cactuses that can explode and kill you.

564
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
And then you Pump Jack.

565
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Pump Jack.

566
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah.

567
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,700
No, and I've been playing it for like, I've been playing it since I got my damn phone,

568
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,060
which is almost a year, and I still haven't beaten it.

569
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm on like the last level and it's driving me crazy that I can't win.

570
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,020
Which goes to show you why I don't play video games, because I get frustrated and then I

571
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,140
just don't want to play anymore.

572
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
So.

573
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,660
Well, we have an interesting story later on that might appeal to you.

574
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
I'll talk about that.

575
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Bring it.

576
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,100
Like what they're doing for frustrated people like you.

577
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,260
Fabulous.

578
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
My gaming week.

579
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,340
I haven't played a lot of new things.

580
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,660
I've kind of recycled a lot of the older games I have.

581
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,500
Like of course I've been playing WoW.

582
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,660
I've been playing a lot of little big-

583
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Shut up.

584
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,140
I've been playing a lot of little big planet.

585
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,340
I don't remember if I ever talked about it on the show, but I was playing Suikoden, the

586
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,220
old school one for PlayStation 1.

587
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Like I was playing that like crazy.

588
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,500
I haven't really touched it since I got back from Hawaii, because I got to a part of the

589
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,700
game where it actually got hard again.

590
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,780
So I'm getting to the Victoria level of frustration with it, but I'll go back and try to beat

591
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,660
it at some point.

592
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
And then as far as new stuff I've been playing.

593
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,940
The new stuff I've been playing is on the iPhone, which is kind of interesting.

594
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,060
Konami put out some interesting games this week.

595
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:35,280
They put out a demo for Dance Dance Revolution, the new iPhone DDR game, which is interesting.

596
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,540
Its biggest problem is like it's choppy.

597
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,700
Like seriously, if you think that Xbox frame rate thing is an issue, try playing DDR on

598
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
your iPhone.

599
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
It's pretty horrible.

600
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
But it's very pretty.

601
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Like for a cell phone game, it's actually very pretty looking and the sounds very good

602
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,000
because obviously iPhones or iPods.

603
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,900
So the music is obviously full quality, which is kind of nice.

604
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,180
And basically what it is, a little dance pad shows up at the bottom of your screen and

605
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
you play with your fingers.

606
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,860
You dance with your fingers to the music, which is, you know, cute, but I don't know

607
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
how.

608
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,180
I mean, luckily it's free.

609
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
It's free.

610
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
So you can't complain.

611
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Totally free.

612
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,620
But it's just the one song for free.

613
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,980
So just one song.

614
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Yeah.

615
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
It's one song.

616
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Wow.

617
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,700
But it's like a preview of what they're working on or something.

618
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
All right.

619
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,420
The other game I got on the iPhone is Silent Hill.

620
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,260
They actually have on the iPhone now.

621
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,940
It's a new version of it.

622
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,100
I think it's called Silent Hill, the revenge.

623
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,180
I can't remember the name of it.

624
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm actually looking it up on my phone right now.

625
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,060
It's called, let me see, I'm learning it right now.

626
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,500
Basically in this game, you have these little mini mazes.

627
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,100
It looks like the old school dungeon explorer game from the Turbo Graphics 16, the escape.

628
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
That's what it's called.

629
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Silent Hill, the escape.

630
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,780
Let me see if I can get some of the music for you guys.

631
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,660
Your fingers and you just hit the buttons and like, that's how you play it and there's

632
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,700
only one level.

633
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,740
I have no idea if they can hear that over the air, but a little bit of what it sounds

634
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
like.

635
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,160
No, you actually, it uses the touch screen.

636
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,760
It's a whole new interface that uses the touch screen.

637
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,340
You can slide back and forth to move through the maze and you turn left and right.

638
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,260
And then to fire your gun, you tap on the crosshair to fire the gun.

639
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,700
And the crosshair is all tilt sensitive.

640
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,760
So if you want to aim up and down, you tilt.

641
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,500
So you will run across these nurses in the maze and you can blow their brains out basically.

642
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,900
It's not really a Silent Hill game.

643
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,300
It's basically a dungeon crawling game that they've slapped Silent Hill graphics onto.

644
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,740
Surely you just, Rob.

645
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,620
Well, Silent Hill is all about avoiding things.

646
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,760
You don't necessarily have to shoot everything in the face, you know what I mean?

647
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,380
But this game kind of encourages that.

648
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Thanks, Rob.

649
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
I do encourage people.

650
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
I appreciate you explaining it to me.

651
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Shut up.

652
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,660
But I'm telling you, for the listeners, you know what I mean?

653
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
I know, I know.

654
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I don't know what it's about.

655
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
I've seen the movie.

656
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
And you didn't like the movie, did you?

657
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
I was pissed at the end.

658
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I was like, what the fuck is this?

659
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,900
But it's more one of those things that's much better if you've played the game.

660
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,180
So yeah, Silent Hill on the iPhone is kind of, eh, I mean, it's only $8.

661
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,940
You can be honest.

662
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
You know what?

663
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
Here's the thing.

664
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,680
It's actually a really smooth running game.

665
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,620
The controls are kind of interesting.

666
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,660
The way you play, no, compared to DDR, like the frame rate is much better.

667
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,980
It runs a lot smoothly.

668
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,620
For a mobile phone game, the graphics are actually pretty good.

669
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,900
And if you play with headphones, the sound and stuff is actually kind of neat.

670
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,400
So it's actually not a bad game.

671
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,180
It's just kind of short and not really Silent Hill.

672
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
That's the thing.

673
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,260
So, I mean, if you want to get kind of an interesting maze exploring game that you shoot

674
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,540
things in, get this game.

675
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,780
Or if you want like a, you know, just, it's a cute little time waster.

676
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,980
I mean, there's only like six levels, so I don't know if it's necessarily worth $8.

677
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,420
I think maybe $5 would have been a better price point for this, but you know, whatever,

678
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
I guess.

679
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
That's just, yeah.

680
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,620
When I think of Silent Hill, I totally think of shooting my way out of a maze.

681
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,260
They had to come up with like, they try, you know, they have these little story elements

682
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,020
that are in it too, although not much.

683
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,940
I haven't seen Pyramid Head yet, but I might not have just played far enough.

684
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,060
I mean, it's, it's, it's all right.

685
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,620
It's you have to remember it's a mobile phone game.

686
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,180
If your expectations are high, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.

687
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
I know.

688
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,300
Or they just make it a generic game or something like it's nothing like Silent Hill.

689
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Well, it is.

690
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:26,140
Cause then it wouldn't get sold if they didn't put Silent Hill on it.

691
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,700
That's pretty much it right there.

692
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,620
But what's interesting about this is that, hey, there's a Metal Gear game coming out

693
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,980
and a lot of people are like, OMG, Metal Gear on the phone.

694
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,020
Well, if it's anything like this, don't get your hopes up.

695
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,700
It is exactly, actually it's worse than that.

696
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,300
It's a real shooter.

697
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,220
Then it's not even going to be anything.

698
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,100
And then a pad comes up and you just use your fingers to hit the buttons and it's only one

699
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
song.

700
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Yeah.

701
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Yeah.

702
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
There you go.

703
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Womp, womp, womp.

704
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
All right.

705
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
So there it is.

706
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,460
That, that was my quick review on the Silent Hill, the escape, the iPhone game.

707
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,060
Uh, otherwise I don't think I've really been playing a lot of new stuff.

708
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,780
Um, you know, just playing the same old stuff on, well, there's console games too.

709
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,660
Yes, I played Violet hold with you.

710
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
I'm the best warrior.

711
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
There you go.

712
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
All right.

713
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,820
Let's, uh, let's start to get into some gaming news tonight, but first I just want to say

714
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,780
a couple quick housekeeping announcements.

715
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,740
Really dark soccer is not here tonight.

716
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,220
Um, which, you know, is probably pretty obvious cause the show is completely getting off base.

717
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Uh, cause you know, when, when Jamie's not here to keep us in line, uh, the show just

718
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
goes crazy.

719
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,580
Uh, so she's not here tonight.

720
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,460
We will still have a classic game of the week tonight, um, that I believe I'm doing or did

721
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,300
the Deloki find something he's doing, uh, we'll figure it out.

722
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,620
Uh, so we'll do that in a little later on and, uh, she'll be back next week and, uh,

723
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,180
we apparently also in housekeeping tonight, we have a brand new orange launch radio website

724
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
coming soon.

725
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,160
It looks like, cause the beta looks great.

726
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,680
And if you're in chat right now, just ask a deep man.

727
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,480
He did a awesome.

728
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
He did.

729
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,140
It doesn't look like it was made in the early two thousands.

730
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
It doesn't.

731
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,020
It looks, it looks very modern.

732
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
It's still simple though.

733
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Is what I like about it.

734
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,460
He didn't, he didn't load it up with like a bunch of crap.

735
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,740
It still looks efficient, which would be cool.

736
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,620
So I'm, I'm very excited.

737
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,020
So big thank you to deep man and we'll find other ways to thank him later on when the

738
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,140
site goes live.

739
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,540
People will send, we'll send, uh, we'll send Victoria out there to babysit cause he's married.

740
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,620
So Victoria can go babysit.

741
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,500
I have a 10 year old brother and I want to kill him every time I see him, I can't stand

742
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
children.

743
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,860
No, I don't, I don't hurt him.

744
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,980
I just, you know, kind of pulls, I kind of pull his hair a little bit and smack him in

745
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,180
the head and tell him to quit looking like a little girl with his John Lennon hair.

746
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,140
But you know, doesn't your 10, doesn't your 10 year old brother play grand theft auto?

747
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,980
Yeah, he does, he called me on Christmas day asking me to find him cheat codes for grand

748
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,460
theft auto four and I said, God damn it, you have the fucking internet.

749
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,060
Look it up yourself to your 10 year old brother.

750
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
He knows I love him.

751
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,180
He shouldn't be playing grand theft auto four anyway.

752
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,900
I was playing grand theft auto since he was like six.

753
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,380
My dad thought it was appropriate to buy him GTA three when he was six.

754
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Okay.

755
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
Yeah.

756
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,580
So it's fabulous parenting on my parents' part.

757
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Yes.

758
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,140
And I just wonder how I turned out so normal.

759
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,940
All right.

760
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,100
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news for the love of God.

761
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Gaming news.

762
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Yes.

763
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Loki, please.

764
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,380
Well, we got to do some stuff from last week first though, right?

765
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Yes.

766
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
Okay.

767
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,380
So let's start with last week's news.

768
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,900
Last week we had CES and of course there wasn't a whole lot of game news coming out, but Microsoft

769
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,620
did show off one thing that was kind of neat.

770
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,660
Their brand new community game, um, that's actually kind of a game making program.

771
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,140
Now we talked about this on the program before when it was called Boku.

772
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,980
Now they've decided to change the name to kudo or kodo kodo.

773
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,140
I mean, Boku, kudo, kodo, but who cares?

774
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Okay.

775
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:02,460
So kodo anyways, it's basically a very simplified game making program.

776
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,100
Um, they're comparing it to a little big planet.

777
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,220
I don't think it's anything like little big planet at all, but, um, it's kind of object

778
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,420
oriented programming stuff and you can use the characters and stuff in there, um, to

779
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,100
basically create your own little games.

780
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,900
They're all kind of pixelated looking cause the blocks in the game are actually very Lego

781
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
like.

782
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,700
So it's kind of neat.

783
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,900
Um, so yeah, you can basically make games.

784
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,220
They have 200 building blocks right now.

785
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,260
I'm sure there'll be more available for download.

786
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,940
Uh, no word on when it's coming out, supposedly later this year and, um, you'll be able to,

787
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,940
I guess, make games.

788
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,060
I don't know if it will be available also on, um, their community game service cause

789
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,580
that could be really messy if there's that many community games on there, you know, as

790
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,140
if it was hard enough for some of these community game developers to get their game notice.

791
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,140
They have all these crappy Boku levels.

792
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
I don't know.

793
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,580
Or, uh, kodo levels.

794
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,380
Well, yeah, one of these days I want to get, um, Aaron back on the show.

795
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm hoping he'll listen at one point, but he's the guy who did snake three 60.

796
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,420
Like I want to talk to him now, like six weeks out after his game has been released and see

797
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,380
how it, I saw him respond back to a, there was an IGN review of his game or something

798
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,300
there really about like the hot or not of like community games.

799
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,100
And his was actually in the not section and the reasons and the reasons that they gave

800
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
her retarded.

801
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,640
They're all, Oh, it's snake game and it totally looked like that the guy did not play the

802
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
game at all.

803
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,140
So it was, it was retarded, but it was funny cause he's just, you know, called him out

804
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
on it.

805
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,700
He's like, um, doesn't sound like you played this at all.

806
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,220
And you actually, there's a lot of features that you didn't mention.

807
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,300
And um, you know, there's some other games that was just like crap that they gave good

808
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
reviews for.

809
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,540
But remember it's just one person's review and you know, just because they happen to

810
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,620
be behind a website and you know, their voice unfortunately is a little bit louder than everybody

811
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,620
else's.

812
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,600
Well, there's a lot of voices that got a little quieter last week and this is huge news, huge

813
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,980
news throughout the community, especially, um, you know, on the type of websites.

814
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,620
I think those of you guys that listen to these types of independent podcasts, I'm sure you

815
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,180
guys read a lot of gaming blogs.

816
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,060
You see a lot of this, so it's no news to you guys.

817
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,980
I'm sure that a UGO bought the one up network, uh, this week and uh, basically it caused,

818
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:24,660
you know, long story short, uh, it caused EGM to go under electronic gaming monthly.

819
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:30,300
The magazine is no more and uh, lots and lots of folks that were working at one up.com goodbye,

820
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,560
including the people that were doing the one up show and uh, one up was one up yours was

821
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
the video show.

822
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,020
I'm going to be honest guys, it's so fun.

823
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,700
Here's the thing, you know, there's not a lot of extra news to talk about with us.

824
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,040
I'm sure you guys all read it in the week we were gone, so you all are probably pretty

825
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
familiar with it.

826
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,360
If not, go look on any blog that was running last week and I'm sure you'll read about it.

827
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,100
It's very interesting, like really how much love was out there for these shows and this

828
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,100
site, which was interesting to me because honestly I've never ever watched it or listened

829
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,740
to a show of theirs, but I don't do it.

830
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
That's, that's my policy across the board.

831
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,580
There's very, very, very few shows that I listened to because I don't want to inadvertently

832
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
steal ideas.

833
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,580
If that makes sense.

834
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Does that make sense?

835
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
That makes sense.

836
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,580
You know, we've done a show for like seven years.

837
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,380
I don't want to be accused of ripping something off of somebody else.

838
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,700
And no offense, but that's going to happen anyway, even if I don't watch them.

839
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,980
People are going to say we stole stuff, but whatever.

840
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,140
So and to be honest, I don't even know who UGO is.

841
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,260
I mean, I've never heard of them as a website.

842
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,700
Don't they run a lot of other sites for entertainment, movies, things of that nature.

843
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,460
They're trying to be like a one, not one, an IGN type of service, but I've never visited

844
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,940
them ever and you know, I don't know, I just have never heard of them.

845
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,900
It's, you know, maybe that's my own ignorance, but I've never heard of them at all and the

846
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,300
fact that they're teaming up with 1UP now or they bought them out means nothing to me

847
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,100
because I haven't visited 1UP in months and I just don't, same with GameSpot.

848
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,900
It's just done with it.

849
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,020
Well, here's what's interesting is that my comment on this, the first thing I was thinking

850
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,780
of because I read about this when I was out in Hawaii and I was kind of my first thought

851
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,980
was, okay, we're going to have to talk about this on the show at some point.

852
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,940
My kind of thought on this is this will be a chance to see how much these guys that were

853
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,460
producing these shows and doing this stuff were really into video games and really into

854
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,900
their craft because as many independent podcasts have shown for years and years and years,

855
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,000
you don't have to get paid to do this stuff if you really, really enjoy it.

856
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,020
So my kind of thing was I was going to say, well guys, here you go, here's your chance

857
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,560
to keep doing what you do just because this may not be the day job anymore.

858
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,440
You can still keep it going and they have.

859
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,700
So props to them because now there is the whole Rebel FM I think it's called and I think

860
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,940
there's another one called Geek Box.

861
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,680
So props to them for continuing to do it.

862
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,040
So I'm kind of curious to see how much this is going to go and kind of where some of these

863
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
guys end up.

864
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,460
If this is the same thing that's going to happen, remember, that's how we got This Week

865
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
in Tech.

866
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
True.

867
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,460
I mean, you know, follow up from Tech TV, so, I don't know, and I'm sure that they'll

868
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:28,940
make it just as well and probably even better now that they're away from 1UP, so.

869
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,180
Why do you say that?

870
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,620
Just because, like look at This Week in Tech, I think they're doing very well and I think

871
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,940
that if they were still part of G4, you know, the whole Tech TV thing, I think they wouldn't

872
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,260
be doing as well as they are now, independently.

873
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,020
Less influence from other things that are more corporate oriented.

874
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Interesting.

875
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,660
Well, good luck.

876
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:55,620
I mean, it's never fun to talk about job layoffs, but good luck to those folks and good luck

877
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,140
to 1UP, too.

878
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,060
Stand kind of on top of things now because they've been, of course, they've taken a lot

879
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,780
of negative press over this whole thing, so I don't know.

880
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,380
I got to ask you, Rice Princess, because you were on 1UP for quite some time, like years

881
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,500
ago when I was posting on there and participating on the site, you were kind of the one that

882
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,580
got me into that and I think you kind of hung out there for a little while after that.

883
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,540
What do you think about all this news about it closing?

884
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,900
Is 1UP a site you would still visit or are you like, eh, the people are gone, whatever?

885
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,220
It's interesting because, yeah, I actually did revisit my 1UP account like a couple weeks

886
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,500
ago, actually, before any of this ever happened and I still have the same friends and stuff.

887
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,940
I didn't really do anything, but I mean, it's always sad when a community, a group of people

888
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,300
just, you know, can't meet at the same place anymore.

889
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,180
It's like having your favorite local coffee shop or something close down.

890
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
It's just like, oh, that sucks.

891
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
But, you know.

892
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
You just moved to a new coffee shop.

893
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
I know.

894
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
That's what I'm saying.

895
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,820
People can, you know, get each other's information, go to another place and do it.

896
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,140
But, you know, you can go to another coffee shop, but it might not be as cool or as quirky

897
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
or whatever.

898
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,660
Now, you know, the thing is, in defense, I guess you would say to, you know, UGO, you

899
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,380
know, print gaming press, I think it's going to be gone in a few years anyways.

900
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,600
It's just that they can't really compete unless you're like, you know, Game Informer or something

901
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
like that.

902
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,980
And you're, you know, cutting deals with these publishers to have the exclusive story and

903
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
stuff.

904
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,260
But even still, people know now not to even bother reading that because they can just

905
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,460
read that same story on the internet when someone gets their copy of the magazine, relays

906
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,380
what's in there, as well as all the media that was on there.

907
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,380
It's just the internet's so instantaneous now that print press is just becoming kind

908
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
of dated.

909
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
Yeah.

910
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,060
The electronic gaming monthly news is especially sad because, you know, I think a lot of us

911
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,460
remember that magazine from years and years ago.

912
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
I grew up.

913
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
Yeah.

914
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Don't get me wrong.

915
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,220
It was like the best gaming magazine out there years ago when the internet didn't exist.

916
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
Yeah.

917
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,380
But here's the thing is that I know a lot of people are really sad about EGM going away

918
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,740
and to me to an extent too.

919
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
Am I sad?

920
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Yes.

921
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Am I surprised?

922
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Not really.

923
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
But here's the thing.

924
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,740
That magazine has been dead to me for 10 years.

925
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,260
Like I, I remember that magazine like back in the day, you know, like, Oh my God, that

926
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,380
issue where they actually had the, um, Shang Long lie in it for the April Fools.

927
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,580
I fricking had that issue with the magazine.

928
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
I remember that.

929
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Yeah.

930
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,980
Like I remember some of that stuff happening, but honestly, like I stopped.

931
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,140
I stopped subscribing to that a long time ago.

932
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,620
A lot of people did.

933
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,540
So for me it was more of the news of, uh, Oh, well, you know, that's too bad.

934
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,860
That's an icon of my youth that's going away, but I'm not surprised.

935
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Yeah.

936
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:42,000
I mean, with the advent of, you know, internet news outlets and especially blogs, blogs are

937
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,520
becoming more popular than, you know, normal media sites because people like to identify

938
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,220
with other people who are on their level, who are normal, who can give, you know, a

939
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,980
perspective, you know, that's not like corporate.

940
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,660
And a big purpose for magazines now in this day and age is to read when you're on the

941
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,860
toilet, but now that they have iPhones, you can look at blogs when you're on the toilet

942
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,860
now.

943
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
You can.

944
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Yes.

945
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,860
Yeah.

946
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,860
Just don't.

947
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,860
That's what I do.

948
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,860
So you don't, I don't even need magazines anymore.

949
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,060
I can look at websites.

950
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Only a wow.

951
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
What Victoria?

952
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,060
What you want?

953
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Nasty ho.

954
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Okay.

955
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,060
We don't want to know what you're doing.

956
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
You're taking a dump.

957
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,900
Look, everybody poops, haven't you ever read that book?

958
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,180
Everybody poops.

959
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,540
If you wipe your butt and you get a little bit of poop on your finger and you put it

960
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,420
on your thing, you can't throw it away like a magazine.

961
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
Stop it.

962
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,940
I'm down with the old school magazines being in my bathroom.

963
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
You know that.

964
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,180
You see all the maxims lined up like on my toilet.

965
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,120
We can move away from that now.

966
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,980
But what I'm talking about is, is that, you know, people used to have the magazines or

967
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,380
the, what was it, the bathroom reader books or whatever, but now we can have the internet

968
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,700
even when we're pooping.

969
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
We could.

970
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,220
So we can look at blogs and all that there.

971
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,100
I guess you're right about that.

972
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,100
It's gross, but yeah.

973
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,860
So magazine, I'm just saying magazines are, are, it's one last use is going away.

974
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, I'm holding your laptop right now.

975
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,140
You've had this in the bathroom with you.

976
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Haven't you?

977
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,140
Oh yeah.

978
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
There's poop somewhere on here, isn't there?

979
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Oh, damn it.

980
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,860
Why are the keys so sticky, Rob?

981
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
You're disgusting.

982
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,740
Somebody burned my hands off.

983
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,380
All right, please.

984
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,380
Let's move on.

985
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
For God's sake.

986
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
All right.

987
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,060
Well, there's a rumor coming from IGN.

988
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,620
They have multiple sources close to Nintendo that have told the site that, um, the TSI

989
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:47,300
will be out in the US on April 4th at $179.

990
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,540
I somehow don't believe this.

991
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,940
And why is that that you don't believe this?

992
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,140
Well, there's just a few things that strike me as weird.

993
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,780
Nintendo for some reason likes releasing their stuff, especially hardware, on Sundays, and

994
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,220
the 4th is actually a Saturday.

995
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,220
For one.

996
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,820
Actually, that's my only thing, is that it's a Saturday, not a Sunday.

997
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,460
Therefore I am calling the whole thing book.

998
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,900
I don't know, it doesn't really matter, and I think if anything, they would want to hold

999
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:20,620
off on selling the DSi, because they've been selling tons of DS's already, and I think

1000
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,180
if they bring the DSi out, it's just going to cut into their DS sales.

1001
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,060
And they're not really having trouble selling DS systems, and I don't know, there's not

1002
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,820
really any DSi software out, even in Japan right now, other than the download stuff,

1003
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,860
but I guess, I don't know.

1004
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,180
Of course, they could always just cut the price of the DS that's out there right now

1005
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,260
by like 20 bucks and release the DSi.

1006
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,700
For $99.99, yeah, then people will start making love to DS's like crazy or something.

1007
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,900
Exactly, and then they'll sell both, because you'll have the more high priced ones for

1008
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,380
folks that want the camera and all that stuff.

1009
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
They could do it.

1010
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,420
But yeah, what Loki says about the date is especially interesting, because Nintendo does

1011
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
usually do a Sunday.

1012
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I wonder if it doesn't mean maybe shipping on April 4th to store on April 5th?

1013
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,820
No, you can't have a ship date on Saturday, it wouldn't make any sense, because no one

1014
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,580
ships on Saturdays.

1015
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,680
They would street it for a Sunday.

1016
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,540
So okay, whatever, maybe it's April 5th, I mean, big deal.

1017
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,420
I don't know, I think it's just a big rumor right now.

1018
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,540
I think if anything, they'll announce something later, I don't know, it doesn't really seem

1019
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,820
like there'd be any reason to release this now, I mean, there's just a few download games

1020
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
and that's it.

1021
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,220
It's just not really that worthwhile.

1022
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:41,660
I don't know if the DS was kind of tanking a little bit, not really tanking, but if sales

1023
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,720
are starting to drop off a little bit in Japan, and maybe that's why they released the DSi,

1024
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,940
but I don't think they're dropping off at all, I mean, we're still selling tons of DS

1025
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,300
systems, not having a problem whatsoever.

1026
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,080
Some comments from chatroom on this story, Cy says, I think their strategy is that Nintendo

1027
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,820
fans will buy the 179DSi and most people will buy the DS Lite at regular, kind of similar

1028
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
to what I was saying.

1029
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,780
Yeah, so the DSi is for hardcore gamers, yeah, uh-huh, sure.

1030
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,860
Or people who want the extra garbage that it's gonna have.

1031
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,180
Xlink says, and you can take it to the bathroom.

1032
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,180
You can indeed play your DS in the bathroom, and I'm sure there's people that do that.

1033
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,980
Yeah, and it has a really crappy, you know, jump browser.

1034
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,980
No pun intended.

1035
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,500
Yeah, it has a horrible web browser built into it as well, so.

1036
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,460
Bobby says, Activision Blizzard doesn't want the DSi released because their best-selling

1037
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,060
DS game won't be compatible.

1038
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,100
Guitar Hero on tour.

1039
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Yes.

1040
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,340
Well, Activision Blizzard don't have a say in it, so...

1041
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,340
Poop on them.

1042
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,340
I don't know.

1043
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,340
It's just...

1044
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,340
This show is really poop-filled.

1045
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,820
They'll just come out with another peripheral that'll plug into the SD card slot, and then

1046
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,980
they can make their crappy games.

1047
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,100
They're gonna have, like, some stupid drum peripheral.

1048
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,580
I don't know, all their DS guitar games suck.

1049
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,700
I'm sorry, it's just...

1050
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,540
It's retarded to play Guitar Hero on the DS.

1051
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,540
I said it.

1052
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,540
There you go.

1053
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:08,380
It's also retarded to play Dance Dance Revolution on iPhone, a PSP, or a DS, because it makes

1054
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,380
no sense.

1055
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,780
Yeah, you're not dancing.

1056
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,780
You're not dancing.

1057
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,780
You're not...

1058
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,780
I don't know.

1059
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
I have to concur with you on there.

1060
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:20,180
Even though I used to play, like, DDR, like, with the remote control, like, when I couldn't

1061
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,780
afford to go to the arcade.

1062
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,140
What's one of the biggest iPhone games right now, in fact, so big that Apple actually displays

1063
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,380
it on a big banner inside their store?

1064
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,500
Silent Hill The Escape.

1065
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,860
No, not Silent Hill The Escape.

1066
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,540
Tap Tap Revenge.

1067
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,500
Tap Tap Revenge is like a somewhat DDR clone.

1068
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Hit the buttons.

1069
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
No.

1070
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,780
It's a clone of Amplitude.

1071
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,140
No, it's not.

1072
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,260
I've played the game.

1073
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,620
It's like Guitar Hero, if anything else.

1074
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,820
The notes scroll down and you tap.

1075
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,620
That's what it's closest to, is Guitar Hero.

1076
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,380
But still, though, you're not dancing, though.

1077
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,420
That's the thing.

1078
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,780
If it's like a BeatMania game or something like that, then yeah, that's a little bit

1079
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,980
more acceptable, because you can't play DDR on a DS.

1080
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
It's just weird.

1081
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,220
Although, although I did see a homebrew program, though, that could be a way that they could

1082
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,700
do DDR on a DS.

1083
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,700
It would just be, you know, with stylus strokes and stuff like that, and it looked really

1084
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,700
cool.

1085
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,380
But because it looked really cool, Konami would never do that.

1086
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,660
Of course.

1087
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,900
Alright, well, hey, speaking of some systems, there's still some love for the old systems

1088
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,900
too.

1089
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,500
In fact, systems so old that Victoria actually owns them, because she can afford them.

1090
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,020
You are such a bitch, oh my god!

1091
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Shut up!

1092
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,020
I love you.

1093
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
Please don't.

1094
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
Yes, I do.

1095
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,980
PlayStation 2 reaches the 50 million sold mark in North America.

1096
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:53,720
PlayStation 2 has actually hit that mark, 50 million, and I believe that is more than

1097
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,780
any other system, if I'm not mistaken.

1098
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,740
So it's a lot.

1099
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,740
Wow.

1100
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,540
Because they keep breaking, and you have to keep re-buying them.

1101
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:11,240
So by the way, there is a note from John Kohler, the marketing head of Sony Computer Entertainment.

1102
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,100
We don't intend on discarding the system any time soon.

1103
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,060
Yeah, they still sell like hundreds of thousands of units each month, because they can't play

1104
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,060
the games on a PS3.

1105
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:24,580
They're going to release the PSI on April 4th for a price tag of $159.

1106
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Perhaps.

1107
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,340
It would be cool if they shrunk down the PS2 even more, make it like the size of an old...

1108
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,580
Like your finger or something.

1109
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,580
Yes, the size of my finger.

1110
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,580
That would be awesome.

1111
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,140
Yeah, because I could put a DVD in my finger, dummy.

1112
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,140
I could!

1113
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,540
I could spin it around my finger, that would work.

1114
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,000
You could put it in, it would just break.

1115
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Like a lot.

1116
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You're so weird.

1117
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You're weird.

1118
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Shut up.

1119
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,180
Game Guru would like to point out, PS2 makes money, PS3 does not.

1120
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
Yep.

1121
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,380
But you know, people are saying the PS3 needs to come down in price, and then they might

1122
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,140
actually sell some more units.

1123
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,140
Who knows?

1124
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,140
Too late.

1125
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Too little, too late.

1126
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Yeah, I think so.

1127
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
It's just a little too late.

1128
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,060
It's just, might as well give up this console generation, just, you know, work on the next

1129
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,060
one.

1130
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,340
I don't know.

1131
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:13,980
So we talked a little bit before about the video download service that they have in Japan

1132
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,700
for the Wii, which is kind of, I don't know.

1133
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,460
It's very family friendly, I guess.

1134
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,620
Maybe they have cartoons and other Japanese programming stuff on there.

1135
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:32,780
Well, something similar may be coming to the US this year, actually.

1136
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:40,460
And apparently, FujiSoft, the company behind it, was at CES and told Gamersight that they

1137
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,980
were planning on bringing the WiiWare video service to the US.

1138
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:52,300
It says, we can't quite tell at the moment, but if the negotiations are a success, maybe

1139
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,500
within the year.

1140
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,100
Which is cool, but you know, we still need some better storage on the Wii.

1141
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,140
I know, I'm gonna be able to store all that video on my, you know, internal Wii drive

1142
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,980
or the SD card it doesn't know how to read off of.

1143
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,540
So what's that, Victoria?

1144
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,460
I said, I can't work the Wii, I'm like retarded.

1145
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,180
I've tried playing it.

1146
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:20,500
You know what's funny is that the Wii is made for people to be able to understand very easily,

1147
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,500
but you can't figure it out?

1148
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Well, I can, but I'm just not good at it.

1149
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,780
I like having the little control in my hand.

1150
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,100
Well, I guess it's kind of good if you're one of those people who moves the controller

1151
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,220
to the left when you want your little person to go to the left, you know, like you're playing

1152
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,980
Mario Brothers old school.

1153
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,260
You know, just, jump right, right, right, yeah, no, I don't know.

1154
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,260
Yeah, you do.

1155
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,260
Yeah, exactly.

1156
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,700
Yeah, but I fail, epically, at the Wii.

1157
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,060
What games do you enjoy on Wii?

1158
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,220
I like that Wario one where you have to go through, do the little movements, I don't

1159
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,220
know what it's called.

1160
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,220
WarioWare.

1161
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,220
That one.

1162
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,140
Yeah, that's like one of the only games I've ever played on the Wii, other than Guitar

1163
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,620
Hero because my cousins have it on, so.

1164
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,220
Alright, good times.

1165
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,220
So you're a Wii-tard, is what you're basically saying.

1166
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Yes, I'm a Wii-tard, yeah, exactly.

1167
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
There you go.

1168
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,220
Alright.

1169
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,380
Well, hey, if you want to get a Wii cheap, you might want to run over to Circuit City

1170
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,060
because Circuit City has gone under, and you know, so many of these companies are going

1171
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,980
under recently, it's kind of sad.

1172
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,460
I almost feel like we need a theme song on the show for when companies go under.

1173
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:35,300
So let me try reading the story to this music.

1174
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:43,180
Circuit City has announced that they are going to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, actually

1175
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,180
no, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy already and closed 155 stores, that wasn't enough.

1176
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:55,060
Now they are unable to find a buyer to keep themselves afloat, they are being liquidated.

1177
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:02,140
So basically, sadly, and I apologize to any listeners we have who work for Circuit City

1178
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:07,740
because this news has got to suck, and we really hope somebody else will come in and

1179
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,500
buy up some of these old stores, but they are going under.

1180
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,780
And from what I'm hearing from people who do work for them, that I know on like Live

1181
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,900
Journal and stuff, apparently the company was horribly managed, and it's finally come

1182
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,900
back to get them.

1183
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:26,260
They kind of had an old business model too, I mean like, with places like Fry's and Best

1184
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,780
Buy and stuff, Circuit City was just kind of the little guy, and they just can't keep

1185
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,780
up.

1186
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,100
And they kept building them next to Best Buy's, or Best Buy's kept building them next to Circuit

1187
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,340
City, so like, you know, they kind of didn't have a chance.

1188
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,380
So and here's the interesting thing, is of course the way liquidation sales usually work

1189
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,100
is that, you know, they will be, by the way, it doesn't affect Canada.

1190
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,500
Circuit City Canada is still going because it's not the US, so you don't have a US bankruptcy

1191
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
thing.

1192
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
So Circuit City Canada is still fine.

1193
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,380
But Circuit City US, they're, you know, going under, and when a store liquidates, usually

1194
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,260
they're going to have sales for the first week, 10% off.

1195
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,900
And then the second week, 20% off, third week, 30% off.

1196
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,060
Well here's the thing is that people are already snatching up the TVs, the Xboxes and all this

1197
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,300
stuff, because they're like, OMG, 10% off.

1198
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,260
Well, Circuit City was marking half this shit up to begin with, which is probably part of

1199
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,700
the reason they're going under.

1200
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,900
So you're really sadly not going to say much.

1201
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,020
Actually they're doing some stuff 10, some stuff 20, and some stuff 30, all in the same

1202
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,020
week, so.

1203
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,020
Oh interesting.

1204
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,020
I haven't been to the one here yet.

1205
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,020
Did you check it out already?

1206
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,500
Nathan went, that's where he was going to look for his RAM or whatever, so.

1207
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Oh okay, interesting.

1208
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Good luck with that.

1209
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
I know.

1210
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,140
So I was like, all the good stuff's going to be gone already, I'm sure it went this

1211
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,140
weekend.

1212
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,140
Probably.

1213
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,940
So all that's going to be left is like DVD and CDs of bands you've never heard of, probably.

1214
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,300
Yeah, we went over to Circuit City the other day to look at their, this was before I got

1215
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,700
my new car stereo.

1216
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,260
They actually had less stereos than Walmart did.

1217
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,940
I mean, Walmart has a pretty pathetic car stereo section, I mean, I think Circuit City

1218
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,940
had like eight.

1219
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,620
I didn't know that Walmart had a car section, or car stereo.

1220
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:04,300
Yeah, they're very, they're, they suck, you know, I was like, looking for a price for

1221
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,380
one of them, and the woman's like, be on that shelf over here!

1222
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,980
Just like, what the fuck?

1223
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Well they all just lost their jobs, I mean, they're fine.

1224
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
No, I'm talking about Walmart.

1225
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,980
Oh.

1226
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,900
This woman's not going anywhere, she's a bitch, but yeah.

1227
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,740
It's like Mrs. Crabtree, like, sit down!

1228
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,740
Shut up!

1229
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,180
The Circuit City people were back smoking or talking to each other or something like

1230
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,300
that, they were nowhere to be found.

1231
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,580
I always, see, here's the thing, I always liked shopping at Circuit City, actually.

1232
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,860
I liked going to Circuit City to shop because it was never crowded, and there was never

1233
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:36,140
any lines, because nobody was there.

1234
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,820
I mean, honestly, I mean, I hate to be rude, but it was actually kind of a selling point

1235
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,820
to me.

1236
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,420
Remember that one time, back when they were selling Weez and stuff, and we went, we drove

1237
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,180
by the Circuit City, and there was like, no one there?

1238
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,200
Yeah, it was the night the Weez came out, and Best Buy had a line like, going around

1239
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,300
the block, remember we went out, like, when the Weez came out, we were giving out, what

1240
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,220
was it, orange soda, and so we were trying to sell our show to locals, and so we did

1241
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,740
that, went to Best Buy, and then Circuit City had like, five people.

1242
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,020
Wow, that's great.

1243
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,020
Poor guys.

1244
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,020
I feel bad, you know there's someone who listens to this show who works for Circuit City, who

1245
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:14,020
just loves their job, who's a little pissed, that we're riffing on them a little bit, and

1246
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,220
it does suck, you know.

1247
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,460
You know, I have friends, actually, from school that worked at Circuit City, but they kind

1248
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,780
of knew it was coming, you know, they've been looking for a little while for another job,

1249
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,300
you know, like, they had something lined up, they knew this was gonna happen, so, I mean,

1250
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,780
it sucks, but, they prepared, you know, they've known.

1251
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,020
Well, I hope that's the case, so, good luck to all those that were impacted, and unless

1252
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,580
you were part of the reason Circuit City went under, like, you're one of these upper managements

1253
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,380
that didn't know what you were doing, then, well, sucks, doesn't it?

1254
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:50,540
Alright, well, apparently there was a story about this dog that was as dead as Circuit

1255
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,300
City for at least a moment.

1256
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Wow.

1257
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:01,500
Apparently a woman in Michigan nearly killed her dog when she accidentally struck it on

1258
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,540
the temple with a Wii remote.

1259
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,740
Yes, she was busy doing some Wii Sports bowling, didn't have the wrist strap on or something

1260
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,740
like that, and the Wii remote went straight and hit the dog in the temple, killing him

1261
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,740
instantly.

1262
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,300
Poor doggy!

1263
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:27,340
But then, luckily though, the dog, Ozzy, was not moving and stuff, so they called a neighbor

1264
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:33,460
who apparently had some veterinary training, and she was able to revive the dog using mouth-to-mouth.

1265
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:38,980
But the dog had to be taken to the real vet, where, you know, apparently it had some severe

1266
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:44,540
brain swelling due to cardiac arrest, but the dog, you know, apparently is fine now.

1267
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,540
Yay!

1268
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,060
Wait, she had to kiss the dog on the mouth?

1269
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,060
Not kiss.

1270
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,060
Yeah, full-on, like, mouth-to-mouth.

1271
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,020
No, no, it's not mouth-to-mouth, it's actually nose.

1272
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,020
You have to blow down the dog's nose.

1273
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,020
Oh.

1274
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,020
Okay, well.

1275
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,940
I love dogs, but not that much.

1276
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Aww.

1277
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,300
Hey, if my cat was dying, I'd do that.

1278
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,700
Fuck that, it's my cat.

1279
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,700
Fuck that.

1280
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,700
It's a family.

1281
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,700
It's got these boogers on its nose.

1282
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,700
I'm gonna...

1283
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,700
No, I understand.

1284
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,700
Yeah, that'd be like, I'm happy.

1285
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,780
Oh, Irene's dying, but her breath kinda smells...

1286
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,220
Hey, I wouldn't blame you, Matt.

1287
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,460
I think I'm just gonna let her die, you know?

1288
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,340
Rob, I'm never gonna give you, like, mouth-to-nose.

1289
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,340
I mean, you're dear to me, but that's nasty, and I wouldn't...

1290
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,540
Just let me die, right?

1291
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,540
Maybe your mouth, but your nose.

1292
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,540
Hell nah.

1293
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,540
Aww, the dog is...

1294
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,980
And then when I wake up, I'd be like, ew, why are you trying to kiss me, pervert?

1295
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,420
And then I'd throw a Wii Mode at your temple, and like, hope you die.

1296
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,780
That's wrong, you shouldn't joke about that.

1297
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,780
You don't know.

1298
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,780
I know, it's a cute puppy.

1299
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,780
Alright.

1300
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,780
Aww.

1301
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,620
And then later, pretty soon, there will be video of these Wii accidents, as if there

1302
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,940
aren't enough already, of people destroying their TVs and stuff, showing up on YouTube.

1303
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,100
And the ironic thing now is that it'll be much easier to watch someone break their Wii

1304
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,100
on a Wii.

1305
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,900
And the reason why I say that is that, you know, who doesn't love to watch YouTube?

1306
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,260
Like when you're having a party, and somebody says, hey, did you see that thing on Saturday

1307
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,260
Night Live?

1308
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,940
Hurry up, let's look it up on YouTube before they remove it.

1309
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,220
You run onto YouTube, right, and you get it on the TV, but unfortunately, YouTube kinda

1310
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,860
sucks to look at on the TV, right?

1311
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:21,540
Well now, YouTube has launched a special site, it's at www.youtube.com slash TV, and if you

1312
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:26,820
go to the site on your PlayStation 3 or your Nintendo Wii, it's a new site that's like,

1313
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,540
optimized for those.

1314
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:35,140
So it's much easier to browse YouTube, and yeah, and I've heard great things about it.

1315
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,940
So props to YouTube for finally, a year later, getting their site optimized to use on the

1316
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
TV.

1317
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
That's great.

1318
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,580
I was gonna say, though, that there is a video, I guess it's a news report about the dog that

1319
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:51,260
died on YouTube, so it's, if you search for a woman's, they have a, what is it, a dog

1320
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,180
killed by Wii Remote, and then you can-

1321
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,580
Wait, but the dog actually lived!

1322
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
The dog lived!

1323
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,580
He was only dead for five minutes.

1324
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,700
Okay, cause I don't, you know, it's-

1325
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,180
Which makes him a zombie!

1326
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,700
Wait, he was dead for five minutes?

1327
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
Yes.

1328
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,500
I thought you could start getting, like, brain damage after, like, three or four minutes.

1329
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Doctor dumb.

1330
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
So, you know-

1331
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,700
Like, what are they gonna damage?

1332
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,700
You know?

1333
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,980
I guess that's true.

1334
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,980
Aww, that's what makes them adorable, though.

1335
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,900
And it's one of those dogs, I forget what they call it, it's not a collie, but it's,

1336
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,900
um-

1337
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,900
It's like Lassie?

1338
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,900
It's like a miniature collie or something, what do they call it?

1339
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,500
Yeah, it's like a mini Lassie.

1340
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,140
She killed Lassie!

1341
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,140
Yeah.

1342
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,580
Border collie?

1343
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Is the normal thing?

1344
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,580
Right?

1345
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,100
I don't know if it's a border collie, it's like a miniature collie, I don't know.

1346
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,100
Cause border collies are a little bit bigger.

1347
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,100
Man, I don't know.

1348
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,100
They're, like, Lassie-sized.

1349
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Yeah.

1350
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,100
That's what Lassie is, a border collie.

1351
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,100
Anyways.

1352
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,100
Sorry.

1353
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,380
Distracted by the dog.

1354
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:54,140
So, there's some other interesting stuff, a little bit more positive, I guess, for Nintendo.

1355
00:59:54,140 --> 01:00:02,660
There's a new patent that shows Nintendo is possibly working on a motion-sensing DS card.

1356
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,340
Perhaps, you know, something that was similar to, like, what they had for the Game Boy Advance,

1357
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,620
you know, for different games.

1358
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,700
I think one of the Warioware games had it.

1359
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,860
But it's a DS direction-sensing card.

1360
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,860
Hmm.

1361
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,260
No word on what it's gonna be used for, but it's something that has built-in direction

1362
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,260
and motion tracking.

1363
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,980
So, I can get my iPhone's games ported to my DS, because that's what I see happening

1364
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,980
when this comes out, is that now we'll just get ports of iPhone games on the DS.

1365
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Yeah.

1366
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,980
With that whole little TILTI thing.

1367
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,020
I can get Silent Hill The Escape on my DS.

1368
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,020
Wouldn't that be fabulous?

1369
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,020
Wow.

1370
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,020
That's exactly what you wanted, huh?

1371
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,020
I know.

1372
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,020
Okay.

1373
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,580
No, they didn't do a Silent Hill game on the DS.

1374
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,220
They did a Resident Evil game on the DS, and that was not very good.

1375
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,420
Was there, like, a play novel or something that was on the DS?

1376
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:53,060
But a motion-sensing card, I mean, those DS cards are not exactly that big, so that's

1377
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,060
pretty impressive.

1378
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,980
I would think that they would just do, well, the actual chips that do the motion-sensing

1379
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,900
are really super tiny, so it could be done.

1380
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:07,940
It's just, I don't know, and really, I mean, you can have those things kind of hang out

1381
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:13,180
of the slot a little bit, you know, because I remember with, like, the WarioWare one that

1382
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,660
they had, it was pretty big.

1383
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,700
I mean, I guess technology was a little bit older then, but, you know, the card itself

1384
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:25,260
was huge compared to what normal Game Boy Advance, you know, cards look like, so.

1385
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,260
Very interesting.

1386
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,260
I like this comment in chat.

1387
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,860
Sy says this in chat room, what the hell?

1388
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,020
Why not have that in the DSi?

1389
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,220
A new system is just out and already an add-on that should be built in.

1390
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,820
Yeah, exactly.

1391
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:40,140
Just like the Wii Motion Plus, something that should have been done in the first place.

1392
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,300
Because Nintendo really cares about its customer base.

1393
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,020
Damn it, we're not getting into that argument.

1394
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:51,500
Well, alright, I guess we'll see what comes to this, or what possible game they could

1395
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,740
be making with this, who knows, but, uh.

1396
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,880
It's gonna suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

1397
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,380
It's gonna be like Wii Sports for the DS or something, can you imagine that?

1398
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,380
Wii Bowling, people throwing their DSs, oh no, I broke my DS, like, guess I gotta go

1399
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,820
buy a new DSi, I see conspiracy here.

1400
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:16,060
Well this will be an interesting game when it comes out, Final Fantasy Legend 2 is being

1401
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,220
remade for the DS.

1402
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,100
Wait, is that the Game Boy one?

1403
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,100
Yes.

1404
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,660
Okay, the one that's not really like Final Fantasy, the one that's more like part of

1405
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,660
the Saga series?

1406
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:31,700
You got it, it was actually Saga 2, Hiho Densetsu, and that was Final Fantasy Legend

1407
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,700
here.

1408
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,700
I love when you pronounce Japanese.

1409
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,700
Shut up.

1410
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:40,340
But yeah, it's getting the full 3D little views and things, kind of like Final Fantasy

1411
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,420
4 and the Dragon Quest games have had, so that's being released here.

1412
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:49,660
Awesome, I actually think I still have Final Fantasy Legend 2 or 3 on my old Game Boy cartridge.

1413
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:54,020
Yeah, and in this Japanese magazine, they are definitely selling it as Saga 2, so.

1414
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,020
Awesome.

1415
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,020
Yeah.

1416
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,020
I liked the Saga series, I'm like the only person in the world.

1417
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,620
Maybe they'll call it Saga when it comes out over here instead of Final Fantasy.

1418
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Um, maybe, because it would be very weird to have Final Fantasy Legend 2 come out over

1419
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,980
here, you know, and it would be kind of like, well, whatever happened to the first two,

1420
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,060
because who remembers that far back of the Game Boy, you know?

1421
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,940
Well, yeah, I guess that's true.

1422
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,020
Let's just hope that they never do a Mystic Quest remake.

1423
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,500
I somehow don't see that happening.

1424
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,620
Mystic Quest wasn't terrible.

1425
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,620
But it wasn't good.

1426
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,220
Yeah, I'll just leave it at that, it wasn't terrible.

1427
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,220
Anyhow.

1428
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,220
Anyways.

1429
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,220
That's it.

1430
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:35,460
So, yes, it figures that the homebrew community, of course, is doing something that Nintendo

1431
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,060
isn't doing on their own.

1432
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:43,860
A new device has come out, Matrix Wii Z.

1433
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:52,740
It's being prototyped right now, but it basically is sort of a mod chip that plugs into your

1434
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,740
Wii system.

1435
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,660
There's actually no modification really being done to the hardware, it's just a plug mod,

1436
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,780
so you unhook one of the ribbon cables, plug it into this mod device, and then plug another

1437
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,700
ribbon cable into where you'd normally plug the original ribbon cable.

1438
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:13,020
It sounds kind of complicated, but what this actually does, it will allow you to not only

1439
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:20,100
do the same stuff as a normal mod chip, but it has a connector for a SATA external HD

1440
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:27,380
or a hard drive, so you can attach an external hard drive to the Wii.

1441
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,380
And so I can put...

1442
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,440
So, well, they say that you can put ISO's on there and stuff like that and actually

1443
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,340
run pirated games for them, but you can...

1444
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,940
Oh, I wouldn't want to encourage people to do that.

1445
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,940
No, no, no.

1446
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,540
You can also, it will, the system itself will look at it like it's part of the actual storage

1447
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,960
on the device, so you can, you know, use it for storing games.

1448
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:52,420
But this, yeah, you can actually store ISO's and stuff, so.

1449
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,660
Rob just tried to rape me.

1450
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,920
Well, you were falling asleep, so I went over there to give you a lap dance, and I was getting

1451
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,920
a cookie.

1452
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,920
So, because...

1453
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,140
I'm frightened.

1454
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:03,740
All I hear is blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, and I'm not hearing...

1455
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,260
You shoved your dong in her face, okay?

1456
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,020
I did not shove my dong in her face.

1457
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,620
You were like, how many licks does it take, and you were like, I'm waving your dong in

1458
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,620
her face.

1459
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,380
No, I waved a snickerdoodle in her face.

1460
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,860
Oh, yeah, that's what they call it, your snickerdoodle.

1461
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,580
And that's why you thrusted your nut sack in my face.

1462
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,200
I was like, oh my gooses.

1463
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,980
You make it sound like I'm not wearing pants or something.

1464
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,980
You're not.

1465
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:32,020
But yeah, it's basically, this device will allow super fast loading of ISOs in homebrew,

1466
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,020
so.

1467
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,020
Yeah.

1468
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,020
Awesome.

1469
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,020
Hooray.

1470
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,060
I'm sorry, I was just hearing blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, a system that

1471
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,460
doesn't have any games out on it I care about, blah, blah, blah.

1472
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,020
But Rob, what?

1473
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,380
They're doing, you know, the new play control...

1474
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,260
Yes, that's a title that they stuck with, you know, for instead of play on the Wii,

1475
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:57,420
you know, new play control, Mario, was it Mario Power Tennis and the new play control

1476
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,420
Pikmin.

1477
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,100
Aren't you excited about those?

1478
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,260
I mean, those games are totally new and not ever been out on the GameCube.

1479
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,140
Oh, wait, no, they have.

1480
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,140
Sad.

1481
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,220
Irene, care to comment on anything?

1482
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,900
What Wii games are you looking forward to, Irene?

1483
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,020
I'm dying to know.

1484
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,980
You know, things and stuff.

1485
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,180
That's probably actually a Wii game that's coming out with things and stuff.

1486
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,180
Things and stuff.

1487
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,060
When it's a collection of mini games.

1488
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,060
That's what it is.

1489
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,060
Yay.

1490
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,060
Things and stuff.

1491
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,100
Sounds like a dream game to me.

1492
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,100
You too?

1493
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,100
Oh my gosh.

1494
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Shut up.

1495
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,420
Is that coming out on the Wii in April?

1496
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,420
On April 4th.

1497
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,420
Can't wait.

1498
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,420
Things and stuff.

1499
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,420
Yeah.

1500
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,420
Shut up.

1501
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,340
They said I'll wave my dong in people's faces, okay?

1502
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,380
That's one of the mini games, actually, in things and stuff.

1503
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,380
No, I'm never buying that game then.

1504
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,940
You take your thingy and wave it in Victoria's face.

1505
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,900
Yeah, take your stuff.

1506
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,900
Yup.

1507
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,620
Well, hey, whatever Nintendo's doing, it's working, because do you know how many Wiis

1508
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,460
they sold in December?

1509
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,160
Five million consoles sold by Nintendo in December, although that's a little bit...

1510
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,540
It's actually not Wiis alone.

1511
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:11,580
It was actually the DS sold three million, and the Wii sold two million, so you put it

1512
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,780
together, they sold five million systems that Nintendo moved.

1513
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,780
That's a lot of dead Collies.

1514
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,980
Matt!

1515
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:26,220
Matt's gonna wipe out the Collie species off this plant.

1516
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,220
You are terrible.

1517
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,660
Lassie will be just a memory.

1518
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,700
Well, she is, but she's dead.

1519
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,700
Look, that's okay.

1520
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,500
And Timmy will be stuck in the well forever.

1521
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,300
Where's Jamie here to yell at you?

1522
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,660
But look, the reason why this is newsworthy is December, hello, Christmas.

1523
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,540
So these are the numbers that were going into the Christmas and what ended up under people's

1524
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,540
trees.

1525
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:58,980
So, yeah, three million DS's, two million Wiis, one and a half about million Xbox 360s,

1526
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,740
one million PSPs, three quarters of a million PS3s.

1527
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,740
Big surprise.

1528
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,020
And not even half a million PS2s, but still, you know, going in there.

1529
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,900
Yeah, it's kind of an old system, so that's actually pretty good.

1530
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,900
Dark Tetsuya says OLR's gonna get an angry email from PETA.

1531
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:21,740
I hope we do, because Jamie would have to read it.

1532
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,260
And Jamie is very opinionated when it comes to PETA.

1533
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,140
So I would actually, I welcome them to write the email, please, by all means.

1534
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,140
Come on the show.

1535
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,580
In fact, I totally encourage people going out and murdering animals with Wii remotes

1536
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,580
and controllers.

1537
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,340
And why stop at the Wii?

1538
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:43,180
I mean, hell, look at the original Xbox controller.

1539
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:49,020
That thing is like a blunt object of death.

1540
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,020
Try dropping an original Xbox on a dog?

1541
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,020
God, I hope the kids know he's not serious.

1542
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,020
Oh, they'd never survive.

1543
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,020
Please, please.

1544
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,020
You can take out like three dogs with that thing.

1545
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,020
Oh, God, am I really here right now?

1546
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,020
Yeah, three like great veins with those.

1547
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,020
Am I really here?

1548
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,180
Like, Christ.

1549
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,180
If we get sued, I don't want any part of this.

1550
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,180
You know, you're gonna get sued by.

1551
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,180
I'm distancing myself.

1552
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,180
I love PETA or some shit.

1553
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,460
Did you ever see Mythbusters where they were, there was the myth where they dropped the

1554
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,780
frozen turkey on a dog and to see what kind of damage it would do.

1555
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:16,380
So they made this like analog dog and they dropped the turkey on it and it just shattered

1556
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,380
the dog.

1557
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,260
So can you imagine what happened with an Xbox?

1558
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,100
I mean, those things are heavy.

1559
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,020
Oh, oh, frozen Xbox.

1560
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,020
Oh, my God.

1561
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,020
Frozen Xbox.

1562
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:30,620
You drop it and then the world like breaks in half because it's so way out of this show.

1563
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,620
It's not ridiculous.

1564
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,620
Could happen.

1565
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,620
Yes.

1566
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,620
I do.

1567
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,620
You know what?

1568
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,860
It's the Wii Fit Balance Board.

1569
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:43,220
I mean, that thing is pretty big and it does wake a bit.

1570
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,220
It's pretty sizable.

1571
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,220
It's pretty sizable.

1572
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,220
You could.

1573
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,780
I'm not advocating anything.

1574
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,180
I'm just saying it could happen.

1575
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,060
Matt's the one who's saying you should kill animals.

1576
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,380
I'd like to drop a frozen turkey on Miley Cyrus.

1577
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,460
I don't know about anybody else out there.

1578
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,460
Kill that bitch.

1579
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,700
She gets to fucking die.

1580
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,220
Hey, have you seen the trailer for the new movie?

1581
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,220
No.

1582
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,220
Tyra Banks is in it.

1583
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,060
Oh, shit.

1584
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,060
I might have to go.

1585
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,660
See, that's what I would, if I had a radio show, I'd be all about celebrities and all

1586
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,660
that shit.

1587
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,660
Me and Rob talked about it for a while.

1588
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,660
This is a possibility.

1589
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:15,660
This is a kind of possibility.

1590
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,660
I think it'd be pretty fierce.

1591
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,660
Maybe.

1592
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,660
Yep.

1593
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,660
All right.

1594
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,660
I don't know.

1595
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,660
That's enough of me saying stuff that's...

1596
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,660
Yes, please.

1597
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,660
Can we get some release dates for God's sake?

1598
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,660
No.

1599
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,660
I guess.

1600
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:26,660
Whatever.

1601
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,660
Oh, perfect.

1602
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,460
Anyways, so this week we've got a few things coming out.

1603
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,460
I mean, it's January.

1604
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
It's pretty slow still.

1605
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,340
There's some good stuff.

1606
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,820
Star Ocean Second Evolution for the PSP.

1607
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:37,940
That's going to be a pretty good game.

1608
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:43,900
You know, some of these Square Enix PSP games are doing very well, so that one's awesome.

1609
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,700
Jumble Madness for the DS.

1610
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,020
It's a bunch of word puzzles and stuff, hooray.

1611
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,140
Big Bang Mini on the DS.

1612
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,260
We actually played this, I think, at South Peaks booth.

1613
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,260
Pretty fun.

1614
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:01,180
It's kind of a little bit like, what was it, Fanavision and a space shooter type game.

1615
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,180
Yeah, it was neat.

1616
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,180
Yeah.

1617
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,060
Something that needs a die and a fire.

1618
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,060
Imagine Fashion Party.

1619
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,060
Yeah, no thanks.

1620
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,060
Let's see here.

1621
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:14,060
So these are the games I'm going to get for Victoria, because she loved this type of game.

1622
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,060
Imagine Fashion...

1623
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,060
Okay, look.

1624
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,060
No, no, no, no.

1625
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,000
This bitch right here.

1626
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,700
We were walking through Walmart, and we got to the section with the top model clothes,

1627
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,020
and she was like, oh, top model.

1628
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,900
I got a top model tank top for Christmas, so bite me.

1629
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:34,540
Can you imagine the possibilities with that game?

1630
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,300
Shut up.

1631
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,300
Let's see here.

1632
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:44,140
I was going to say, also, the Ultimate Shooting Collection on the Wii.

1633
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,980
It's three Japanese arcade shooter games.

1634
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,980
They're actually pretty good.

1635
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,380
I'm trying to remember what was in it.

1636
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:56,660
It was Cororius, Radio Allergy, and I don't remember the last one that was in there.

1637
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:01,140
But really, bullet hell shooter games.

1638
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,140
Oh.

1639
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,140
Okay.

1640
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,020
That's cool.

1641
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,060
Wonder World Amusement Park for the DS.

1642
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,860
A bunch of mini games on there.

1643
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:14,460
Artonaliko 2, the Melody of Melofechesa, I guess.

1644
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,640
I don't know.

1645
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,640
Was that a Disney villain?

1646
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,640
Melofechesa?

1647
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,640
No, I'm sorry.

1648
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
I totally butchered that.

1649
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,860
The Melody of Metapholycia, I guess.

1650
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,860
I don't know.

1651
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,860
Felicio?

1652
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,860
I'm so done with that.

1653
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,860
Okay.

1654
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,860
With some extra crap.

1655
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,860
It's on the PS2.

1656
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,860
Wow.

1657
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:36,660
The subtitle to that, none of which I just said.

1658
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
So there you go.

1659
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:45,940
Anyways, Skate 2 is coming out on PS3 and 360 this week as well.

1660
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:52,220
And let's see here, tying in perfectly what we were talking about just before I started

1661
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,100
talking about release dates.

1662
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:59,700
Sim animals, another sim game where you get to control the wonders of nature.

1663
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:04,860
In fact, they actually have this hand, which is the pointer, and you can poke badgers and

1664
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,680
stuff and they will attack your hand.

1665
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
It's awesome.

1666
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,880
Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger.

1667
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,580
Is it football or mushroom?

1668
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,580
Mushroom.

1669
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,580
It's football, isn't it?

1670
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:17,580
I don't know.

1671
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,580
I think it's mushroom.

1672
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,580
It's mushroom.

1673
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,580
Yeah, it's okay.

1674
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:21,740
But that'll be out on the Wii and the DS.

1675
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,280
So awesome.

1676
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,300
Can you simulate, you know, dropping stuff on your animals?

1677
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,620
You can throw animals.

1678
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:34,360
I saw them shaking a squirrel violently, so I'm sure you can throw rocks at them.

1679
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
Why would you shake a squirrel?

1680
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,600
Or maybe feed them to other things.

1681
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,280
Are you done with US release dates?

1682
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,720
We need to take, like, the bear in that game and just feed it all sorts of animals, and

1683
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,840
they'll become rabid and just eat things.

1684
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,840
I know.

1685
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
Very rare bear.

1686
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,160
I'm trying my hardest, okay?

1687
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,800
It just never works.

1688
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,200
Moving on to the UK and the release dates over there.

1689
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
We need a British accent.

1690
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
British accent.

1691
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,600
Oh, you want me to do it in British accent?

1692
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,840
I do, yes please.

1693
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,280
Well, I really annoy everybody overseas when I talk like this.

1694
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,280
It's a really bad British accent, I'll give you that.

1695
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,280
It's a really bad one.

1696
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,280
Do you want to read these in British accent, Victoria?

1697
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,280
No, I don't want to read them in British accent.

1698
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Why not?

1699
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,280
Because.

1700
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,280
I think you should.

1701
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
Why?

1702
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,280
Well, do you want me to get you some tea and some crumpets?

1703
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Put you in the mood?

1704
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,280
I don't like tea and crumpets.

1705
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,280
Okay.

1706
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,280
Okay, knock it off.

1707
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,880
If you're going to talk in an accent, talk like you're from New York, alright?

1708
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,880
Don't be such a wanker.

1709
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,880
Alright.

1710
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,880
You're a wanker.

1711
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:30,800
On the 20th, I'm going to get so much hate mail this week.

1712
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,800
On the 23rd.

1713
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,200
British accent.

1714
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:47,280
On the 23rd, Football Manager Live is coming to the PC and Neopets Puzzle Adventures coming

1715
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,920
out as well on the DS and the PFC and the Wii.

1716
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,480
I don't know who's bloody playing Neopets, but somebody is for sure.

1717
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:04,640
On Skate 2 comes out for the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1718
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:11,280
I'm not doing a Japanese accent for the Japanese releases.

1719
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,280
Stop it.

1720
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,280
Left 4 Dead comes out.

1721
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:18,520
The Japanese version on January 22nd on the Xbox 360.

1722
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,040
The Playstation 3.

1723
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,600
See, she can do that because she's actually Asian.

1724
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,840
I do it and I'm a racist.

1725
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,960
Well you are.

1726
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:37,600
Playstation 3, Prince of Persia, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, and Juice 2 all getting releases

1727
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,520
in Japan.

1728
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:49,960
And on the Nintendo Wii, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Fragile, Sayonara, Suki no Haikayo,

1729
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,080
Suzumiya Harui no Gekidou comes out as well.

1730
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080
What?

1731
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,080
You want to read them?

1732
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,080
No.

1733
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
You think you can do better?

1734
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,080
Probably.

1735
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,680
I think anybody could do better.

1736
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
I'm sorry.

1737
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,360
Playstation 2.

1738
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:10,800
Some price reductions for Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.

1739
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,640
On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer comes out as well as Rayman what?

1740
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,080
When you said that, you said Destroy All Humans and Juice 2, but I thought you said Juice

1741
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,080
2.

1742
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,480
It sounded like Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.

1743
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,720
I'm like, but they're humans too.

1744
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:37,080
You know, I don't even think that would be acceptable in Japan, let alone here.

1745
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,920
I know they get away with some pretty crazy stuff, but not that.

1746
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,240
That was awful.

1747
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,880
Man, our show has really gone downhill.

1748
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
It has.

1749
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,480
We lose Jamie and seriously, it just goes to shit.

1750
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,320
It's Rob's fault because he can't do a good British accent.

1751
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,400
I know, my British accent single-handedly ruined the show.

1752
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:05,040
On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Te Guato DS Series

1753
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,320
1, Tetsudo Data File.

1754
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,240
What the hell that is.

1755
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,640
But a game called Zubo is coming out in Japan, I bet that's pretty awesome.

1756
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,640
So there you go.

1757
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,640
Wow.

1758
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Zubo?

1759
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,640
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,920
I think that's a music game that's from EA.

1761
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,920
They look like crap.

1762
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:32,920
And on the Sony PSP, we have Patapon 2 comes out.

1763
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,520
At least the Chinese version comes out in other Asian territories.

1764
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,400
Ratchet and Clank gets a price reduction.

1765
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:46,400
Looks like the only new game, Hokuto no Ken Rao Gaiden, Ten no Haoa comes out.

1766
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
That's what it's called.

1767
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Totally.

1768
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,480
Sort of.

1769
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,240
It's a fighting game coming out on the PSP.

1770
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,240
There you go.

1771
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Good times.

1772
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,280
There's your Japanese releases.

1773
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
Let's move on with the news.

1774
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,280
I need a break.

1775
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
Oh, those were Japanese?

1776
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
We need to get to...

1777
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
We need to get to the end of the par day.

1778
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,720
I need to go flush my head down the toilet.

1779
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,720
Alright.

1780
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:11,880
Well, there's lots of download content coming to our music games here.

1781
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:19,200
Starting off with Guitar Hero World Tour, they're getting a Travis Barker track pack.

1782
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:29,040
And featured in there will be What's My Age Again by Blink-182, Lo, the Travis Barker

1783
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:40,560
remix by Flo Rida, featuring T-Pain, and Looks Like a Lycanthrope by Plus44.

1784
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:49,680
And that'll be available for 160 Microsoft points per track, or 440 for the entire bundle.

1785
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,680
And no word on what the real money is.

1786
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:57,480
I think, what is it, 160 is two bucks per.

1787
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:03,120
And let's see, Rock Band is getting some interesting stuff.

1788
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:11,400
Steve Miller, there's gonna be a Steve Miller Band 3-pack with Space Cowboy, Take the Money

1789
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,440
and Run, and The Joker.

1790
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,920
All of those will be available for 160 Microsoft points each, or $2.

1791
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,560
And the pack will run you 440 Microsoft points, or $5.49.

1792
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:30,880
And then the individual songs, you'll be getting I Stand Alone by Godsmack, Feed the Tree by

1793
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:37,360
Belly, Wind Me Up by Ghost Hounds, Typical by Mute Math, and Warzone by Rob Zombie.

1794
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,120
And if I remember correctly, I think Warzone says new single.

1795
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,320
And all those will be available for...

1796
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,320
Where's Dragula?

1797
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,320
That song's awesome.

1798
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,040
And I wanna play that on Rock Band.

1799
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,040
Well that's...

1800
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,760
It's back in the 90s, Rob.

1801
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,280
Shut up, I hate you.

1802
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,280
Anything.

1803
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:58,080
Warzone wasn't that good from what I remember, I actually bought that.

1804
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,600
So it was okay.

1805
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,000
Not worth the single though.

1806
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,720
It's a shame.

1807
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Yes.

1808
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:11,240
Finally, Lips, the karaoke game, has some stuff coming out for the rest of this month.

1809
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:19,360
Available, actually came out earlier this week, When I Grow Up by the Pussycat Dolls.

1810
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,360
You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling by the Righteous Brothers, and Erased Rewind by the Carnagans.

1811
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,200
Those all came out on the 16th.

1812
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,120
I love that song.

1813
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:37,160
Next week, we've got, let's see, on the 23rd here, Hate That I Love You by Rihanna featuring

1814
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:43,280
Neo, and Thanks for the Memories by Fall Out Boy.

1815
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,200
Yes, they're so hip that they don't use vowels in their...

1816
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,480
We need to have Victoria just sing these songs as Loki reads them.

1817
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,480
Yes, awesome.

1818
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,960
I'm doing it anyway.

1819
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,120
And then finally, Look What You've Done by Jet.

1820
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,400
I don't know that one.

1821
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,120
Look What You've Done, no I don't think that's it.

1822
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:08,720
Alright, and then finally on January 30th, Sunday Morning by Maroon 5, Take a Bow by

1823
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,840
Rihanna, and Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men.

1824
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,880
Wow, what is up with these random old songs like Belly Feed the Tree, like oh man, I was

1825
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:24,720
so glad that made a comeback, and then like Boyz II Men, one of their songs that was not

1826
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,880
even all that popular, like wow, okay, I guess.

1827
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,600
Some comments from chat I gotta read.

1828
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,160
Retertainment says, Why pay for tracks from Lips when I can steal them from Bittorrent

1829
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,160
sites?

1830
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,280
Plug in my iPod and play them for free.

1831
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:44,320
Because it's not quite the same, and I think these actually come with the videos and stuff.

1832
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,560
Leo Shen says, Where the fuck is my love fool and my favorite game?

1833
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,400
Love Fools in Sing Star, for whatever it's worth, and it has the original video, not

1834
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,800
the one they did in the US.

1835
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,800
It's like the old school one.

1836
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,800
I like your Race and Rewind.

1837
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,800
That's a good song.

1838
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,800
I do too.

1839
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,200
I like my favorite game too, and I don't know what a good karaoke song that would be.

1840
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:05,280
That's more of a, that other series, the racing series had that in one of their ads.

1841
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,280
Gran Turismo?

1842
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Yeah.

1843
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,280
Two.

1844
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,280
My favorite game was like in the commercial?

1845
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,280
It was, yeah.

1846
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,280
It was a song in the game, wasn't it?

1847
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,280
Mm-hmm.

1848
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,280
Yeah.

1849
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,280
Alright.

1850
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,400
My favorite game was also, I think, one of the Euro DDR games.

1851
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,400
Well speaking of...

1852
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,000
I don't know, I could be completely wrong on that, but that's a guess.

1853
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,320
Speaking of awesome music games, this news has me very, very happy.

1854
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:34,240
The Harmonics CEO Alex Rigopoulos was interviewed with Ars Technica recently, and he has basically

1855
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,720
professed his love for Amplitude.

1856
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
You might remember that game.

1857
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,840
Harmonics, these are the games they did before Guitar Hero, Amplitude and Frequency.

1858
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,480
Well, he was basically confirming that he does want to eventually revive the series.

1859
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,480
Yay!

1860
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
Excited!

1861
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,480
That'd be awesome.

1862
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,120
So the only problem is Sony actually owns that property.

1863
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,400
Harmonics developed it, I guess, for Sony.

1864
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,200
So you ain't gonna see this on Xbox.

1865
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,840
It would probably be like a PlayStation Network type game.

1866
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,680
But hell, I don't mind.

1867
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,800
I would love to see this game make a comeback because, you know, there's certain songs that

1868
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,160
you can only get in these types of games.

1869
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,280
You're not gonna get in like a rock band type game.

1870
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,920
So I am definitely for this.

1871
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,920
I hope...

1872
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,920
I hope they do it.

1873
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:18,560
They really need to like, revive some of those older rhythm games, like from the 90s and

1874
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,560
early 2000s.

1875
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,480
Like Guitar Freaks, and then they'll make a game called Rock...

1876
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,480
Oh.

1877
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,840
GS68 says, did Harmonics also do Karaoke Revolution with Konami?

1878
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
They did.

1879
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,840
They did.

1880
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,120
They developed the first couple versions.

1881
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,880
And then, by the time I think they got to like, Karaoke Country, I think finally Harmonics

1882
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,880
split off.

1883
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,880
And Konami did it themselves.

1884
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,840
Harmonics is like, okay, we're not doing Country, fuck that.

1885
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,840
Something like that, yeah.

1886
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,840
Just kidding.

1887
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,440
That's exactly how it went down.

1888
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,440
All right.

1889
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,080
So we're gonna get into the classic video game of the week.

1890
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,800
It's a little part of the show where we like to pay homage to a game from yesteryear.

1891
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,200
A game from the past.

1892
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,400
And Dark Sakura is not here tonight to do this, so this is the part where Loki and I

1893
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
will fill in.

1894
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,200
I guess we're gonna do your game tonight, because I did it last time.

1895
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,840
So Loki is gonna pick a game for us this week.

1896
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,000
A classic video game that he thinks everybody out there on the internet who listens to our

1897
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
show should be playing.

1898
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,440
Loki, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

1899
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,200
You know, I didn't know.

1900
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,240
But actually, I just came up with one last minute.

1901
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,040
Hooray for me!

1902
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,320
No, actually, I want to pay homage to...

1903
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:26,440
It's not even that old, I mean, I hate thinking that a Playstation 1 game is considered retro

1904
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,440
now.

1905
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:35,080
But I think one of the greatest in this game series, except for maybe Twisted Metal Black,

1906
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:40,720
but Twisted Metal 2, Twisted Metal 2, as it was known in Europe as Twisted Metal 2 World

1907
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:48,600
Tour, the second game in the vehicle combat series Twisted Metal, still one of my favorite

1908
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,080
games, and they've remade it a few different times.

1909
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:56,640
On the PSP they had Twisted Metal 2 head on, or Twisted Metal head on, I guess it was called.

1910
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,240
But basically this game, very over the top, just killing each other, and each one won

1911
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:08,480
the win the entire competition because they got a wish granted from Sweet Tooth, I believe,

1912
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,880
or Dark Tooth, or whatever the other evil guy was.

1913
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,880
I don't remember.

1914
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
It's been a while.

1915
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,760
Doesn't really matter, because who cares about the story when you're just going around major

1916
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:25,000
cities like Paris, and Moscow, and stuff like that, and just destroying all sorts of stuff.

1917
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,640
It was great.

1918
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,000
Paris, you can actually destroy the Eiffel Tower.

1919
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:38,120
LA, they had some ruins left over, I guess, from the previous Twisted Metal game.

1920
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:44,600
In, let's see here, New York, they had the rooftops, which I think was my favorite map

1921
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,200
of the entire game there.

1922
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:52,440
Antarctica, they had some glaciers that were dropping, different icebergs sinking into

1923
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,440
the ocean.

1924
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:59,440
And then Hong Kong, they had the Hong Kong Crunch, which was set in the streets of Hong

1925
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,040
Kong.

1926
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:07,040
Of course there was some different characters that were added in the game.

1927
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,600
They had Sweet Tooth, Dark Tooth, and Minion, which could be unlocked with different codes

1928
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,600
in the game.

1929
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,760
And I guess Dark Tooth was only playable on the PC version, or if you had a cheat device

1930
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:23,880
for the Playstation 1, you could play Dark Tooth that way, which is kind of cool.

1931
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:31,040
And he was a giant ice cream truck, because, yes, with a clown on top, because he was Sweet

1932
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,120
Tooth's father, if I remember correctly.

1933
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,520
Victoria actually played this game.

1934
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,360
I heard her speak up, going, I remember this game!

1935
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:43,600
Yes, because Dark Tooth was Charlie Kane, and then of course Sweet Tooth was Needles

1936
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,040
Kane, and he had the ice cream truck.

1937
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,880
Some of the other characters, Axl, which was a guy that was trapped in a vehicle, I guess,

1938
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,560
by his father, with two giant tires, and so he was playing that.

1939
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,400
Then Grasshopper, which was a dune buggy, which apparently was Calypso's daughter, and

1940
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,000
Calypso, of course, was the guy that was running the entire tournament.

1941
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,480
Mr. Grim, which was on a red motorcycle, and he consumed souls, which was kind of, sort

1942
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,560
of kind of a Ghost Rider ripoff, I guess.

1943
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,880
Minion, which was pretty fun, I think that was actually one of my favorite characters

1944
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,520
to play, and it was a black battle tank, and then of course Specter, who had a sports car

1945
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,800
with the missiles that would fly through things, like ghost missiles, and then a bunch of other

1946
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,120
stuff in there.

1947
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:43,740
Of course, I think that TwistML2, they had some levels that they cut out, that they brought

1948
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:50,360
back for TwistML head-on, the PS2 version, they brought some that they had canceled actually,

1949
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:54,800
I think they were making a, I don't know, more levels for TwistML Black that were added

1950
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,600
into that game, and it was kind of a remake of TwistML2 and the TwistML Black engine,

1951
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,800
which is pretty cool.

1952
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,560
But unfortunately we still haven't seen another TwistML game since Black, and I don't really

1953
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,720
count the PSP ones.

1954
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,840
But hey, you know, they were talking about remaking, these were adding, making a new

1955
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,160
one for PS3, and I think they should do it, because it was probably one of the best series

1956
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,720
that was on the Playstation, so.

1957
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,120
That's my classic game there.

1958
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:26,120
Alright, there you have it, Twisted Metal 2, your classic game of the week.

1959
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,120
That's a good pick.

1960
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,120
That's not, that's not good enough.

1961
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,680
That was pretty good for a last minute one, yeah.

1962
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,680
Yeah, that was good.

1963
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,040
The soccer has done Dreamcast games, and that was later in PS1.

1964
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,160
Yeah, you can tell that I totally remember all the backstory on this, because I totally

1965
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
butchered everything.

1966
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,160
That's cool.

1967
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,160
That's alright.

1968
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,160
It was last minute.

1969
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,160
You did good.

1970
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,160
You did good.

1971
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,200
Alright, so that's going to do it for part A of Orange Ons Radio, but that doesn't mean

1972
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,320
the show's over, we're just going to take a break, and we'll be back, there's plenty

1973
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,760
more where this came from.

1974
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,540
Your calls as well, we'll get to a little later on in the show, we have some more news

1975
01:28:56,540 --> 01:29:01,560
in the next segment, we're going to be talking about some updates with the Pandora battery,

1976
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:05,880
the controversial device for the PSP, also talk about some other PSP news, we have quite

1977
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,640
a bit, as well as a very controversial Nintendo patent that was discovered this week.

1978
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:15,700
It was something I kind of referred to earlier, to try and help those people that are really

1979
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:19,800
bad at video games, but is it a good thing, or is it going to be a bad thing?

1980
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,800
Who knows?

1981
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,040
Anyhow, with all the talk about Silent Hill this week, for the live listeners, I'm going

1982
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,880
to play some music from Silent Hill games, because who doesn't love the Silent Hill music,

1983
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,680
but for those of you listening to the podcast, you don't get that because we're not allowed

1984
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,840
to play copyright music, but we'll be right back in just a few seconds for you guys on

1985
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,840
the podcast.

1986
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,880
For those of you listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes here on Orange Lounge

1987
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:46,720
Radio.

1988
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,920
And we're back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast, taping

1989
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,160
live here on January the 18th of 2009, to those of you guys who are just tuning in live

1990
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,640
on AllGames.com.

1991
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,040
Thank you guys for tuning in, tonight's kind of a weird night.

1992
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,400
Mark Sacra is not here, she's on vacation just before school starts, so we brought in

1993
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:06,640
two girls to replace her, well obviously she can never be replaced, but substitute tonight,

1994
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,840
and so we have somebody who definitely looks like a naughty substitute teacher, Victoria

1995
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,840
is here.

1996
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,840
Yeah, and she's hot.

1997
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,840
And she was flirting with the chatters.

1998
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,840
Hi guys.

1999
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,840
Oh, shut up.

2000
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,520
Oh man, all Skype's going to be, hi Victoria, how's it going?

2001
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,120
I did upload the picture that was requested earlier to my Twitter during the break, so

2002
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:30,040
the boys could see it, and then we had a couple of chatters flirting with Victoria, so that's

2003
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,040
cute.

2004
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,440
So anyway, alright, but no more flirting, back to business, alright, we're back to work

2005
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:42,000
here on Orange Lounge Radio, we got more gaming news to talk about, and yes we do, so, Loki

2006
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,680
why don't you start us off, oh no, you're not gonna, are you starting us off, yes, alrighty

2007
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,680
then.

2008
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:53,280
Guitar Hero Metallica has been announced by Metallica that it is coming out in the US,

2009
01:30:53,280 --> 01:31:01,400
or North America I guess, March 29th, May, pretty much everywhere else.

2010
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,720
It's interesting though, is the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions are coming out on the

2011
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:12,160
29th, but the PS2 and the Wii version though are coming sometime this spring, most likely

2012
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:19,720
early May, and this is according to the band's website, and of course, you know, it's gonna

2013
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:26,400
have Expert Plus, 28 songs from the group's discography, as well as other tracks from

2014
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,920
like Alice in Chains, The Food Fighters, Slayer, Machine Head, Queen, and stuff like that.

2015
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:38,220
What's interesting though, and this is a little bit late news here, but they're gonna have

2016
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:44,160
a special pre-order bonus actually being done through GameStop, which is surprising, they're

2017
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:51,320
going to be giving away, with Guitar Hero Metallica, another drum pedal, because apparently

2018
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:56,240
you're gonna need to have two pedals for the kick drum to be able to play some of those

2019
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:03,640
songs, or you're probably gonna want to have two kick pedals, so that's kind of interesting.

2020
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:09,400
But yeah, no other worry on that, but interesting to see this is gonna be the first Guitar Hero

2021
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,020
game coming out this year, and I'm sure not the last.

2022
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,120
First of many.

2023
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,240
First of many, yeah.

2024
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,400
How long before the series jumps the shark?

2025
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,720
Oh wait, done!

2026
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:25,680
Hey, Sony is going to be delivering of course more PSP and PlayStation 1 old titles on PlayStation

2027
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:30,600
Network, and guess what, there is a PSP game that just came out I believe this week on

2028
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,960
the PlayStation 3, it's Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

2029
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,660
I believe Jamie spoke very highly of this game when she was here, it's kind of a put

2030
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:42,640
together compilation of some of the old Ghosts and Goblins titles, it's now available for

2031
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,480
download for $20.

2032
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,860
There you have it, you can't play it on the PlayStation 3 because it was a PSP game, but

2033
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,780
you can use your little transfer device and put it on your PSP if you have a large storage

2034
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,500
stick for your PSP.

2035
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,500
There you have it.

2036
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:01,600
If you have a large stick, you can shut up, shut up.

2037
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:08,080
There is a lawsuit in place for Datel, the makers of such wonderful devices as the Wii

2038
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,720
freeloader, which apparently I don't think works anymore, I'm not sure, that's kind of

2039
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:19,040
in limbo there, and also a third party battery that would have made it easier to hack the

2040
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,360
PSP 3000 perhaps.

2041
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:28,900
Lightblue Tool, which is their service mode battery that they've made, is just basically

2042
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:36,400
a fancy name for the Pandora battery, they basically stole the idea for and decided that

2043
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,600
they were going to put it out.

2044
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:43,560
However, due to legal action by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, they are not able to

2045
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:49,040
put out said battery, and yeah, they will not be releasing it.

2046
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:54,720
But that's okay, because if you remember that there is an exploit now that's being used

2047
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:00,280
that will eventually allow the PSP 3000 to be hacked using Grip Shift.

2048
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:05,920
So that is coming along nicely, they already have some homebrew games available for it,

2049
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,720
and soon enough a homebrew and firmware loader.

2050
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,720
Cool.

2051
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,720
Yeah.

2052
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:17,000
What do you think will happen as a result of the lawsuit?

2053
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Nothing, they'll just stop making the battery and, you know, move on.

2054
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,080
There'll be something else to hack the PSP with later?

2055
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,480
There'll be something else, but the thing is, the fact that they were even releasing

2056
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,840
that battery in the first place was kind of retarded, I mean, I know it is a little bit

2057
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:37,760
difficult to make a Pandora's battery, but it can be done.

2058
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,360
It's not too difficult if you just follow the instructions, but the fact that they were

2059
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:48,640
kind of making this and claiming it as their own, you know, is kind of a rip-off, because

2060
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,520
they did not come up with this idea.

2061
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:57,320
All right, well speaking of hacking, DotHack, which is kind of a cult series on the PlayStation,

2062
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,320
you ever played the DotHack games?

2063
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,600
Yeah, I've never played them, but I'm familiar with them.

2064
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,320
I own the very first one, the very, very first one I found for like 20 bucks somewhere.

2065
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:09,240
They're kind of fun, they're very niche kind of titles, but, you know, I think they had

2066
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,240
two different series.

2067
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:14,040
They had the DotHack series and then there was DotHack GU, which was the later series.

2068
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:20,400
Now DotHack Link was announced by Famitsu Magazine as coming to the PSP in 2009, so now it's

2069
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,240
going from PlayStation 2 to PSP.

2070
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,880
The interesting thing though they're saying is that, you know, part of what made DotHack

2071
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,920
kind of interesting is that it was sort of like an MMO, but it wasn't.

2072
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,600
It was a single player experience that was like an MMO, if that makes any sense.

2073
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,120
Like, you know, all the characters that you came across were scripted and everything,

2074
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,200
but it was kind of part of the niche of the game.

2075
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,800
But they're thinking that this series is now going to be a little more like Monster Hunter,

2076
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,360
because that's the very big series in Japan right now on the PSP.

2077
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:50,640
So DotHack Link could be a little more Monster Hunter-esque, but I'm sure there's a lot of

2078
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,000
anime fans that are going to be very excited to hear that DotHack is making a comeback on

2079
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
the PSP.

2080
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Sweet.

2081
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Hooray.

2082
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Let's see here, some, I guess, interesting stuff coming out from a Sony survey, and we

2083
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,840
all love these surveys that they put out.

2084
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:17,240
Speculation of what exactly might be coming to the PSP2, and this new survey of course

2085
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:23,960
was asking, you know, gamers what features they would like seen in the new console, and

2086
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:29,960
some of the stuff that they were suggesting here, let's see, possible features include

2087
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:38,720
smaller, yet retain most of the current PSP screen size, offered social networking functionality

2088
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:46,480
in the cross-media bar, included a keyboard for easier internet browsing and communication,

2089
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:52,680
offered Bluetooth wireless support for easy pairing with other devices, had a touchscreen,

2090
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:58,520
had an improved screen for more dynamic graphic displays, offered the ability to find others

2091
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:06,260
near you who want to connect for online gaming, offered an e-comic book or book download service

2092
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:14,000
through the PlayStation Network, and included a hard drive for memory storage.

2093
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:23,400
And some other things, they were also talking about built-in GPS, and yeah, interesting.

2094
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,960
I have a feeling that they're going to do a touchscreen at the next one.

2095
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:30,960
They kind of have to at this point, if you think about it.

2096
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,400
And motion-sensoring, I mean, why not?

2097
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,880
Do you think it's for, like, another PSP redo, or do you think this is for, like, the next

2098
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,400
PSP, whatever it is, like the PSV2, or whatever?

2099
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,560
I think it would have to be for the next one.

2100
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:47,560
I mean, they could still do another redo of it or whatever, because I think there was

2101
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,200
some rumors about PSP 4000.

2102
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,880
I don't know, though, if they would just put a touchscreen on, you know, a new PSP or something

2103
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,880
like that.

2104
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,200
A lot of these, I mean, other than, like, social networking, that wouldn't be too bad,

2105
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:04,800
or like a book download service, I mean, you can do e-books right now if you're homebrew

2106
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:11,840
stuff, so that could be done now, and even the ability to find others near you that,

2107
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,200
you know, want to connect for an online game.

2108
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:19,640
I don't really see that as kind of a necessity, because that would require a lot of hotspots

2109
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,840
and stuff like that, and it wouldn't really make sense that you would need, you know,

2110
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,440
to know if there's someone nearby to connect with, because you're connected with anybody

2111
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:32,040
over the internet, so it doesn't really matter.

2112
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:38,480
Maybe Bluetooth support for, like, using, like, say, your 6-axis controller might be

2113
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,680
kind of cool.

2114
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,640
Let's read some comments from the chat room, chat.orensontraded.com, we've had a lot of

2115
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:48,500
PSP different stories, I want to kind of read through some of these, because lots of diverse

2116
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,120
comments from our chat.

2117
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,080
Reddertainment says, why is Dattell getting sued for selling something that you can hack

2118
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,520
the PSP with?

2119
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,840
People who sell rocks don't get sued for possibly causing car break-ins.

2120
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,160
But this is the case with a lot of these, you know, companies that get sued, right?

2121
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:07,900
I think it has to do with infringing on some sort of stuff, probably information that was

2122
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:13,700
written on the ROM of the battery, because the actual batteries that Sony uses actually

2123
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:19,000
have data written on to them, so if, for example, they use that to reverse engineer something

2124
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,860
to create a program, that would violate copyrights, and then they could stop them, I guess.

2125
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:30,880
And also probably, you know, Dattell's not really a large company, and Sony is a lot

2126
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:35,880
bigger, and they could probably bully them into doing whatever they want, so.

2127
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:41,960
But more likely, you know, the prior, that they actually reverse engineered something,

2128
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:50,260
and because of that, you know, it's not licensed, so, you know, they gotta put a stop to it.

2129
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:54,240
Also some other things I want to read here, Jiove Dea, who's very excited about a new

2130
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,420
.hack game coming out, says I wish those fuckers would have brought the actual.hack MMO over

2131
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:04,680
even if it sucked balls, and XLink confirms there was a.hack MMO in Japan but it was

2132
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,080
shut down.

2133
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:12,240
D5T says.hack link for the PSP is going to be the last game, FYI.

2134
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,920
So I don't know if it's gonna, I guess not a series, because all the other.hack games

2135
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:19,440
were in series, I think the first one had four games, the other one had three, so that's

2136
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,040
kind of weird that this would be a one-off game.

2137
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:27,000
Hopefully it's a lot of game, because.hack got a big, I guess a very cult-type game.

2138
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,780
There's a lot of people who've never heard of these games, but then I think there's enough

2139
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,800
of our audience who like the anime and all that stuff too that I'm sure know about these

2140
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,800
games.

2141
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:34,800
I was pretty excited about it.

2142
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,740
Well you know Monster Hunter, they're basically trying to recreate Monster Hunter over, find

2143
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:43,240
anything that would work as a Monster Hunter game, because those are insanely popular in

2144
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:47,120
Japan right now and especially with the new Monster Hunter game coming out on the Wii,

2145
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,440
that's gonna probably take off really well.

2146
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,160
They're trying to find more stuff that's kinda similar to Monster Hunter and if they try

2147
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:58,640
to make their game more like Monster Hunter, then maybe they'll try to get that same type

2148
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,200
of appeal that that game had.

2149
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,880
There were some other games that they were trying to make like Monster Hunter too, I

2150
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,680
I can't remember what it was, though.

2151
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,160
But some other series game that they're changing up.

2152
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,080
Interesting speculation in chat, too, by Alpha

2153
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,200
Kananagrams says, maybe.hack link has DLC.

2154
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:14,600
Good.

2155
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,240
I don't know, a place for a PSP game.

2156
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,400
That would be very interesting, but good.

2157
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:22,920
All right, anyhow, let's go into a new story, kind of

2158
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,600
getting away from the PSP stuff a little bit.

2159
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,640
This is kind of one of those sad story things.

2160
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,760
Apparently, in Illinois, there's a town there in

2161
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,720
Illinois who put a new tax out on video game machines.

2162
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,960
And it caused a small arcade to basically go under.

2163
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,080
It was a place called the Name Your Game Store, and it was

2164
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:41,200
located in Hampshire.

2165
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,760
It was apparently a very popular after-school hangout.

2166
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,680
It had games, snacks, cards, clothing, of all things.

2167
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,360
So it was kind of like a little hodgepodge of cool

2168
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,560
stuff, sounds like, a place for kids to go hang out.

2169
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,160
The proprietors were Bob and Gina Pearson.

2170
01:41:55,160 --> 01:42:01,880
Apparently, a $250 annual tax per machine on these games,

2171
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,440
they had to get rid of the 10 games that they had.

2172
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,800
Glow-in-the-dark air hockey, NASCAR racing, Ms. Pac-Man all

2173
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,720
bit the dust because of this new tax in the town.

2174
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,920
Here's a quote from one of the owners.

2175
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,040
We didn't renew the licenses because the machines didn't

2176
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,600
even make what you charge in these astronomical fees.

2177
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,560
The game companies tell us this is one of the highest

2178
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,520
fees in Illinois.

2179
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,840
We wonder if the village really researched how big this

2180
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,000
should be or if they just slapped a number on it.

2181
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,240
We had become a pretty big hangout for kids after school

2182
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,840
and weekends, but not having the video games this year has

2183
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,880
made a big impact in just the first two weeks.

2184
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,680
So apparently, somebody who works for the town told the

2185
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,440
local news that they set the fee high with the

2186
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,840
understanding that the game machine distribution companies

2187
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:46,040
would actually pay the fees.

2188
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,240
But one of the proprietors said that only happens when

2189
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,400
you actually serve alcohol in the establishment.

2190
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,760
So what was the purpose of this tax or whatever it's

2191
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,720
supposed to be?

2192
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,760
Just to get money.

2193
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,360
I guess.

2194
01:42:59,360 --> 01:42:59,840
Why not?

2195
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,120
It's the most random thing ever.

2196
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,720
Like, oh, and by the way.

2197
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,640
Well, in this economy, you've got to balance the budget in

2198
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,360
weird ways, right?

2199
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:09,160
Yeah, but that seems really weird, though, the tax.

2200
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,200
First off, arcade games.

2201
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,120
I would think, I mean, let's just look at, for example,

2202
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,320
like Rancho Cordova or something like that.

2203
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:18,000
I can't imagine that there's over 100 arcade

2204
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,600
games in this city.

2205
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,080
I would be surprised if there are over 50 arcade games in

2206
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,480
this city, let alone enough.

2207
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,440
I don't know of many at all that would be

2208
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,320
independently owned.

2209
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,840
Maybe at that pool place I've never been to up the street.

2210
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:31,600
They probably have some.

2211
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,760
But see, that's the thing, though.

2212
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,160
It's random and arbitrary.

2213
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,760
Oh, yeah, and all of a sudden, let's just pull

2214
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,520
this out of our ass.

2215
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,080
There has to be something behind it.

2216
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,120
Well, it sounds like other, because when the lady quoted

2217
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,760
about places that sell alcohol in all this, too, she sounded

2218
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,280
like this isn't unheard of.

2219
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,160
Because it sounded like she had a point of reference.

2220
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,760
So I guess this whole thing is not heard.

2221
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,880
I'd never heard of this before.

2222
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,600
But it seems weird, though, that you would be able to tax

2223
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,760
something like that because you're still

2224
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,400
paying taxes on it.

2225
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:01,080
You're paying taxes on your revenue that you bring in.

2226
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:02,320
So why tax it again?

2227
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,880
There has to be something behind it.

2228
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,120
There has to be maybe it was targeted at that place or

2229
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,320
something, or the places like this where kids hang out.

2230
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:11,760
Maybe they think they're going to become delinquent or

2231
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,480
something if they spend their time doing that instead of

2232
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,720
other stuff.

2233
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:20,040
Tigerclaw says, if you read between the lines, this was

2234
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,080
their way of getting rid of video games in these places so

2235
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,760
kids go home and do their homework.

2236
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,640
I don't know, Tigerclaw.

2237
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:25,520
I kind of disagree.

2238
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,520
I think some of these kids, if they don't have another place

2239
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:32,600
to go, they're going to turn to graffiti and murder.

2240
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,160
I'm just kidding.

2241
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,040
But more of the latter.

2242
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,720
But you know what I'm talking about?

2243
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,920
Like, at least in these types of places, it's, you know.

2244
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,520
Yeah, that's exactly what these

2245
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,720
establishments are there for.

2246
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,600
If parents aren't enforcing their kids to, like, do their

2247
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,960
homework and stuff, they're going in at least playing

2248
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,440
video games or something like that.

2249
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,200
You know, they're not out on the street or anything.

2250
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:56,160
So I just think that's kind of odd.

2251
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,440
In other words, kids hanging out at this place is because

2252
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,880
their parents aren't making them go home

2253
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:02,760
and do their homework.

2254
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,640
So if they're not here at this place hanging out, they'll be

2255
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,320
somewhere else.

2256
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,640
Yeah, they're not going to be going home.

2257
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:08,840
They're not going to go home.

2258
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,040
Oh, shucks.

2259
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,280
No more Ms. Pac-Man for me.

2260
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,600
I guess I'll go do homework.

2261
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,040
Because that's what my brothers and I did, like our

2262
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,840
parents didn't give a shit if we came home and did our

2263
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:17,520
homework after school.

2264
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,960
So we went to the arcade, you know, like, so we probably

2265
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,080
would have become druggies and like murderous convicts were

2266
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,280
it not for video games.

2267
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,160
So I don't know.

2268
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,720
That's just kind of wacky.

2269
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:29,200
I don't know.

2270
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,760
SSJ100 Matt says, so things are going to turn into Jet Set

2271
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,920
Radio, basically.

2272
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,160
Yeah, there you go.

2273
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:34,920
It's all going to start.

2274
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,280
We're all going to strap on roller blades and go around

2275
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,320
and spray paint shit.

2276
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,720
Yep.

2277
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:45,440
So kind of sad.

2278
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:45,920
I don't know.

2279
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,560
Maybe we should try to email these people and

2280
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,120
get them on the show.

2281
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,640
These are the types of stories I want to dig into.

2282
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,000
Are you going to be like, call Rob or whatever?

2283
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,800
Not, you know, like the local show?

2284
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,480
Like the local news and stuff?

2285
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,520
Well, here's the thing.

2286
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,840
All the other shows, you know, they're trying to get the one

2287
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,520
up guys and all that on their show.

2288
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,840
Because that's what everybody's, you know, I don't

2289
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,120
care, I'm over all that stuff.

2290
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,160
Let's get these little niche stories and get them on the

2291
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:15,520
show and talk about why was your town out to screw you?

2292
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,320
We want answers.

2293
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,560
We demand to know.

2294
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,680
Asking questions, getting answers.

2295
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,360
Oh my God, Rob, you're going to make an impact.

2296
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,280
All right, we'll see.

2297
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:27,840
We'll see.

2298
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,440
All right, let's move on.

2299
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,360
Loki, do you have some other news for us?

2300
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,200
Maybe happier news?

2301
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:35,120
Maybe this is why they're getting rid of the arcades for

2302
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,480
games like Mortal Kombat.

2303
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,400
Yes, that's right.

2304
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:42,520
The Mortal Kombat killer has gotten 36 years.

2305
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,720
Lamar Roberts, the teenager convicted of beating to death a

2306
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:50,040
seven-year-old, will be sentenced to 36 years.

2307
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,320
Apparently, this happened in 2007.

2308
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:59,840
I guess they beat up Zo Garcia, a seven-year-old who

2309
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,560
was described, I guess, by prosecutors and law

2310
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,320
enforcement in Greeley, Colorado.

2311
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,600
They were beating her up as an reenactment of the fight

2312
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,720
moves from Mortal Kombat.

2313
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,880
And says Robert and his 17-year-old girlfriend were

2314
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,720
supposedly supposed to be babysitting the child.

2315
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,920
They uppercutted a baby.

2316
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,480
And said that two kicked, hit, and slammed his half

2317
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:26,080
sister to the floor.

2318
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:31,360
OK, did they confuse their babality with the fatality?

2319
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,480
I can't even joke.

2320
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,040
This is terrible.

2321
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,000
I know, that is awful.

2322
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,440
I probably shouldn't have said that, but wow.

2323
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:41,200
They must be stupid.

2324
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,160
Only 36 years, just 36 years.

2325
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,360
I mean, really?

2326
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,440
Really?

2327
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,240
Seriously?

2328
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:51,080
Are prisons like that hard up for cash?

2329
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,320
Yeah, that's pretty sad.

2330
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,880
But here's something you can laugh at, because it's funny

2331
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,960
and it's ridiculous.

2332
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,560
And I don't think anyone got hurt.

2333
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:03,600
But apparently, there is a new assailant to compete against

2334
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,120
the Mortal Kombat killer for press, the Xbox Taco

2335
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,880
assailant.

2336
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:14,040
Yes, apparently law enforcement near Orlando, Florida.

2337
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,800
This is one of the stories that I've read so far, so it's good.

2338
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,680
They have in custody a 19-year-old who refused to

2339
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:23,760
stop playing games to join his family for dinner and throw a

2340
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,920
taco at his mother after she unplugged his Xbox.

2341
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:33,240
Apparently, this was reported as a domestic disturbance.

2342
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:40,720
And apparently, there is some name calling that says,

2343
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,520
seems his mom went upstairs and demanded he stop playing

2344
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,680
that Sega or Atari or whatever you call it and come down to be

2345
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:50,160
a contributing member of the family.

2346
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:55,560
And he was all, whatever, bitch, she said.

2347
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,760
And he flung the taco.

2348
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:59,160
Is this for real?

2349
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah, he says they actually have a screen capture from the

2350
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,440
news thing, and he's making a weird little face on it.

2351
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:10,680
Yeah, WFL-TV is the news station covering it.

2352
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:14,400
And she says she was going to let him sit in his jail cell

2353
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,880
for a few days and teach him a lesson.

2354
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,800
They need to show no mercy to this kid.

2355
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,120
It's funny, it's all a few minutes.

2356
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,240
You know what they should do as punishment is make him work

2357
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:28,200
a Taco Bell and see what exactly it takes to get in to

2358
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,960
make a taco, because I don't know anybody who's ever worked

2359
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,200
a Taco Bell that would enjoy their job.

2360
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,080
Here's the quote from Dina, his sponsor.

2361
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,840
A few minutes later, Dina says she was in the kitchen

2362
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,880
cleaning and cooking tacos for dinner when Zachary showed up.

2363
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,720
That's when she says he slapped her arm and threw a

2364
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,880
taco in her face.

2365
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:55,320
He went ahead and hit me with the taco and I got taco all

2366
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,760
over my shirt and the kitchen.

2367
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,560
I've threatened to call the police before.

2368
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,520
But anyway, this time I thought he went too far, so I

2369
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,280
called the police and he's in jail now.

2370
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,960
Leo Shen sums it up in chat, says that he should rot in

2371
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,880
jail, he wasted a good taco.

2372
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:13,080
That's taco side, no one commits taco side.

2373
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,440
I can imagine Eric right now like, no.

2374
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,360
All right, and finally, this is a little bit more recent.

2375
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:26,400
There's a 17-year-old, Daniel Petrick of Ohio, he's been

2376
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:31,400
found guilty of shooting both of his parents, which led to

2377
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,320
the death of his mother, his dad, survived.

2378
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:37,480
And apparently he has been found guilty.

2379
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:42,200
This was because they took away Halo from him, Halo 3.

2380
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,800
He's a 15-year-old, by the way.

2381
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:49,160
And it says they took his copy of Halo 3 away, mature rated

2382
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,160
title, after they had previously refused him from

2383
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,120
playing the game.

2384
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:59,240
And so he basically told them, I have a surprise for you,

2385
01:50:59,240 --> 01:50:59,880
close your eyes.

2386
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,040
And he shot them both in the face.

2387
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,960
Oh my god.

2388
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:03,760
That's terrible.

2389
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,240
With a taco.

2390
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,120
No, I'm just kidding.

2391
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,280
That's awful.

2392
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,720
That is so bad.

2393
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,800
I got, sorry, I have to say this.

2394
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,200
I know this is like a horrible story.

2395
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,520
I have to go back to the taco thing, because this is one we

2396
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,640
could actually laugh at, right?

2397
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:15,920
The other ones are terrible, right?

2398
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,200
But comments from chat, D5T says, if I went to jail every

2399
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:22,600
time I threw food at my mom.

2400
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,320
And I'm thinking, my mom and I did get into a fight over

2401
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,480
M&M's once, so that's what I'm sure of.

2402
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,160
I remember, you didn't throw them though.

2403
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:28,640
You broke them to death.

2404
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,000
I didn't throw them, but it was a different story.

2405
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,320
Um, Deakman says, I see nothing wrong with tacos

2406
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,440
getting thrown at my face.

2407
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,960
Like, if you open, it could be like a game.

2408
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,640
If you open your mouth, try to catch them.

2409
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:42,600
OK, but here is the huge, huge news.

2410
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:46,760
Apparently, one of our listeners does not live that

2411
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,160
far from the taco person.

2412
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:48,600
Really?

2413
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,280
And is going to try and get them on the show.

2414
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,240
Oh, that'd be awesome.

2415
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,680
Oh, be careful, dude.

2416
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:58,320
We're going to have to bump the Tax Town people to get the

2417
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,960
taco assailant on the show.

2418
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,200
I must speak to the taco kid.

2419
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,880
Keep your mouth open, dude, in case he throws any tacos.

2420
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,000
Just be careful.

2421
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
OK, and then here's the best part about

2422
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,080
the halo murder thing.

2423
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,400
Apparently, the judge, James Burge, told the courtroom,

2424
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,280
it's my firm belief as a human being, and not just as a

2425
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:22,880
jurist, that Daniel does suffer from a serious defect

2426
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,000
of the mind.

2427
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,720
And apparently, believes that games are somehow

2428
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:33,360
involved, that he says, I firmly believe Daniel had no

2429
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,880
idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed

2430
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,840
his parents, they would be dead forever.

2431
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,320
That he was so far into the Halo 3 world that he separated

2432
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,560
himself from reality.

2433
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,000
Would he be like that, calling from earlier?

2434
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,760
So would they like respawn, like parents respawn?

2435
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,760
He'd be like that, calling from earlier.

2436
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,720
You know, it died and came back to life.

2437
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,040
Mom?

2438
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,360
Oh my god.

2439
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:05,840
This is like there's a special place in hell where

2440
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,000
this show is waiting.

2441
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,520
I don't know who's stupider, that kid or that juror.

2442
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,600
No, that's a judge.

2443
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,600
I mean, wow.

2444
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,440
OK, this part.

2445
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,840
Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.

2446
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,480
I mean, I'm sure that kid's stupid, but I don't know if

2447
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,680
he's that stupid.

2448
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:27,160
No, I think he knew exactly what he was doing.

2449
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:30,640
But now he figured out I got to go to jail forever.

2450
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:31,880
I'm insane.

2451
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,800
Please don't kill me in the face.

2452
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,120
In the face.

2453
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,520
I don't know.

2454
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:41,480
I don't even know what to say.

2455
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,320
This isn't even really a story about video

2456
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:44,320
games at this point.

2457
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,000
This kid obviously has like a ton of issues.

2458
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,600
Can we just talk about the Taco Kid some more?

2459
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,040
Yes, the Taco Kid's awesome.

2460
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:57,120
But I just wanted to point out that here live in studio,

2461
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:02,120
I'm now the snickerdoodle assailant.

2462
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,120
Open your mouth.

2463
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:04,600
Oh, you wasted my cookie.

2464
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,560
Pick it up and eat it.

2465
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:07,840
Spin on my boobie.

2466
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:08,920
I'll eat your cookie.

2467
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:11,480
I threw a snickerdoodle and it hit Irene in the boob.

2468
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:22,000
It was deliciously painful.

2469
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,160
All right, look, we're going to dedicate a certain segment

2470
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,320
of our show we do here.

2471
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:26,840
Love you.

2472
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,880
We're going to dedicate a certain part of our show

2473
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,960
here we do every week to these guys who

2474
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,240
are ruining the image of video gamers

2475
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,160
everywhere with their stupidity.

2476
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,120
And it's a segment called the FUs of the Week.

2477
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:56,840
Since we don't have Dark Sakura tonight to start us off we'll let Loki start us off with the FUs of the Week today.

2478
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:03,360
Fucking Rockstar Games for making a really crappy port of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC.

2479
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:08,640
There's no reason whatsoever that the game should work for a while then all of a sudden just stop.

2480
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,920
I didn't install anything.

2481
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,960
I didn't change anything.

2482
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,440
It just said I'm not working no more and just stop working.

2483
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,520
Now I reinstall it.

2484
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:20,960
I've uninstalled everything including secure ROM, all my video drivers,

2485
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,720
every little bit of crap that would possibly affect this game.

2486
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,560
I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it.

2487
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,280
Nothing.

2488
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,720
It just broke in.

2489
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,360
Bullshit.

2490
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:33,000
Why should I pay for an actual game and have it not work?

2491
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:33,520
That's it.

2492
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,840
Never do it again.

2493
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:35,160
I know.

2494
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:35,760
That's ridiculous.

2495
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,960
I am never buying a PC game ever again.

2496
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,720
Especially Rockstar Games.

2497
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,920
Never again.

2498
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:43,840
Don't do it.

2499
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:49,760
My FU of the Week, if you're done, my FU of the Week goes to my tooth because it hurts.

2500
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,240
And I have to go to the dentist tomorrow.

2501
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,000
And I don't like going to the dentist.

2502
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,760
I think I mentioned this on the show before because it's like going to a used car salesman.

2503
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,840
Because then they're going to tell me, oh, you need to have this done.

2504
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,360
Oh, and by the way, you need to get this done.

2505
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,440
You need to replace this crown.

2506
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,360
It's going to cost this much money.

2507
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,160
And it's like, ugh.

2508
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,400
I thought you had an awesome dentist, though.

2509
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,040
No.

2510
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:05,680
Do that crap.

2511
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:06,760
No.

2512
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,360
No.

2513
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:07,840
OK.

2514
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,040
You want to hear something funny?

2515
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:09,400
What?

2516
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,360
I'm a horrible, I'm horrible when it comes to oral hygiene.

2517
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,960
Like, they tell me to floss.

2518
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,040
I'm like, yeah, I'll floss.

2519
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,320
And I totally forget.

2520
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,120
But OK, so yeah, nobody flosses.

2521
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:23,120
So anyways, they keep telling me, yeah, you got to floss because your gums are all, you know,

2522
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:25,360
they're going to get fucked up and that kind of stuff.

2523
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,720
So I haven't flossed for a year since I saw them last.

2524
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,400
And they said that it looked better.

2525
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,120
I'm like, have you been flossing?

2526
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,680
I'm like, yeah, sure, I've been flossing all the time.

2527
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,440
Oh, well, it looks like it's doing a good job.

2528
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,600
So yes, they're full of shit.

2529
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:36,560
That's basically it.

2530
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,920
I've seen more unicorns than people flossing.

2531
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,040
Like, nobody flosses.

2532
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:45,800
SSJ100Matt wants to point out that his dad's a dentist, but he's an honest dentist.

2533
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,360
Look, if I lived in New York City, I would happily go to your dad.

2534
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,800
Like, I need a friend who's a dentist or who goes to the dentist.

2535
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:52,640
I have a friend who's a dentist.

2536
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,200
Really?

2537
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,520
Yeah, he's starting his own practice.

2538
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,960
I want to go see them because I want to go see somebody I trust.

2539
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,080
Yeah.

2540
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:01,000
You can go to a dental school.

2541
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:01,680
Blah.

2542
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,440
Blah.

2543
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,400
At least they're honest.

2544
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,240
That's what poor people do.

2545
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,080
I'm just kidding.

2546
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,640
At least we ain't paying for any shit.

2547
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,440
Look, we've all been there, Victoria.

2548
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,840
We've all been there, OK?

2549
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,960
You're a young 21 still.

2550
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,120
You're in that phase.

2551
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,680
A young, beautiful, single 21-year-old gal.

2552
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,880
With big titties.

2553
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:19,360
Yes.

2554
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,200
She's the one.

2555
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,240
Quit trying to pimp me.

2556
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:26,400
I want to say, there is somebody in chat right now with the nickname that

2557
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,800
says, I love Victoria.

2558
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:32,920
Aw, I hurt you too, whoever you are.

2559
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,960
All right, so my F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.

2560
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,720
Victoria, do you have any F.U.s of the week?

2561
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:40,840
My F.U. of the week is to the person who didn't turn my keys in.

2562
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,320
Whoever found my keys at work and didn't turn them

2563
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,040
in since I've been locked out of my apartment for the past three fucking

2564
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,720
days.

2565
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,240
Not really.

2566
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:51,280
That's the biggest F.U. of the week that I have.

2567
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,280
And to my phone that's flashing an evil red color at me

2568
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:56,240
because it needs to be charged.

2569
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:56,720
Uh-oh.

2570
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,320
That's it.

2571
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,680
And Rice Princess, do you have any F.U.s?

2572
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:03,520
Yeah, F.U. to you for hitting my titty.

2573
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,160
You liked it.

2574
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,400
You wasted a snickerdoodle.

2575
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,360
You liked it a little bit.

2576
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:07,560
I'll give it to John when he gets back.

2577
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,960
I'll put it on a plate and say, we saved you a snickerdoodle.

2578
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,720
Just brush off the little bit of dust and pee pee on it.

2579
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:18,480
Oh my god, if he ever finds out it touched my boob, he'll die.

2580
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,080
He'd be like, oh my god, I had a woman's breast in my mouth.

2581
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:22,960
I'm going to put it back on the plate when no one's looking.

2582
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,640
And then it's like a game of Russian snickerdoodle roulette.

2583
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,080
Yeah, you see.

2584
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,600
One of these was on Irene's booby.

2585
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:33,300
Do you want to eat one and take a chance?

2586
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,600
It's the one that's dead to you.

2587
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,120
Or do you want to possibly inadvertently lick her boob?

2588
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,320
Let's not talk about this.

2589
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,840
Yeah, let's not.

2590
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:41,760
All right.

2591
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,040
Anyway, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week

2592
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:44,680
on that note.

2593
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:46,400
So let's get back into some gaming news.

2594
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,840
And this is actually some big news that came out this week,

2595
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,200
a patent that was revealed.

2596
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,200
Now this is what I was kind of talking to Victoria

2597
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,960
a little bit about before, is that she

2598
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,440
was talking about how video games get too hard

2599
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:58,280
and she gets too frustrated and throws a controller, right?

2600
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:02,320
Here's what's interesting, is that apparently Miyamoto

2601
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,680
has filed a patent.

2602
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,140
And I don't know if it's him or like his company or whatever,

2603
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:08,000
but basically Nintendo has filed the patent.

2604
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,960
And it has been discovered for a computable readable storage

2605
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:12,520
medium.

2606
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:19,800
But what the medium is is basically kind of a hint system.

2607
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,120
And the game that they kind of show pictures of

2608
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:25,880
is a work in progress called Legend of O.O., which could

2609
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,320
possibly be a Legend of Zelda game.

2610
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,920
But here's the interesting thing.

2611
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,920
This patent is very, very, very wordy, kind of goes on.

2612
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,200
It talks about these different gameplay features

2613
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:39,040
that include hint videos that are actually already there

2614
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,240
inside the game that would unlock,

2615
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,880
if you've been stuck on a puzzle for so long,

2616
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:46,180
then a hint video will show up.

2617
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,480
A mode called the digest, which will actually just show

2618
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,520
the game's cinematics and gameplay sequences just

2619
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,400
as a movie.

2620
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,600
And you can take control at any point you want.

2621
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:57,560
And then a scene menu, which lets

2622
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:01,120
you choose exactly where you want to go into the story.

2623
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,760
So it's kind of like this extreme hybrid

2624
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:08,800
of mixing a video game with DVD features, almost.

2625
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,760
Kind of interesting.

2626
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:12,480
And then you just add on to this the fact

2627
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,040
that Miyamoto has said before that he

2628
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,260
wants to make more Zelda Wii titles more

2629
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:20,040
accessible to a broad audience.

2630
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,800
Could this actually be something that they

2631
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,400
are going to implement in a future Zelda title?

2632
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,640
Possibly.

2633
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,960
Well, what do you think of that?

2634
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:31,840
I mean, is that dumbing down the game too much?

2635
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,080
Is that taking the game out of the video game?

2636
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:42,120
I think it's kind of, for us, the hardcore gamers,

2637
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:44,520
the gamers who've been playing games for all of our life,

2638
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
we're probably not going to be big fans of that.

2639
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,600
But yeah, it's going to bring new people into games.

2640
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,800
So let me ask Victoria, even though she's

2641
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,720
tapping away on the laptop, it's somebody else right now.

2642
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,080
What if they had a game, like one of these games

2643
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,440
you'd get really frustrated at.

2644
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,920
But you could just say you throw the controller

2645
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,840
because it's too hard.

2646
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,520
What if suddenly the game said, hey, it

2647
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,480
looks like you're stuck.

2648
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,760
Let me show you a video of how to get past this part.

2649
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,280
Would that make the game more appealing to you?

2650
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,320
It would probably help.

2651
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,520
But I'd probably get annoyed because I

2652
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,320
wouldn't be able to be like, what the hell?

2653
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,480
What's going on?

2654
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:14,400
How do I get up there?

2655
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,280
You know what I mean?

2656
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,040
That's usually my problem with games

2657
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,520
is I have to get up somewhere and, you know.

2658
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,360
What if the game said, press this button

2659
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,080
and I'll take you past this point?

2660
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:24,960
Then I'll play.

2661
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,920
Then I'd be like, all right, bring it, bitch.

2662
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,300
What would draw you to that, though?

2663
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:32,200
What would try to play the game if there's no challenge?

2664
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:35,360
I'm sorry, I just read something funny about the thing.

2665
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:38,240
I don't know, what was the question?

2666
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,080
What would draw you, if you could just

2667
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,600
hit the button and skip that part to get up the ledge

2668
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,640
or get to where you need to go, fast forward or whatever.

2669
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,180
What's the draw to the game to you?

2670
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:48,200
Well then, I just think it'd make it easier

2671
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:51,200
for me to play it, because I'm not very video game savvy,

2672
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:54,440
as I've said already.

2673
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,260
But I just think it would make it easier for me to play it.

2674
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:00,840
I think me and the 4-year-olds who

2675
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,240
can't play video games very well,

2676
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:05,200
I'm assuming there are 4-year-olds out there who can't

2677
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:08,380
play video games very well.

2678
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:11,040
But yeah, I think that's the biggest appeal,

2679
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:14,160
I could just say, oh, you too can play video games.

2680
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:17,560
You don't have to be as awesome as Rob or Matt or Irene to play video games.

2681
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:21,360
Which is funny because people assume because we host this show that we're actually good at video games,

2682
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,360
but that's so not true.

2683
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:23,460
I've seen you play video games.

2684
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:25,060
You've seen me play Rock Band.

2685
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:27,260
Oh yeah, you're pretty- he's pretty badass at Rock Band, guys.

2686
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:29,960
But here's the thing, here's- here's- I don't know.

2687
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,560
No, Loki, please, I'd like to hear your-

2688
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,160
Here's my issue with it.

2689
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:37,560
If the game is designed well in the beginning, you shouldn't have problems figuring out what you need to do,

2690
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:41,360
because it gradually teaches you the skills in the game that you need to learn,

2691
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:45,160
and teaches you how to solve different puzzles, and then says go do it.

2692
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:49,160
And you should know how to do it if it's been done right.

2693
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:53,360
Now, if you're gonna put this together- put together a game that's like poorly done,

2694
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,960
then yeah, you're gonna need this stupid cheat system and stuff.

2695
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:01,960
And I think it's a waste of time anyways, because it would be like showing somebody how-

2696
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,860
Okay, here's a video of how you do this.

2697
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,660
And they're like, huh?

2698
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:06,960
Okay, hit this button, then go past it.

2699
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,260
Great, okay, now I'm at another scene that's too hard.

2700
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,260
Oh, I'm gonna hit this button, then go past it again.

2701
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,160
Read a book!

2702
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:12,960
Go read a book!

2703
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:13,960
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.

2704
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:16,760
It's like, God, I don't want to invest time to figure out what the story is.

2705
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:18,660
Let me just read the end and figure out what happens.

2706
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:20,960
Oh, and then it ruins it for me.

2707
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,260
It'd be just like Animal Crossing.

2708
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:25,760
Oh, I don't want to wait here and, you know, pay off Tom Nook's mortgage or whatever.

2709
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,560
Let me just, you know, cheat and have lots of money.

2710
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:30,060
Look, now I have no purpose to this game anymore.

2711
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:34,760
Which is, by the way, what happened with Animal Crossing, but I had no purpose to begin with anyways, so.

2712
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,260
Um.

2713
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:39,960
It- I think it's a horrible idea, and I see what they're trying to do,

2714
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:42,960
because they're still, you know, having this dilemma.

2715
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,060
How do we sell games to people that only want to play Wii Sports, and now Wii Fit?

2716
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:50,160
How do we sell games to them?

2717
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,060
And they don't know.

2718
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:55,860
And this is a problem, because they're never gonna figure this out, this console generation,

2719
02:03:55,860 --> 02:04:00,660
and they're gonna- I have a feeling they're gonna sell millions of systems,

2720
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:03,360
but they're not gonna sell millions of games.

2721
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,360
And that's a problem, because, you know, the only things they're selling right now

2722
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,160
are the things that they're making hard to find.

2723
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:13,960
Because, trust me, I'm sorry, Mario Kart's been out since last April.

2724
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:17,760
It's- we're coming upon almost a year of it being out.

2725
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,460
There's no fucking reason that should be a shortage right now.

2726
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:24,160
It's a game and a goddamn steering wheel that's a piece of plastic.

2727
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:26,360
Shit, they make plastic toys like crazy.

2728
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,760
They're in supermarkets everywhere.

2729
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,760
It's a piece of fucking plastic!

2730
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:30,960
I mean, come on!

2731
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,160
So there's no reason that this stuff is-

2732
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,960
they're selling out of it because they can't make enough-

2733
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,960
no, they're not making enough on purpose, so that there's not enough on the market.

2734
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,160
So demand's always high, so people are always looking for it.

2735
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,560
So Wii Fit's always popular, because people think,

2736
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,360
oh my god, it's out there, but once they buy it, like I do,

2737
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,960
you go, oh my god, I'm not using this thing.

2738
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,560
Like Rob did.

2739
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,360
Okay. I have an argument for it.

2740
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,360
Okay.

2741
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:02,160
Number one, we have not only strategy guides,

2742
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:07,160
but we have a huge website dedicated to FAQs and walkthroughs and stuff like that.

2743
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:09,960
So obviously, people are going to need help with games.

2744
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:11,360
That's why those exist.

2745
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,760
Number two, there are going to be parts of games.

2746
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,960
Like not every part of every game is hard,

2747
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,960
but there are going to be very hard parts.

2748
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:21,160
I remember a part in Resident Evil 4 that I just could not get past,

2749
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:22,760
and I wish I could have done that.

2750
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:26,160
Just press a button and just gotten through that one small section of the game,

2751
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,160
and then continued.

2752
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:32,960
So, like, I personally probably would not use it to just skip through every part of the game,

2753
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,960
but if I have a chance to get through a hard part of the game,

2754
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:37,560
bring it on. I'd like it.

2755
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:43,160
This has been done before, you know, not necessarily to the fact that there's stuff that you can,

2756
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:47,160
you know, skip parts of the game, but Alone in the Dark, the game that came out,

2757
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:51,360
unfortunately it was crap, but it came out in chapters, basically, in this game,

2758
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:55,160
and you can start the game at any chapter and go from there.

2759
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,960
So, say, oh, this is too hard, skip ahead,

2760
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,560
and it will fill you in on what happened in the last chapter, and you just kind of go from there.

2761
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,160
I don't, the problem is, though, is the only way you're going to get good at games

2762
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:08,960
is from playing games and being challenged to think for yourself,

2763
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,360
because if you're just sitting there going, oh, I don't get it,

2764
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:15,160
and then the game solves the problem for you, you're not going to learn anything.

2765
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:16,160
That is true.

2766
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:19,560
And, you know, and that may turn away people from playing those games,

2767
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:24,760
but you're not going to buy the game in the first place if you don't, aren't remotely interested in it.

2768
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:27,760
It's like someone's spoiling the ending for, you know, a movie or something.

2769
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:33,160
Like, I, you know, why is, you know, like, for example, like, The Sixth Sense or something like that,

2770
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:37,360
you know, you know, why, why is it that, you know, his wife doesn't see him?

2771
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,360
What's going on?

2772
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:39,560
It's because he's dead!

2773
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:42,960
You know, it's like, if someone, if someone spoiled that for you,

2774
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,960
so that you figure out the puzzle there, it ruins it.

2775
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:47,760
That's the thing.

2776
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:53,760
Well, see, okay, gamers like us, regular gamers that have hand-eye coordination and all that stuff,

2777
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,360
we're not going to want to skip over the story parts.

2778
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,360
We're going to want to play the game as is.

2779
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:02,560
But there are people who suck, just playing flat-out suck at video games.

2780
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:07,360
They just can't make their character jump or whatever, you know, they can't put two and two together.

2781
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:12,760
They're going to want to be kind of like a, you know how people are like spectators when it comes to video games?

2782
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:15,160
They like to watch other people play a video game.

2783
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,960
Yeah, that's going to be part of the appeal too.

2784
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:20,760
They can feel like they're going through the video game themselves,

2785
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:23,360
but have to skip over the hard things that they can't do.

2786
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:28,360
One of the features of this game was actually watching basically the gameplay itself.

2787
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:31,360
I have to say my piece, because I haven't said anything on this yet.

2788
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,360
Do your piece.

2789
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:34,360
And I haven't stated my opinion.

2790
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:38,360
And you know I'm one of Nintendo's biggest critics as of like 2008 and everything.

2791
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,360
Nintendo's kind of been pissing me off a lot lately.

2792
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:44,360
That being said, I actually think this is a really good idea.

2793
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:50,360
For Nintendo and its audience, I think this is a really good idea.

2794
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:55,360
As long as they make a feature to turn it off and you hit the nail on the head.

2795
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,360
Exactly what I was thinking.

2796
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,360
This is for those people that like to watch other people play video games.

2797
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:03,360
Because they're too intimidated, they don't want to really play them themselves.

2798
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,360
Because of the fact that they feel like they suck at video games.

2799
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,360
They can't get past these hard parts.

2800
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,360
They want to just get past this stuff.

2801
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:14,360
And I think a game like Zelda especially, that has such pretty awesome cinematics.

2802
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:16,360
You know, these things that you get into.

2803
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:19,360
The towns, you know, and the story behind these games.

2804
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,360
I think it actually is going to work really well.

2805
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,360
I kind of think about how many times that we've kind of hoped.

2806
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:27,360
That there was a game like Final Fantasy X or something.

2807
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,360
Where you could just like, I don't want to grind.

2808
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,360
I don't want to do this dungeon.

2809
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32,360
I just want to run past all the monsters.

2810
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:35,360
I want to get my, I'm going to equip the run boots on my character.

2811
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,360
So I can just run really fast through the dungeon.

2812
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,360
So I don't have to grind here.

2813
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,360
Because I just want to get to the next part of the story.

2814
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:44,360
Do you know how many games I've quit because I couldn't get past one certain part?

2815
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:46,360
Fucking Alundra.

2816
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:48,360
Oh my God, that game pissed me off.

2817
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,360
I spent so long trying to do one puzzle.

2818
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:52,360
I could just never get it, so I quit the game.

2819
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,360
But here's the problem.

2820
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,360
My thing though.

2821
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,360
One other thing.

2822
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,360
I think as we start to blur the line even more and more.

2823
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:00,360
As games become more and more realistic between games and movies.

2824
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:03,360
This actually kind of seems like a logical progression to me.

2825
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:07,360
Is that these video games are slowly becoming Blu-ray movies in a way.

2826
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,360
It's fascinating.

2827
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,360
And again, for the hardcore gamers that can be a little off putting at first.

2828
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:17,360
But I don't think this necessarily means that games that you and I enjoy are going to go away.

2829
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:20,360
I think this is just something they're going to start in Nintendo.

2830
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,360
And it's a very Nintendo thing to do.

2831
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,360
It's not surprising at all.

2832
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,360
Okay, sorry Matt.

2833
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:28,360
My thing is, is that a fault of the fact that you can't finish something?

2834
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:32,360
Is that a fault of the person or is that a fault of the game design?

2835
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:34,360
I think it's a fault of the game design.

2836
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:37,360
The fact that they made that many random battles.

2837
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:43,360
You know, they tweaked it in future Final Fantasy games where there aren't that many random battles.

2838
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:46,360
And they've gone back and fixed different things like that.

2839
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,360
Because people complained about it and they listened to it.

2840
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:53,360
But I don't think that necessarily, you know, it's a bad thing that there should be some difficulty in there.

2841
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,360
Because it makes it worthwhile to figure it out.

2842
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:59,360
Instead of just like, if you want to just go from story to story to story.

2843
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,360
Seriously, go read a book. Go watch a movie.

2844
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:02,360
Well, of course.

2845
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:04,360
You know, but they're making it an option for you.

2846
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:06,360
Like, yeah, you know, work at it.

2847
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:10,360
If you really want a sense of accomplishment from beating this game, do it normal.

2848
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,360
But for those people who don't want to, they're giving them the option to.

2849
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:16,360
I just have a problem though with, you know, someone pushing a button, having the game play itself.

2850
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,360
You know, beginning to end.

2851
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:20,360
And just, what's the point?

2852
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:23,360
Because here's what you can't do with a movie, Loki.

2853
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,360
And there's going to be some people like this.

2854
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:28,360
All they're going to do in a Zelda game is go around and talk to the villagers.

2855
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:31,360
And then like fast forward through the action sequences and the dungeons of the game.

2856
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,360
But they're going to feel like a part of the game.

2857
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,360
And they feel that more emotional attachment.

2858
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,360
More interactive.

2859
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:39,360
Because it was more interactive and they just walked around and talked to villagers.

2860
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,360
And that's all they ever did.

2861
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:42,360
And they're going to be like, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

2862
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,360
And you know what's also awesome about that?

2863
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:48,360
The fact that they're going to be done with the game now and they have to buy something else.

2864
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:50,360
Because that's what Nintendo wants to do.

2865
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,360
That's their own choice.

2866
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,360
That's their prerogative.

2867
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:53,360
They can do that if they want to.

2868
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,360
If they want to spend their money.

2869
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:59,360
And you can go on to TheMovieSpoiler.net and look at the ending to all your movies without having to pay $100.

2870
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,360
Alright, fine.

2871
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:01,360
Or whatever it's called.

2872
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,360
I'm going to say this here and now.

2873
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:05,360
This game, whenever it does come out with this feature, I'm not buying it.

2874
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:06,360
I'm sorry.

2875
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,360
This feature right here ruined it for me.

2876
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:11,360
And the fact that they're putting it in this game, I am not buying this game.

2877
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,360
Even though it's optional?

2878
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,360
Even if it's optional.

2879
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,360
I don't give a shit.

2880
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:15,360
I'm not buying it.

2881
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,360
Because you know what?

2882
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:22,360
If they want to design a game that's more appealing to the casual audience, they need to design that game for the casual audience.

2883
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:25,360
It's just like the EA Sports games that they put out.

2884
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:29,360
The really stupid, easy, you can play them with the remote.

2885
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:34,360
They're really stripped down versions of the game because people can't figure out the complex controls.

2886
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,360
Well I'm sorry.

2887
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,360
You know what?

2888
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:40,360
There have been plenty of kids, plenty of people that have figured out the Xbox controllers.

2889
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,360
Figured out the Playstation 2 controllers.

2890
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,360
I'd like to meet them.

2891
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:45,360
Figured out how to use the Wii remote.

2892
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,360
There's people that still don't know how to use the Wii remote.

2893
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:52,360
Unless you come out with a game that's a fucking controller that's a big giant button that says,

2894
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:53,360
Push me.

2895
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,360
And even then they're not going to figure it out.

2896
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:58,360
They're going to throw it on the floor and go, I don't know how to play this.

2897
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:00,360
These people do not need to be playing games.

2898
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:02,360
And I don't care if you want to introduce them in the games.

2899
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:06,360
They think they need to be playing games but they do not need to be playing games.

2900
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:09,360
And keep them away from my goddamn games.

2901
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:13,360
Do you care to make a wager on how much this game will sell?

2902
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:16,360
No, I am not making a wager.

2903
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:21,360
Because it will be a Zelda game and some will be like, Oh my god, Zelda, go buy it.

2904
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:24,360
Even if it's crap, it could be Zelda Cribbage or something.

2905
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:27,360
And they'll be like, Oh my god, I got to buy this, it's Zelda.

2906
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:30,360
Oh my god, Zelda and they have stuff in it.

2907
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:34,360
The chat room is setting off the Loki rant alarm.

2908
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:38,360
Goldanthro in chat says, Wii 2.0, push me.

2909
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:42,360
Rice Princess.

2910
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:50,360
Oh no, I was just going to say, the way I see it, I liken it to having an easy, normal, and hard mode in a game.

2911
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:54,360
There's going to be like, dumb fuck mode.

2912
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:57,360
Don't know how to do anything in the game, just going to watch it play itself.

2913
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:58,360
Whatever, you know.

2914
02:12:58,360 --> 02:12:59,360
Just another mode.

2915
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:00,360
I'm not surprised.

2916
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,360
It's the Wii.

2917
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:02,360
You know, great.

2918
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,360
They're going to have this feature, but I bet you anything they're going to be able to turn it off.

2919
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,360
And you know why?

2920
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:06,360
Because that's a feature.

2921
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:09,360
And Nintendo doesn't add features that people want.

2922
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:12,360
Okay, we're getting back into that, Matt.

2923
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:14,360
We don't need to have that argument on this show.

2924
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:15,360
No, seriously.

2925
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,360
They're not going to have it.

2926
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:18,360
Ah, whatever.

2927
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:19,360
I'm done.

2928
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:21,360
There's a second half to this I want Loki to get into.

2929
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,360
Yes, there's a second half.

2930
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:28,360
Apparently, the game developers were asked to kind of comment on this.

2931
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:30,360
And they have different things.

2932
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:36,360
For example, Ben Matz from Ubisoft, he was saying, you know, he read through it quickly.

2933
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:41,360
Not surely they fully understand what it is yet.

2934
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:48,360
But it says it makes sense to them in a purely linear game, but as soon as they get to sort of like a sandbox game,

2935
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:56,360
or an evenly or remotely open-ended game, the number of variables would seem to invalidate the potential of this system.

2936
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:01,360
But I think he's talking about something that would actually play through the game for you or something like that.

2937
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:05,360
But Ubisoft just put out a game that definitely had easy mode on.

2938
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:07,360
You don't die in Prince of Persia, ever.

2939
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,360
Yeah.

2940
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:13,360
It's kind of interesting because Ubisoft kind of already started going this direction where, you know, you don't die.

2941
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,360
The chick always saves you.

2942
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:19,360
And in every battle, at least that I've played so far, it pretty much tells you how to fight it.

2943
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,360
And you just press buttons and it does cool stuff.

2944
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,360
But, like, it's not a bad game.

2945
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,360
It's really not.

2946
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:27,360
I have a lot of fun with the new Prince of Persia.

2947
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,360
Can I read this in chat real quick?

2948
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:29,360
Yeah.

2949
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:30,360
I'm sorry, this is too good.

2950
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:33,360
GS68 says, I guess talking about, you know, getting irritated at games,

2951
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,360
My face turns beet red.

2952
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:36,360
I throw my controller on the ground, start swearing.

2953
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:37,360
Fucking game.

2954
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:38,360
Long chains.

2955
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:40,360
Swear to never play a shooting game again.

2956
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:42,360
And then SakuraMax follows up and says,

2957
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:47,360
And then you throw a taco at someone.

2958
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:54,360
Todd Howard from Bethesda says that, you know, most people stop playing certain games because they get frustrated or confused by what the game wants them to do.

2959
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:57,360
It becomes work and frustration as opposed to play time.

2960
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:01,360
This idea clearly tries to alleviate that.

2961
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:07,360
It's much like passing the controller to someone that knows the game really well so that you can move ahead or simply enjoy the story.

2962
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:15,360
It's a classic challenge or entertain issue that designers will often deal with.

2963
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,360
Yeah.

2964
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:19,360
And then finally, let's see here.

2965
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:23,360
Jonathan Blow from the creator of Braid says,

2966
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:25,360
Based on just reading your posting, I don't know.

2967
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:31,360
I mean, it's an okay idea for a developer to have a way to show you through various parts of the game, I guess.

2968
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:34,360
To show you the side quests that you missed or whatever.

2969
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:36,360
I'd like to see someone try that.

2970
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:43,360
But as a general, what was it, paradigm for playing games, there are a lot of problems.

2971
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,360
The defining characteristics of a game is that you play it.

2972
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:55,360
And if in order for games to be accessible to a wide audience, we need to make sure that so that most people can skip over the playing part of it,

2973
02:15:55,360 --> 02:16:03,360
then what that really means is that our medium sucks.

2974
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:15,360
And if you have to elude the basic property of your medium to make experiences in the medium desirable, then the medium itself is questionable at a very deep level.

2975
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:21,360
Apparently our stream went down for the live listeners. The podcast listeners won't notice the thing because we've been recording the whole time.

2976
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,360
But our stream went down in the middle of you reading that.

2977
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:27,360
Like, I don't know what's going on tonight. There's some weird things with our internet stream.

2978
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:32,360
But somebody in the chat room had to say, who threw a taco at the stream?

2979
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:37,360
Sorry, that's never going to get old. I'm sorry to derail the other thing you're talking about.

2980
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:44,360
The live listeners didn't even hear what you were just saying, which is unfortunate, but kind of some varied opinions from developers.

2981
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:50,360
Yeah. I mean, definitely it's all over the place, but I think it's something that's only going to be used in Nintendo games anyway.

2982
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,360
It's not something that they're requiring, I don't think.

2983
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:57,360
I wonder if any of these developers are secretly already working on something for this new system. That's what I'm curious about.

2984
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:58,360
I doubt it.

2985
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:00,360
Do you think this is a Nintendo-only thing?

2986
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:04,360
I think this is something they're going to push, and it's probably going to be in one game, and I don't think you'll see it ever again.

2987
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:15,360
I really don't think... I mean, honestly, with this in here, the problem is that we're expecting this to be implemented in a Zelda game.

2988
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:21,360
And really, are you going to be able to tell what kind of an impact this had on a Zelda game?

2989
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:25,360
I mean, this is a title that's going to sell like crazy anyways.

2990
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:31,360
I mean, I would think that they would want this something on, you know, something that doesn't sell very well.

2991
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,360
Like, even Mario Galaxy didn't sell that well.

2992
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:39,360
You know, maybe something like that is where we can see an actual impact on this, but with a Zelda, it's just going to sell like crazy and be like,

2993
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:42,360
Oh, it worked! You know, I mean, it's just stupid.

2994
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:45,360
I don't know. I don't think it's...

2995
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:52,360
They're just going to sell tons of copies anyways, because people are dumb, and they'll buy whatever people tell them is good.

2996
02:17:52,360 --> 02:18:00,360
And Zelda is going to get tens out of ten, because there's fanboys out there that are reviewing that stuff.

2997
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:06,360
And even though Twilight Princess, in my opinion, I don't think that's a ten out of ten game, or not even a nine out of ten game.

2998
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:09,360
It was okay. It was the first Zelda game.

2999
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:15,360
Actually, the GameCube one, or not the GameCube, the Nintendo 64 ones, I didn't care for too much either.

3000
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:26,360
I just was not interested. It just didn't hold my interest, and that's sad, because I'm really interested in Zelda games.

3001
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:30,360
Yeah, but they don't have an objective perspective on the game.

3002
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:32,360
Yeah, I think that's it. Perfectly.

3003
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:35,360
You know, there's going to be like, Grand Theft Auto. Oh, ten out of ten.

3004
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:37,360
You know, Gears of War. Ten out of ten!

3005
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:39,360
Yeah, they don't even have to work on a hit anymore. It's guaranteed.

3006
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:44,360
I mean, that's what you do. You build up a franchise, and you get to the point where it's like, you know, you can do whatever, and people are still going to buy it.

3007
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,360
I don't know.

3008
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:46,360
It's huge.

3009
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:49,360
I'm really curious to see what the listeners think of all this casual stuff.

3010
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:55,360
I haven't seen a whole lot in chat, probably because the stream went down, but I will hopefully see some emails later on.

3011
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:59,360
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, you know, for next week or something would be great.

3012
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:03,360
We will get into tonight's mailbag. Well, how about right now?

3013
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:04,360
Want to open up the mailbag?

3014
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,360
Well, alright then.

3015
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:07,360
Check out some emails from the listeners.

3016
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:08,360
Sure!

3017
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:19,360
Every week we invite you to send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, and usually DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads the emails.

3018
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:22,360
However, she's not here tonight, so I am filling in.

3019
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:27,360
And we actually have quite a few emails tonight, so I want to try and get through these as fast as I can.

3020
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:30,360
Let's read this first email. It's from Chaz.

3021
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:39,360
Hey, OLR gang. I'm a long-time listener of the show, but it's my first time writing in. I listen to you all every Monday at my desk while hard at work here in the frozen tundra known as Chicago.

3022
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:44,360
I listen to a lot of the other video game podcasts out there, and OLR is by far the best. Well, thank you.

3023
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:49,360
I don't really have much to say in the way of video games today, but consider this my love letter to the show.

3024
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,360
How hard does OLR rock? Let me count the ways.

3025
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:55,360
Number three, real gamers with real opinions. Nothing commercial here.

3026
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:56,360
Thank you, that's one of the things we pride ourselves on.

3027
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,360
Yeah, we're definitely not commercial based on the comments and crap that we've-

3028
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:02,360
Brought to you by Nintendo.

3029
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:05,360
By the way, have you checked out Game Tap this week? No, just kidding.

3030
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:11,360
Number two, awesome segments. Classic Game of the Week and Fus of the Week rock my world. Well, thank you.

3031
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:19,360
Number one, good friends with great chemistry. Loki with his blistering honesty, Jamie's hilarious interludes, and Rob's fun-loving and sincere take on gaming culture.

3032
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:23,360
These are just a few of the reasons I am and will continue to be an OLR fanboy.

3033
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:27,360
Also, on a personal note, I'd like to give a special shout out to Rob.

3034
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,360
You think I'd pay this guy to write-

3035
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:31,360
Yeah, you wrote this to yourself.

3036
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,360
No, come over here and read it for sure.

3037
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:39,360
I think it's so great and so important to have an openly gay gamer's voice being heard in the community.

3038
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:51,360
As a gay man myself, you know as well as I do how severely underrepresented and occasionally maligned gay sexuality has been portrayed through the games we've played and how rampant homophobia continues to be in the online gaming sphere.

3039
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:59,360
Thanks for letting listeners know your stand on these issues. It means a lot to me and also to those who are unable for whatever reason to speak up for themselves. Keep up the great work.

3040
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:01,360
Ooh, is he single?

3041
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,360
And not a minor?

3042
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:05,360
Shush. Shush.

3043
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:07,360
No, that was very nice.

3044
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:13,360
You know, it's letters like those that make me feel good about doing this show for free for seven years, honestly.

3045
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:15,360
Oh, tear, tear.

3046
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:26,360
You know, when Wendy says it's right, it's tough. It's really tough sometimes because, you know, the nice thing is being gay is getting more and more accepted. We're getting there.

3047
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:31,360
You know, even though Prop 8 in California didn't pass, it was just- I know, I know, Victoria, don't get me started.

3048
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:37,360
It was a very slim margin compared to Prop 22 of several years ago. We're getting there.

3049
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:40,360
You know, more and more, especially in the youth, no more gay people, what have you.

3050
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:46,360
But it's funny because in the gay world, it's like, oh, you play video games? That's like a kid thing.

3051
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:51,360
You know, why don't you listen to Madonna or do fashion shows? Like seriously, you know, like it's hard.

3052
02:21:51,360 --> 02:22:00,360
Like there was a long time where I didn't feel comfortable when I met guys for the first time, like telling them, yeah, I do an online radio show about video games on the weekends because it's like, whoa, nerd alert.

3053
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:02,360
But now I don't give a shit.

3054
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:15,360
I'm to that point where I've kind of seen there's enough out there that, you know, there's people out there that are going to like me for both elements, if that makes sense.

3055
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:18,360
Anyhow, I don't want to get too into it.

3056
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,360
We can relate to you, Rott.

3057
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,360
How so?

3058
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:31,360
Because girl and girl gamers. I mean, like, you know, a lot of them are kind of, I guess, not really tomboyish, but they kind of shun like female convention.

3059
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:36,360
You know, they're not all of them are bottle blondes that get their nails done every day and wear a lot of makeup.

3060
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:38,360
So it's kind of the same.

3061
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:39,360
Interesting perspective.

3062
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,360
Yeah, true.

3063
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,360
True.

3064
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:43,360
All right, let's get to another email.

3065
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:49,360
And OK, this kind of ties into a story we reported on earlier, but obviously we weren't here last week.

3066
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:50,360
Spazinator writes in.

3067
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:55,360
Hey, everyone, I thought I'd email you folks about some news that I received the other day that you might want to share.

3068
02:22:55,360 --> 02:23:03,360
I have heard via both one up dot com green speak dot com and G4 that Ziff Davis has sold the one up network at sites along with EGM to UGO.

3069
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:07,360
Not to be confused with Yu-Gi-Oh for some undisclosed sum.

3070
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:09,360
Subsequently, UGO is fine.

3071
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:17,360
Now I want to say Yu-Gi-Oh has fired approximately 30 one up employees, including some of the more well-known popularity and popular personalities.

3072
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:19,360
Additionally, EGM has been officially killed off.

3073
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:26,360
And although no one mentioned specifically, it looks like the audio and video podcasts have been axed as well, including one up FM, Retronauts and so on and so on.

3074
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:31,360
On a personal note, I really feel bad for those that got the ax earlier this week are the ones I recognize.

3075
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:38,360
I know they produce top notch material, whether it be for the sites, podcasts or the magazines, and inject their own personality into said material to keep it from going stale.

3076
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,360
I hope for the best for them.

3077
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:46,360
But given the particularly craptastic economy as of late, I'm afraid there's the potential they may leave the video games journalism biz.

3078
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:48,360
If that's the case, the industry would suffer a great loss.

3079
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:52,360
Additionally, it really sickens me that they killed off EGM, a long as hell running magazine.

3080
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:57,360
Isn't it bad enough that OPM was killed in 06 and game for Windows earlier this year?

3081
02:23:57,360 --> 02:24:00,360
I mean, come on, websites are fine and dandy, but magazines still have a place though.

3082
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:04,360
Case in point, which would you rather bring to the can, a mag or a laptop?

3083
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:05,360
Or worse, yes, a desktop.

3084
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:07,360
Wow, it's like this guy read my mind from earlier.

3085
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:08,360
That's amazing.

3086
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:14,360
Not only that, but for some people such as myself, we like the feel of holding a mag in our hands.

3087
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:17,360
While you're in the bathroom, you talk about holding things in your hands.

3088
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:19,360
And you know what, if you run out of toilet paper...

3089
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:20,360
Shut up, shut up.

3090
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:26,360
And sometimes you even like to achieve or collect if you prefer the mags, especially if the magazine is a particularly good publication.

3091
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:36,360
Hell, I still have every single solitary issue of OPM, original PlayStation magazine, all 112 and every single issue of EGM since my OPM subscription rolled over to EGM.

3092
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:38,360
I was wondering, what are your opinions on this?

3093
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:45,360
I know that based on user generated comments on various sites, blogs, et cetera, that most people are uber pissed and vowed never to visit 1up.com again.

3094
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:49,360
Additionally, what other podcast websites and mags would you recommend to fill the void?

3095
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:56,360
Honestly, I want to avoid GameSpot because of their reputation and credibility has been severely tarnished early last year over that army of two firing debacle.

3096
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:59,360
Thank you for the email.

3097
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:01,360
Obviously, we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show.

3098
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:09,360
But the point that he brought up that I thought was interesting was that last paragraph was based on everybody complaining, they vowing never to visit 1up.com and all this stuff again.

3099
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:17,360
But here's the thing, EGM has really gone through a lot of changes since the beginning. Do a lot of people that worked there in the first couple of years work there now?

3100
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:23,360
Very, very few. And I know that because most of the people working at 1up.com were in their early 30s or late 20s.

3101
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:27,360
So they would have been like teenagers when the magazines first came out.

3102
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:33,360
So these magazines have already changed the guards a few times.

3103
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:45,360
So my question back to you guys is, yes, these guys integrated their personalities into the show and everything, which in turn probably ended up being bad for 1up.com because this would have never happened had they never had those podcasts.

3104
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:50,360
Think about it. If they never had those podcasts, if they never built up that personality, it's kind of like a double edged sword.

3105
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:54,360
It probably really helped sell their site. But at the same time, now they're having to deal with this.

3106
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:59,360
What if you'd never really gotten to know those writers as well as you did? Would you have cared so much about this news?

3107
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:09,360
Kind of interesting. Because I bet this kind of stuff has happened before. You didn't care because you didn't feel that connection to them from reading their Twitters, looking at their podcasts, so on and so on.

3108
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:14,360
So kind of interesting.

3109
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:24,360
As far as what to recommend to fill the void, I've said this before and I've said it again. There's hundreds of people out there, almost thousands, that do stuff like we do for free every week.

3110
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:29,360
This kind of stuff. Because we love video games too, even though it doesn't sound like it sometimes because we get ranty and things like that.

3111
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:38,360
It's just because we hate because we love. There's other independent podcasts that are great and awesome that you can tune out there and listen to.

3112
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:45,360
There's tons of networks. If you don't know where to begin, look for some of the networks that have come together, such as AllGames.com.

3113
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:55,360
There's what? Gamercast network, I think they're called. Especially if you like Xbox. They have a lot of Xbox centric shows over there. Look for some of the networks of shows.

3114
02:26:55,360 --> 02:27:05,360
Because that's kind of what OneUp was, was a network, except it was a little different because they were all still produced in house. Whereas I think in the case of AllGames, Gamercast, and whatever other networks you can think of.

3115
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:15,360
What's the other one? Platform Nation I think is another one. Is Evil Avatar a network? I don't know off the top of my head.

3116
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:23,360
I think the difference is that OneUp produced all those in house. Everybody produces their own little silo show and they come together on these networks.

3117
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:30,360
There's lots of people that love games that would love to talk about them with you out there on the internets.

3118
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:38,360
And obviously if you still feel connected to the OneUp guys, it sounds like they're doing their own show. So maybe it'll last for them. We'll see.

3119
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:53,360
Alright. I said them right? I don't remember. I think so. Okay. By the way, just for the live listeners only, and I apologize I'm too lazy to edit this kind of stuff out of the podcast.

3120
02:27:53,360 --> 02:28:00,360
Apparently the stream is skipping now. It sounds like a CD that's skipping or something. That's not on our end guys. I don't know what's going on.

3121
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:07,360
I have had cable issues. I did not get to go to a WoW raid on Thursday because of Comcast cable issues.

3122
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,360
Yeah, they've been suckers.

3123
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:11,360
God forbid you miss your story of the castle.

3124
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:21,360
For real. For real. And by the way, it was the dragon battle, Malygos, that I missed. And I was the only one attuned for it, so the whole guild didn't get to go because I couldn't sign on because of Comcast.

3125
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:29,360
So it was big drama. Big drama. But anyway, I don't know what's going on. I don't know if it's us. I don't know if it's the server. Something's up.

3126
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:36,360
But the podcast will be up in its entirety along with last week's podcast this week on the stream. Promise?

3127
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:40,360
More emails, except I just closed the mailbag. Whoops.

3128
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:42,360
Way to go, Rod.

3129
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:47,360
Sorry about that. Anything else you guys want to say on that last email? About other places to go?

3130
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:49,360
I don't think you touched anything.

3131
02:28:49,360 --> 02:29:01,360
All right. GS68 emails us. Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68. So I've gotten to play my DJ Max Technica some more, thanks to me taking advantage of my winter break to go to Spiggle regularly. That's Sunnyvale Golf Land.

3132
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:06,360
For those not familiar with Technica, the game goes like this. One half of the screen is filled with stationary notes and a line passes over them.

3133
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:15,360
As the line does, you touch the notes to recreate parts of the music. Sometimes you get special notes, such as blue notes that you hold down, green and yellow notes that you drag along, and purple notes that you press repeatedly.

3134
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:19,360
When the line reaches the end, it continues on the other half of the screen.

3135
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:28,360
I feel that this game is the right step for the rhythm game genre. There's always two to three people waiting to play the game at Sunnyvale Golf Land, which shows that Technica just might keep arcades going somewhat longer.

3136
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:35,360
I doubt it. I hate to be the pessimist, but one game ain't gonna happen. But I appreciate your enthusiasm.

3137
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:47,360
The touch screen in the EBA meets luminous gameplay allows for more freedom of movement and play styles, as opposed to, say, BeatMania 2DX or DDR. I've seen players use one hand, both hands, one or two fingers, all of their fingers, and so on.

3138
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:58,360
It does have some flaws, though. Scoring and grades are combo-based, and if I've learned anything from EBA and Ohndon, it's that combo-based scoring is retarded, as where you screw up has a big impact on your score.

3139
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:14,360
Also, the life meter is fairly strict. Though it falls to just as much as, say, DDR or other DJMax games, it takes forever to recover your life gauge, which is a problem in technical mode, where you need to be above a certain amount of life to get to the next stage, not unlike 2DX or Pop'n Music's regular modes.

3140
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:24,360
And of course, being a touch-to-the-notes game as opposed to hit notes as they pass a redline game, it's harder to sight-read a song. I've seen otherwise good players fail a song because of the offbeat notes.

3141
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:30,360
Songs that are faster tend to be also harder than slow songs because the notes are more spaced out and you have less time to survey the notes.

3142
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:41,360
I'm hoping something good comes out of having a card. I have one myself, and so far it's only apparent features or modifiers, which you use max points on, and Platinum Crew mode, which is some sort of online mode I'll discuss later when it's activated.

3143
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:45,360
Also, our machine is looking to get an update in a few days. Hopefully we'll get some new songs about it.

3144
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:54,360
Also a minor but nice touch, there's a headphone jack below the touchscreen if it's hard to hear the game. Using headphones can help. Take care, maybe I'll see some of you at Spiggle.

3145
02:30:54,360 --> 02:31:00,360
P.S. this email was brought to you by Beatrock3 from Pop'n Music, home of the never-ending Falling Books.

3146
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:02,360
So there you go.

3147
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:07,360
It sounds interesting. I want to try this touch game. It sounds interesting.

3148
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:08,360
Go to Spiggle.

3149
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:17,360
I actually am supposed to be in South Bay February 7th anyway, and I'm taking Victoria with me, so maybe I'll take Victoria to the arcade because we have Rocky in the South Bay on the 7th.

3150
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:23,360
So maybe we can swing by and check out this game. Don't you want to go play video games, Victoria?

3151
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:25,360
OMG, totally.

3152
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:29,360
Alright, she just rolled her eyes. You don't want to play DDR, Victoria?

3153
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:38,360
I'm an epic fail at DDR, my fat ass on the damn thing, I'm like on easy, I'm like oh girl, oh girl, I need a break.

3154
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:40,360
You can play pinball or something that's less stressful.

3155
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:41,360
Holla.

3156
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:42,360
Alright.

3157
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:46,360
Also Victoria's ass is not fat, it's just round.

3158
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:51,360
I like big butts and I cannot lie. Actually I don't think Victoria's fat, but whatever.

3159
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:55,360
No, she's not at all. She's beautiful and single.

3160
02:31:55,360 --> 02:31:58,360
Stop trying to pimp me, Irene.

3161
02:31:58,360 --> 02:32:01,360
I'm not at all.

3162
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:08,360
Um, let me read another email here from R.J.

3163
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:11,360
Because I don't see another signature here, so I'm just going to say R.J.

3164
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:16,360
Hey OLR, I'm using my lovely eye touch to send this email, so be warned Jamie if the Grammar Nazi bar is high.

3165
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:20,360
You lucked out, you read me tonight and I have terrible grammar so I don't judge the others.

3166
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:24,360
I've just finished Infinite Undiscovery and Lost Odyssey and I'm planning on getting The Last Remnant next,

3167
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:29,360
which I've heard is a slightly generic story but a robust and interesting battle system, so I'll tell you what I've experienced next time.

3168
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:34,360
Now as Rob said countless times, the beginning in Infinite Undiscovery was annoying, but the ogre part lasts not even an hour,

3169
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:39,360
and after that the game's gameplay and story will always leave you wanting to keep continuing with it,

3170
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:42,360
even if the English voiceover for some of the characters are dreadful.

3171
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:48,360
That's the opposite case of Lost Odyssey, which has some of the best English voiceover in years, especially Janssen.

3172
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:53,360
The bad point for Lost Odyssey is the boring turn-based gameplay which brings nothing new at all to the table.

3173
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:57,360
Nevertheless, both leave you satisfied at the end and don't suffer from rehashed plot points.

3174
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:04,360
If you wish story is better, I'm sorry, which story is better, Lost Odyssey is and has superb presentation.

3175
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:11,360
With Infinite Undiscovery gameplay, in my opinion, fun yet repetitive at parts. Don't hesitate on getting either.

3176
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:16,360
So interesting because I gave up on Infinite Undiscovery because the beginning is terrible.

3177
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:17,360
Really?

3178
02:33:17,360 --> 02:33:20,360
Oh, but I even got past that ogre part he's talking about.

3179
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:25,360
No, maybe because I got into like the really dark forest and that part annoyed me too and whatever.

3180
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,360
I'll go back to it someday.

3181
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:29,360
Too bad you didn't have a button to just pass.

3182
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:34,360
For real. For real. Thank you. Seriously? Seriously, I would have hit the button on that game.

3183
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:35,360
For serious, yeah.

3184
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:36,360
I would have. For real.

3185
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:38,360
Yeah. For realsies.

3186
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:43,360
And it's signed P.S. Rob. Queen was the better 70s band than ABBA.

3187
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:46,360
I love Queen. Queen is amazing.

3188
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:49,360
Queen is amazing. Queen Mercury was...

3189
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:50,360
I know. Freddie Mercury is a god.

3190
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:51,360
I would love to be his head. Oh my god.

3191
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:53,360
Freddie Mercury was a god, really.

3192
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:58,360
But, I'm sorry, ABBA's still number one. But Queen is like seriously two or three. Seriously.

3193
02:33:58,360 --> 02:33:59,360
Two or maybe three.

3194
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:01,360
Maybe two or three. Because Bowie's kind of, you know.

3195
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:06,360
Oh, from Labyrinth. He's awesome.

3196
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:07,360
There you go. That's my thoughts on that.

3197
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:12,360
And just a couple more here. Sorry, I know we have a lot of emails tonight, but that's alright.

3198
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:13,360
We don't have a lot of...

3199
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:18,360
This one's for Fart Princess, which we haven't called her that tonight, but Fart Princess.

3200
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:23,360
No, since Rice or Fart Princess, which, by the way, can I say this about Fart Princess real quick?

3201
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,360
I was on WoW last night.

3202
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:26,360
Okay, do you have to bring this up?

3203
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:27,360
Boo!

3204
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:28,360
Thank you.

3205
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:32,360
And for an hour, she was talking about farts and guilt chat.

3206
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:35,360
It was not an hour. It was like five minutes.

3207
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:36,360
It felt like an hour.

3208
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,360
It was incidental, okay?

3209
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:41,360
She talked to you. You were talking about farts for an hour.

3210
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:46,360
And Vlad kept talking to me, okay? So, obviously, someone was interested in what I had to say.

3211
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:51,360
Since Rice Princess is here tonight, this is from Amaze Satsuma, I'll go ahead and ask,

3212
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:54,360
how did you all like the latest Battlestar Galactica episode?

3213
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:55,360
Oh my god!

3214
02:34:55,360 --> 02:35:00,360
We all know the BSG talk is in, was going to happen sooner or later with her here,

3215
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,360
so I thought I'd give it a helping hand.

3216
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:05,360
No spoilers. I haven't watched it yet because I'm still on season three.

3217
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:10,360
This doesn't spoil anything, but I am depressed beyond belief.

3218
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:15,360
I want to elaborate more, but I can't because then I'll start getting into the spoilers.

3219
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:19,360
But, oh man, I absolutely want to keep watching.

3220
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:23,360
They know how to make people keep coming back and wanting more.

3221
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:27,360
And this is just, yeah, but better.

3222
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:32,360
I did hear, because it was inadvertently spoiled for me, that now the last Cylon has been revealed, right?

3223
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:33,360
You here tell correct.

3224
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:35,360
Was it shocking?

3225
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:38,360
I thought it was stupid.

3226
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:43,360
I hope that's not a spoiler, but I'm hoping that it wasn't an actual revelation of the final Cylon,

3227
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:49,360
that it was just speculation on behalf of one of the characters in the show.

3228
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:54,360
But, I don't know, I think it pretty much is confirmation that it is the last Cylon,

3229
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:57,360
but if that is the last Cylon, I'll be upset.

3230
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,360
Alright.

3231
02:35:58,360 --> 02:35:59,360
That's all I have to say.

3232
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,360
Yeah.

3233
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,360
Okay.

3234
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:02,360
That's enough. We won't say any more.

3235
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:04,360
Okay. No BSG.

3236
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:05,360
Alright.

3237
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:11,360
One other email from our old buddy DMN who wants to update you on the March Madness competition that's going on.

3238
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:14,360
Remember, this is the controversial one last year where Super Metroid beat Chrono Trigger,

3239
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:16,360
and I got hate mail for a year because of it?

3240
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:18,360
Yeah, as deserved.

3241
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:22,360
Here is your chance to write what has been wronged.

3242
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:28,360
You can send your top 25 to Bresloll, I guess is his name.

3243
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:31,360
But there's a specific email address you actually want to send those to.

3244
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:33,360
I know it's a Gmail address.

3245
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:34,360
Let me look it up real quick.

3246
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:36,360
And this is the last week to do so, by the way.

3247
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:37,360
There's like six days left.

3248
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:41,360
uslmadness, all one word, at gmail.com.

3249
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:45,360
You want to send those into Bresloll as fast as you can because you only have six days left.

3250
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:47,360
Here's the rundown of the top 25 so far.

3251
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:53,360
Keep in mind, this is only determining the seeds for the head-to-head competitions that will happen later on.

3252
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:56,360

3274
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:39,360

02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:48,360
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

3279
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:50,360
Like five places up.

3280
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:55,360
And the current number one game of all time, according to the people who have emailed.

3281
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:56,360
Big Rigs.

3282
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:57,360
No.

3283
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:58,360
Just kidding.

3284
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,360
Rock Band is the number one game of all time.

3285
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:05,360
If you consider that music game fans, you know, is our roots, I'm not surprised.

3286
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:11,360
But, if you disagree, here's your chance to send in your list to make Super Metroid number one so it gets a little higher.

3287
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:13,360
Why the fuck is Pokemon on there?

3288
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,360
Alright.

3289
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:15,360
I don't like Pokemon.

3290
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:16,360
So there you go.

3291
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:19,360
If you disagree, again, get those lists in, you have six days left.

3292
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:20,360
That's it.

3293
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:21,360
Okay, thanks Rob.

3294
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:22,360
Because they're closing the polls.

3295
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,360
So, are you going to send in a list?

3296
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,360
Your top 25 of all time?

3297
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:25,360
Probably not.

3298
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:27,360
I already know my, I'm secure in my decision.

3299
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:29,360
My top five games of all time.

3300
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,360
Alright.

3301
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:31,360
I don't need to, like, validate it.

3302
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,360
Alright.

3303
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,360
Just stuck up, bitch.

3304
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,360
Alright.

3305
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:35,360
That's going to do it for the emails.

3306
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:40,360
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you'd like to send your own email in for read, for

3307
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:41,360
reading?

3308
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:42,360
Red read?

3309
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:43,360
I don't know, Rob.

3310
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:44,360
To read on the air next week.

3311
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,360
Speak English.

3312
02:38:45,360 --> 02:38:46,360
Thank God Jamie's not here.

3313
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:47,360
I would have just got a fail award.

3314
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:48,360
Yeah.

3315
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:49,360
She would have thrown a taco at you.

3316
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:53,360
Back to some gaming news, and then we're going to take some calls on the Skype line at 1877.

3317
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:56,360
You mean Victoria's going to take a call?

3318
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,360
1877 Game OLR.

3319
02:38:57,360 --> 02:38:58,360
In a little bit.

3320
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:00,360
We still have some stories.

3321
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:01,360
Loki.

3322
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:07,360
This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we'll be getting the brand new game, The Maw.

3323
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:10,360
The Maw is being put out by TwistedPixels.

3324
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:16,360
It's an adventure platformer that places you in the role of Frank, an alien stranded on

3325
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:21,360
a strange planet with The Maw, a strange blob-like creature that acts like his only friend and

3326
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:26,360
ultimate weapon all at the same time.

3327
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:29,360
Let's see, it will be available for 800 Microsoft points.

3328
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:35,360
We'll be out on the 21st, and if I remember correctly, I think The Maw was a winner of

3329
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:40,360
some award during PAX, but I can't remember what it was.

3330
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,360
Oh well.

3331
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:44,360
Was it one of those indie games that was featured in the center?

3332
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:45,360
Yes, it was.

3333
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:47,360
I remember hearing about that.

3334
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:48,360
That's cool.

3335
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:49,360
Very neat.

3336
02:39:49,360 --> 02:39:50,360
Awesome.

3337
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:54,360
Fable 2, which I'm finally going to get a chance to play this week, because Loki helped

3338
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:57,360
me get hooked up with a copy of Fable 2, so I'm going to check that out this week, and

3339
02:39:57,360 --> 02:40:00,360
I know this is a game that, like, Dark Soccer has been playing a lot.

3340
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:04,360
I haven't seen her on Xbox Live a lot until this game came out, and apparently she's been

3341
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:08,360
playing with, like, OLR people and stuff, so I'm going to get on there and finally get

3342
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:09,360
to play some Fable 2.

3343
02:40:09,360 --> 02:40:10,360
You're not a big fan?

3344
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,360
It's okay.

3345
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:14,360
I actually have to go back and play because I want to finish it.

3346
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:15,360
It's short.

3347
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:20,360
I'm thinking about getting the download content, though, for it, then I can start Fallout 3.

3348
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:21,360
Or maybe Lost Aussie.

3349
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:23,360
I may have to go back to Lost Aussie.

3350
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,860
Well, I think I'm going to check out Fable 2.

3351
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:30,360
I might even play it tonight and force Victoria to watch some of it with me, but we'll see.

3352
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:32,360
Victoria, I just caught Victoria's attention.

3353
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:33,360
I'm going to play some Fable 2 tonight.

3354
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:35,360
It's a video game.

3355
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:37,360
She's going yippee.

3356
02:40:37,360 --> 02:40:38,360
You'll have my laptop.

3357
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:40,360
You can chat with your hoes on AOL.

3358
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:41,360
You'll be fine.

3359
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:47,360
You can marry people of the same sex or, like, have multiple husbands and wives and babies.

3360
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:51,360
Well, I've been watching Sauce, you know, or Tiara, whatever you want to call her.

3361
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:52,360
She's been on this show a couple times.

3362
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:55,360
I've been watching her tweets that have been updating us on the progress of her.

3363
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:57,360
It sounds like she's having a lot of fun.

3364
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:01,360
I think she has two husbands and a wife and a child named Optimus Prime.

3365
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:04,360
So I want to check this out.

3366
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:10,360
So anyhow, speaking of Fable 2, the download content, not whole island, finally came out.

3367
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:15,360
Apparently, there's a weapon in it called Howl's Rifle.

3368
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:20,360
The funny thing about it, it looks exactly like the assault rifle from Halo.

3369
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:21,360
Get it?

3370
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:22,360
Howl?

3371
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:23,360
Halo?

3372
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:28,360
59 damage per shot, 24 shots per clip, and has an empty augment slot.

3373
02:41:28,360 --> 02:41:32,360
So basically, they kind of made a little Halo lol joke in the download content.

3374
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:33,360
Halo.

3375
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,360
Halo.

3376
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:35,360
Wow.

3377
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:36,360
Nice.

3378
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:40,360
Redtertainment says, Sky, why are you forcing Victoria to do things?

3379
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,360
What is she, your girlfriend?

3380
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:43,360
No, but kind of.

3381
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:45,360
I mean, she's like one of my hags.

3382
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:47,360
So, and she has to crash here all weekend.

3383
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:50,360
So I've got, I've got two of my hags here tonight.

3384
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:51,360
I'm very special.

3385
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:55,360
It's the least I could do for letting, you know, him letting me stay here and not sleep

3386
02:41:55,360 --> 02:41:56,360
in my car.

3387
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:59,360
It's the least that she can do as his hag.

3388
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:02,360
We have hag duties, you know, that we have to do.

3389
02:42:02,360 --> 02:42:04,360
And this is some of it.

3390
02:42:04,360 --> 02:42:05,360
What did it say?

3391
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:08,360
If the hag, if the hag don't like you, the fag.

3392
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:10,360
If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you.

3393
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:12,360
But that goes the other way around too.

3394
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:13,360
Yep.

3395
02:42:13,360 --> 02:42:14,360
It does go there.

3396
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:16,360
Like I have to approve of anyone Victoria or Irene dates.

3397
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:17,360
This is true.

3398
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,360
Yep.

3399
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:19,360
I have to approve.

3400
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:20,360
Of?

3401
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:21,360
Of?

3402
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:25,360
Well, don't ask that on the radio for God's sake.

3403
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:29,360
If, if I didn't, I would have said something already.

3404
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:33,360
And you, you Irene have been, you know, with your man a long time.

3405
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:34,360
I've been with my man.

3406
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:37,360
So if I disapproved, I would have said something a long time ago.

3407
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:39,360
You would have bitch slapped the shit out of him.

3408
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:40,360
I would have bitch slapped you.

3409
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:41,360
All right.

3410
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,360
Cause Irene makes no qualms if she dislikes somebody I'm dating.

3411
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:47,360
Yes, we know.

3412
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:52,360
Nellie was saying that she wants to get a second wife to do all the cleaning and cooking

3413
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:54,360
because she doesn't do any of that.

3414
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,360
You should.

3415
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,360
All right.

3416
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:57,360
Anyhow.

3417
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:58,360
I'm sorry.

3418
02:42:58,360 --> 02:42:59,360
We got derailed talking.

3419
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:01,360
If you become a gay man, that will be easy.

3420
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:04,360
Cause you'll get a bunch of hags who will do that for you.

3421
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:06,360
Why can't I have street hags?

3422
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,360
Because there's no such thing as a straight hag.

3423
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:09,360
Are you ridiculous?

3424
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,360
I am going to pioneer this.

3425
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:12,360
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

3426
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,360
Yes I can.

3427
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:15,360
What else do you do with cake?

3428
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:16,360
You should take applications.

3429
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,360
I don't know how many people like tacos.

3430
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:20,360
Loki, you have a radio show.

3431
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:23,360
You should solicit applications for some straight hags.

3432
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:29,360
Cause see street hags, that's actual real hags and no one likes real hags.

3433
02:43:29,360 --> 02:43:32,360
You should just put on the application four tooth minimum.

3434
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:36,360
No fat chicks.

3435
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,360
All right.

3436
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:42,360
Anyways, SSJ100 Matt says Loki needs to find a girl who's into airsofts.

3437
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:43,360
Wait a minute though.

3438
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:44,360
We're not trying to set him up on a date.

3439
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:45,360
He's very happily married.

3440
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:47,360
Him and Nellie get along fabulously.

3441
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:50,360
He just wants a maid that works for free.

3442
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:53,360
I just want someone that'll cook.

3443
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:55,360
Well I cook, so that's fine.

3444
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:58,360
Mainly clean and maybe walk around naked if she's hot.

3445
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:00,360
Yeah, why not?

3446
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:02,360
Is that so much to ask?

3447
02:44:02,360 --> 02:44:03,360
Geez.

3448
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:04,360
It's not asking much.

3449
02:44:04,360 --> 02:44:06,360
I'm not asking to have sex with me or something.

3450
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:12,360
No, you want someone for Nellie to nag so that she gets it out of her system before you get home.

3451
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:14,360
Oh thank god.

3452
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:18,360
I was like, that would be awesome.

3453
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:20,360
Speaking of the airsoft stuff.

3454
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:22,360
Doesn't even have to be a woman.

3455
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:26,360
I haven't been good when it comes to the airsoft stuff.

3456
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:28,360
Sorry, OLR Studio Drama.

3457
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:30,360
You know how we tape in the garage basically, very thin wall.

3458
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:33,360
I think I can hear the neighbor yelling at a dog or something.

3459
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:35,360
We can hear it all the way here in the garage.

3460
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:37,360
Oh my god, I hope he's not throwing his...

3461
02:44:37,360 --> 02:44:40,360
I think somebody just threw a taco across the street at the dog.

3462
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:42,360
Really? I'll be back.

3463
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:44,360
Anyways, I'm hungry.

3464
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:46,360
Back to game news here.

3465
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:55,360
We talked about last week how there was a game that possibly will get removed off of the app store relatively soon if Nintendo caught wind of it.

3466
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:57,360
And that was the Game & Watch game.

3467
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:59,360
Well now there's another Nintendo game.

3468
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:01,360
Duck Hunt is now available for $1.

3469
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:03,360
Damn, I forgot to download the Game & Watch game.

3470
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,360
Shit.

3471
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:05,360
Oh no.

3472
02:45:05,360 --> 02:45:07,360
Well I don't know if it might still be up there.

3473
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:09,360
I mean, you just better check.

3474
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:14,360
And then Duck Hunt is available now for a dollar.

3475
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:16,360
One dollar.

3476
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:18,360
Yes, one dollar.

3477
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:20,360
And it has everything in the game.

3478
02:45:20,360 --> 02:45:22,360
Ducks and no annoying dog.

3479
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:25,360
You move the cursor around and shoot ducks.

3480
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:27,360
All for a dollar.

3481
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:28,360
All for a dollar.

3482
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:30,360
What a bargain.

3483
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:34,360
But the laughing dog isn't in it, so what the hell's the point?

3484
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:37,360
You shoot ducks.

3485
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:41,360
Well, you know, maybe they didn't like the dog.

3486
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:43,360
So, you know.

3487
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:44,360
Who cares?

3488
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:49,360
Hence the reason he prefaced that statement with annoying.

3489
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:52,360
Alright, sorry, I'm looking for the Game & Watch games right now to see if they're there.

3490
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:53,360
I don't think they're there.

3491
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:54,360
What was the name of it?

3492
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:57,360
Um, crap.

3493
02:45:57,360 --> 02:46:01,360
I searched for Game & Watch and didn't find anything.

3494
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:03,360
Here, just one second, I can find it for you.

3495
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:08,360
It is... it's not called Game & Watch, it's called...

3496
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:10,360
Alright, you look while I talk about the next story.

3497
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:14,360
Here it is, it's GW Chef, GW Parachute, GW Fire.

3498
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:15,360
Just look for GW.

3499
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:17,360
GW, thank you.

3500
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:21,360
Alright, I'll look at that after I read you this story because this is pretty exciting, okay?

3501
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:24,360
I love the Commodore 64.

3502
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,360
Didn't you love the Commodore 64?

3503
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:26,360
Oh my gosh, some of it, yeah.

3504
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:31,360
Do you remember, if I start talking this, you are standing in front of a White House.

3505
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:32,360
There is a mailbox here.

3506
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:34,360
Is that Zork?

3507
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:36,360
It is Zork, exactly right.

3508
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:38,360
You have been eaten by a grew.

3509
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:39,360
Oh, I knew you were going to do that.

3510
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:44,360
Okay, and obviously Zork actually had a couple of other games that came out later, like Zork Grand & Quizzer.

3511
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:46,360
They were kind of cute, funny games.

3512
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:50,360
Well, apparently Zork is coming back as an MMO.

3513
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,360
What?

3514
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:52,360
Legends of Zork.

3515
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:54,360
Wiggity what?

3516
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:57,360
Joel Online is resurrecting the Zork franchise.

3517
02:46:57,360 --> 02:46:58,360
It's a game called Legends of Zork.

3518
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:01,360
It's a casual, browser-based MMO.

3519
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:06,360
I don't think it's up just yet, but they actually were interviewed by Grandma Sutra recently,

3520
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:09,360
and they have mentioned that the game is going to feature microtransactions.

3521
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:12,360
You can play it on the computer or the iPhone.

3522
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:14,360
So that's kind of cool.

3523
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:15,360
Sweet.

3524
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:16,360
There you go.

3525
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,360
What are you so upset about?

3526
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:18,360
My phone just died.

3527
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:20,360
Victoria's phone died, big drama.

3528
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:23,360
Maybe we could bring it back to life.

3529
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:27,360
I'm wondering how fast it's going to be before people get eaten by a grew.

3530
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:30,360
I want to push Irene in front of a grew.

3531
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:35,360
I'm going to push you off the edge of something from Impossible Mission.

3532
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:37,360
No.

3533
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:40,360
I almost did that for the classic game tonight, but it was Loki's turn.

3534
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:42,360
Oh my gosh, I love that game so much.

3535
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:46,360
It was Loki's turn, and I actually found another Commodore 64 game I wanted to do first before Impossible Mission.

3536
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:50,360
You need to get the sound bites from that game and use it sometimes in here.

3537
02:47:50,360 --> 02:47:52,360
Stay a while.

3538
02:47:52,360 --> 02:47:54,360
Stay forever.

3539
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:55,360
Hold on a minute.

3540
02:47:55,360 --> 02:48:01,360
I love that game so much, but I couldn't ever play it because I was only like 10.

3541
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:05,360
You know, I never realized what it was he was saying in the beginning of the game.

3542
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,360
Another visitor.

3543
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:08,360
Yeah.

3544
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:09,360
Visitor.

3545
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:11,360
Stay a while.

3546
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:15,360
Stay forever.

3547
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:16,360
Anyhow.

3548
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:17,360
What does he say?

3549
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:19,360
Get him my robots or something.

3550
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:20,360
Shut up.

3551
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:21,360
Let's go on to the story.

3552
02:48:21,360 --> 02:48:23,360
Two more stories before we open up the Skyblind.

3553
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:25,360
Hurry. Go. Do it.

3554
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:26,360
Loki.

3555
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,360
Well, there's some other fun stuff.

3556
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:32,360
We talked about Klonoa coming out on the Wii.

3557
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:35,360
It's actually been out on the Wii already in Japan.

3558
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:38,360
And, of course, will be coming out over here.

3559
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:40,360
Pretty soon, actually.

3560
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:45,360
It's been announced that sometime in 2009 it will be available.

3561
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:48,360
Or possibly April.

3562
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:50,360
Then it might move. Who knows?

3563
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:51,360
April 4th.

3564
02:48:51,360 --> 02:48:52,360
No, not April 4th.

3565
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:54,360
Why not?

3566
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:58,360
It's a great day to release stuff.

3567
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,360
April 4th.

3568
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:04,360
And, you know, when these games come out, you can rent them at Game.

3569
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:07,360
That's right. Game is not here in the US.

3570
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:09,360
So if you're looking confused, like, what the hell is Game?

3571
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:13,360
It's actually a big competitor for the GameStop EB behemoth over in Europe.

3572
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:16,360
And it's also in Australia and parts of Asia.

3573
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:19,360
They actually are only in the business of selling new and used games right now.

3574
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,360
But soon they are going to rent games.

3575
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:24,360
They partnered up with a group called Swap Game.

3576
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:29,360
So they're going to be offering folks over in the UK the option of paying a monthly subscription fee

3577
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:32,360
that will allow them to rent two games at a time.

3578
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:34,360
Like a GameStop employee.

3579
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:36,360
Yeah, interesting business model, though.

3580
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:39,360
Do you think that's going to make them a lot of money?

3581
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:41,360
Rental, it couldn't hurt.

3582
02:49:41,360 --> 02:49:44,360
I mean, I think it, well...

3583
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:46,360
Why not? A lot of those sites are making money.

3584
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:50,360
If they're going to do, like, a mail service where they're going to mail out the games or something.

3585
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:55,360
I don't know. I was just thinking if I ever opened up a game store, I'd want to name it Store.

3586
02:49:55,360 --> 02:49:58,360
You know, because let's just get it as broad as possible.

3587
02:49:58,360 --> 02:49:59,360
Store.

3588
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:02,360
Good luck getting any new releases, though, from a place like this.

3589
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:07,360
You know, I always wondered, like, because movie rental stores always rent games.

3590
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:10,360
But that never made sense that game stores never rented games.

3591
02:50:10,360 --> 02:50:13,360
Like, you would think that's where you would go to do something like that.

3592
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:17,360
I have a few customers of mine that actually rent games and they sell games, too.

3593
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:21,360
So, it's something that they do, but it doesn't make them a lot of money.

3594
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:26,360
Yeah, but no game stores here in America right now rent out games, do they?

3595
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:31,360
Maybe if you want to consider GameCrazy, which basically is in a Hollywood video.

3596
02:50:31,360 --> 02:50:35,360
Yeah, I don't know. I think of GameCrazy as not, like, an independent thing.

3597
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:38,360
I think of them as, like, part of Hollywood video.

3598
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:39,360
Yeah.

3599
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:41,360
I mean, you know, that's a movie rental place.

3600
02:50:41,360 --> 02:50:44,360
And GameStop wouldn't do it because they would cut into their used game sales.

3601
02:50:44,360 --> 02:50:50,360
Because, you know, why bother paying $30 for, you know, a $40 game or something like that

3602
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:53,360
when they can rent it for $7 and beat it in a week or so.

3603
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:58,360
Well, they could still do the buybacks of the used games and then rent out those games as a buyback.

3604
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:00,360
And besides, those games they consider new.

3605
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:02,360
Remember, they just put a little sticker on them.

3606
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:03,360
I want to say this.

3607
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:07,360
Misty in chat says, it sounds more immediate than GameFly if it weren't a mail-based return system.

3608
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,360
And that's true.

3609
02:51:08,360 --> 02:51:10,360
And some people don't like to do the mail thing.

3610
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:12,360
I mean, Netflix is huge, but they're still Blockbuster.

3611
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:15,360
Because sometimes, you know, just like even last night, Victoria was over.

3612
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:18,360
I was here, bored, done with WoW.

3613
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:19,360
Let's watch a movie.

3614
02:51:19,360 --> 02:51:23,360
But, you know, I didn't want to wait for Netflix.

3615
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:25,360
We tried looking on the PlayStation.

3616
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:26,360
There was nothing we wanted to pay to Dallas.

3617
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:28,360
I was like, well, maybe we should just go to Blockbuster and look.

3618
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:29,360
Exactly.

3619
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:33,360
You know, sometimes you want that instant gratification that even the mail won't get you.

3620
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,360
Yeah.

3621
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:36,360
No, that's kind of like, I don't know.

3622
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:41,360
That's why I prefer having the monthly thing at Blockbuster where you can go in the store and rent it

3623
02:51:41,360 --> 02:51:43,360
as opposed to their total access online or whatever.

3624
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:44,360
No.

3625
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:50,360
I'm surprised and I'm sure it will happen that they haven't done game rentals available over, you know,

3626
02:51:50,360 --> 02:51:52,360
like Xbox Live or something like that.

3627
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:55,360
You download the game and you have it for seven days or something.

3628
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:57,360
Probably just a matter of time.

3629
02:51:57,360 --> 02:52:02,360
If they could make money off renting the game, then selling the game, that would be amazing.

3630
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:03,360
That would be, yeah.

3631
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:04,360
Smart business would be.

3632
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:05,360
Oh, there you go.

3633
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:06,360
Next.

3634
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:07,360
All right.

3635
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:08,360
That's it for stories tonight.

3636
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,360
We're going to get into some last-minute stories.

3637
02:52:09,360 --> 02:52:14,360
But first, we want to take your calls on the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3638
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:18,360
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you have the Skype program and want to talk to us that way.

3639
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:20,360
Let's go to the phone and take some calls.

3640
02:52:20,360 --> 02:52:22,360
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3641
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:23,360
Who's this?

3642
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:24,360
Hey, it's Ronma.

3643
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:25,360
What's up, everyone?

3644
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:26,360
Hey, not much.

3645
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:27,360
How you doing, Ronma?

3646
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:28,360
I'm doing good.

3647
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:30,360
Well, what is on your mind tonight?

3648
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:31,360
So I got a couple of things I want to discuss.

3649
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:32,360
All right.

3650
02:52:32,360 --> 02:52:38,360
Number one, the whole thing about EGM going down, I'm really sad by that because growing up,

3651
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:44,360
that was one of three magazines I pretty much read like it was a religion to me.

3652
02:52:44,360 --> 02:52:46,360
I got a quick question for you, though.

3653
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:48,360
When was the last time you bought EGM?

3654
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:50,360
About a couple of months ago.

3655
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:51,360
I still had a subscription.

3656
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,360
Okay.

3657
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:53,360
That's cool.

3658
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:55,360
I'm just curious because I bet there's some people that are sad.

3659
02:52:55,360 --> 02:53:00,360
You know, I was sad to see EGM go, but I haven't bought it in like 10 years.

3660
02:53:00,360 --> 02:53:01,360
You know what I mean?

3661
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:04,360
But I'm just kind of curious on what side of the fence you're on there.

3662
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:07,360
So you were still a regular reader of it, so okay, you're sad to see it go.

3663
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:08,360
Yeah, pretty much.

3664
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:12,360
It was that, Die Hard, Game Fan, and Game Pro.

3665
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:15,360
Those were the three magazines I read all throughout high school.

3666
02:53:15,360 --> 02:53:16,360
That was it for me.

3667
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:17,360
Isn't Game Pro still around?

3668
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:22,360
Yeah, that's still around, but Die Hard, Game Fan died after like two or three years.

3669
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:28,360
I love that because at the time it was the only magazine available that had an in-depth review about in-port video games.

3670
02:53:28,360 --> 02:53:30,360
Hmm.

3671
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:32,360
Weird, obscure fact about Game Pro.

3672
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:33,360
I've got to say this.

3673
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:34,360
This is what a nerd I am.

3674
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:36,360
I don't know if you remember way back in the day.

3675
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:38,360
If you read Game Pro for a long time, you'll remember this.

3676
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:44,360
A long, long time ago, they had a contest to get like, I think it was 250 people,

3677
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:51,360
or maybe it was 50 or 250 people that were going to be part of an exclusive club that would get to write reviews for games or something like that

3678
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:53,360
for possible inclusion in the magazine or something.

3679
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:54,360
This was a long time ago, so bear with me.

3680
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:55,360
But this is what I remember.

3681
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:58,360
I was in like the fourth grade or fifth grade or something, and I wrote in a letter.

3682
02:53:58,360 --> 02:54:00,360
I got picked as one of them.

3683
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:01,360
Nice.

3684
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:02,360
Wow, in fourth grade?

3685
02:54:02,360 --> 02:54:04,360
But they never did anything with it.

3686
02:54:04,360 --> 02:54:05,360
Boo.

3687
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:11,360
I never got anything else other than the letter it said, you know, congratulations, you got selected, and then they never did anything with it.

3688
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,360
So, this is funny.

3689
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:13,360
Sorry, just a rant.

3690
02:54:13,360 --> 02:54:15,360
Whenever I think of Game Pro, I think of that.

3691
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:16,360
Wow.

3692
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:19,360
From when I was like, maybe it was a little late, like sixth grade, but I was young.

3693
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:20,360
I know I was young.

3694
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:22,360
Dork.

3695
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:23,360
Well.

3696
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,360
Yeah, kind of sad.

3697
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:31,360
But, you know, some of those magazines are still around, but I sadly don't think this will be the last one to fold.

3698
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:42,360
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if any more fold, because honestly, I mean, as many video gaming sites there are, it's getting to the point where it's like video gaming industry with news and stuff is getting very saturated.

3699
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:50,360
It's like every other site, someone has a video game review site or blog or something like that, whereas me, I'm on opposite spectrum for what I cover.

3700
02:54:50,360 --> 02:54:52,360
It's kind of hard to get that kind of information.

3701
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:53,360
Yeah.

3702
02:54:53,360 --> 02:54:56,360
What else did you want to talk about tonight?

3703
02:54:56,360 --> 02:55:03,360
You know, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I totally forgot, but I will do a brief review about The Last Remnant.

3704
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:05,360
It's a game I just picked up yesterday.

3705
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:06,360
Ah, yes, please do.

3706
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:17,360
Basically, it plays like Final Fantasy XII, but when it comes to the battle sequences, it turns into a complete tactical style game, which I'm really enjoying a lot.

3707
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:23,360
Really? What about the story? I've heard kind of mixed reviews on this game, so I'm kind of curious.

3708
02:55:23,360 --> 02:55:34,360
If I remember correctly, the story is about a brother and sister are going to meet up with their parents, but the sister is kidnapped, and he goes through his travels to find his sister,

3709
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:41,360
and you're discovering what these last remnants are, or these relics for all types of different types of power that you can get.

3710
02:55:41,360 --> 02:55:43,360
Hmm.

3711
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:52,360
And right now, I'm like four or five hours in, and just like a regular tactics game, if you're not fully prepared, you will get killed on the first quest.

3712
02:55:52,360 --> 02:56:02,360
Interesting. Huh. So is this something for like a hardcore tactical game fan only, or can anyone get into it, or what?

3713
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:11,360
It's like this. If you're not really into tactics games, but there are some tactical games that are very simple, and you want something simple like that,

3714
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:17,360
this would be a good game to pick up, but to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't pay the $59.99 retail price tag for it.

3715
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:22,360
I got it on sale for $39. I would say, when you see it for $39, then pick it up then.

3716
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:24,360
Gotcha.

3717
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:25,360
Yeah, definitely.

3718
02:56:25,360 --> 02:56:28,360
Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

3719
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:30,360
Now remember one more thing, and I'll get out of here.

3720
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:31,360
Yes.

3721
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:36,360
Remember a long time ago, I sent in a letter, an email about which games I should get for my $360?

3722
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:40,360
Um, yes, I think so.

3723
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:44,360
Yeah, I actually picked up each of the games that you guys recommended for me.

3724
02:56:44,360 --> 02:56:45,360
Oh, really?

3725
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:49,360
I finally got around to doing so.

3726
02:56:49,360 --> 02:56:51,360
Um, what did you think?

3727
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:55,360
Okay, Blue Dragon, I'm still playing. I really enjoy that.

3728
02:56:55,360 --> 02:57:01,360
Loving Saints Row, and I'm loving Crackdown, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance is definitely a fun party game.

3729
02:57:01,360 --> 02:57:04,360
Hmm. Cool, cool.

3730
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:07,360
Oh, you're good. I'm glad our reviews did some good.

3731
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:09,360
Well, you guys are awesome. What can I tell you?

3732
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:12,360
Oh, I do love you. It's almost like we pay you to say that.

3733
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:15,360
Hmm. Just wait till you come out here again.

3734
02:57:15,360 --> 02:57:20,360
Uh huh. Alright, but hey, hopefully soon. It is one of my goals for 09 to get back to New York City.

3735
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:22,360
It just probably won't happen until later in the year.

3736
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:23,360
We'll be waiting.

3737
02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:24,360
Alright, have a good one.

3738
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:26,360
Alright. Later. Bye.

3739
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:28,360
Bye, Ranma.

3740
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:31,360
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3741
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:36,360
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is Jason coming to you with one less tooth in his mouth.

3742
02:57:36,360 --> 02:57:42,360
Well, hey, Jay. I know we've both been having dental drama this week, except yours sounds a little more severe, so I'm really sorry to hear it.

3743
02:57:42,360 --> 02:57:47,360
Yeah, mine went a little bit crazy, but my mouth's been fine ever since Thursday.

3744
02:57:47,360 --> 02:57:50,360
That's what it's all about then, so isn't it the worst?

3745
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:52,360
Alright, I don't want to think about my mouth because then it's just going to hurt more.

3746
02:57:52,360 --> 02:57:57,360
By the way, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen what Deep Man's done for the OLR Beta?

3747
02:57:57,360 --> 02:58:03,360
Yeah, he was giving it to me. He showed me the link just a couple minutes ago, and I was futzing around with it.

3748
02:58:03,360 --> 02:58:06,360
It's a lot more attractive pretty instantly, I've got to say.

3749
02:58:06,360 --> 02:58:15,360
I know, I know. He did a nice job, so I've got to get you kids to work together behind the scenes to help make it happen so we can launch the new website, because I'm all excited now.

3750
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:21,360
Alright, anyhow, we've got to show it to Jamie, though. She's not here tonight to give it her okay, but she'll love it, too. I know she will.

3751
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:24,360
Oh, yeah, there's not going to be...

3752
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:30,360
How can you look at the current site and go, oh, the current site's better? You really can, and the new site's pretty awesome.

3753
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:32,360
I can agree with that.

3754
02:58:32,360 --> 02:58:45,360
Do you know, can I say the one piece of feedback I ended up giving Deep Man on the site was actually, he used a little Pac-Man graphic in the logo, and I was too afraid it looked too similar to the logo for another independent game podcast.

3755
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:53,360
But I'm like, out of all the things I could have said need to be changed about the website, I'm like, that is nothing. The website's awesome. It's awesome.

3756
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:54,360
Space Invaders?

3757
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:55,360
Huh?

3758
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:56,360
Pac-Man?

3759
02:58:56,360 --> 02:58:58,360
No, he changed it, I think, to a Space Invader now.

3760
02:58:58,360 --> 02:59:01,360
Okay, yeah, like I said, just a couple minutes.

3761
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:11,360
The Pac-Man is right next to this little radio looking thing, and it looks way too similar to another show's logo, so I was like, eh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to ruffle any feathers.

3762
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:15,360
I suggested a Space Invader, and I guess he ran with it. I haven't seen the new logo yet. Anyway...

3763
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:18,360
I just completely lost you. Don't tell me I just completely lost you.

3764
02:59:18,360 --> 02:59:25,360
Well, we'll open up... No, I'm here. Hello? Can you hear us? Are we having internet issues going on?

3765
02:59:25,360 --> 02:59:27,360
Yes, I blame you and nobody else.

3766
02:59:27,360 --> 02:59:36,360
I did not dump him. Anyway, Jason, if you can hear me, why don't you tell us what you really called in for tonight before I hijacked website talk.

3767
02:59:36,360 --> 02:59:41,360
You can hear me now, right? Yeah, there's my echo. Okay, two questions.

3768
02:59:41,360 --> 02:59:42,360
Yes.

3769
02:59:42,360 --> 02:59:52,360
How long did... This is a question from Ryan, but she's too shy to get on the microphone because she's like that. How long did EGM2 last?

3770
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:58,360
EGM2, that's right. They had a spinoff magazine for a little while, didn't they? Like they were trying...

3771
02:59:58,360 --> 03:00:00,360
That's retarded.

3772
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:05,360
No, I remember. Famitsu was a weekly magazine, so they felt, I think for a short time there, that there was going to be like...

3773
03:00:05,360 --> 03:00:10,360
Didn't EGM2 come out like in the middle of the month or something to like offset it?

3774
03:00:10,360 --> 03:00:14,360
I never... She had it. FYI, you went off the air again.

3775
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:22,360
It was not very long. Maybe a year. Maybe a year. So, just ignore the complaints about the stream and chat, Jason.

3776
03:00:22,360 --> 03:00:24,360
We're going to just keep going with the show even if they can't hear us.

3777
03:00:24,360 --> 03:00:28,360
Well, I have it in the background and I noticed a very specific loop, so...

3778
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:29,360
Oh, sorry about that.

3779
03:00:29,360 --> 03:00:30,360
So about a year.

3780
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:39,360
I think. I don't know. I'm definitely not the source. Let's see. Oh, no. Here we go. EGM2 ran from July 1994 to July 1998.

3781
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:41,360
So it was actually four years. Wow.

3782
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:42,360
Four years. Nice.

3783
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:44,360
I was way off.

3784
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:50,360
She had a subscription to both and I've never heard of it, but she wanted to know, so I am making you people do... or me.

3785
03:00:50,360 --> 03:00:55,360
There you have it. I got that from Wikipedia and I believe everything I read on Wikipedia, so there you go.

3786
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:59,360
That's just because I'm older than Jason.

3787
03:00:59,360 --> 03:01:06,360
Thank you. I'm glad she hopped on the mic to clarify. What was the second question?

3788
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:12,360
I have never heard of this before and I just kind of bumped across it, so I figured I'd ask it tonight.

3789
03:01:12,360 --> 03:01:20,360
Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams. It's apparently something on the PS2. What?

3790
03:01:20,360 --> 03:01:26,360
They released a little later on. I don't know if it was on the PS2, but there was two versions of Silent Hill 2.

3791
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:33,360
The second version, Restless Dreams, has an additional scenario where... don't you play as Maria or something?

3792
03:01:33,360 --> 03:01:37,360
It's really short. It's not a lot. It's not like you're getting a whole second game.

3793
03:01:37,360 --> 03:01:42,360
It's just like another little quick scenario that just gives some additional insight to the story.

3794
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:46,360
So it was like a little bonus disc add-on that they released slightly later.

3795
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:50,360
You got it. Like a bonus chapter. I wouldn't even think of it as a full game. It's very short.

3796
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:55,360
It's not even really a game. I don't even think you really do much. You do one thing and that's...

3797
03:01:55,360 --> 03:02:02,360
Restless Dreams, I believe, was originally for the Xbox expansion and then I think they re-released it on the PS2 with the Restless Dreams thing.

3798
03:02:02,360 --> 03:02:13,360
Interesting. I went through and I replayed all the Metal Gear Solids and then that led up to the time that we got the PS3 and I played Metal Gear Solid 4 all the way through.

3799
03:02:13,360 --> 03:02:25,360
And our next run-through series of Silent Hill and I'm, barring the dental madness, I've been playing through Silent Hill 1 and I think I might be finishing that off tonight.

3800
03:02:25,360 --> 03:02:31,360
And since obviously Silent Hill 2 was the next one in line and I came across that, I had never heard of it before.

3801
03:02:31,360 --> 03:02:35,360
You'll like Silent Hill 2 a lot.

3802
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:45,360
She was wondering if we were just going to skip the first one and as much as I want to because the game plays like hell and it really looks really bad.

3803
03:02:45,360 --> 03:02:52,360
I don't know if it's the PS2 doing something back compat but it has some really weird effects on our TV.

3804
03:02:52,360 --> 03:03:01,360
We were both thinking of just skipping the first one but she doesn't remember much of it and I fell asleep through some of it.

3805
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:05,360
I wasn't the one who played it in the first place so I kind of wanted to go through it the whole way and see it.

3806
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:08,360
I'm admittedly using a walkthrough all the way through it.

3807
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:13,360
So that hint system is actually viable to some situations, Loki.

3808
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:26,360
Yeah, I'm cheating all the way through it but I'm getting the entire story in the manner it was supposed to be presented to me and I'm playing the game to some extent so that's kind of enough for me.

3809
03:03:26,360 --> 03:03:28,360
Nice.

3810
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:39,360
And you want to play through 1 because it's not necessary but it's good to play through 1 when you play through 3 because it'll kind of give some insight into 3's story also.

3811
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:42,360
I watched Silent Hill the movie, what do I need to play the game for?

3812
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:44,360
Because it's completely different.

3813
03:03:44,360 --> 03:03:49,360
Because if you're like 3 you'll think it's crap unless you give some insight to the series.

3814
03:03:49,360 --> 03:03:54,360
Alright, I have to admit, if I'd never played the games I would have thought the movie was kind of random.

3815
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:55,360
You know what I mean?

3816
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:56,360
No, I understand that.

3817
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:57,360
What the hell is this pyramid thing?

3818
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:59,360
Really, the movie was made for the fans.

3819
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,360
Yeah, oh yeah.

3820
03:04:00,360 --> 03:04:02,360
I really wish they were due to see more.

3821
03:04:02,360 --> 03:04:04,360
It wasn't very well made on that same line.

3822
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:07,360
What are the better video game movies, amazingly enough?

3823
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:10,360
For real, my favorite video game movie, I ain't even going to lie.

3824
03:04:10,360 --> 03:04:12,360
I kind of want to watch it right now.

3825
03:04:12,360 --> 03:04:14,360
I do too, I've been wanting to watch it for like 3's.

3826
03:04:14,360 --> 03:04:16,360
We should go get it on Blu-Ray and then watch it.

3827
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:19,360
Is it on Netflix? Because then we could party watch it or something like that.

3828
03:04:19,360 --> 03:04:21,360
Do they have that built in yet?

3829
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:24,360
I don't think they have that feature built in yet.

3830
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:30,360
We'd call each other and try to press play at the same time and do it that way or something, I don't know.

3831
03:04:30,360 --> 03:04:32,360
That'd be fun, do it on Justin.tv or something.

3832
03:04:32,360 --> 03:04:34,360
Well that worked too.

3833
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:44,360
Jason, we've got to let you go, take some more calls, but thank you for all you do for the website too. Between you and Deep Man, 2009 is going to be the best year ever for our website. I'm so excited.

3834
03:04:44,360 --> 03:04:46,360
Sure as hell hope so, it's been long enough.

3835
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:52,360
I am so excited because I'm all jazzed to write again for the website and I know TR has been wanting to do reviews.

3836
03:04:52,360 --> 03:04:55,360
We're actually going to have a functional website and I'm so excited I could tinkle.

3837
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:56,360
You're jazzed.

3838
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:58,360
Alright, so we're going to let you go Jason.

3839
03:04:58,360 --> 03:05:07,360
Give me a month to move as we're closing on Tuesday and then I'll do my best to be really, really on top of it.

3840
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:08,360
You got it buddy.

3841
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:09,360
Alright, take care.

3842
03:05:09,360 --> 03:05:10,360
Sweet.

3843
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:11,360
Bye.

3844
03:05:11,360 --> 03:05:12,360
Bye.

3845
03:05:12,360 --> 03:05:17,360
Alright, dang, we've got calls coming in back to back. I think this is going to be the last one though because we're running kind of long tonight.

3846
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:19,360
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

3847
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:21,360
It's GS68.

3848
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:22,360
Hi GS68.

3849
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:27,360
I was going to say, yeah, we're at three hours between the two parts so far, so we're going to wrap up after this call.

3850
03:05:27,360 --> 03:05:31,360
So, sorry to all the callers that didn't get through, but we ran kind of long tonight.

3851
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:37,360
I blame Victoria, I don't know why, but it's just she's here and she's just, you know, she's magical.

3852
03:05:37,360 --> 03:05:38,360
She's here and single and beautiful.

3853
03:05:38,360 --> 03:05:39,360
Alright.

3854
03:05:39,360 --> 03:05:40,360
Yeah, you two are welcome.

3855
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:43,360
What's on your mind GS68?

3856
03:05:43,360 --> 03:05:48,360
So, about the whole instance and how the game pretty much played for you.

3857
03:05:48,360 --> 03:05:49,360
Yes.

3858
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:52,360
There's always something like that in arcade games. It's called unlimited continues.

3859
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:57,360
Yeah, but you have to feed it a quarter every time you want to continue.

3860
03:05:57,360 --> 03:06:04,360
Well, but at home, if you have free play, you just keep pressing start and you eventually get to the end of the game.

3861
03:06:04,360 --> 03:06:06,360
I mean, no need to use any skill.

3862
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:11,360
Like playing the Ninja Turtles game on the Xbox, you can just get all the continues you want?

3863
03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:15,360
Yeah, or unlocking free play in Ikaruga.

3864
03:06:15,360 --> 03:06:18,360
In fact, you can even just let the bosses time out.

3865
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:26,360
That's true, but you know, I also think of the old, you know what you're talking about, kind of reminds me of, could anyone, and I got to ask Loki this, I've got to ask Loki this.

3866
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:32,360
Could you actually beat Contra on the NES without up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start?

3867
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:34,360
No, it's fucking hard.

3868
03:06:34,360 --> 03:06:38,360
But that's the point though, you have to be good at it to, it can be done.

3869
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:42,360
It's just that, you know, you just need, I need to play it more.

3870
03:06:42,360 --> 03:06:46,360
I need to play more to, you know, be able to learn the patterns and that kind of stuff.

3871
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:55,360
And that's the whole point, it shouldn't be just like, oh look at this, it was super, cause even when we did that, we still didn't beat it, you know, it was fucking hard.

3872
03:06:55,360 --> 03:07:03,360
I don't know, the continues system was kind of an antiquated method of, to have gamers, you know, feed quarters into the machine, that's the whole point.

3873
03:07:03,360 --> 03:07:10,360
You have to start all over again, unless you put it in a quarter, you know, and then just carry it over onto consoles, you know, that's what people were used to.

3874
03:07:10,360 --> 03:07:26,360
If you're supposed to, like, if you want to learn the game, but, I mean, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, it's, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, you think continues is kind of like a good point.

3875
03:07:26,360 --> 03:07:30,360
Uh oh.

3876
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:37,360
I don't know if the internet's acting up again, but you're kind of cutting in a little bit, in and out, so go ahead and say what you want to say.

3877
03:07:37,360 --> 03:07:39,360
And then what else?

3878
03:07:39,360 --> 03:07:43,360
Yeah, I was going to bring up DJ Max Black Square, which I got this week.

3879
03:07:43,360 --> 03:07:54,360
Um, it's alright, I guess, I mean, the songs are pretty good, and they're pretty hard, but I hate the club tour mode, cause some of the missions are, like, really stupid hard.

3880
03:07:54,360 --> 03:08:03,360
And then one feature, and there's Twitter features that really piss me off, one, sometimes, the...

3881
03:08:03,360 --> 03:08:06,360
Andy just dropped, oh no, you there?

3882
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:13,360
I'm gonna ask real quick, we're having these weird problems tonight, is this the American version that you're talking about, or is this the new one that came out in Korea?

3883
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:15,360
It's Korea.

3884
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:18,360
Oh, my bad, okay, I didn't know.

3885
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:26,360
Yeah, uh, basically sometimes the music will cut out and re-continue, but it will lag really badly.

3886
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:29,360
Or it'll lag, like, a few seconds.

3887
03:08:29,360 --> 03:08:37,360
Um, are there any, like, crazy-ass videos like there were in the earlier games?

3888
03:08:37,360 --> 03:08:48,360
Sure, the pissing me off is this autocorrect feature, basically, if you press the wrong node to play a node, you still get a vast 100% for it.

3889
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:53,360
I mean, you get 80% of the score, but you still get 100% of the judgement.

3890
03:08:53,360 --> 03:09:00,360
Is it just me, or is the arcade DJ Max and the PSP one kind of, like, really different because of the whole touch element?

3891
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:01,360
They're really different.

3892
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:02,360
Um, well, obviously they're different.

3893
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:05,360
I wonder why they don't do DJ Max on the DS.

3894
03:09:05,360 --> 03:09:07,360
They are, and this is the arcade one.

3895
03:09:07,360 --> 03:09:09,360
Aha! Aha!

3896
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:14,360
Arcade one, like, sometimes...

3897
03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:18,360
Okay, we're having too many phone problems, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the call.

3898
03:09:18,360 --> 03:09:22,360
Sorry, GS68, I don't know if it's your internet connection or our internet connection, but something's up.

3899
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:28,360
Um, so, yeah, um, DJ Max, you know, it's one of the series I've been...

3900
03:09:28,360 --> 03:09:33,360
One of my friends is really into it and keeps begging me to check it out, so I probably will at some point.

3901
03:09:33,360 --> 03:09:35,360
At least when it comes out in America.

3902
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:38,360
But I do want to try this arcade version that's at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

3903
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:40,360
Hopefully it's not gone.

3904
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:45,360
I guess GS68 was saying in chat earlier that it looks like it's probably gonna be gone by the time I get there.

3905
03:09:45,360 --> 03:09:51,360
So that would suck, because I guess it's in this weird beta test or whatever, so we'll see.

3906
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:54,360
Anyhow, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us before we wrap up the show?

3907
03:09:54,360 --> 03:09:57,360
Yes, that's what I've been doing.

3908
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:59,360
Um, some interesting ones.

3909
03:09:59,360 --> 03:10:03,360
Apple has actually rejected a game from Utesato.

3910
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:06,360
You remember him from the Seaman series.

3911
03:10:06,360 --> 03:10:14,360
Well, he had a game coming out, I think it was like Seaman 2, on the iPhone.

3912
03:10:14,360 --> 03:10:16,360
It was Gabo.

3913
03:10:16,360 --> 03:10:20,360
It was a spiritual successor to Seaman, but with a caveman instead.

3914
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:28,360
And unfortunately they said, due to unpleasant gameplay, they axed the game and they're not allowed to put it on the App Store.

3915
03:10:28,360 --> 03:10:34,360
I heard about that. That's so weird, because there's a lot of crap on the App Store, so I'm kind of surprised, actually.

3916
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:37,360
And which is why apples suck.

3917
03:10:37,360 --> 03:10:39,360
You just had to work that in there, didn't you?

3918
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:40,360
Yes, I did.

3919
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:44,360
This isn't really a gaming story, but it has a game addict with it.

3920
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:57,360
Apparently there's a game addict in Beijing who was 23 years old and was rushed to a hospital after swallowing five pieces of saw blades in order to attempt to commit suicide.

3921
03:10:57,360 --> 03:11:06,360
And apparently he had been talking incoherently about how to win his favorite computer games after being sent to a Beijing hospital ICU.

3922
03:11:06,360 --> 03:11:15,360
Yeah, that was another one of those cases where he was a gamer, and that's about the extent that it was related to video games. This guy had issues way beyond video games.

3923
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:19,360
Well, I just want to talk about swallowing saw blades, and that was kind of neat. That's pretty extreme.

3924
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:21,360
That is pretty extreme. I'll give you that.

3925
03:11:21,360 --> 03:11:28,360
House of the Dead Overkill is actually getting an official gun attachment for the Wii.

3926
03:11:28,360 --> 03:11:30,360
Only in Europe, though.

3927
03:11:30,360 --> 03:11:42,360
Apparently Amazon UK is taking pre-orders on it right now. It's supposed to ship on February 13th, and it will be priced for 12.99 euros.

3928
03:11:42,360 --> 03:11:44,360
Or pounds or something like that. I think it's euros.

3929
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:57,360
And they're also going to have a big bang box set that's going to have both that and two of those guns, which they're calling the hand cannons, and they look like pretty sweet guns.

3930
03:11:57,360 --> 03:11:59,360
So that's kind of cool.

3931
03:11:59,360 --> 03:12:12,360
And this is pretty big news. Final Fantasy 13 is coming to Japan in 2009. Of course, we'll be making it out overseas and everywhere else April 2010.

3932
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:25,360
So April 2010 is the earliest that we'll see Final Fantasy 13. However, I hope that we'll see it a lot sooner, because I will be importing the Blu-ray special edition for Advent Children.

3933
03:12:25,360 --> 03:12:33,360
I want that so bad, but if we have to wait until 2010, then we have to wait until 2010. I guess it's not surprising. It's just a little disappointing.

3934
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:39,360
Especially because we do these things on the OLR forums, the annual predictions.

3935
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:43,360
Rob with Two Bees does this thread every year, and he does a really good job tabulating and everything.

3936
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:46,360
And everybody makes their predictions for the year, and we see how many of them come true.

3937
03:12:46,360 --> 03:12:50,360
I've already lost, like, on two of my predictions. I said there'd be a new Rock Band game this year.

3938
03:12:50,360 --> 03:12:57,360
There's not going to be, they've already said, because of the Beatles game, which makes sense. I should have been smarter and known that, that they don't need a new Rock Band game with the Beatles game.

3939
03:12:57,360 --> 03:13:05,360
And also, now this. I said that Final Fantasy 13 would finally come out this Christmas, and now it looks like it's going to be next year.

3940
03:13:05,360 --> 03:13:08,360
I might get half credit for the Japanese release date, though.

3941
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:15,360
Yeah, and like I said, I'll try to import the Blu-ray for Advent Children, because it's going to have a demo on it.

3942
03:13:15,360 --> 03:13:19,360
Yeah, I totally want to check that out, too. I might even import it for that. We'll see.

3943
03:13:19,360 --> 03:13:23,360
Because the demo's supposed to be like two hours long, they said. Which is pretty crazy.

3944
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:37,360
CS09! Microsoft has been, apparently was talking to somebody, that they were saying that they were looking to increase the 100 friend limit on Xbox Live.

3945
03:13:37,360 --> 03:13:38,360
Yes, thank God.

3946
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:53,360
Apparently because it was in place for the original Xbox, it was coded into games, but now since they've moved past the Xbox, they can go ahead and raise it. So maybe in a future update, they will do that. Which would be awesome.

3947
03:13:53,360 --> 03:14:10,360
And let's see here. Also, there's going to be a special edition Final Fantasy VII Advent Children PS3 coming out in Japan. It's in cloud black, and it's got a nice little symbol there etched into the front of it.

3948
03:14:10,360 --> 03:14:28,360
It's one of the 160GB PS3s. It's got a Final Fantasy XIII trail version set, which is with the Final Fantasy XIII demo, I guess. And then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete Blu-ray disc set.

3949
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:51,360
Which would be available for 49,980 yen, approximately $551 US. Very cool. And apparently, those people interested in purchasing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete, it does have an English language option.

3950
03:14:51,360 --> 03:15:05,360
So fuck yeah, I'm importing that shit. Awesome. And this is some funny stuff. Duke Nukem Critical Hour is coming along quite well, says 3D Realms. And you may not remember what these are, actually.

3951
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:29,360
Critical Hour was the game that they're putting out on the PSP. It's a new game trilogy, I guess. And they're also having some on the DS as well. But all I have to say is finish Duke Nukem forever first! Stop going on to new things! Finish one, then you get to work on new games.

3952
03:15:29,360 --> 03:15:50,360
Hey, speaking of Final Fantasy XIII, not to backtrack, but I am. Did you see the new character that was announced this week? Yeah, he's pretty cool looking. Yeah, I know. A lot of people were giving it crap. He's Lando. He looks fine. He looks pretty cool. I love the cute little chocobo he has with him. That's going to be awesome. Anyway, sorry, I just wanted to back, because we didn't mention that during the show either, so I just wanted to throw that out there.

3953
03:15:50,360 --> 03:16:13,360
And then the last thing, EA is prepping a new game called Spore Hero, and of course it will be related to Spore. It's coming out on Wii and DS. Alright, awesome. We're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show, then, and get everybody's final thought and get on out of here. Unfortunately, our stream is crashing left and right, and we're starting to lose listeners because of it, so I think that's a sign that we're probably running too long.

3954
03:16:13,360 --> 03:16:33,360
So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight, but first we're going to go get around everybody's final thought, but I do want to say thank you very much for listening to Orange Lawn Radio this week. If you've enjoyed what you've heard, please tell two friends about our show. You know, it's how we spread the word about our show and get it out there, the little program that we do. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought. Victoria left the studio to go charge her phone.

3955
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:49,360
I'm Victoria, and I'm young and I'm single, and I'm sexy. I want to thank her for being on the show tonight and giving her opinion and everything, especially in the first part of the show, although she started to tune out during the second half of the show. Shut up.

3956
03:16:49,360 --> 03:17:05,360
So thank you, Victoria. Rice Princess, thank you for being here tonight. Thanks. And you said quite a bit tonight, especially in regards to Nintendo, so thank you for your input as always. And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? I want to know when the website's going live.

3957
03:17:05,360 --> 03:17:19,360
The website, I don't know. Don't get too excited. It might not be until next month. I got to make sure Deep Man and Jason get it worked out, but we will try to get it up fast. I will do whatever I can to get it working.

3958
03:17:19,360 --> 03:17:35,360
All right. Loki, your final thought tonight? It's cold in here. I know, I haven't been running the heater. It's getting cold in here. Sorry. And my final thought is I need some Auragel. Boo hoo, cry.

3959
03:17:35,360 --> 03:17:55,360
All right. That's it. Thank you guys once again for staying with us all night long, especially you live listeners that have suffered through several outages tonight. Thank you guys as always for your support of Orange Lounge Radio. You know we would just not do this if it weren't for you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Have an amazing week. We'll see you again next week with Jamie back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
