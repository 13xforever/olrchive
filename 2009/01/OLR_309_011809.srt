1
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, January 18, 2009, could we see the DSi released in April for the US?

2
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Circuit City goes under, and are the .hack games set to make a comeback?

3
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:36,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:42,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:44,008
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back after a little bit of a break.

6
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Took a little break last week because I was in Hawaii taking a little vacation, but I'm back now.

7
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: and refreshed and feeling better.

8
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,890
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be joining you for the next several hours.

10
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:01,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:02,377
[SPEAKER_07]: She has the night off.

12
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It's her last week before going back to school, so she's taking care of some things around the house.

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,322
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have somebody filling in tonight.

14
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:12,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I called the other woman that I know, the other female gamer I know.

15
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So say hello to Rice Princess.

16
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:15,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your mistress.

17
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:15,949
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

18
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:16,750
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Rice Princess?

19
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm okay.

20
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: How about yourself?

21
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:19,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing great.

22
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to hear.

23
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you're wearing a Silent Hill t-shirt showing your love for Pyramid Head.

24
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:29,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I thought the camera was going to be working tonight and I did my hair and everything.

25
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the funny thing.

26
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you look very cute, by the way.

27
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:32,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I can take a picture and post it to the website or something.

29
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:34,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All in vain.

30
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

31
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I get to see you and that's important.

32
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:39,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you're not gay at all.

33
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:40,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

34
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:41,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

35
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:49,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say you and Jamie both have Silent Hill shirts that you wear to the show, so we need to get you both here sometime and you can be twinsies.

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they the same shirt?

37
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:51,601
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

38
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:52,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

39
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she has a slightly different one.

40
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's thermal, so it keeps me warm.

41
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:55,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

42
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good because we have a cold garage.

43
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:58,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of, yeah.

44
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,216
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

45
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to survive tonight.

46
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:01,058
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

47
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to get the heater on in just a minute.

48
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,500
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you also for bringing Snickerdoodles to the show.

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,821
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

50
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know bribing us with food always freaking rocks.

51
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:08,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

52
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:08,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.

53
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:09,104
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

54
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's joining us tonight.

55
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:13,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

56
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,409
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Loki?

57
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:15,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing fine.

58
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:15,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

59
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,771
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week off?

60
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,391
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you end up doing?

61
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to get Grand Theft Auto PC to work.

62
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:21,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

63
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taken a turn for the worst.

64
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:23,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

65
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:25,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

66
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It was doing so well.

67
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:28,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It was working just fine.

68
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:32,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden, Rockstar's like, ah, fuck this shit.

69
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,715
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to work no matter what you do now.

70
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:39,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I've reinstalled it like eight times now.

71
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:43,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've uninstalled all the other things that remotely might be related to it.

72
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:46,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just does not want to work.

73
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently I'm not alone.

74
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:48,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.

75
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:50,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

76
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know.

77
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I give up.

78
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:17,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually bought this game, and see, that teaches me for not pirating this shit.

79
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:18,696
[SPEAKER_06]: See what happens?

80
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:21,819
[SPEAKER_06]: If I buy it, it breaks, and it sucks.

81
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,144
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had just downloaded it like I should have, wouldn't be having this problem.

82
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:28,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

83
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:50,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well alright, well hey, you had tuned in, because also last week we missed, you know, our buddy Bobby, Bobby Blackwolf does a show before us here on All Games Radio, and he does the Bobby Blackwolf show on Sundays, but he just launched a new Friday night show, right, Friday Night Gaming, and you tried to play Grand Theft Auto with us.

84
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was even more fun.

85
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:52,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

86
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:59,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for some reason then Xbox Live said, no, you're never going to connect to this game ever if you even want to.

87
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried four different times.

88
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:08,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I even reset my system a few different times and it just said, no, I'm sorry, you just cannot connect to this game ever.

89
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck Grand Theft Auto.

90
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:17,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, still been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto 4.

91
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:21,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 4, I have to bring this up.

92
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,670
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty awesome.

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta rub this in.

94
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:33,398
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was in Hawaii, I got Grand Theft Auto 4 for $30 on the Xbox 360, and I got Metal Gear Solid 4 for $20 for the PlayStation 3.

95
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Both new and wrapped.

96
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting them for $5 in Hawaii.

97
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

98
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Really cheap.

99
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:41,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Radio Shack, apparently.

100
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:53,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I had forgotten that they had gotten in the market of selling games, but then when I saw that they were clearing them out, because I guess I hadn't been performing very well, I suddenly remembered, oh yeah, I think we reported that on the show once, is that Radio Shack was selling games.

101
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And not anymore.

102
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:58,149
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, actually, I was going to say that...

103
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Buy was clearing out some games as well.

104
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,854
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Ninja Gaiden 2 for $10 for the 360.

105
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:08,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

106
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't buy it because I don't have a 360.

107
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,197
[SPEAKER_07]: You should get one one of these days.

108
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:12,858
[SPEAKER_07]: You really should.

109
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you still on your anti-Microsoft thing?

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you finally caved and you were going to get one.

111
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not anti-Microsoft.

112
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just anti-Xbox because it's a piece of crap system.

113
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:24,906
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys missed it.

114
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:28,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Bryce, Princess, and Loki were getting into it before the show about Nintendo.

115
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll talk about it later.

116
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:38,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, why don't you just tell them what you said and I won't even need to do anything because, you know, it was so asinine that, you know.

117
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:39,976
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to it later.

118
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:44,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to introduce someone else because she's been sitting there very quiet and patiently, which is so unlike her.

119
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

120
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that going to be your first words on the show?

121
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is going to be my first words on the show.

122
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

123
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:50,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

124
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,063
[SPEAKER_07]: She has never been on the show before.

125
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:54,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss Victoria

126
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:17,127
[SPEAKER_07]: See now, I'm looking, the chat room is going crazy right now for two reasons.

127
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:24,271
[SPEAKER_07]: The earlier, and of course you can always join us in chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com The chat's not working on the laptop, so we can't see it.

128
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,451
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get it working somehow later on.

129
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:28,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But Loki and I can see it.

130
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:28,692
[SPEAKER_07]: They're there.

131
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:29,613
[SPEAKER_07]: They're freaking out.

132
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,554
[SPEAKER_07]: They want pics of Rice Princess.

133
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:34,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll try to get something on the Twitter because, you know, OMG woman.

134
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:41,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll try to get Rice Princess and Victoria to pose and maybe I'll get them to make out a little bit.

135
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have that one jello shot in the refrigerator from New Year's.

136
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,282
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

137
00:06:48,347 --> 00:07:00,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, they're freaking out because right now in chat, a brand new Orange Lounge Radio website is being previewed.

138
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:06,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been made by our buddy Deekman, and he's posted the preview link there in chat, and it's amazing.

139
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:12,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so excited that finally our website that looks old is going to be going away and looking new.

140
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so freaking excited.

141
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know why that's why I love our listeners?

142
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like, which one is giving them the bigger boner?

143
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:24,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Like women on the show or the new website layout?

144
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:26,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

145
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:27,504
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

146
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:27,744
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

147
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:28,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to Victoria.

148
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,646
[SPEAKER_07]: She's never been on the show before.

149
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to interview Victoria a little bit.

150
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:31,789
More about me.

151
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about you, isn't it?

152
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:33,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh!

153
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So what kinds of video games do you like?

154
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,253
[SPEAKER_07]: What kinds of video games do you play?

155
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:39,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you play a lot of games?

156
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:39,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay if you don't.

157
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, unfortunately.

158
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I play Rock Band when I come over to your house.

159
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only video... Well, we have a PlayStation 2 at my house.

160
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:47,959
[SPEAKER_09]: My roommate plays Kingdom Hearts.

161
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,241
[SPEAKER_09]: But the only thing I play is on my GameCube.

162
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And I play Mario Party 7 because that's the only game I have.

163
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:54,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I stole it from my brother.

164
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so she knows a little bit about her games.

165
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:58,026
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows what she's talking about.

166
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's got some stuff that she plays.

167
00:07:59,367 --> 00:07:59,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

168
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:00,347
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

169
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that you write, bitch?

170
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:24,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm a Harry Potter role player.

171
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:25,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big Harry Potter nerd.

172
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:27,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit it.

173
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm proud of it.

174
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm proud of it.

175
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,441
Okay.

176
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:35,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you need to shut the fuck up because you used to be the vice president of the Star Trek Club.

177
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:36,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And what?

178
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:38,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

179
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 15 years ago.

180
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:40,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

181
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,865
[SPEAKER_09]: He has such a boner when the movie is going to come out.

182
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:44,645
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to drag my ass to the midnight premiere.

183
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:45,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already tell you.

184
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,367
[SPEAKER_06]: So what exactly do you mean by... Or like...

185
00:08:50,291 --> 00:09:12,548
[SPEAKER_09]: role-playing basically I take on one of the roles of one of the characters in Harry Potter and somebody else takes another role or make they make up their own and we just plot and we don't I'm not like no no no no no no no no no no no yeah basically that's that's that's it and we just plot and make our own little storyline it's glorified fan fiction basically

186
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:22,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, alright So you do other nerdy stuff too though, like I know you watch Lost religiously All the time, oh my god, Wednesday, I'm so excited!

187
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:38,664
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I love about Victoria is she's so animated, this is great I gotta read some comments from chat about the whole roleplay thing Chat.orangelawnsradio.com, we have GS68 says she puts on a robe and wizard hat Fuck you!

188
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not.

189
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not.

190
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:43,887
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

191
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:47,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's only for the premieres.

192
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to dress up for the next premiere?

193
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:49,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I might.

194
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,838
[SPEAKER_09]: If it comes down to it, I'll just buy a t-shirt and wear my Harry Potter jacket.

195
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:53,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

196
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:53,820
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

197
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

198
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,402
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with that.

199
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:56,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

200
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:59,587
[SPEAKER_07]: What else was I going to say about you being a nerd?

201
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you went to Comic Con last year.

202
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:01,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to Comic Con every year.

203
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from San Diego.

204
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So I go to Comic Con every year.

205
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:06,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

206
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:09,119
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be huge this year.

207
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already tell you it's the 40th anniversary.

208
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't bought my tickets yet, but I should do that soon.

209
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,655
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it you like to see when you're at Comic-Con?

210
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I go for the movie premieres and stuff like that.

211
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:24,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, I saw the panel for The Day the Earth Stood Still.

212
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:37,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I unfortunately went to the Twilight panel and wanted to kill myself because all the little screaming 12-year-olds were creaming their panties over Robert What's-His-Face.

213
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I go for the movie premieres.

214
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I've met so many celebrities because of Comic-Con and

215
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:47,214
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, met Matthew Fox, who I kind of creamed my panties over.

216
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:53,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all right then.

217
00:10:55,957 --> 00:11:01,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Suddenly the chatters are lining up to roleplay Matthew Fox in your next Harry Potter thing.

218
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,299
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

219
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we've got to take this back to video games at some point.

220
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:12,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But my buddy Shane, an old friend of the show, Miklatov, is listening, and he's sending me private messages.

221
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:14,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell Irene and Victoria hi, and they need to make out.

222
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them now.

223
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Shane!

224
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:18,387
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

225
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,063
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to get the liquor out.

226
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:20,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that'll happen later.

227
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:22,044
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

228
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:26,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's actually get back to some gaming here real quick.

229
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:26,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait.

230
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to ask you one other question, though, speaking of video games.

231
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:29,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't take it back to gaming.

232
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:37,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I love World of Warcraft, as you know, and Rice Princess also dabbles in World of Warcraft once in a while.

233
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:37,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Really funny story.

234
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:43,096
[SPEAKER_07]: She played her boyfriend's account last night and out-DPSed another character because she didn't even know what she was doing.

235
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,318
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, you are what we call a WoW Widow.

236
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:48,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a little bit of a grudge against WoW.

237
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,106
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

238
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: All day long.

239
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I would stop doing Orange Lawns Radio.

240
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,374
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have a friend in San Diego.

241
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:44,979
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my gays in San Diego plays WoW just so he can dress his characters up in pretty outfits.

242
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,121
[SPEAKER_09]: He told me this.

243
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:50,827
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, it's a guild of nothing but women, and we dress our characters up in pretty outfits.

244
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:51,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

245
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,878
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many great things to say, but first off, Victoria has her gaze.

246
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:00,400
[SPEAKER_07]: She has.

247
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

248
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:07,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And there really is just a guild of women that dress up.

249
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:16,733
[SPEAKER_09]: A guild of women and Patrick that just dress up and they run around and like, I don't know what he says, they run around and just, I don't know, do things.

250
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:18,099
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

251
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

252
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what it was your ex-boyfriend was doing in WoW that took so long?

253
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Was he dressing up in princess outfits?

254
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:25,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Serving the castle.

255
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,662
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it you do when you play for four hours?

256
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:28,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Raiding.

257
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:28,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that.

258
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:30,483
[SPEAKER_09]: That.

259
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:31,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

260
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, that's what he would do.

261
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:34,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when...

262
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I broke up with him, to say the least.

263
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:39,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you tell him that that was the reason you were breaking up with him?

264
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:40,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it wasn't the main reason.

265
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,391
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a douche, but, you know.

266
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:48,296
[SPEAKER_09]: But that had a pretty big influence on why I am no longer with this person.

267
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:49,277
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

268
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:50,398
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fair enough.

269
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:54,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm sure we'll get into it later if we're talking about Warcraft stories and you hear a big, Ah!

270
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hell no!

271
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,103
[SPEAKER_07]: From the corner.

272
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:57,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop talking about that shit!

273
00:13:59,346 --> 00:13:59,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 4

274
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:21,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

275
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:48,672
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other sandbox games that have come out on the PC, like Saints Row 2 just came out, but that sucks on the PC.

276
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible port.

277
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just sad.

278
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:58,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockstar, unfortunately, is not doing anything to fix Grand Theft Auto 4.

279
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,824
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I've never seen a game where I can reinstall it and it still doesn't work correctly.

280
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:04,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for Crysis.

281
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:08,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Crysis also didn't work correctly when I reinstalled it, but that was a whole different way.

282
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:19,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't finish that game because, you know, I would get to the general or whatever and he'd be standing there like a mannequin and couldn't progress any further because the event didn't trigger.

283
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that sucked.

284
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that... Um...

285
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I watched Nellie play more Animal Crossing.

286
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot I had that game.

287
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:32,671
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

288
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have Animal Crossing?

289
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not anymore.

290
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I ruined it for her, apparently, because I cheated.

291
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you time-traveling?

292
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:42,958
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we did that before.

293
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:46,722
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is actually pure cheating now.

294
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: They have devices that you can, you know, hack the memory and stuff and give yourself all this crazy shit.

295
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Including download content.

296
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's pay for unlock content.

297
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:01,816
Um...

298
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the game's really boring because it's just Animal Crossing.

299
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: But they had some fun codes.

300
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:10,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

301
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:17,350
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a code where you can go into the characters' houses and you can steal their furniture and move it around and stuff.

302
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:19,051
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty awesome.

303
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also do it to the stores, too.

304
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,093
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just go and pick up stuff.

305
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:32,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, that was funny because we had maxed out money and there were some characters that were pissing us off so we just trapped them in a corner and surrounded the furniture around them.

306
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:35,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was mildly satisfying for a second there.

307
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really what I've been doing with my consoles lately is I've been streaming movies.

308
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:42,747
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much what I did.

309
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually downloaded a bunch of the Rift Track shorts last night.

310
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,192
[SPEAKER_06]: We were watching some of those.

311
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:48,794
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome.

312
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the PS3 actually works really good.

313
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,820
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

314
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,394
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's really nice actually.

315
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:18,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very nice looking.

316
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes full screen video really easy.

317
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:28,023
[SPEAKER_06]: The layout of it's really big so that you can see it on your TV and it works great.

318
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely something to check out especially if you're just browsing YouTube stuff or you want to show your friends something.

319
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:42,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I just happened to show them the new shorts that they did for YouTube Live for Charlie the Unicorn.

320
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:44,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

321
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,774
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to actually show us everything and they're bringing me a turntable I get to keep.

322
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

323
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:07,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

324
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,899
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one that Newark's actually doing the turntable for.

325
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only thing I don't like about it though is it's all urban and hip hop music.

326
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:19,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But it makes sense in that game because there's not a lot of scratching in techno music.

327
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say that's kind of...

328
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:22,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

329
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:25,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The music that is produced by Turntables.

330
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish there was some more house music.

331
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:27,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe there is.

332
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll find out more this week.

333
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to see it on Thursday.

334
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty psyched about that.

335
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely tune back in next week for Loki's review.

336
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:35,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

337
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:35,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

338
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:36,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

339
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:37,068
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

340
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

341
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Victoria grabbed your boob.

342
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:41,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

343
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't want to acknowledge it on air.

344
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:44,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for doing that.

345
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:54,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally downloaded Samurai Shodown 2 on Virtual Console and I was having good times with that because that was one of my original fighting games that I loved to play all the time.

346
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing that for a while.

347
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's your character?

348
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Galford because he has a dog.

349
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only reason I ever played it because Galford was on there and he was hot.

350
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:06,367
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

351
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,028
[SPEAKER_02]: PopCap games.

352
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:13,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got Silent Hill Origins for Christmas kind of late because it came out.

353
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:13,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, on the PlayStation 2?

354
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

355
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, how is it?

356
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best Silent Hill.

357
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad, but it's different.

358
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it was made by some European team.

359
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:26,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not bad.

360
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Silent Hill 5?

361
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:30,480
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

362
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, but no.

363
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, it's Silent Hill Homecoming.

364
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:35,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever.

365
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:35,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Homecoming 5.

366
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:40,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it only on the... Silent Hill The Room, you know, that's 4, whatever.

367
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a crap.

368
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:43,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, isn't it on the Xbox?

369
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:44,138
[SPEAKER_02]: 360 and PS3.

370
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:44,418
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3, yeah.

371
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:45,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any of those.

372
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

373
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting.

374
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,180
[SPEAKER_07]: You're stubborn.

375
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get a 360.

376
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:50,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have friends.

377
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know me.

378
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:51,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

379
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:54,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to come over here and play?

380
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:56,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I am so fucking lazy.

381
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:57,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to drive here.

382
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Silent Hill, but I also love not driving places.

383
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:05,647
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these days, I'm sure.

384
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:08,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll pull a Victoria and stay the weekend at your house.

385
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:10,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we tell that story real quick?

386
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we?

387
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:11,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we?

388
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,790
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why Victoria is here on the show tonight.

389
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Victoria, why don't you tell our listeners why you're here on the program tonight?

390
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,072
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm kind of dumb.

391
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm opening a hotel right now.

392
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,554
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new hotel opening out in...

393
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:23,374
[SPEAKER_09]: www.DarkSakura.com

394
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:46,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and my roommate isn't home because she's in Sonoma seeing her boyfriend.

395
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's not going to be home until tomorrow.

396
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:54,115
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm basically stuck at Rob's house until tomorrow imposing on his good hospitality and all that nonsense.

397
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very grateful to him for letting me stay here.

398
00:20:57,377 --> 00:20:58,058
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, bitch.

399
00:20:58,378 --> 00:20:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: You better gush.

400
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,180
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, I'd be sleeping in my car.

401
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell the listeners about how wonderful I am.

402
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:03,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

403
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:04,303
[SPEAKER_09]: He's so good to me.

404
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,124
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

405
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I just thought that was my story.

406
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:11,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, there was one game I did forget about that I actually played this week.

407
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja Blade.

408
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:13,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the demo for that.

409
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:15,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is pretty cool.

410
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:19,171
[SPEAKER_06]: The game looks kind of like a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden 2.

411
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:22,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually more of a rip-off of Conan or God of War.

412
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: The game plays very similar.

413
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:28,022
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three different weapons with varying speed and damage.

414
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,206
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, you know, it's all ninja themed and stuff.

415
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:39,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, there's a lot of, like, quick time event, um, cutscenes that are in the game, which are pretty cool looking, just very cinematic and action packed.

416
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,725
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one scene where you're actually running down the side of a skyscraper, and, uh,

417
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:49,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Killing these dragon-looking monster things, which are pretty awesome.

418
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely worth checking out.

419
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:52,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not crap.

420
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:55,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely not Vampire Reigns.

421
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,700
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be a good one to check out.

422
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's coming out at the end of March now.

423
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:04,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those secondary FromSoftware games that Microsoft's publishing.

424
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times, good times.

425
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

426
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp So Victoria, you know how you can extend your stay here at Rob's?

427
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:23,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Do his laundry, do his dishes, clean his house The guy that I was seeing told me to cook for him, but you know, he's all diet-y and stuff

428
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:26,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to give Loki the presents I got him from Hawaii.

429
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you get me?

430
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got him an authentic dashboard hula girl doll because I thought he'd like that.

431
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Jamie one too.

432
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,433
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll find out about that next week.

433
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I got some, since you like food, I got you some macadamia nut covered toffee which is really good.

434
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:40,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So eat it.

435
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:40,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

436
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:42,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give this to Nellie.

437
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:42,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat it.

438
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:44,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Nellie will like it too.

439
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:44,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

440
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:47,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

441
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

442
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:49,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

443
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:50,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I just remembered that.

444
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,929
[SPEAKER_07]: So you were done with your gaming week too then, Rice Princess?

445
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Victoria, I don't know if there's been anything you've been playing, but why don't you share?

446
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Rock Band with Rob yesterday.

447
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We made a band, The Shrieking Beavers.

448
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have a game on my phone that I've been playing, but that's as awesome as it gets.

449
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:12,998
[SPEAKER_07]: What game on your phone?

450
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:13,999
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Pump Jack.

451
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a little, you're like a little... Sounds dirty.

452
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

453
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:17,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

454
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:18,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

455
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:19,842
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it came with my sidekick.

456
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:27,065
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, it's like your little wheel and you have to go collect all the gas cans and you have to avoid the little cactuses that can explode and kill you.

457
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:28,566
[SPEAKER_09]: The new Pump Jack!

458
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:29,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Pump Jack, yeah!

459
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:35,929
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and I've been playing it since I got my damn phone, which is almost a year, and I still haven't beaten it.

460
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the last level, and it's driving me crazy that I can't win.

461
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Which goes to show you why I don't play video games, because I get frustrated, and then I just don't want to play anymore.

462
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:47,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have an interesting story later on that might appeal to you.

463
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:48,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about that.

464
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: What they're doing for frustrated people like you.

465
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:51,576
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

466
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,009
[SPEAKER_07]: The old school one for PlayStation 1.

467
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:09,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing that like crazy.

468
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really touched it since I got back from Hawaii.

469
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I got to a part of the game where it actually got hard again.

470
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm getting to the Victoria level of frustration with it.

471
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,492
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll go back and try to beat it at some point.

472
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as far as new stuff I've been playing.

473
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,573
[SPEAKER_07]: The new stuff I've been playing is on the iPhone.

474
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:24,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is kind of interesting.

475
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:26,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami put out some interesting games this week.

476
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,534
[SPEAKER_07]: They put out a demo for Dance Dance Revolution.

477
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,155
[SPEAKER_07]: The new iPhone DDR game.

478
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:32,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is...

479
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:34,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

480
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:37,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Its biggest problem is it's choppy.

481
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, if you think the Xbox frame rate thing is an issue, try playing DDR on your iPhone.

482
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:43,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty horrible.

483
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:44,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very pretty.

484
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:53,370
[SPEAKER_07]: For a cell phone game, it's actually very pretty looking, and the sound's very good, because obviously iPhones are iPods, so the music is obviously full quality, which is kind of nice.

485
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically what it is, a little dance pad shows up at the bottom of your screen, and you play with your fingers.

486
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:02,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You dance with your fingers to the music, which is cute, but I don't know how...

487
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:04,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, luckily it's free.

488
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:05,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free.

489
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:06,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't complain.

490
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally free.

491
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just the one song for free.

492
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one song?

493
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's one song.

494
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:12,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

495
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:16,467
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like a preview of what they're working on or something.

496
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:17,128
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

497
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,250
[SPEAKER_07]: The other game I got on the iPhone is Silent Hill.

498
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,811
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have on the iPhone now.

499
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new version of it.

500
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:27,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's called Silent Hill The Revenge.

501
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name of it.

502
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually looking it up on my phone right now.

503
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:32,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called...

504
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill The Escape Silent Hill The Escape

505
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea if they can hear that over the air, but a little bit of what it sounds like.

506
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you actually... It uses the touchscreen.

507
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a whole new interface that uses the touchscreen.

508
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:13,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You can slide back and forth to move through the maze, and you turn left and right, and then to fire your gun, you tap on the crosshair to fire the gun, and the crosshair is all tilt-sensitive.

509
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to aim up and down, you tilt.

510
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will run across these nurses in the maze, and you can blow their brains out, basically.

511
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:23,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a Silent Hill game.

512
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:28,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a dungeon-crawling game that they've slapped Silent Hill graphics onto.

513
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely you just, Rob.

514
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Silent Hill is all about avoiding things.

515
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,242
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't necessarily have to shoot everything in the face, you know what I mean?

516
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:38,203
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game kind of encourages that.

517
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Rob.

518
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never played Silent Hill, so I appreciate you explaining it to me.

519
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:43,766
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm telling you, for the listeners, you know what I mean?

520
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:44,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

521
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it's about.

522
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:46,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the movie.

523
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And you didn't like the movie, did you?

524
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I was pissed at the end.

525
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the fuck is this?

526
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's more one of those things that's much better if you've played the game.

527
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was told.

528
00:26:57,097 --> 00:27:00,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Silent Hill on the iPhone is kind of eh.

529
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's only $8.

530
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be honest.

531
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:04,484
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

532
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:05,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

533
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a really smooth running game.

534
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: The controls are kind of interesting.

535
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Compared to DDR, the frame rate is much better.

536
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It runs a lot smoothly.

537
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:17,433
[SPEAKER_07]: For a mobile phone game, the graphics are actually pretty good.

538
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:21,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you play with headphones, the sound and stuff is actually kind of neat.

539
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually not a bad game.

540
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,242
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of short and not really Silent Hill.

541
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:29,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

542
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:38,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if you want to get kind of an interesting maze exploring game that you shoot things in, get this game.

543
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you want like a, you know, just, it's a cute little time waster.

544
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's only like six levels, so I don't know if it's necessarily worth $8.

545
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:49,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe $5 would have been a better price point for this, but, you know.

546
00:27:50,815 --> 00:28:19,959
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever, I guess yeah, when I think of Silent Hill I totally think of shooting my way out of a maze they had to come up with they have these little story elements that are in it too, although not much I haven't seen Pyramid Head yet, but I might not have just played far enough it's alright, you have to remember it's a mobile phone game, if your expectations are high, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment I know, why don't they just make it a generic game or something it's nothing like Silent Hill well it is

547
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:23,488
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Victoria mic because we can't hear it.

548
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Because then it wouldn't get sold if they didn't put Silent Hill on it.

549
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it right there.

550
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:33,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's interesting about this is that, hey, there's a Metal Gear game coming out and a lot of people are like, OMG, Metal Gear on the phone.

551
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's anything like this, don't get your hopes up.

552
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:35,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It is exactly.

553
00:28:35,856 --> 00:28:36,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's worse than that.

554
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:37,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real shooter.

555
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's not even going to be anything.

556
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:44,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a pad comes up and you just use your fingers to hit the buttons and it's only one song.

557
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:45,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

558
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:46,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

559
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,124
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

560
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:49,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there it is.

561
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:53,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my quick review on the Silent Hill The Escape, the iPhone game.

562
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I don't think I've really been playing a lot of new stuff.

563
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,588
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just playing the same old stuff.

564
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:01,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's console games too.

565
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:04,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the best warrior ever

566
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll do that a little later on.

567
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And she'll be back next week.

568
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:44,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently also in housekeeping tonight, we have a brand new Orange Lounge Radio website coming soon, it looks like.

569
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:46,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the beta looks great.

570
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're in chat right now, just ask Deakman.

571
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:50,824
[SPEAKER_07]: He did awesome.

572
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:51,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.

573
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like it was made in the early 2000s.

574
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:54,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.

575
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very modern.

576
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still simple, though, is what I like about it.

577
00:29:58,928 --> 00:29:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sophisticated.

578
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,371
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't load it up with a bunch of crap.

579
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It still looks efficient, which would be cool.

580
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:06,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very excited.

581
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:07,976
[SPEAKER_07]: It's attractive.

582
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thank you to Deakman.

583
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:12,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll find other ways to thank him later on when the site goes live.

584
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll send Victoria out there to babysit because he's married.

585
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So Victoria can go babysit.

586
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:24,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a 10-year-old brother and I want to kill him every time I see him.

587
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't stand children.

588
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:29,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reporting you to the authorities.

589
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't hurt him.

590
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kind of pull his hair a little bit and smack him in the head and tell him to quit looking like a little girl with his John Lennon hair.

591
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't your 10-year-old brother play Grand Theft Auto?

592
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he does.

593
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:46,774
[SPEAKER_09]: He called me on Christmas Day asking me to find him cheat codes for Grand Theft Auto 4.

594
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:49,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, God damn it, you have the fucking internet.

595
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Look it up yourself.

596
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:51,990
[SPEAKER_06]: To your 10-year-old brother.

597
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,651
[SPEAKER_09]: To my 10-year-old brother.

598
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:53,552
[SPEAKER_09]: He knows I love him.

599
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,175
[SPEAKER_06]: He shouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto 4 anyway.

600
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:58,377
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been playing Grand Theft Auto since he was like 6.

601
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:02,582
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad thought it was appropriate to buy him GTA 3 when he was 6.

602
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:03,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

603
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:04,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

604
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:08,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So, fabulous parenting on my parents' part.

605
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

606
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonder how I turned out so normal-ish.

607
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,301
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

608
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

609
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:56,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Cuckoo, Kudo, Kodo, Bunko, whatever.

610
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Kodu.

611
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:02,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it's basically a very simplified game-making program.

612
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:05,105
[SPEAKER_06]: They're comparing it to LittleBigPlanet.

613
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:16,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's anything like LittleBigPlanet at all, but it's kind of object-oriented programming stuff, and you can use the characters and stuff in there to basically create your own little games.

614
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,957
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all kind of pixelated-looking because of the...

615
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

616
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:44,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

617
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,381
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days, I want to get Aaron back on the show.

618
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:05,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping he'll listen at one point.

619
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,402
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the guy who did Snake 360.

620
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:10,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk to him now, like six weeks out after his game's been released and see how it's been going.

621
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:15,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him respond back to, there was an IGN review of his game or something.

622
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:15,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

623
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:21,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They were talking about the hot or not of community games, and his was actually in the not section.

624
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reasons that they gave are retarded.

625
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,407
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all, oh, it's Snake game.

626
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:25,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

627
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:29,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And it totally looked like the guy did not play the game at all.

628
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was retarded, but it was funny.

629
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he called him out on it.

630
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:37,526
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, doesn't sound like you played this at all.

631
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, there's a lot of features that you didn't mention.

632
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:45,808
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some other games that were just crap that they gave good reviews for.

633
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, it's just one person's review.

634
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because they happen to be behind a website...

635
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:53,108
[SPEAKER_06]: UGO bought the 1UP Network

636
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:24,604
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, and basically, it caused, you know, long story short, it caused EGM to go under Electronic Gaming Monthly.

637
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:25,685
[SPEAKER_07]: The magazine is no more.

638
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:30,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And lots and lots of folks that were working at 1up.com, goodbye.

639
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:37,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Including the people that were doing the 1up show, and 1up was 1up Yours, was the video show.

640
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:38,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest, guys.

641
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:38,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so funny.

642
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:40,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

643
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,698
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot of extra news to talk about with us.

644
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you guys all read it in the week we were gone.

645
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So you all are probably pretty familiar with it.

646
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,743
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, go look on any blog that was running last week, and I'm sure you'll read about it.

647
00:34:52,284 --> 00:35:00,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very interesting, like, really how much love was out there for these shows and this site, which was interesting to me because, honestly, I've never...

648
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And no offense, but...

649
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:31,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and to be honest, I don't even know who Yu-Gi-Oh is.

650
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:36,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've never heard of them as a website.

651
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:40,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they run a lot of other websites for entertainment, movies, things of that nature?

652
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:51,573
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to be like a one, not one, an IGN type of service, but I've never visited them ever, and you know, I don't know, I just have never heard of them.

653
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:57,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, maybe that's my own ignorance, but I've never heard of them at all, and

654
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:58,582
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:42,587
[SPEAKER_07]: How much these guys that were producing these shows and doing this stuff were really into video games and really into their craft because as many independent podcasts have shown for years and years and years, you don't have to get paid to do this stuff if you really, really enjoy it.

656
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So my kind of thing was I was going to say, well, guys, here you go.

657
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:51,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's your chance to keep doing what you do just because this may not be the day job anymore.

658
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,910
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still keep it going.

659
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have.

660
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to them.

661
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now there is the whole Rebel FM, I think it's called.

662
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:01,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there's another one called Geekbox.

663
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:04,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to them for continuing to do it.

664
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of curious to see how much this is going to go.

665
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:09,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of where some of these guys end up.

666
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I think... Well, this is the same thing that's going to happen.

667
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, you know, that's how we got This Week in Tech.

668
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know... True.

669
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Fallout from Tech TV, so...

670
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

671
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:27,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that they'll make it just as well and probably even better now that they're away from 1UP.

672
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:29,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you say that?

673
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:30,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because.

674
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:31,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this week in tech.

675
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:41,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're doing very well and I think that if they were still part of G4, the whole tech TV thing, I think they wouldn't be doing as well as they are now independently.

676
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Less influence from other things that are more corporate oriented.

677
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:48,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

678
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck.

679
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's never fun to talk about job layoffs, but good luck to those folks.

680
00:37:54,521 --> 00:38:00,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And good luck to 1UP too, staying kind of on top of things now.

681
00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:03,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they've taken a lot of negative press over this whole thing.

682
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:04,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

683
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to ask you, Rice Princess, because you were on 1UP for quite some time.

684
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:12,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Years ago when I was posting on there and participating on the site, you were kind of the one that got me into that.

685
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you kind of hung out there for a little while after that.

686
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about all this news about it closing?

687
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Is 1UP a site you would still visit?

688
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:20,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you like, eh, the people are gone?

689
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:21,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

690
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:29,680
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because, yeah, I actually did revisit my 1UP account a couple weeks ago, actually, before any of this ever happened.

691
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have the same friends and stuff.

692
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really do anything.

693
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:40,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's always sad when a community, a group of people, just can't meet at the same place anymore.

694
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:44,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having your favorite local coffee shop or something close down.

695
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, oh, that sucks.

696
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You just moved to a new coffee shop!

697
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:47,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's what I'm saying.

698
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:56,576
[SPEAKER_02]: People can get each other's information, go to another place and do it, but you can go to another coffee shop, but it might not be as cool or as quirky or whatever.

699
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:02,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the thing is, in defense, I guess you would say to UGO, print

700
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Informer, something like that.

701
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:17,915
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

702
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:40,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Electronic Gaming Monthly News

703
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,691
[SPEAKER_07]: has been dead to me for 10 years.

704
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:08,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that magazine back in the day.

705
00:40:09,235 --> 00:40:15,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, that issue where they actually had the Shang Long lie in it for the April Fool's.

706
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I freaking had that issue with the magazine.

707
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:18,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

708
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:25,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember some of that stuff happening, but honestly, I stopped subscribing to that a long time ago.

709
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,331
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people did.

710
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, it was more the news of, oh, well, you know, that's too bad.

711
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:32,852
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an icon of my youth that's going away.

712
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:35,073
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not surprised.

713
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:53,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, with the advent of, you know, internet news outlets and especially blogs, blogs are becoming more popular than, you know, normal media sites because people like to identify with other people who are on their level, who are normal, who can give, you know, a perspective, you know, that's not like corporate.

714
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:58,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And a big purpose for magazines now in this day and age is to read when you're on the toilet.

715
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that they have iPhones, you can look at blogs when you're on the toilet now.

716
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: You can?

717
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:03,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

718
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I do.

719
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't even need magazines anymore.

720
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I can look at websites.

721
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Only, oh wow.

722
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,071
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Victoria, what?

723
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You a nasty hoe.

724
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to know what you do when you're taking a dump.

725
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:20,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, everybody poops.

726
00:41:20,872 --> 00:41:22,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you ever read that book?

727
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody poops.

728
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wipe your butt and you get a little bit of poop on your finger and you put it on your thing, you can't throw it away like a magazine.

729
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:33,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

730
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:36,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down with the old school magazines being in my bathroom.

731
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:37,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.

732
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:40,239
[SPEAKER_02]: You see all the Maxims lined up on my toilet.

733
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,019
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la la la.

734
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,380
[SPEAKER_02]: We can move away from that now.

735
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,406
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I'm talking about is that, you know, people used to have the magazines or the, what was it, the bathroom reader books or whatever.

736
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:54,309
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we can have the internet even when we're pooping.

737
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We could.

738
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,132
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can look at blogs and all that there.

739
00:41:58,293 --> 00:41:59,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you're right about that.

740
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross, but yeah.

741
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:07,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So magazine, I'm just saying magazines are, you know, it's one last use.

742
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:11,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you take your, oh, I'm holding your laptop right now.

743
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had this in the bathroom with you, haven't you?

744
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:14,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

745
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: There's poop somewhere on here, isn't there?

746
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:16,582
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

747
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:17,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, damn it.

748
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:20,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are the keys so sticky, Rob?

749
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: You're disgusting.

750
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody burn my hands off.

751
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

752
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let's move on.

753
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

754
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:29,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

755
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:33,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a rumor coming from IGN.

756
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:43,508
[SPEAKER_06]: They have multiple sources close to Nintendo that have told the site that the DSi will be out in the US on April 4th at $179.

757
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow don't believe this.

758
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:50,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is that that you don't believe this?

759
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's just a few things that strike me as weird.

760
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:59,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, for some reason, likes releasing their stuff, especially hardware, on Sundays.

761
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:01,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 4th is actually a Saturday.

762
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: For one.

763
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's my only thing.

764
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:05,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Saturday, not Sunday.

765
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, I am calling the whole thing bunk.

766
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:09,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know.

767
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:10,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really matter.

768
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, if anything, they would want to hold off on...

769
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Selling the DSi because they've been selling tons of DSs already and you know I think if they bring the DSi out it's just going to cut into their DS sales and they're not really having trouble selling DS systems and I don't know there's not really any DSi software out even in Japan right now I mean other than the download stuff but

770
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:38,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

771
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

772
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:46,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they could always just cut the price of the DS that's out there right now by like $20 and release the DSi.

773
00:43:46,184 --> 00:43:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: For $99.99.

774
00:43:46,444 --> 00:43:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, then people will start making love to DSs like crazy or something.

775
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:50,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

776
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:56,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll sell both because you'll have the more high-priced ones for folks that want the camera and all that stuff.

777
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:58,026
[SPEAKER_07]: They could do it.

778
00:43:58,246 --> 00:44:02,147
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, what Loki says about the date is especially interesting because Nintendo does usually do Sunday.

779
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:04,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it doesn't mean maybe shipping on April 4th to...

780
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

781
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:29,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it just doesn't really seem like there would be any reason to release this now.

782
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:32,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's just a few download games and that's it.

783
00:44:32,685 --> 00:44:35,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not really that worthwhile.

784
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:40,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the DS was kind of tanking a little bit.

785
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:47,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really tanking, but like if sales are starting to drop off a little bit in Japan and maybe that's why they released the DSi, but I don't think they're dropping off at all.

786
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

787
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:52,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still selling tons of DS systems, not having a problem whatsoever.

788
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Some comments from chatroom on this story.

789
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:01,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Sai says, I think their strategy is that Nintendo fans will buy the 179 DSi and most people will buy the DS Lite at regular.

790
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:03,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of similar to what I was saying.

791
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, so the DSi is for hardcore gamers.

792
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:06,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, uh-huh, sure.

793
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:09,947
[SPEAKER_07]: or people who want the extra garbage that it's going to have.

794
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:12,669
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Link says, and you can take it to the bathroom.

795
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: You can indeed play your DS in the bathroom, and I'm sure there's people that do that.

796
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:18,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a really crappy web browser.

797
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:20,414
[SPEAKER_02]: No pun intended.

798
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a horrible web browser built into it as well.

799
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:30,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says, Activision Blizzard doesn't want the DSi released because their best-selling DS game won't be compatible.

800
00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero on tour.

801
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:37,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Activision and Blizzard don't have a say in it, so poop on them.

802
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:38,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

803
00:45:38,814 --> 00:45:41,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... This show is really poop-filled.

804
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:48,457
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll just come out with another peripheral to plug into the SD card slot and then they can make their crappy games.

805
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have some stupid drum peripheral.

806
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:51,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

807
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:54,198
[SPEAKER_06]: All their DS guitar games suck.

808
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

809
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:55,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

810
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

811
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to concur with you on there.

812
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I used to play DDR with the remote control when I couldn't afford to go to the arcade.

813
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:28,033
[SPEAKER_07]: What's one of the biggest iPhone games right now, in fact so big that Apple actually displays it on a big banner inside their store?

814
00:46:28,373 --> 00:46:29,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill The Escape.

815
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:30,795
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not Silent Hill The Escape.

816
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:31,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Tap Tap Revenge.

817
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:37,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Tap Tap Revenge is like a somewhat DDR clone.

818
00:46:37,432 --> 00:46:38,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit the buttons.

819
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:40,975
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a clone of Amplitude.

820
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:42,116
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

821
00:46:42,196 --> 00:46:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played the game.

822
00:46:42,956 --> 00:46:45,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Guitar Hero, if anything else.

823
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,340
[SPEAKER_07]: The notes scroll down and you tap.

824
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,922
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's closest to, is Guitar Hero.

825
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:52,164
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, though, you're not dancing, though.

826
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

827
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:54,566
[SPEAKER_06]: You are tapping.

828
00:46:54,706 --> 00:47:00,610
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's like a Beatmania game or something like that, then yeah, it's a little bit more acceptable, because...

829
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,850
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR on a DS DDR on a DS

830
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:28,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, hey, speaking of some systems, there's still some love for the old systems too.

831
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:32,677
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, systems so old that Victoria actually owns them because she can afford them.

832
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:36,002
[SPEAKER_07]: You are such a bitch!

833
00:47:36,162 --> 00:47:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god!

834
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:38,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up!

835
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:39,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

836
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

837
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:46,221
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2 reaches the 50 million sold mark in North America.

838
00:47:47,522 --> 00:47:55,805
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2 has actually hit that mark, 50 million, and I believe that is more than any other system, if I'm not mistaken.

839
00:47:56,765 --> 00:47:59,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's a lot.

840
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:02,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they keep breaking, and you have to keep rebuying them.

841
00:48:04,293 --> 00:48:09,315
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, there is a note from John Kohler, the marketing head of Sony Computer Entertainment.

842
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,977
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't intend on discarding the system anytime soon.

843
00:48:14,437 --> 00:48:17,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they still sell like hundreds of thousands of units each month.

844
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they can't play the games on my PS3.

845
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:23,560
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to release the PSI on April 4th for a price tag of $159.

846
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:23,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

847
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:26,969
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

848
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, people are saying the PS3 needs to come down in price and they might actually sell some more units.

849
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

850
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be too late.

851
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:56,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Too little, too late.

852
00:48:57,121 --> 00:48:57,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

853
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:58,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little too late.

854
00:48:58,982 --> 00:49:04,163
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, might as well give up this console generation, just, you know, work on the next one.

855
00:49:04,664 --> 00:49:07,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

856
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:15,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we talked a little bit before about the video download service that they have in Japan for the Wii, which is kind of

857
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:17,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

858
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:21,199
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very family friendly, I guess.

859
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:26,041
[SPEAKER_06]: They have cartoons and other Japanese programming stuff on there.

860
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something similar may be coming to the US this year, actually.

861
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:32,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

862
00:49:34,345 --> 00:49:43,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Fujisoft, the company behind it, was at CES and told GamerSight that they are planning on bringing the WiiWare video service to the U.S.

863
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, we can't quite tell at the moment, but if the negotiations are a success, maybe within the year.

864
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:59,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is cool, but we still need some better storage on the Wii.

865
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:02,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Or an SD memory card What's that, Victoria?

866
00:50:11,514 --> 00:50:12,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't work the Wii.

867
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, like, retarded.

868
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:21,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried playing and it's just... You know what's funny is that the Wii is, like, made for, like, people to be able to understand very easily, but you can't figure it out.

869
00:50:21,782 --> 00:50:23,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can, but I'm just not good at it.

870
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:25,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I like having a little control in my hand.

871
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:31,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess it's kind of good if you're one of those people who, like, you know, moves the controller to the left when you want your little person to go to the left.

872
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,450
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when you're playing Mario Brothers, old school.

873
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,393
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just jump right, right, right.

874
00:50:36,473 --> 00:50:37,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I don't know.

875
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:38,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you do.

876
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:39,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

877
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:39,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

878
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I fail epically at the Wii.

879
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,787
[SPEAKER_07]: What games do you enjoy on Wii?

880
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that Wario one where you have to go through the little movements.

881
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:49,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it's called.

882
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:50,631
[SPEAKER_07]: WarioWare.

883
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:51,232
[SPEAKER_09]: That one.

884
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:55,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's like one of the only games I've ever played on the Wii.

885
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:58,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than Guitar Hero because my cousins have it on.

886
00:50:58,898 --> 00:50:59,198
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

887
00:50:59,538 --> 00:50:59,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

888
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're a Wii-tard is what you're basically saying.

889
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm a Wii-tard.

890
00:51:02,741 --> 00:51:03,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

891
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:04,082
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

892
00:51:04,702 --> 00:51:05,003
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

893
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:12,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, if you want to get a wee cheap, you might want to run over to Circuit City because Circuit City has gone under.

894
00:51:12,592 --> 00:51:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, so many of these companies are going under recently.

895
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:15,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of sad.

896
00:51:16,193 --> 00:51:19,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost feel like we need a theme song on the show for when companies go under.

897
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:23,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me try reading the story to this music.

898
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:42,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Circuit City has announced that they are going to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

899
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:46,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy already and closed 155 stores.

900
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:47,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't enough.

901
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:52,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they are unable to find a buyer to keep themselves afloat.

902
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:54,465
[SPEAKER_07]: They are being liquidated.

903
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, sadly, and I...

904
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:03,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize to any listeners we have who work for Circuit City because this news has got to suck.

905
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:09,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really hope somebody else will come in and buy up some of these old stores.

906
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:12,030
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are going under.

907
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I'm hearing from people who do work for them that I know on LiveJournal and stuff, apparently the company was horribly managed.

908
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:20,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's finally come back to get them.

909
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:23,081
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of had an old business model, too.

910
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like...

911
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:26,784
[SPEAKER_02]: with places like Fry's and Best Buy and stuff.

912
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:28,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Circuit City was just kind of the little guy.

913
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:31,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just can't keep up.

914
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And they kept building them next to Best Buy's.

915
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:36,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or Best Buy's kept building them next to Circuit City's.

916
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, you know, they kind of didn't have a chance.

917
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:41,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the interesting thing.

918
00:52:41,455 --> 00:52:45,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the way liquidation sales usually work is that they will be... By the way, this doesn't affect Canada.

919
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:49,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Circuit City Canada is still going because it's not the U.S., so you don't have a U.S.

920
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:50,601
[SPEAKER_07]: bankruptcy thing.

921
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:52,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So Circuit City Canada is still fine.

922
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:55,684
[SPEAKER_07]: But Circuit City U.S., they're going under.

923
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:59,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And when a store liquidates, usually they're going to have sales for the first week 10% off.

924
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:01,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Then in the second week, 20% off.

925
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Third week, 30% off.

926
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:08,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing is that people are already snatching up the TVs, the Xboxes, and all this stuff because they're like, OMG, 10% off.

927
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:14,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Church of City was marking half this shit up to begin with, which is probably part of the reason they're going under.

928
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:16,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're really sadly not going to say much.

929
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they're doing some stuff 10, some stuff 20, and some stuff 30 all in the same week.

930
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:22,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

931
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:23,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been to the one here yet.

932
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:24,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check it out already?

933
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:25,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Nathan went.

934
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:27,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where he was going to look for his RAM or whatever.

935
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:28,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

936
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:29,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

937
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck with that.

938
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:33,012
[SPEAKER_07]: All the good stuff is going to be gone already.

939
00:53:33,132 --> 00:53:34,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it went this weekend.

940
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:40,315
[SPEAKER_07]: All that's going to be left is DVD and CDs of bands you've never heard of.

941
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:45,357
[SPEAKER_06]: We went over to Circuit City the other day to look at their... This is before I got my new car stereo.

942
00:53:46,687 --> 00:53:49,009
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually had less stereos than Walmart did.

943
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:52,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and Walmart has a pretty pathetic car stereo section.

944
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:55,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think Circuit City had like eight.

945
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:58,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that Walmart had a car section or car stereo.

946
00:53:58,637 --> 00:54:01,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're very, they're, they suck.

947
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was like looking for a price for one of them and the woman's like, it'd be on that shelf over here.

948
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:09,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, what the fuck?

949
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

950
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:40,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, I hate to be rude, but it was actually kind of a selling point to me.

951
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that one time back when they were selling Wheeze and stuff and we drove by the Circuit City and there was like no one there?

952
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:48,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was the night the Wheeze came out.

953
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:51,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And Best Buy had a line going around the block.

954
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember we went out when the Wheeze came out?

955
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:55,254
[SPEAKER_07]: We were giving out, what was it, orange soda?

956
00:54:55,494 --> 00:54:57,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We were trying to sell our show to locals.

957
00:54:57,956 --> 00:54:59,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we did that, went to Best Buy.

958
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Circuit City had like five people.

959
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's great.

960
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor guys.

961
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:06,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel bad.

962
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there's someone who listens to this show who works for Circuit City, who just left their job, who's a little pissed that we're riffing on him a little bit.

963
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:14,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does suck.

964
00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have friends actually from school that worked at Circuit City, but they kind of knew it was coming.

965
00:55:20,813 --> 00:55:23,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've been looking for a little while for another job.

966
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:25,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they had something lined up.

967
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:26,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew this was going to happen.

968
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:28,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it sucks, but they prepared.

969
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:29,615
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've known.

970
00:55:29,972 --> 00:55:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope that's the case.

971
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:33,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck to all those that were impacted.

972
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:42,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you were part of the reason Circuit City went under, like you're one of these upper managements that didn't know what you were doing, then, well, sucks, doesn't it?

973
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:43,005
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

974
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:52,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently there was a story about this dog that was as dead as Circuit City for at least a moment.

975
00:55:53,536 --> 00:55:53,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

976
00:55:55,598 --> 00:56:03,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently a woman in Michigan nearly killed her dog when she accidentally struck it on the temple with a Wii Remote.

977
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:16,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, she was busy doing some Wii Sports bowling, didn't have the wrist strap on or something like that, and the Wii Remote went straight and hit the dog in the temple, killing him instantly.

978
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:17,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

979
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:32,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, but luckily though, the dog, Ozzy, was not moving and stuff, so they called a neighbor who apparently had some veterinary training and she was able to revive the dog using mouth-to-mouth.

980
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:40,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But the dog had to be taken to the real vet where, you know, apparently had some severe brain swelling due to cardiac arrest.

981
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But the dog, you know, apparently is fine now.

982
00:56:44,352 --> 00:56:45,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

983
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, she had to kiss the dog on the mouth?

984
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Not kiss.

985
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:51,923
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not mouth to mouth.

986
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:53,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually nose.

987
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:57,771
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to blow down the dog's nose.

988
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I love dogs, but not that much.

989
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if my cat was dying, I'd do that.

990
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that, it's my cat.

991
00:57:05,553 --> 00:57:06,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

992
00:57:06,254 --> 00:57:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's family.

993
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:10,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if there's boogers on its nose.

994
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I understand.

995
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Irene's dying, but her breath kind of smells.

996
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:19,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I wouldn't blame you, Matt.

997
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:21,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm just going to let her die, you know?

998
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:24,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm never going to give you mouth to nose.

999
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're dear to me, but that's nasty.

1000
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:28,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let me die, right?

1001
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your mouth, but your nose, hell no.

1002
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:35,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I wake up, I'd be like, ew, why are you trying to kiss me, pervert?

1003
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd throw a Wii mode at your temple and hope you die.

1004
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:39,781
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wrong.

1005
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:40,761
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't joke about that.

1006
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:41,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1007
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cute puppy.

1008
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:42,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1009
00:57:43,382 --> 00:57:52,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure pretty soon there will be video of these Wii accidents as if there aren't enough already of people destroying their TVs and stuff showing up on YouTube.

1010
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:57,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ironic thing now is it'll be much easier to watch someone break their Wii on a Wii.

1011
00:57:58,288 --> 00:57:59,449
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: DogKillByWeRemote

1013
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:54,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, but the dog actually lived.

1014
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:55,245
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog lived.

1015
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:57,447
[SPEAKER_06]: He was only dead for five minutes.

1016
00:58:57,707 --> 00:58:59,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Which makes him a zombie!

1017
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, he was dead for five minutes?

1018
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1019
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:06,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you could start getting brain damage after three or four minutes.

1020
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:14,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a border collie, it's like a miniature collie I don't know, because border collies are a little bit bigger

1021
00:59:35,711 --> 00:59:36,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1022
00:59:45,353 --> 00:59:48,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's some other interesting stuff.

1023
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit more positive, I guess, for Nintendo.

1024
00:59:54,016 --> 01:00:01,879
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new patent that shows Nintendo is possibly working on a motion-sensing DS card.

1025
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:08,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps something that was similar to what they had for the Game Boy Advance, for different games.

1026
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:10,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the WarioWare games had it.

1027
01:00:10,682 --> 01:00:13,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a DS direction-sensing card.

1028
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:15,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1029
01:00:16,907 --> 01:00:22,271
[SPEAKER_06]: No word on what it's going to be used for, but it's something that has built-in direction and motion tracking.

1030
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can get my iPhone's games ported to my DS?

1031
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what I see happening when this comes out, is that now we'll just get ports of iPhone games on the DS.

1032
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,118
[SPEAKER_07]: With that whole little tilty thing.

1033
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get Silent Hill The Escape on my DS.

1034
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:34,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be fabulous?

1035
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1036
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what you wanted.

1037
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:37,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1038
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:38,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1039
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they do... No, they didn't do a Silent Hill game on the DS.

1040
01:00:41,644 --> 01:00:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a Resident Evil game on the DS, and that was not very good.

1041
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there like a play novel or something that was on the... That's it, but a motion sensing card.

1042
01:00:50,596 --> 01:00:53,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those DS cards are not exactly that big, so that's pretty impressive.

1043
01:00:54,159 --> 01:01:01,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that they would just do... Well, the actual chips that do the motion sensing are really super tiny, so it could be done.

1044
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I don't know, in...

1045
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:15,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, I mean, you can have those things kind of hang out of the slot a little bit, you know, because remember with like the WarioWare one that they had, it was pretty big.

1046
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:24,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess technology was a little bit older then, but, you know, the card itself was huge compared to what normal Game Boy Advance, you know, cards look like.

1047
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:25,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

1048
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:27,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this comment in chat.

1049
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Sai says this in the chat room.

1050
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:29,544
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

1051
01:01:29,904 --> 01:01:31,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not have that in the DSi?

1052
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:34,306
[SPEAKER_07]: A new system is just out and already an add-on that should be built in.

1053
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:44,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly, just like the Wii Motion Plus Something that should have been done in the first place Because Nintendo really cares about its customer base Damn it, we're not getting into that argument

1054
01:01:48,379 --> 01:01:52,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, alright, I guess we'll see what comes of this or what possible game they could be making with this.

1055
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:53,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1056
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:55,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

1057
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:59,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be like Wii Sports for the DS or something.

1058
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:00,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine that?

1059
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii bowling, people throwing their DSes.

1060
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:04,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I broke my DS light.

1061
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:07,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess I gotta go buy a new DSi.

1062
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I see conspiracy here.

1063
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:18,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Legend 2 is being remade for the DS.

1064
01:02:18,354 --> 01:02:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is that the Game Boy one?

1065
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:21,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1066
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:25,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the one that's not really like Final Fantasy, the one that's more like part of the Saga series?

1067
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:26,157
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

1068
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:32,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually Saga 2, Hiho Densetsu, and that was Final Fantasy Legend here.

1069
01:02:32,219 --> 01:03:01,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I love when you pronounce Japanese shut up but yeah it's getting the full 3D little views and things kind of like Final Fantasy 4 and the Dragon Quest games have had so that's being released here awesome I actually think I still have Final Fantasy Legend 2 or 3 on my old Game Boy cartridge yeah and in this Japanese magazine they are definitely selling it as Saga too so awesome I liked the Saga series I'm like the only person in the world maybe they'll call it Saga when it comes out over here instead of Final Fantasy

1070
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:09,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, because it would be very weird to have Final Fantasy Legend 2 come out over here, you know, and it would be kind of like, well, whatever happened to the first two?

1071
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Because who remembers that far back of the Game Boy, you know?

1072
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1073
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:16,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just hope that they never do a Mystic Quest remake.

1074
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow don't see that happening.

1075
01:03:19,185 --> 01:03:20,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystic Quest wasn't terrible.

1076
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:22,746
[SPEAKER_10]: But it wasn't good.

1077
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:24,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll just leave it at that.

1078
01:03:25,007 --> 01:03:25,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't terrible.

1079
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:28,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that's it.

1080
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes...

1081
01:03:31,135 --> 01:03:36,981
[SPEAKER_06]: It figures that the homebrew community of course is doing something that Nintendo isn't doing on their own.

1082
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:50,994
[SPEAKER_06]: A new device has come out, Matrix Wii Z. It's being prototyped right now, but it basically is sort of a mod chip that plugs into your...

1083
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:53,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1084
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:07,866
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1085
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:35,784
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I can put... So, well, they say that you can put ISOs on there and stuff like that and actually run pirated games from it, but you can... Oh, we wouldn't want to encourage people to do that.

1086
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:36,405
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1087
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:45,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also... The system itself will look at it like it's part of the actual storage on the device, so you can use it for storing games.

1088
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:50,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But this, yeah, you can actually store ISOs and stuff, so...

1089
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:53,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob just tried to rape me.

1090
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you were falling asleep, so I went over there to give you a lap dance.

1091
01:04:56,232 --> 01:04:57,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was getting a cookie.

1092
01:04:58,894 --> 01:04:59,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm frightened.

1093
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:02,957
[SPEAKER_07]: All I hear is blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah.

1094
01:05:02,977 --> 01:05:06,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You shoved your dong in her face, okay?

1095
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I not shoved my dong in her face.

1096
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, how many licks does it take?

1097
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:12,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were like, waving your dong in her face.

1098
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:14,487
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I waved a snickerdoodle in her face.

1099
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:16,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what they call it, your snickerdoodle.

1100
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why you thrusted your nutsack in my face.

1101
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:21,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my goodness.

1102
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:23,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You make it sound like I'm not wearing pants or something.

1103
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:24,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not.

1104
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:31,811
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's basically this device will allow super fast loading of ISOs in homebrew.

1105
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1106
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:33,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1107
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:34,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

1108
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:39,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I was just hearing blah, blah, blah, Wii, blah, blah, blah, system that doesn't have any games out on it I care about, blah, blah, blah.

1109
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:41,995
[SPEAKER_06]: But Rob.

1110
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:42,335
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1111
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:46,148
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing, you know, the new play control.

1112
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:48,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's a title that they stuck with.

1113
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:52,809
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for instead of play on the Wii, you know, new play control.

1114
01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:58,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario, was it Mario Power Tennis and then new play control Pikmin.

1115
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you excited about those?

1116
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, those games are totally new and not ever been out on the GameCube.

1117
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:04,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, no, they have.

1118
01:06:05,932 --> 01:06:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad.

1119
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:08,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene, care to comment?

1120
01:06:09,192 --> 01:06:09,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything?

1121
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: What Wii games are you looking forward to, Irene?

1122
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:12,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dying to know.

1123
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, things and stuff.

1124
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:20,171
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably actually a Wii game that's coming out.

1125
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Things and stuff.

1126
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:22,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Things and stuff.

1127
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:24,693
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's a collection of mini games.

1128
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:25,613
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

1129
01:06:26,294 --> 01:06:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Things and stuff.

1130
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a dream game to me.

1131
01:06:31,096 --> 01:06:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You too?

1132
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:32,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

1133
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:33,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1134
01:06:34,178 --> 01:06:35,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that coming out on the Wii in April?

1135
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:36,865
[SPEAKER_02]: On April 4th.

1136
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,223
[SPEAKER_07]: 5 million consoles sold by Nintendo in December.

1137
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:06,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Although that's a little bit, it's actually not Wii's alone.

1138
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:11,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually the DS sold 3 million and the Wii sold 2 million.

1139
01:07:11,148 --> 01:07:14,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So you put it together, they sold 5 million systems that Nintendo moved.

1140
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,632
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of dead collies.

1141
01:07:19,093 --> 01:07:19,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt!

1142
01:07:20,984 --> 01:07:26,166
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to wipe out the Kali species off this planet.

1143
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You are terrible.

1144
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:30,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Lassie will be just a memory.

1145
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, she is, but she's dead.

1146
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, that's okay.

1147
01:07:35,671 --> 01:07:38,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And Timmy will be stuck in the well forever.

1148
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:40,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Jamie here to yell at you?

1149
01:07:42,234 --> 01:07:45,035
[SPEAKER_07]: But look, the reason why this is newsworthy is December.

1150
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Christmas.

1151
01:07:46,656 --> 01:07:49,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the numbers that were going into the Christmas and what ended up under people's trees.

1152
01:07:51,076 --> 01:08:19,694
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 million DS's 2 million Wii's 1.5 million Xbox 360's 1 million PSP's 3 quarters of a million PS3's big surprise and not even half a million PS2's but still going in there it's kind of an old system so that's actually pretty good DarkTetsuya says OLR is going to get an angry email from PETA I hope we do because Jamie would have to read it

1153
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:25,355
[SPEAKER_07]: and Jamie is very opinionated when it comes to PETA.

1154
01:08:25,495 --> 01:08:28,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I welcome them to write the email.

1155
01:08:28,477 --> 01:08:29,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, by all means.

1156
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:30,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on the show.

1157
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:38,022
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I totally encourage people going out and murdering animals with Wii remotes and controllers.

1158
01:08:38,763 --> 01:08:40,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And why stop at the Wii?

1159
01:08:40,364 --> 01:08:43,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, look at the original Xbox controller.

1160
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:46,367
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is like a blunt object of death.

1161
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Try dropping an original Xbox on a dog.

1162
01:08:51,913 --> 01:08:53,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they'd never survive.

1163
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,137
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take out like three dogs with that thing.

1164
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:57,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I really here right now?

1165
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:01,484
[SPEAKER_07]: If we get sued, I don't want any part of this.

1166
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:03,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm distancing myself.

1167
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:06,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever see that Mythbusters where they were...

1168
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,911
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1169
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to chop a frozen turkey on Miley Cyrus I don't know about anybody else out there

1170
01:09:58,599 --> 01:09:59,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1171
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, perfect.

1172
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:30,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so this week we've got a few things coming out.

1173
01:10:30,463 --> 01:10:31,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's January.

1174
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:32,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty slow still.

1175
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some good stuff.

1176
01:10:34,245 --> 01:10:36,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Ocean 2nd Evolution for the PSP.

1177
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:38,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a pretty good game.

1178
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these Square Enix PSP games are doing very well.

1179
01:10:42,569 --> 01:10:45,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Jumble Madness for the DS Big Bang Mini for the DS

1180
01:11:03,522 --> 01:11:04,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that needs to die in a fire.

1181
01:11:04,763 --> 01:11:06,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine Fashion Party.

1182
01:11:07,466 --> 01:11:08,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no thanks.

1183
01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:10,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1184
01:11:10,068 --> 01:11:13,672
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the games I'm going to get for Victoria because she'd love this type of game.

1185
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:14,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine Fashion Party.

1186
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:15,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, look.

1187
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:16,034
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

1188
01:11:16,114 --> 01:11:16,895
[SPEAKER_07]: This bitch right here.

1189
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:24,342
[SPEAKER_07]: We were walking through Walmart and we got to the section with the top model clothes and she was like, oh, top model.

1190
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:27,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a top model tank top for Christmas, so bite me.

1191
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:33,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine the possibilities with that game?

1192
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:35,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1193
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:37,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1194
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say also the Ultimate Shooting Collection on the Wii.

1195
01:11:44,064 --> 01:11:46,926
[SPEAKER_06]: It's three Japanese arcade shooter games.

1196
01:11:46,946 --> 01:11:48,047
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually pretty good.

1197
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember what was in it.

1198
01:11:49,408 --> 01:11:56,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Coriolis, Radio Allergy, and I don't remember the last one that was in there, but...

1199
01:11:58,132 --> 01:12:00,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, like, bullet hell shooter games.

1200
01:12:01,176 --> 01:12:01,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1201
01:12:02,357 --> 01:12:02,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1202
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1203
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder World Amusement Park for the DS.

1204
01:12:07,343 --> 01:12:08,745
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of mini-games on there.

1205
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: R-Tonalico 2, The Melody of Melifacisha, I guess?

1206
01:12:14,552 --> 01:12:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1207
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a Disney villain?

1208
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:19,279
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm sorry.

1209
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:20,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally butchered that.

1210
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,842
[SPEAKER_06]: The melody of Metafalacia, I guess.

1211
01:12:23,902 --> 01:12:24,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1212
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:27,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Falatio?

1213
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally good too, okay?

1214
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:30,626
[SPEAKER_06]: With some extra crap.

1215
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:32,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the PS2.

1216
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:33,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1217
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:36,489
[SPEAKER_06]: The subtitle to that, none of which I just said.

1218
01:12:36,669 --> 01:12:37,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1219
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:39,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

1220
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:43,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Skate 2 is coming out on PS3 and 360 this week as well.

1221
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:44,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1222
01:12:45,813 --> 01:12:47,074
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see here.

1223
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:59,761
[SPEAKER_06]: To tie in perfectly what we were talking about just before I started talking about release dates, Sim Animals, another sim game where you get to control the wonders of nature.

1224
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:06,525
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they actually have this hand, which is the pointer, and you can poke badgers and stuff and they will attack your hand.

1225
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

1226
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:11,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, mushroom, mushroom.

1227
01:13:11,427 --> 01:13:12,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it football or mushroom?

1228
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Mushroom.

1229
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:16,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1230
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:17,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Mushroom.

1231
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:19,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's okay.

1232
01:13:19,935 --> 01:13:23,158
[SPEAKER_06]: But that'll be out on the Wii and the DS, so awesome.

1233
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you simulate, you know, dropping stuff on your animals?

1234
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:28,342
[SPEAKER_06]: You can throw animals.

1235
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:33,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw them shaking a squirrel violently, so I'm sure you can throw rocks at them.

1236
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:36,550
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe feed them to other things.

1237
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done with US release dates?

1238
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:43,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to take the bear in that game and just feed it all sorts of animals and it'll become rabid and just eat things.

1239
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Very rare bear.

1240
01:13:45,734 --> 01:13:47,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying my hardest, okay?

1241
01:13:48,975 --> 01:13:50,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never works.

1242
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:54,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to the UK and the release dates over there.

1243
01:13:54,108 --> 01:13:55,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it in a British accent, British accent.

1244
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:57,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you want me to do it in British accent?

1245
01:13:57,869 --> 01:13:59,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Do, yes, please.

1246
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:02,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really annoy everybody overseas when I talk like this.

1247
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,990
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really bad British accent, I'll give you that.

1248
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really bad one.

1249
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to read these in a British accent, Victoria?

1250
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,471
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't want to read them in British accent.

1251
01:14:08,551 --> 01:14:09,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1252
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:09,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Because.

1253
01:14:09,552 --> 01:14:10,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should.

1254
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:10,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1255
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do you want me to get you some tea and some crumpets to put you in the mood?

1256
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:13,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like tea and crumpets.

1257
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:14,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1258
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, knock it off.

1259
01:14:17,044 --> 01:14:20,505
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to talk in an accent, talk like you're from New York, alright?

1260
01:14:20,745 --> 01:14:22,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be such a wanker.

1261
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,285
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a wanker.

1262
01:14:25,406 --> 01:14:28,606
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 20th... I'm going to get so much hate mail this week.

1263
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,447
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 23rd... British.

1264
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:34,987

1267
01:14:51,015 --> 01:14:54,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who's playing Neopets, but somebody is for sure.

1268
01:14:55,796 --> 01:15:02,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And Skate 2 comes out for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1269
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing a Japanese accent for the Japanese releases.

1270
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:11,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.

1271
01:15:11,617 --> 01:15:16,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Left 4 Dead comes out, the Japanese version, on January 22nd on the Xbox 360.

1272
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's very good.

1273
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation 3.

1274
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:22,585
[SPEAKER_07]: See, she can do that because she's actually Asian.

1275
01:15:22,825 --> 01:15:24,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I do it and I'm a racist.

1276
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:26,408

[SPEAKER_02]: You want to read them?

1282
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:55,723
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1283
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:56,603
[SPEAKER_07]: You think you can do better?

1284
01:15:56,823 --> 01:15:57,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1285
01:15:59,165 --> 01:16:00,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anybody could do better.

1286
01:16:01,066 --> 01:16:01,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1290
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:23,438
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said that, you said destroy all humans and Jews too, but I thought you said Jews too.

1291
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like destroy all humans and Jews too.

1292
01:16:29,163 --> 01:16:31,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, but they're humans too.

1293
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:36,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't even think that would be acceptable in Japan, let alone here.

1294
01:16:37,249 --> 01:16:39,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they get away with some pretty crazy stuff.

1295
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:41,993

1299
01:17:12,853 --> 01:17:13,854

01:17:14,654 --> 01:17:15,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1301
01:17:16,996 --> 01:17:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Zubo?

1302
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:22,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a music game that's from EA.

1303
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:24,522
[SPEAKER_06]: They look like crap.

1304

1327
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:46,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to play that on Rock Band.

1328
01:19:46,227 --> 01:19:48,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It's back in the 90s, Rob.

1329
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:49,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, I hate you.

1330
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where it is.

1331
01:19:52,161 --> 01:20:17,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Warzone wasn't that good from what I remember I actually bought that so it was okay not worth the single though it's a shame finally Lips the karaoke game has some stuff coming out for the rest of this month available actually came out earlier this week when I Grow Up by the Pussycat Dolls

1332
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:42,658
[SPEAKER_06]: you've lost that love and feeling by the Righteous Brothers and Erased Rewind by the Carnigans those all came out on the 16th I love that song next week we've got let's see on the 23rd here Hate That I Love You by Rihanna featuring Neo and Thanks For The Memories by Fall Out Boy

1333
01:20:44,775 --> 01:20:46,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they're so hip that they don't use vowels in there.

1334
01:20:46,657 --> 01:20:49,159
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have Victoria just sing these songs as Loki reads them.

1335
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:50,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, awesome.

1336
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing it anyway.

1337
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:55,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, Look What You've Done by Jet.

1338
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that one.

1339
01:20:58,726 --> 01:21:00,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Look What You've Done.

1340
01:21:00,047 --> 01:21:00,968
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think that's it.

1341
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:04,831
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and then finally on January 30th, Sunday Morning by Maroon 5.

1342
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:08,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that song.

1343
01:21:08,093 --> 01:21:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a Bow by Rihanna and Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men.

1344
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what is up with these random old songs like Belly Feed the Tree?

1345
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:21,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh man, I was so glad that made a comeback.

1346
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:26,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like Boyz II Men, one of their songs that was not even all that popular.

1347
01:21:26,222 --> 01:21:27,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow.

1348
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1349
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:29,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

1350
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:31,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Some comments from chat I gotta read.

1351
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment says, why pay for tracks from Lips when I can steal them from BitTorrent sites, plug in my iPod, and play them for free?

1352
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:41,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not quite the same, and I think these actually come with the videos and stuff.

1353
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:42,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1354
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Leo Shen says, where the fuck is my Love Fool and my favorite game?

1355
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:53,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Love Fool is in SingStar, for whatever it's worth, and it has the original video, not the one they did in the US.

1356
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:54,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the old school one.

1357
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:55,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it, Race and Rewind.

1358
01:21:55,774 --> 01:21:56,154
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good song.

1359
01:21:56,174 --> 01:21:56,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I do too.

1360
01:21:56,795 --> 01:21:59,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my favorite game too, but I don't know what a good karaoke song that would be.

1361
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:05,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more of a, that other series, the racing series had that in one of their ads.

1362
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo?

1363
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:06,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo.

1364
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:07,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1365
01:22:07,382 --> 01:22:07,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Two.

1366
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:09,583
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite game was like in the commercial.

1367
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:11,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a song in the game, wasn't it?

1368
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:12,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1369
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1370
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,921
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite game was also, I think, one of the Euro DDR games.

1371
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:22,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I could be completely wrong on that, but that's a guess.

1372
01:22:22,702 --> 01:22:27,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of awesome music games, this news has me very, very happy.

1373
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:36,284
[SPEAKER_07]: The Harmonix CEO, Alex Rigopoulos, was interviewed with Ars Technica recently, and he has basically professed his love for Amplitude.

1374
01:22:36,704 --> 01:22:37,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember that game.

1375
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:41,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Harmonix, these are the games they did before Guitar Hero, Amplitude and Frequency.

1376
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:46,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he was basically confirming that he does want to eventually revive the series.

1377
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:47,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1378
01:22:47,407 --> 01:22:47,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Excited!

1379
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:48,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

1380
01:22:48,528 --> 01:22:51,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Except the only problem is, Sony actually owns that property.

1381
01:22:52,089 --> 01:22:53,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Harmonix developed it, I guess, for Sony.

1382
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you ain't gonna see this on Xbox.

1383
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:59,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It would probably be like a PlayStation Network type game.

1384
01:23:00,033 --> 01:23:01,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But hell, I don't mind.

1385
01:23:01,793 --> 01:23:04,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see this game make a comeback because, you know, there's certain songs...

1386
01:23:05,635 --> 01:23:07,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That you can only get in these types of games.

1387
01:23:07,118 --> 01:23:09,222
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to get in a rock band type game.

1388
01:23:09,263 --> 01:23:10,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am definitely for this.

1389
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they do it.

1390
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They really need to revive some of those older rhythm games from the 90s and early 2000s.

1391
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:22,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Guitar Freaks, and then they'll make a game called Rock-O.

1392
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:26,745
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, didn't Harmonix also do Karaoke Revolution with Konami?

1393
01:23:26,845 --> 01:23:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: They did.

1394
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:27,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They did.

1395
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:29,426
[SPEAKER_07]: They developed the first couple versions.

1396
01:23:30,107 --> 01:23:35,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And then by the time I think they got to Karaoke Country, I think finally Harmonix split off and Konami did it themselves.

1397
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're not doing Country.

1398
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:37,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

1399
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:39,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that, yeah.

1400
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:40,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1401
01:23:40,172 --> 01:23:41,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly how it went down.

1402
01:23:42,426 --> 01:23:46,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we're going to get into the classic video game of the week.

1403
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:52,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little part of the show where we like to pay homage to a game from yesteryear, a game from the past.

1404
01:23:53,176 --> 01:23:56,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura is not here tonight to do this, so this is the part where Loki and I will fill in.

1405
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, I guess we're going to do your game tonight, because I did it last time.

1406
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:05,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki is going to pick a game for us this week, a classic video game that he thinks...

1407
01:24:06,028 --> 01:24:08,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody out there on the internet who listens to our show should be playing.

1408
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:11,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

1409
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:12,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't know.

1410
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I just came up with one last minute.

1411
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:17,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for me!

1412
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:22,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, I want to pay homage to... It's not even that old.

1413
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:26,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I hate thinking that a PlayStation 1 game is considered retro now.

1414
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:33,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think one of the greatest in this game series, except for maybe...

1415
01:24:33,976 --> 01:24:35,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Twisted Metal Black, but Twisted Metal 2.

1416
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:41,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Twisted Metal 2, as it was known in Europe, as Twisted Metal 2 World Tour.

1417
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:50,440
[SPEAKER_06]: The second game in the Vehicle Combat series, Twisted Metal, still one of my favorite games, and they've remade it a few different times.

1418
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:56,002
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PSP, they had Twisted Metal 2 head-on, or Twisted Metal head-on, I guess it was called.

1419
01:24:56,542 --> 01:25:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, basically this game, very over-the-top, just, you know,

1420
01:25:00,703 --> 01:25:01,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1421
01:25:26,992 --> 01:25:29,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Paris, you can actually destroy the Eiffel Tower.

1422
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:37,116
[SPEAKER_06]: LA, they had some ruins left over, I guess, from the previous Twisted Mel game.

1423
01:25:38,137 --> 01:25:45,720
[SPEAKER_06]: In, let's see here, New York, they had the rooftops, which I think was my favorite map of the entire game there.

1424
01:25:47,221 --> 01:25:49,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Antarctica, Glaciers, Icebergs, Hong Kong Crunch

1425
01:26:02,099 --> 01:26:06,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there was some different characters that were added in the game.

1426
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:12,188
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Sweet Tooth, Dark Tooth, and Minion, which could be unlocked with different codes in the game.

1427
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:22,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Dark Tooth was only playable on the PC version, or if you had a cheat device for the PlayStation 1, you could play Dark Tooth that way, which is kind of cool.

1428
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:28,203
[SPEAKER_06]: and he was a giant ice cream truck.

1429
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:33,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, with a clown on top, because he was Sweet Tooth's father, if I remember correctly.

1430
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:35,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Victoria actually played this game.

1431
01:26:35,852 --> 01:26:37,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard her speak up, going, I remember this game!

1432
01:26:38,755 --> 01:26:45,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because Darktooth was Charlie Kane, and then of course Sweettooth was Needles Kane, and he had the ice cream truck.

1433
01:26:46,021 --> 01:26:56,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other characters, Axel, which was a guy that was trapped in a vehicle, I guess, by his father with two giant tires, and so he was playing that.

1434
01:26:56,409 --> 01:27:05,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Grasshopper, which was a dune buggy, which apparently was Calypso's daughter, and Calypso, of course, was the guy that was running the entire tournament.

1435
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:07,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1436
01:27:08,018 --> 01:27:13,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Grim, which is on a red motorcycle, and he consumes souls.

1437
01:27:13,889 --> 01:27:14,330
[SPEAKER_06]: He's kind of...

1438
01:27:16,223 --> 01:27:17,144
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1439
01:27:38,081 --> 01:27:45,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I think that for Twisted Metal 2, they had some levels that they cut out that they brought back for Twisted Metal head-on.

1440
01:27:46,727 --> 01:27:50,429
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS2 version, they brought some that they had cancelled, actually.

1441
01:27:50,449 --> 01:27:55,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were making, I don't know, more levels for Twisted Metal Black that were added into that game.

1442
01:27:56,113 --> 01:28:01,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of a remake of Twisted Metal 2 and the Twisted Metal Black engine, which is pretty cool.

1443
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:06,072
[SPEAKER_06]: But, unfortunately, we still haven't seen another Twisted Metal game since Black.

1444
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't really count the PSP ones.

1445
01:28:10,694 --> 01:28:19,158
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know, they were talking about remaking, and these are making a new one for PS3, and I think they should do it, because it was probably one of the best series that was on the PlayStation.

1446
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:22,079
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my classic game there.

1447
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:23,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you have it.

1448
01:28:23,059 --> 01:28:26,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Twisted Metal 2, your classic game of the week.

1449
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:26,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good pick.

1450
01:28:27,341 --> 01:28:28,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's old enough.

1451
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,763
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty good for a last minute one, yeah.

1452
01:28:30,783 --> 01:28:31,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was good.

1453
01:28:31,503 --> 01:28:34,885
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's done Dreamcast games, and that was later in PS1.

1454
01:28:34,985 --> 01:28:40,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can tell that I totally remember all the backstory on this, because I totally butchered everything.

1455
01:28:40,108 --> 01:28:40,508
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

1456
01:28:40,528 --> 01:28:41,188
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1457
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:41,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the last minute.

1458
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:42,469
[SPEAKER_07]: You did good.

1459
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: You did good.

1460
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:44,171
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1461
01:28:45,052 --> 01:28:48,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but that doesn't mean the show's over.

1462
01:28:49,318 --> 01:28:50,780
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to take a break, and we'll be back.

1463
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,263
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty more where this came from.

1464
01:28:52,723 --> 01:28:55,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Your calls as well we'll get to a little later on in the show.

1465
01:28:55,467 --> 01:28:57,430
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some more news in the next segment.

1466
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:58,312
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be talking about...

1467
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:03,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Some updates with the Pandora battery, the controversial device for the PSP.

1468
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:05,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Also talk about some other PSP news.

1469
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:06,216
[SPEAKER_07]: We have quite a bit.

1470
01:29:06,596 --> 01:29:10,678
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as a very controversial Nintendo patent that was discovered this week.

1471
01:29:10,718 --> 01:29:13,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something I kind of referred to earlier to try and...

1472
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,821
[SPEAKER_07]: and help those people that are really bad at video games.

1473
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:19,401
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it a good thing or is it going to be a bad thing?

1474
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:20,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1475
01:29:20,962 --> 01:29:28,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, with all the talk about Silent Hill this week, for the live listeners, I'm going to play some music from Silent Hill Games because who doesn't love the Silent Hill music?

1476
01:29:28,843 --> 01:29:33,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But for those of you listening to the podcast, you don't get that because we're not allowed to play copyright music.

1477
01:29:34,005 --> 01:29:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll be right back in just a few seconds for you guys on the podcast.

1478
01:29:36,725 --> 01:29:40,326
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1479
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:51,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast, taping live here on January the 18th of 2009.

1480
01:29:52,036 --> 01:29:56,459
[SPEAKER_07]: To those of you guys who are just tuning in live on allgames.com, thank you guys for tuning in.

1481
01:29:56,499 --> 01:29:57,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's kind of a weird night.

1482
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:58,940
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is not here.

1483
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,481
[SPEAKER_07]: She's on vacation just before school starts.

1484
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:02,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So we brought in two girls to replace her.

1485
01:30:03,243 --> 01:30:03,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1486
01:30:29,301 --> 01:30:30,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's cute.

1487
01:30:30,962 --> 01:30:31,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

1488
01:30:32,222 --> 01:30:32,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1489
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:33,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But no more flirting.

1490
01:30:33,602 --> 01:30:34,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to business.

1491
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:36,823
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back to work here on Orange Launch Radio.

1492
01:30:36,843 --> 01:30:38,744
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got more gaming news to talk about.

1493
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:41,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, we do.

1494
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:43,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, why don't you start us off?

1495
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:43,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

1496
01:30:43,845 --> 01:30:44,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you starting us off?

1497
01:30:44,626 --> 01:30:45,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am.

1498
01:30:45,366 --> 01:30:45,786
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty then.

1499
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:55,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero Metallica has been announced by Metallica that it is coming out in the U.S., or North America, I guess, March 29th.

1500
01:30:56,594 --> 01:30:59,676
[SPEAKER_06]: May, pretty much everywhere else.

1501
01:31:01,357 --> 01:31:12,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, though, is the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions are coming out on the 29th, but the PS2 and the Wii version, though, are coming sometime this spring, most likely early May.

1502
01:31:14,201 --> 01:31:16,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is according to the band's website.

1503
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:29,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, it's going to have Expert Plus, 28 songs from the group's discography, as well as other tracks from Alice in Chains, The Food Fires, Slayer, Machine Head, Queen.

1504
01:31:30,514 --> 01:31:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that what's interesting though this is a little bit late news here but they're going to have a special pre-order bonus actually being done through GameStop which is surprising they're going to be giving away with Guitar Hero Metallica another drum pedal because apparently you're going to need to have two pedals for the kick drum to be able to play some of those songs or you're probably going to want to have two kick pedals

1505
01:32:00,964 --> 01:32:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: First of many.

1506
01:32:01,364 --> 01:32:05,789
[SPEAKER_06]: How long before the series jumps the shark?

1507
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:05,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait.

1508
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:06,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Done!

1509
01:32:19,878 --> 01:32:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Sony is going to be delivering, of course, more PSP and PlayStation 1 old titles on PlayStation Network.

1510
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:26,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

1511
01:32:26,684 --> 01:32:31,388
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a PSP game that just came out, I believe, this week on the PlayStation 3.

1512
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

1513
01:32:34,251 --> 01:32:36,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Jamie spoke very highly of this game when she was here.

1514
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:41,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a put-together compilation of some of the old Ghosts and Goblins titles.

1515
01:32:41,778 --> 01:32:43,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now available for download for $20.

1516
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:44,780
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

1517
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:53,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't play it on the PlayStation 3 because it was a PSP game, but you can use your little transfer device and put it on your PSP if you have a large storage stick for your PSP.

1518
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:54,829
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

1519
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,291
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a large stick.

1520
01:32:56,831 --> 01:32:57,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1521
01:32:58,112 --> 01:32:58,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1522
01:33:01,496 --> 01:33:02,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1523
01:33:22,217 --> 01:33:32,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Light Blue Tool, which is their service mode battery that they've made, is just basically a fancy name for the Pandora battery.

1524
01:33:32,682 --> 01:33:37,185
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically stole the idea for it and decided they were going to put it out.

1525
01:33:37,565 --> 01:33:44,668
[SPEAKER_06]: However, due to legal action by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, they are not able to put out said battery.

1526
01:33:45,309 --> 01:33:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1527
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:48,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they will not be releasing it.

1528
01:33:48,906 --> 01:33:59,649
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's okay, because if you remember that there is an exploit now that's being used that will eventually allow the PSP-3000 to be hacked using GripShift.

1529
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is coming along nicely.

1530
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,191
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have some homebrew games available for it.

1531
01:34:05,851 --> 01:34:09,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And soon enough, a homebrew and firmware loader.

1532
01:34:11,573 --> 01:34:11,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

1533
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:12,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1534
01:34:14,073 --> 01:34:16,034
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think will happen as a result of the lawsuit?

1535
01:34:16,837 --> 01:34:17,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1536
01:34:37,718 --> 01:34:50,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too difficult if you just follow the instructions, but the fact that they were kind of making this and claiming it as their own is kind of a rip-off because they did not come up with this idea.

1537
01:34:51,854 --> 01:34:52,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Dothack Games

1538
01:35:07,929 --> 01:35:10,150
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I think they had two different series.

1539
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:13,591
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the .hack series and there was .hack.gu, which was the later series.

1540
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:19,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Now .hack.link was announced by Famitsu Magazine as coming to the PSP in 2009.

1541
01:35:19,432 --> 01:35:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's going from PlayStation 2 to PSP.

1542
01:35:23,234 --> 01:35:29,755
[SPEAKER_07]: The interesting thing, though, they're saying is that, you know, part of what made .hack kind of interesting is that it was sort of like an MMO, but it wasn't.

1543
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:33,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a single-player experience that was like an MMO, if that makes any sense.

1544
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:34,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, all the characters...

1545
01:35:35,097 --> 01:35:35,998
[SPEAKER_07]: DotHack is making a comeback.

1546
01:35:54,975 --> 01:35:55,395
[SPEAKER_07]: on the PSP

1547
01:36:23,463 --> 01:36:25,924
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the stuff that they were suggesting here.

1548
01:36:27,445 --> 01:36:27,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1549
01:36:28,025 --> 01:36:45,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Possible features include smaller yet retain most of the current PSP screen size, offered social networking functionality in the cross-media bar, included a keyboard for easier internet browsing and communication,

1550
01:36:46,353 --> 01:37:11,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered Bluetooth wireless support for easy pairing with other devices, had a touchscreen, had an improved screen for more dynamic graphic displays, offered the ability to find others near you who want to connect for online gaming, offered an e-comic book or book download service through the PlayStation Network, and included a hard drive for memory storage.

1551
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,162
[SPEAKER_06]: and some other things.

1552
01:37:15,202 --> 01:37:18,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They were also talking about a built-in GPS.

1553
01:37:19,127 --> 01:37:21,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, interesting.

1554
01:37:23,513 --> 01:37:25,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that they're going to do a touchscreen at the next one.

1555
01:37:25,936 --> 01:37:28,359
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of have to at this point, if you think about it.

1556
01:37:30,122 --> 01:37:30,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1557
01:37:30,896 --> 01:37:31,736
[SPEAKER_06]: and Motion Censoring.

1558
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know though if they would just put a touch screen on a new PSP or something like that.

1559
01:37:56,107 --> 01:38:01,894
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these, I mean, other than like social networking, that wouldn't be too bad, or like a book download service.

1560
01:38:02,535 --> 01:38:06,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can do e-books right now through Homebrew stuff, so that could be done now.

1561
01:38:08,823 --> 01:38:13,584
[SPEAKER_06]: and even the ability to find others near you that want to connect for an online game.

1562
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see that as kind of a necessity because that would require a lot of hotspots and stuff like that and it wouldn't really make sense that you would need to know if there's someone nearby to connect with because you're connecting with anybody over the internet.

1563
01:38:28,327 --> 01:38:30,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't really matter.

1564
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:34,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Bluetooth support for like...

1565
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Using, like, say, your 6-axis controller might be kind of cool.

1566
01:38:41,627 --> 01:38:42,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read some comments from the chat room.

1567
01:38:42,928 --> 01:38:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orange.trader.com We've had a lot of PSP different stories.

1568
01:38:45,911 --> 01:38:49,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to kind of read through some of these because lots of diverse comments from our chat.

1569
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:55,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment says, Why is Datel getting sued for selling something that you can hack the PSP with?

1570
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,804
[SPEAKER_07]: People who sell rocks don't get sued for possibly causing car break-ins.

1571
01:38:59,807 --> 01:39:02,468
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is the case with a lot of these companies that get sued, right?

1572
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:10,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it has to do with infringing on some sort of stuff, probably information that was written on the ROM of the battery.

1573
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:15,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the actual batteries that Sony uses actually have data written onto them.

1574
01:39:15,712 --> 01:39:25,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So if, for example, they use that to reverse engineer something to create a program, that would violate copyrights and then they could stop them, I guess.

1575
01:39:26,812 --> 01:39:34,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And also probably, you know, Datel's not really a large company, and Sony is a lot bigger, and they could probably bully them into doing whatever they want.

1576
01:39:35,776 --> 01:39:47,681
[SPEAKER_06]: But more likely the prior, that they actually reverse-engineered something, and because of that, you know, it's not licensed, so they've got to put a stop to it.

1577
01:39:50,154 --> 01:39:52,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, some other things I want to read here.

1578
01:39:52,216 --> 01:40:00,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Giovedea, who's very excited about a new .hack game coming out, says, I wish those fuckers would have brought the actual .hack MMO over, even if it sucked balls.

1579
01:40:01,866 --> 01:40:05,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And X-Link confirms there was a .hack MMO in Japan, but it was shut down.

1580
01:40:06,772 --> 01:40:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: D5T says .hack Link for the PSP is going to be the last game, FYI.

1581
01:40:12,193 --> 01:40:15,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if it's going to... I guess not a series, because all the other .hack games were in series.

1582
01:40:15,515 --> 01:40:18,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the first one had four games, the other one had three.

1583
01:40:18,917 --> 01:40:21,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of weird that this would be a one-off game.

1584
01:40:21,859 --> 01:40:26,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's a lot of game, because .hack got a big... I guess a very cult-type game.

1585
01:40:26,942 --> 01:40:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people who've never heard of these games, but then I think there's enough of our audience who like the anime and all that stuff, too, that I'm sure know about these games and are pretty excited about it.

1586
01:40:33,967 --> 01:40:40,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Monster Hunter, they're trying to basically recreate Monster Hunter over, you know, find anything that would work as a Monster Hunter game, because...

1587
01:40:41,872 --> 01:40:44,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are insanely popular in Japan right now.

1588
01:40:44,774 --> 01:40:46,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the new Monster Hunter game coming out on the Wii.

1589
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to probably take off really well.

1590
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:53,241
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to find more stuff that's kind of similar to Monster Hunter.

1591
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: They try to make their game more like Monster Hunter.

1592
01:40:55,783 --> 01:41:00,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe they'll try to get that same type of appeal that that game had.

1593
01:41:00,546 --> 01:41:02,628
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some other game that they were trying to make like Monster Hunter 2.

1594
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:03,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what it was.

1595
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:07,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other series game that they're changing up.

1596
01:41:08,132 --> 01:41:12,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting speculation in chat, too, by Alpha Cananagram says, maybe .hack//Link has DLC.

1597
01:41:14,412 --> 01:41:15,033
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1598
01:41:41,216 --> 01:41:43,637
[SPEAKER_07]: It was apparently a very popular after school hangout.

1599
01:41:43,757 --> 01:41:47,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It had games, snacks, cards, clothing of all things.

1600
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:51,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was kind of like a little hodgepodge of cool stuff, sounds like, a place for kids to go hang out.

1601
01:41:52,563 --> 01:41:54,805
[SPEAKER_07]: The proprietors were Bob and Gina Pearson.

1602
01:41:55,145 --> 01:42:03,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently a $250 annual tax per machine on these games, they had to get rid of the 10 games that they had.

1603
01:42:04,431 --> 01:42:06,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Glow in the Dark Air Hockey, NASCAR Racing, Ms.

1604
01:42:06,651 --> 01:42:09,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man all bit the dust because of this new tax in the town.

1605
01:42:10,712 --> 01:42:12,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a quote from one of the owners.

1606
01:42:12,933 --> 01:42:17,253
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't renew the licenses because the machines didn't even make what you charge in these astronomical fees.

1607
01:42:17,573 --> 01:42:20,294
[SPEAKER_07]: The game companies tell us this is one of the highest fees in Illinois.

1608
01:42:20,574 --> 01:42:24,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We wonder if the village really researched how big this should be or if they just slapped a number on it.

1609
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:31,876
[SPEAKER_07]: We had become a pretty big hangout for kids after school and weekends but not having the video games this year has made a big impact in just the first two weeks.

1610
01:42:32,956 --> 01:42:43,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently somebody who works for the town told the local news that they set the fee high with the understanding that the game machine distribution companies would actually pay the fees.

1611
01:42:46,064 --> 01:42:51,147
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the proprietors said that only happens when you actually serve alcohol in the establishment.

1612
01:42:51,968 --> 01:42:57,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so what was the purpose of this tax or whatever it was supposed to be?

1613
01:42:57,711 --> 01:42:58,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get money.

1614
01:42:58,792 --> 01:42:59,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, why not?

1615
01:42:59,712 --> 01:43:01,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the most random thing ever.

1616
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and by the way...

1617
01:43:02,694 --> 01:43:03,954
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1618
01:43:24,062 --> 01:43:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Let alone, you know, enough... I don't know of many at all that wouldn't be independently owned.

1619
01:43:28,287 --> 01:43:30,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe at that pool place I've never been to up the street.

1620
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:31,511
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably have some.

1621
01:43:31,591 --> 01:43:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, that's the thing, though.

1622
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:34,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That's random and arbitrary.

1623
01:43:34,414 --> 01:43:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why... Oh, yeah, and all of a sudden, let's just pull this out of our ass.

1624
01:43:37,437 --> 01:43:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something behind it.

1625
01:43:38,499 --> 01:43:38,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it sounds like...

1626
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:39,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1627
01:43:58,493 --> 01:44:14,957
[SPEAKER_02]: you're paying taxes on your revenue that you bring in so why tax it again there has to be something behind it there has to be maybe it was like targeted at that place or something are the places like this where kids like hang out maybe they think they're gonna become like delinquent or something if they spend their time doing that instead of like other stuff

1628
01:44:15,765 --> 01:44:23,496
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, if you read between the lines, there was this way of getting rid of video games in these places so kids go home and do their homework.

1629
01:44:23,877 --> 01:44:24,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, TigerClaw.

1630
01:44:24,698 --> 01:44:25,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of disagree.

1631
01:44:25,579 --> 01:44:31,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of these kids, if they don't have another place to go, they're going to turn to graffiti and murder.

1632
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:33,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

1633
01:44:33,219 --> 01:44:34,119
[SPEAKER_02]: But more of the latter.

1634
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,660
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what I'm talking about?

1635
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:44,682
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in these types of places, it's... Yeah, that's exactly what these establishments are there for.

1636
01:44:44,762 --> 01:44:51,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If parents aren't enforcing their kids to do their homework and stuff, they're going and at least playing video games or something like that.

1637
01:44:51,624 --> 01:44:53,224
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not out on the street or anything.

1638
01:44:53,285 --> 01:44:54,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that's kind of...

1639
01:44:56,226 --> 01:45:02,751
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, kids hanging out at this place is because their parents aren't making them go home and do their homework.

1640
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:06,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're not here at this place hanging out, they'll be somewhere else.

1641
01:45:06,354 --> 01:45:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're not going to be going home.

1642
01:45:07,675 --> 01:45:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to go home.

1643
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:10,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shucks.

1644
01:45:10,117 --> 01:45:10,577
[SPEAKER_07]: No more Ms.

1645
01:45:10,617 --> 01:45:11,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man for me.

1646
01:45:11,318 --> 01:45:12,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll go do homework.

1647
01:45:12,378 --> 01:45:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Good golly, because that's what my brothers and I did.

1648
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Our parents didn't give a shit if we came home and did our homework after school, so we went to the arcade.

1649
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:18,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1650
01:45:20,592 --> 01:45:26,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably would have become druggies and murderous convicts were it not for video games.

1651
01:45:26,476 --> 01:45:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1652
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:28,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just kind of wacky.

1653
01:45:28,818 --> 01:45:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1654
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:32,722
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, so things are going to turn into Jet Set Radio, basically.

1655
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:33,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1656
01:45:33,642 --> 01:45:34,103
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1657
01:45:34,263 --> 01:45:35,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all going to start in Hampshire.

1658
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:39,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all going to strap on rollerblades and go around and spray paint shit.

1659
01:45:40,468 --> 01:45:40,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1660
01:45:41,889 --> 01:45:43,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So, kind of...

1661
01:45:44,653 --> 01:45:45,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of sad.

1662
01:45:45,554 --> 01:45:45,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1663
01:45:46,014 --> 01:45:48,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should try to email these people and get them on the show.

1664
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:51,340
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the types of stories I want to dig into.

1665
01:45:52,688 --> 01:45:57,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be like Call Rob or whatever, not the local show?

1666
01:45:57,909 --> 01:45:59,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the local news and stuff?

1667
01:45:59,549 --> 01:46:00,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

1668
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:04,530
[SPEAKER_07]: All the other shows, they're trying to get the one-up guys and all that on their show.

1669
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:07,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1670
01:46:07,191 --> 01:46:09,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm over all that stuff.

1671
01:46:09,211 --> 01:46:15,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get these little niche stories and get them on the show and talk about why was your town out to screw you?

1672
01:46:15,673 --> 01:46:16,373
[SPEAKER_10]: We want answers.

1673
01:46:16,433 --> 01:46:18,173
[SPEAKER_10]: We demand to know.

1674
01:46:18,773 --> 01:46:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Asking questions, getting answers.

1675
01:46:20,014 --> 01:46:21,214
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never going to leave you with answers.

1676
01:46:22,826 --> 01:46:23,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Rob.

1677
01:46:24,052 --> 01:46:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make an impact.

1678
01:46:25,569 --> 01:46:27,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see.

1679
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

1680
01:46:29,611 --> 01:46:31,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have some other news for us?

1681
01:46:31,452 --> 01:46:31,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe happier news?

1682
01:46:31,972 --> 01:46:37,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this is why they're getting rid of the arcades for games like Mortal Kombat.

1683
01:46:37,595 --> 01:46:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

1684
01:46:38,495 --> 01:46:42,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mortal Kombat killer has gotten 36 years.

1685
01:46:42,657 --> 01:46:50,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Lamar Roberts, the teenager convicted of beating to death a 7-year-old, will be sentenced to 36 years.

1686
01:46:50,141 --> 01:46:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, this happened in 2007,

1687
01:46:54,564 --> 01:46:54,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess...

1688
01:46:56,365 --> 01:47:05,948
[SPEAKER_06]: They beat up Zoe Garcia, a 7-year-old who was described by prosecutors and law enforcement in Greeley, Colorado.

1689
01:47:06,509 --> 01:47:11,150
[SPEAKER_06]: They were beating her up as a reenactment of the fight moves from Mortal Kombat.

1690
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:18,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says Robert and his 17-year-old girlfriend were supposedly supposed to be babysitting the child.

1691
01:47:18,773 --> 01:47:19,973
[SPEAKER_06]: They uppercutted a baby?

1692
01:47:20,053 --> 01:47:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And said the two kicked, hit, and slammed his half-sister to the floor.

1693
01:47:26,563 --> 01:47:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they confuse their babality with a fatality?

1694
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:32,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even joke.

1695
01:47:32,589 --> 01:47:33,129
[SPEAKER_07]: This is terrible.

1696
01:47:33,149 --> 01:47:37,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that is awful, and I probably shouldn't have said that, but wow.

1697
01:47:38,295 --> 01:47:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They must be stupid.

1698
01:47:40,157 --> 01:47:42,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, only 36 years?

1699
01:47:42,819 --> 01:47:44,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Just 36 years?

1700
01:47:44,301 --> 01:47:44,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really?

1701
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:45,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1702
01:47:46,663 --> 01:47:47,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

1703
01:47:47,384 --> 01:47:49,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Are prisons that hard up for cash?

1704
01:47:51,192 --> 01:47:51,913
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX TACO ASSAILANTS

1705
01:48:10,006 --> 01:48:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, apparently law enforcement near Orlando, Florida... This is one of the stories that I've read so far, so it's good.

1706
01:48:16,932 --> 01:48:26,801
[SPEAKER_06]: They have in custody a 19-year-old who refused to stop playing games to join his family for dinner and threw a taco at his mother after she unplugged his Xbox.

1707
01:48:28,083 --> 01:48:34,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, this was reported as a domestic disturbance and is...

1708
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:49,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently there is some name calling that says, seems his mom went upstairs and demanded he stop playing that Sega or Atari or whatever you call it and come down to be a contributing member of the family.

1709
01:48:50,297 --> 01:48:53,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was all, whatever, bitch, she said.

1710
01:48:54,682 --> 01:48:56,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And he flung the tacos.

1711
01:48:56,823 --> 01:48:57,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this for real?

1712
01:48:58,344 --> 01:49:04,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he says they actually have a screen capture from the news thing and he's making a weird little face on it.

1713
01:49:06,848 --> 01:49:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: WFLTV is the news station covering it.

1714
01:49:10,951 --> 01:49:15,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says she was going to let him sit in his jail cell for a few days and teach him a lesson.

1715
01:49:16,914 --> 01:49:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to show no mercy to this kid.

1716
01:49:21,234 --> 01:49:21,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

1717
01:49:22,155 --> 01:49:34,184
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they should do as punishment is make him work at Taco Bell and see what exactly it takes to get in to make a taco because I don't know anybody who's ever worked at Taco Bell that really enjoyed their job.

1718
01:49:34,244 --> 01:49:35,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the quote from Dina.

1719
01:49:36,185 --> 01:49:44,931
[SPEAKER_06]: A few minutes later, Dina says she was in the kitchen cleaning and cooking tacos for dinner when Zachary showed up.

1720
01:49:44,951 --> 01:49:48,794
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when she says he slapped her arm and threw a taco in her face.

1721
01:49:50,015 --> 01:49:51,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I said no fucking tomatoes!

1722
01:49:51,096 --> 01:49:51,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That's taco side!

1723
01:49:51,617 --> 01:49:52,417
[SPEAKER_06]: No one commits taco side!

1724
01:49:52,437 --> 01:49:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I can imagine Eric right now like, nooooo!

1725
01:50:16,522 --> 01:50:19,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and finally, this is a little bit more recent.

1726
01:50:21,224 --> 01:50:25,826
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a 17-year-old Daniel Petrick of Ohio.

1727
01:50:26,126 --> 01:50:32,228
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been found guilty of shooting both of his parents, which led to the death of his mother.

1728
01:50:32,268 --> 01:50:33,889
[SPEAKER_06]: His dad survived.

1729
01:50:34,569 --> 01:50:37,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, he has been found guilty.

1730
01:50:37,591 --> 01:50:41,972
[SPEAKER_06]: This was because they took away Halo from him, Halo 3.

1731
01:50:42,313 --> 01:50:43,513
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a 15-year-old, by the way.

1732
01:50:44,273 --> 01:50:44,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1733
01:50:45,814 --> 01:50:47,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a surprise for you.

1734
01:50:47,216 --> 01:50:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Close your eyes.

1735
01:50:47,897 --> 01:50:48,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And he shot them both in the face.

1736
01:50:48,999 --> 01:50:49,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

1737
01:51:03,021 --> 01:51:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible.

1738
01:51:03,561 --> 01:51:04,121
[SPEAKER_02]: With a taco.

1739
01:51:04,141 --> 01:51:04,822
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

1740
01:51:05,222 --> 01:51:06,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awful.

1741
01:51:06,322 --> 01:51:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so bad.

1742
01:51:08,823 --> 01:51:09,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1743
01:51:09,184 --> 01:51:09,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say this.

1744
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:11,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this is like a horrible story.

1745
01:51:11,304 --> 01:51:14,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go back to the taco thing because this is one we could actually laugh at, right?

1746
01:51:14,646 --> 01:51:15,706
[SPEAKER_07]: The other ones are terrible, right?

1747
01:51:16,046 --> 01:51:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But comments from chat.

1748
01:51:17,627 --> 01:51:21,529
[SPEAKER_07]: D5T says, if I went to jail every time I threw food at my mom.

1749
01:51:22,729 --> 01:51:26,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm thinking, my mom and I did get into a fight over M&M's once when I was younger.

1750
01:51:26,233 --> 01:51:26,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

1751
01:51:26,834 --> 01:51:28,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't throw them, though.

1752
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:28,856
[SPEAKER_02]: You broke the bag.

1753
01:51:28,876 --> 01:51:31,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't throw them, but it was a different story.

1754
01:51:31,499 --> 01:51:34,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Deekman says, I see nothing wrong with tacos getting thrown in my face.

1755
01:51:34,522 --> 01:51:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you open... It could be like a game if you open your mouth trying to catch them.

1756
01:51:37,746 --> 01:51:41,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but here is the huge, huge news.

1757
01:51:42,752 --> 01:51:43,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently...

1758
01:51:44,229 --> 01:51:44,729
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1759
01:52:07,717 --> 01:52:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: and then here's the best part about the Halo murder thing apparently the judge James Burge told the courtroom it's my firm belief as a human being and not just as a jurist that Daniel does suffer from a serious defect of the mind and apparently believes

1760
01:52:27,222 --> 01:52:27,722
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1761
01:52:27,843 --> 01:52:30,304
[SPEAKER_06]: He believes that games are somehow involved.

1762
01:52:30,845 --> 01:52:38,750
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I firmly believe Daniel had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents, they would be dead forever.

1763
01:52:39,891 --> 01:52:45,515
[SPEAKER_06]: That he was so far into the Halo 3 world that he separated himself from reality.

1764
01:52:45,635 --> 01:52:47,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Would he be like that Kali from earlier?

1765
01:52:48,117 --> 01:52:49,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So would they like respawn?

1766
01:52:49,838 --> 01:52:51,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like parents respawn?

1767
01:52:51,379 --> 01:52:53,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be like that Kali from earlier.

1768
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:54,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

1769
01:52:54,542 --> 01:52:55,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It died and came back to life.

1770
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom?

1771
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:06,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, this is... There's a special place in hell where this show is waiting.

1772
01:53:07,053 --> 01:53:10,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who's stupider, that kid or that juror.

1773
01:53:11,555 --> 01:53:12,815
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a judge.

1774
01:53:13,436 --> 01:53:13,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1775
01:53:14,716 --> 01:53:15,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, disbarred.

1776
01:53:17,537 --> 01:53:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.

1777
01:53:19,858 --> 01:53:23,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure that kid's stupid, but I don't know if he's that stupid.

1778
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:25,640
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think he knew exactly what he was doing.

1779
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:25,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1780
01:53:27,182 --> 01:53:30,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But now he figured out, I gotta go to jail forever.

1781
01:53:30,745 --> 01:53:31,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm insane!

1782
01:53:34,589 --> 01:53:35,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't kill me.

1783
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:36,410
[SPEAKER_06]: In the face.

1784
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: In the face.

1785
01:53:40,114 --> 01:53:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1786
01:53:40,554 --> 01:53:41,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what to say.

1787
01:53:41,495 --> 01:53:44,257
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't even really a story about video games at this point.

1788
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:46,319
[SPEAKER_07]: This kid obviously has a ton of issues.

1789
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we just talk about the Taco Kid some more?

1790
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:50,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the Taco Kid's awesome.

1791
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:51,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1792
01:53:53,188 --> 01:53:56,971
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just wanted to point out that, you know, here live in studio.

1793
01:53:57,891 --> 01:53:59,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my titty.

1794
01:53:59,352 --> 01:54:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm now the snickerdoodle assailant.

1795
01:54:02,234 --> 01:54:03,075
Open your mouth.

1796
01:54:03,175 --> 01:54:03,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1797
01:54:03,455 --> 01:54:04,616
[SPEAKER_02]: You messed with my cookie.

1798
01:54:04,656 --> 01:54:05,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick it up and eat it.

1799
01:54:06,377 --> 01:54:07,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been on my boobie.

1800
01:54:07,959 --> 01:54:08,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll eat your cookie.

1801
01:54:09,099 --> 01:54:10,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I threw a snickerdoodle and it hit Irene in the boob.

1802
01:54:10,861 --> 01:54:11,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, eat my cookie, Victoria.

1803
01:54:11,661 --> 01:54:11,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1804
01:54:11,721 --> 01:54:11,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1805
01:54:11,841 --> 01:54:16,585
[SPEAKER_02]: That was going to hurt, too, man.

1806
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1807
01:54:17,105 --> 01:54:18,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it flat.

1808
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:20,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's deliciously painful.

1809
01:54:21,008 --> 01:54:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1810
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:26,275
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, look, we're going to dedicate a certain segment of our show we do here.

1811
01:54:26,415 --> 01:54:26,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you.

1812
01:54:26,956 --> 01:54:36,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to dedicate a certain part of our show here we do every week to these guys who are ruining the image of video gamers everywhere with their stupidity, and it's a segment called the FUs of the Week.

1813
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:56,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we don't have DarkSakura tonight to start us off, we'll let Loki start us off with the FUs of the week today.

1814
01:54:56,902 --> 01:55:03,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Rockstar Games, for making a really crappy port of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC.

1815
01:55:03,385 --> 01:55:08,567
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason whatsoever that the game should work for a while, then all of a sudden just stop.

1816
01:55:08,727 --> 01:55:13,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't install anything, I didn't change anything, it just said, I'm not working no more.

1817
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:19,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And just stopped working, now I reinstall it, I've uninstalled everything, including secure ROM,

1818
01:55:19,492 --> 01:55:45,765
[SPEAKER_06]: all my video drivers every little bit of crap that would possibly affect this game I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it, nothing it's just broken this is bullshit, why should I pay for an actual game and have it not work that's it, never doing it again I am never buying a PC game ever again especially Rockstar Games never again don't do it my FU of the week, if you're done

1819
01:55:46,767 --> 01:55:49,271
[SPEAKER_07]: My few of the week goes to my tooth, because it hurts.

1820
01:55:49,892 --> 01:55:53,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to go to the dentist tomorrow, and I just... I don't like going to the dentist.

1821
01:55:53,056 --> 01:55:54,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've mentioned this on the show before.

1822
01:55:54,258 --> 01:55:57,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like going to a used car salesman, because then they're going to tell me, oh, you need to have this done.

1823
01:55:58,064 --> 01:55:59,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and by the way, you need to get this done.

1824
01:55:59,446 --> 01:56:00,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to replace this crown.

1825
01:56:00,508 --> 01:56:01,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to cost this much money.

1826
01:56:01,449 --> 01:56:01,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like...

1827
01:56:02,236 --> 01:56:04,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you had an awesome dentist, though.

1828
01:56:04,557 --> 01:56:04,817
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1829
01:56:05,037 --> 01:56:05,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that crap.

1830
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:05,978
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1831
01:56:06,878 --> 01:56:07,499
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1832
01:56:07,519 --> 01:56:08,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you want to hear something funny?

1833
01:56:09,099 --> 01:56:09,640
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1834
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:11,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm horrible when it comes to oral hygiene.

1835
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:13,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they tell me to floss.

1836
01:56:13,962 --> 01:56:15,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, I'll floss, and I totally forget.

1837
01:56:16,363 --> 01:56:18,904
[SPEAKER_06]: But, okay, so, yeah, nobody flosses.

1838
01:56:19,224 --> 01:56:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyways, they keep telling me, yeah, you gotta floss because your gums are all, you know, they're gonna get fucked up and that kind of stuff.

1839
01:56:25,428 --> 01:56:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I haven't flossed for years since I saw them last, and they said that it looked better.

1840
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:29,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

1841
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, sure, I've been flossing all the time.

1842
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:34,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, it looks like it's doing a good job.

1843
01:56:34,511 --> 01:56:35,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, they're full of shit.

1844
01:56:35,631 --> 01:56:36,492
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically it.

1845
01:56:36,672 --> 01:56:39,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen more unicorns than people flossing.

1846
01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:41,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, nobody flosses.

1847
01:56:42,173 --> 01:56:45,794
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt wants to point out that his dad's a dentist, but he's not a dentist.

1848
01:56:45,834 --> 01:56:48,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, if I lived in New York City, I would happily go to your dad.

1849
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:51,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I need a friend who's a dentist.

1850
01:56:51,495 --> 01:56:52,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a friend who's a dentist.

1851
01:56:52,696 --> 01:56:52,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1852
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he started his own practice.

1853
01:56:54,596 --> 01:56:57,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go see them because I want to go see somebody I trust.

1854
01:56:58,004 --> 01:57:00,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could go to a dental school.

1855
01:57:01,006 --> 01:57:01,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah.

1856
01:57:01,747 --> 01:57:02,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah.

1857
01:57:02,728 --> 01:57:03,548
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're honest.

1858
01:57:03,588 --> 01:57:04,749
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what poor people do.

1859
01:57:05,329 --> 01:57:06,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

1860
01:57:07,131 --> 01:57:08,512
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we ain't paying for every shit.

1861
01:57:08,552 --> 01:57:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all been there, Victoria.

1862
01:57:09,493 --> 01:57:12,415
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all been there, okay?

1863
01:57:12,435 --> 01:57:13,936
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a young 21 still.

1864
01:57:13,996 --> 01:57:14,937
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in that phase.

1865
01:57:15,177 --> 01:57:17,799
[SPEAKER_10]: A young, beautiful, single 21-year-old gal.

1866
01:57:17,819 --> 01:57:18,900
[SPEAKER_07]: With big titties.

1867
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:19,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1868
01:57:20,381 --> 01:57:21,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Quit trying to pimp me.

1869
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:27,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say there is somebody in chat right now with the nickname that says, I love Victoria.

1870
01:57:28,217 --> 01:57:30,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww, I hurt you too, whoever you are.

1871
01:57:32,983 --> 01:57:34,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so my FU of the week goes to my tooth.

1872
01:57:35,045 --> 01:57:36,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Victoria, do you have any FUs of the week?

1873
01:57:36,607 --> 01:57:40,091
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week is to the person who didn't turn my keys in.

1874
01:57:40,871 --> 01:58:00,444
[SPEAKER_09]: whoever found my keys at work and didn't turn them in because I've been locked out of my apartment for the past three fucking days not really, that's the biggest FU of the week that I have and to my phone that's flashing an evil red color at me because it needs to be charged that's it and RicePrincess, do you have any FUs?

1875
01:58:00,764 --> 01:58:10,051
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, FU to you for hitting my titty you wasted a snickerdoodle you liked it a little bit I'll give it to John when he gets back I'll put it on a plate and say we saved you a snickerdoodle

1876
01:58:11,018 --> 01:58:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, brush off the little bit of dust.

1877
01:58:12,979 --> 01:58:13,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll do.

1878
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, if he ever finds out it touched my boob, he'll die.

1879
01:58:17,261 --> 01:58:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be like, oh my god, I had a woman's breast in my mouth.

1880
01:58:20,883 --> 01:58:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put it back on the plate when no one's looking.

1881
01:58:22,945 --> 01:58:26,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like a game of Russian snickerdoodle roulette.

1882
01:58:28,288 --> 01:58:30,449
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these was on Irene's boobie.

1883
01:58:31,789 --> 01:58:33,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to eat one and take a chance?

1884
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:36,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you want to possibly inadvertently lick her boob?

1885
01:58:38,193 --> 01:58:39,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's not talk about licking my boob.

1886
01:58:40,764 --> 01:58:41,267
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1887
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:43,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's going to do it for the FUs of the Week.

1888
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:44,021
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note...

1889
01:58:44,767 --> 01:58:46,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's get back into some gaming news.

1890
01:58:46,609 --> 01:58:48,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually some big news that came out this week.

1891
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:50,132
[SPEAKER_07]: A patent that was revealed.

1892
01:58:50,252 --> 01:58:53,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is what I was kind of talking to Victoria a little bit about before.

1893
01:58:53,174 --> 01:58:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: She was talking about how video games get too hard and she gets too frustrated and throws a controller, right?

1894
01:58:58,318 --> 01:58:59,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what's interesting.

1895
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:03,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Miyamoto has filed a patent.

1896
01:59:03,923 --> 01:59:12,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if it's him or his company or whatever, but basically Nintendo has filed a patent and it has been discovered for a computable, readable storage medium.

1897
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:12,791
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1898
01:59:13,331 --> 01:59:19,333
[SPEAKER_07]: What the medium is, is basically kind of a hint system.

1899
01:59:19,974 --> 01:59:27,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game that they kind of show pictures of is a work in progress called Legend of OO, which could possibly be a Legend of Zelda game.

1900
01:59:28,417 --> 01:59:29,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the interesting thing.

1901
01:59:29,998 --> 01:59:32,679
[SPEAKER_07]: This patent is very, very, very wordy, kind of goes on.

1902
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:35,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It talks about these different gameplay features that include...

1903
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:45,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Hint videos that are actually already there inside the game that would unlock if you've been stuck on a puzzle for so long, then a hint video will show up.

1904
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:55,238
[SPEAKER_07]: A mode called the Digest, which will actually just show the game's cinematics and gameplay sequences just as a movie, and you can take control at any point you want.

1905
01:59:55,719 --> 02:00:00,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a Scene menu, which lets you choose exactly where you want to go into the story.

1906
02:00:01,124 --> 02:00:08,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like this extreme hybrid of mixing a video game with DVD features, almost.

1907
02:00:08,869 --> 02:00:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting.

1908
02:00:10,930 --> 02:00:19,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just add on to this the fact that Miyamoto has said before that he wants to make Zelda Wii titles more accessible to a broad audience.

1909
02:00:20,055 --> 02:00:24,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Could this actually be something that they are going to implement in a future Zelda title?

1910
02:00:25,489 --> 02:00:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

1911
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:27,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But what do you think of that?

1912
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:31,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is that dumbing down the game too much?

1913
02:00:31,935 --> 02:00:34,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that taking the game out of the video game?

1914
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:46,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of... For us, the hardcore gamers, the gamers who've been playing games all of our life, we're probably not going to be big fans of that.

1915
02:00:46,448 --> 02:00:48,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's going to bring new people into games.

1916
02:00:48,991 --> 02:00:49,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1917
02:00:49,713 --> 02:00:53,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me ask Victoria, even though she's typing away on the laptop at somebody else right now.

1918
02:00:54,895 --> 02:01:00,578
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they had a game, like one of these games you get really frustrated at, but you can just say you throw the controller because it's too hard.

1919
02:01:00,918 --> 02:01:03,439
[SPEAKER_07]: What if suddenly the game said, hey, it looks like you're stuck.

1920
02:01:03,519 --> 02:01:05,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me show you a video of how to get past this part.

1921
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:07,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that make the game more appealing to you?

1922
02:01:08,342 --> 02:01:12,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It would probably help, but I'd probably get annoyed because I wouldn't be able to be like, what the hell?

1923
02:01:12,163 --> 02:01:12,603
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on?

1924
02:01:13,583 --> 02:01:14,343
[SPEAKER_09]: How do I get up there?

1925
02:01:14,363 --> 02:01:15,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1926
02:01:15,303 --> 02:01:20,024
[SPEAKER_09]: That's usually my problem with games is I have to get up somewhere and, you know.

1927
02:01:20,604 --> 02:01:23,465
[SPEAKER_07]: What if the game said, press this button and I'll take you past this point?

1928
02:01:24,145 --> 02:01:24,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'll play.

1929
02:01:24,985 --> 02:01:26,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'll be like, all right, bring it, bitch.

1930
02:01:27,025 --> 02:01:28,245
[SPEAKER_07]: What would draw you to that, though?

1931
02:01:28,285 --> 02:01:30,726
[SPEAKER_07]: What would draw you to play the game if there's no challenge?

1932
02:01:31,566 --> 02:01:32,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1933
02:01:32,566 --> 02:01:33,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I just read something funny.

1934
02:01:34,206 --> 02:01:34,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1935
02:01:35,407 --> 02:01:35,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1936
02:01:35,807 --> 02:01:36,807
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the question?

1937
02:01:38,298 --> 02:01:45,863
[SPEAKER_07]: What would draw, if you could just hit the button and skip that part to get up the ledge or get to where you need to go, you know, fast forward or whatever, what's the draw to the game to you?

1938
02:01:46,244 --> 02:01:57,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I just, I think it'd make it easier for me to play it because I'm not very video game savvy as I've, you know, said already, but I just think it would make it, I think it'd make it easier for me to play it.

1939
02:01:58,353 --> 02:02:06,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, me and the four-year-olds who can't, you know, play video games very well, I'm assuming there are four-year-olds out there who can't play video games very well.

1940
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I think that's the biggest appeal.

1941
02:02:11,162 --> 02:02:13,903
[SPEAKER_09]: You just say, oh, you two can play video games.

1942
02:02:14,203 --> 02:02:17,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be as awesome as Rob or Matt or Irene to play video games.

1943
02:02:17,624 --> 02:02:22,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is funny because people assume because we host this show that we're actually good at video games, but that's so not true.

1944
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:22,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen you play video games.

1945
02:02:23,567 --> 02:02:24,647
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen me play Rock Band.

1946
02:02:25,188 --> 02:02:27,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, he's pretty badass at Rock Band, guys.

1947
02:02:27,489 --> 02:02:28,229
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

1948
02:02:28,249 --> 02:02:28,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1949
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Loki, please.

1950
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:32,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my issue with it.

1951
02:02:33,371 --> 02:02:44,733
[SPEAKER_06]: If the game is designed well in the beginning, you shouldn't have problems figuring out what you need to do because it gradually teaches you the skills in the game that you need to learn and teaches you how to solve different puzzles and then says, go do it.

1952
02:02:45,493 --> 02:02:48,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And you should know how to do it if it's been done right.

1953
02:02:49,274 --> 02:02:56,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're going to put together a game that's poorly done, then yeah, you're going to need this stupid cheat system and stuff.

1954
02:02:56,035 --> 02:03:00,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a waste of time anyways because it would be like showing...

1955
02:03:00,936 --> 02:03:01,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1956
02:03:19,227 --> 02:03:20,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1957
02:03:36,697 --> 02:03:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a horrible idea and I see what they're trying to do because they're still having this dilemma.

1958
02:03:43,323 --> 02:03:48,048
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we sell games to people that only want to play Wii Sports and now Wii Fit?

1959
02:03:48,989 --> 02:03:50,210
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we sell games to them?

1960
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:51,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't know.

1961
02:03:51,311 --> 02:03:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a problem because they're never going to figure this out, this console generation, and they're going to

1962
02:03:57,822 --> 02:04:03,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling they're going to sell millions of systems, but they're not going to sell millions of games.

1963
02:04:03,544 --> 02:04:09,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a problem because the only things they're selling right now are the things that they're making hard to find.

1964
02:04:09,207 --> 02:04:13,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Because trust me, I'm sorry, Mario Kart's been out since last April.

1965
02:04:14,729 --> 02:04:17,330
[SPEAKER_06]: We're coming upon almost a year of it being out.

1966
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,532
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no fucking reason that should be a shortage right now.

1967
02:04:20,672 --> 02:04:22,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game and a goddamn steering wheel.

1968
02:04:22,512 --> 02:04:23,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a piece of plastic.

1969
02:04:24,618 --> 02:04:26,378
[SPEAKER_06]: They make plastic toys like crazy.

1970
02:04:26,519 --> 02:04:27,799
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in supermarkets everywhere.

1971
02:04:27,979 --> 02:04:29,399
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a piece of fucking plastic.

1972
02:04:29,979 --> 02:04:30,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

1973
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:36,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no reason that the stuff is, they're selling out of it because they can't make enough.

1974
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:39,781
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're not making enough on purpose so that there's not enough on the market.

1975
02:04:40,042 --> 02:04:41,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So demand's always high.

1976
02:04:41,522 --> 02:04:42,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are always looking for it.

1977
02:04:43,422 --> 02:04:46,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So Wii Fit's always popular because people think, oh my God, it's out there.

1978
02:04:46,723 --> 02:04:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But once they buy it, like I do, you go, oh my God, I'm not using this thing.

1979
02:04:53,504 --> 02:04:54,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an argument for it.

1980
02:04:55,548 --> 02:04:55,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1981
02:04:55,688 --> 02:04:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1982
02:04:57,572 --> 02:04:58,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, we have...

1983
02:05:00,652 --> 02:05:07,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only strategy guides, but we have a huge website dedicated to, you know, FAQs and walkthroughs and stuff like that.

1984
02:05:07,336 --> 02:05:09,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, obviously, people are going to need help with games.

1985
02:05:10,218 --> 02:05:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why those exist.

1986
02:05:11,579 --> 02:05:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, there are going to be parts of games.

1987
02:05:14,021 --> 02:05:18,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, not every part of every game is hard, but there are going to be very hard parts.

1988
02:05:18,104 --> 02:05:22,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a part in Resident Evil 4 that I just could not get past, and I wish I could have done that.

1989
02:05:22,947 --> 02:05:27,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Just press a button and just gotten through that one small section of the game, and then continued.

1990
02:05:27,450 --> 02:05:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1991
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:36,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally probably would not use it to just skip through every part of the game, but if I have a chance to get through a hard part of the game, bring it on.

1992
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:37,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like it.

1993
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:45,167
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been done before, not necessarily to the fact that there's stuff that you can skip parts of the game, but

1994
02:05:45,808 --> 02:05:46,568
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1995
02:06:16,323 --> 02:06:24,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may turn away people from playing those games, but you're not going to buy the game in the first place if you aren't remotely interested in it.

1996
02:06:24,787 --> 02:06:27,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like someone spoiling the ending for a movie or something.

1997
02:06:28,108 --> 02:06:28,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is...

1998
02:06:30,975 --> 02:06:33,137
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, The Sixth Sense or something like that.

1999
02:06:34,097 --> 02:06:37,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it that his wife doesn't see him?

2000
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,381
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

2001
02:06:38,521 --> 02:06:39,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because he's dead!

2002
02:06:40,022 --> 02:06:40,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoilers!

2003
02:06:41,443 --> 02:06:46,948
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone spoiled that for you so that you figure out the puzzle there, it ruins it.

2004
02:06:47,168 --> 02:06:47,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

2005
02:06:47,849 --> 02:06:56,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, gamers like us, regular gamers that have hand-eye coordination and all that stuff, we're not going to want to skip over the story parts.

2006
02:06:56,475 --> 02:06:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to want to play the game as is.

2007
02:06:58,456 --> 02:06:59,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are people who suck.

2008
02:07:00,257 --> 02:07:02,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Just plain, flat-out suck at video games.

2009
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:05,761
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't make their character jump or whatever.

2010
02:07:06,162 --> 02:07:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't put two and two together.

2011
02:07:07,823 --> 02:07:09,184
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want to be kind of like a...

2012
02:07:09,884 --> 02:07:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2013
02:07:29,014 --> 02:07:43,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say my piece because I haven't said anything on this yet and I haven't stated my opinion and you know I'm one of Nintendo's biggest critics as of like 2008 and everything Nintendo's kind of been pissing me off a lot lately that being said I actually think this is a really good idea

2014
02:07:45,691 --> 02:07:49,856
[SPEAKER_07]: For Nintendo and its audience, I think this is a really good idea.

2015
02:07:50,557 --> 02:07:54,962
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as they make a feature to turn it off and you hit the nail on the head.

2016
02:07:55,282 --> 02:07:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly what I was thinking.

2017
02:07:56,344 --> 02:08:02,051
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for those people that like to watch other people play video games because they're too intimidated.

2018
02:08:02,111 --> 02:08:03,733
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to really play them themselves.

2019
02:08:04,113 --> 02:08:09,537
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the fact that they feel like they suck at video games, they can't get past these hard parts, they want to just get past this stuff.

2020
02:08:09,557 --> 02:08:21,286
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a game like Zelda, especially, that has such pretty awesome cinematics, these things that you get into, the towns, and the story behind these games, I think it actually is going to work really well.

2021
02:08:21,666 --> 02:08:32,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think about how many times we've kind of hoped that there was a game like Final Fantasy X or something, where you could just like, I don't want to grind, I don't want to do this dungeon, I just want to run past all the monsters,

2022
02:08:33,115 --> 02:08:40,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to equip the run boots on my character so I can just run really fast through the dungeon so I don't have to grind here because I just want to get to the next part of the story.

2023
02:08:41,083 --> 02:08:44,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many games I've quit because I couldn't get past one certain part?

2024
02:08:45,187 --> 02:08:46,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Alundra.

2025
02:08:46,749 --> 02:08:48,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that game pissed me off.

2026
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:52,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent so long trying to do one puzzle I could just never get it so I quit the game.

2027
02:08:52,935 --> 02:08:53,676
[SPEAKER_07]: My thing though is

2028
02:08:55,818 --> 02:09:03,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as we start to blur the line even more and more as games become more and more realistic between games and movies, this actually kind of seems like a logical progression to me.

2029
02:09:04,244 --> 02:09:07,145
[SPEAKER_07]: These video games are slowly becoming Blu-ray movies, in a way.

2030
02:09:07,526 --> 02:09:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fascinating.

2031
02:09:08,947 --> 02:09:17,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, for the hardcore gamers, that can be a little off-putting at first, but I don't think this necessarily means that games that you and I enjoy are going to go away.

2032
02:09:17,732 --> 02:09:20,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is just something they're going to start in Nintendo.

2033
02:09:20,894 --> 02:09:22,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a very Nintendo thing to do.

2034
02:09:22,295 --> 02:09:23,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not surprising at all.

2035
02:09:23,115 --> 02:09:23,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry, Matt.

2036
02:09:24,537 --> 02:09:27,979
[SPEAKER_06]: My thing is, is that a fault of the fact that you can't finish something?

2037
02:09:28,019 --> 02:09:32,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a fault of the person or is that a fault of the game design?

2038
02:09:32,803 --> 02:09:34,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a fault of the game design.

2039
02:09:34,705 --> 02:09:37,267
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that they made that many random battles.

2040
02:09:37,507 --> 02:09:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they've tweaked it in future Final Fantasy games where there aren't that many random battles.

2041
02:09:43,232 --> 02:09:45,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've gone back and fixed different things like that.

2042
02:09:46,254 --> 02:09:48,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people complained about it and they listened to it.

2043
02:09:48,356 --> 02:09:49,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that necessarily...

2044
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:55,737
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bad thing that there should be some difficulty in there because it makes it worthwhile to figure it out.

2045
02:09:55,777 --> 02:10:00,979
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to just go from story to story to story, seriously, go read a book.

2046
02:10:00,999 --> 02:10:01,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Go watch a movie.

2047
02:10:01,839 --> 02:10:04,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, but they're making it an option for you.

2048
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:06,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, work at it.

2049
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:10,401
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want a sense of accomplishment from beating this game, do it normal.

2050
02:10:10,501 --> 02:10:12,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those people who don't want to, they're giving them the option.

2051
02:10:12,902 --> 02:10:18,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a problem, though, with someone pushing a button, having the game play itself, beginning to end, and just...

2052
02:10:19,984 --> 02:10:20,444
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the point?

2053
02:10:20,704 --> 02:10:23,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what you can't do with a movie, Loki.

2054
02:10:23,805 --> 02:10:25,206
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be some people like this.

2055
02:10:25,466 --> 02:10:31,928
[SPEAKER_07]: All they're going to do in a Zelda game is go around and talk to the villagers and then fast forward through the action sequences and dungeons of the game.

2056
02:10:32,228 --> 02:10:40,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to feel like a part of the game and they feel that more emotional attachment because it was more interactive and they just walked around and talked to villagers and that's all they ever did.

2057
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:42,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be like, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

2058
02:10:42,091 --> 02:10:43,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what's also awesome about that?

2059
02:10:43,651 --> 02:10:47,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that they're going to be done with the game now and they have to buy something else.

2060
02:10:48,673 --> 02:10:51,014
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their own choice.

2061
02:10:51,094 --> 02:10:52,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their prerogative.

2062
02:10:52,075 --> 02:10:53,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do that if they want to.

2063
02:10:54,056 --> 02:10:58,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can go on to themoviespoiler.net and look at the ending to all your movies without having to pay $100.

2064
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:00,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

2065
02:11:00,119 --> 02:11:01,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say this here and now.

2066
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:05,282
[SPEAKER_06]: This game, whenever it does come out with this feature, I'm not buying it.

2067
02:11:05,622 --> 02:11:06,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

2068
02:11:06,603 --> 02:11:11,265
[SPEAKER_06]: This feature right here ruined it for me, and the fact that they're putting it in this game, I am not buying this game.

2069
02:11:11,365 --> 02:11:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it's optional?

2070
02:11:12,786 --> 02:11:15,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit, I'm not buying it.

2071
02:11:36,775 --> 02:11:42,899
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been plenty of kids, plenty of people that have figured out the Xbox controllers, figured out the PlayStation 2 controllers.

2072
02:11:42,979 --> 02:11:44,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to meet them.

2073
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:46,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Figured out how to use the Wii Remote.

2074
02:11:46,281 --> 02:11:48,183
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people that still don't know how to use the Wii Remote.

2075
02:11:48,343 --> 02:11:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you come out with a game that's one fucking controller that's a big giant button that says, push me, and even then they're not going to figure it out.

2076
02:11:56,048 --> 02:11:58,510
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to throw it on the floor and go, I don't know how to play this.

2077
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: These people do not need to be playing games.

2078
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:03,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't care if you want to introduce them in the games.

2079
02:12:03,493 --> 02:12:06,595
[SPEAKER_06]: They think they need to be playing games, but they do not need to be playing games.

2080
02:12:06,937 --> 02:12:09,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep them away from my goddamn games!

2081
02:12:11,058 --> 02:12:11,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We 2.0, push me

2082
02:12:41,202 --> 02:12:42,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Rice Princess.

2083
02:12:42,563 --> 02:12:50,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I was just gonna say, I, the way I see it, I liken it to, um, having an easy, normal, and hard mode in a game.

2084
02:12:50,908 --> 02:12:54,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you just, there's gonna be, like, dumb fuck mode, you know?

2085
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:58,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, don't know how to do anything in the game, just gonna watch it play itself.

2086
02:12:58,092 --> 02:12:58,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, you know.

2087
02:12:58,713 --> 02:12:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another mode.

2088
02:12:59,253 --> 02:13:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised it's the Wii, you know, great.

2089
02:13:01,715 --> 02:13:04,656
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna have this feature, but I bet you anything they're gonna be able to turn it off.

2090
02:13:04,736 --> 02:13:05,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know why?

2091
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:09,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's a feature, and Nintendo doesn't add features that people want.

2092
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:10,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so...

2093
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:15,001
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting back into that Matt we don't need to have that argument on this show no seriously

2094
02:13:16,084 --> 02:13:18,245
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to have it.

2095
02:13:18,365 --> 02:13:18,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2096
02:13:19,606 --> 02:13:22,067
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a second half to this I want Loki to get into here.

2097
02:13:22,087 --> 02:13:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's a second half.

2098
02:13:23,127 --> 02:13:28,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the game developers were asked to comment on this.

2099
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:30,310
[SPEAKER_06]: They have different things.

2100
02:13:30,750 --> 02:13:35,032
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Ben Matz from Ubisoft.

2101
02:13:35,152 --> 02:13:36,973
[SPEAKER_06]: He was saying he read through it quickly.

2102
02:13:37,413 --> 02:13:39,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Not surely they fully understand the...

2103
02:13:41,055 --> 02:13:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2104
02:14:07,819 --> 02:14:13,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of interesting because Ubisoft kind of already started going this direction where, you know, you don't die.

2105
02:14:13,644 --> 02:14:14,725
[SPEAKER_07]: The chick always saves you.

2106
02:14:15,305 --> 02:14:18,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And in every battle, at least that I've played so far, it pretty much tells you how to fight it.

2107
02:14:19,148 --> 02:14:21,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just press buttons and it does cool stuff.

2108
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:23,732
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, it's not a bad game.

2109
02:14:23,832 --> 02:14:24,473
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not.

2110
02:14:24,553 --> 02:14:25,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of fun with the new Prince of Persia.

2111
02:14:27,731 --> 02:14:28,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I read this in chat real quick?

2112
02:14:28,912 --> 02:14:29,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, this is too good.

2113
02:14:30,054 --> 02:14:40,589
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, I guess talking about getting irritated at games, my face turns beet red, I throw my controller on the ground, start swearing, fucking game, long chains, swear to never play a shooting game again.

2114
02:14:41,069 --> 02:14:43,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And SakuraMax follows up and says, and then you throw a taco at someone.

2115
02:14:47,403 --> 02:14:54,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd Howard from Bethesda says that most people stop playing certain games because they get frustrated or confused by what the game wants them to do.

2116
02:14:54,685 --> 02:14:58,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes work and frustration as opposed to playtime.

2117
02:14:59,087 --> 02:15:01,267
[SPEAKER_06]: This idea clearly tries to alleviate that.

2118
02:15:01,687 --> 02:15:07,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much like passing the controller to someone that knows the game really well so that you can move ahead or simply enjoy the story.

2119
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:12,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a classic challenge or entertain issue that designers will often deal with.

2120
02:15:17,584 --> 02:15:34,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then finally, uh, let's see here, Jonathan Blow from, um, the creator of Braid says, based on just reading your posting, I don't know, I mean, it's an okay idea for a developer to have a way to show you through various parts of the game, I guess, to show you the side quests that you missed or whatever.

2121
02:15:34,863 --> 02:15:38,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see someone try that, uh, but as a general, um...

2122
02:15:39,708 --> 02:15:40,128
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

2123
02:15:40,168 --> 02:15:40,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Paradigm.

2124
02:15:41,089 --> 02:15:43,830
[SPEAKER_06]: For playing games, there are a lot of problems.

2125
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:46,351
[SPEAKER_06]: The defining characteristics of a game is that you play it.

2126
02:15:46,491 --> 02:16:03,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And if in order for games to be accessible to a wide audience, we need to make sure that so that most people can skip over the playing part of it, then what that really means is that our medium sucks.

2127
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have...

2128
02:16:06,809 --> 02:16:15,052
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have to elude the basic property of your medium to make experiences in the medium desirable, then the medium itself is questionable at a very deep level.

2129
02:16:16,553 --> 02:16:18,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently our stream went down for the live listeners.

2130
02:16:18,874 --> 02:16:23,396
[SPEAKER_07]: The podcast listeners won't notice the thing because we've been recording the whole time, but our stream went down in the middle of you reading that.

2131
02:16:24,316 --> 02:16:25,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's going on tonight.

2132
02:16:25,256 --> 02:16:27,477
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some weird things with our internet stream.

2133
02:16:28,358 --> 02:16:31,939
[SPEAKER_07]: But somebody in the chat room had to say, who threw a taco at the stream?

2134
02:16:33,379 --> 02:16:34,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's never going to get old.

2135
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to derail the other thing you're talking about.

2136
02:16:37,443 --> 02:16:41,326
[SPEAKER_07]: The live listeners didn't even hear what you were just saying, which is unfortunate.

2137
02:16:42,327 --> 02:16:43,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of some varied opinions from developers.

2138
02:16:46,294 --> 02:16:50,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, definitely it's all over the place, but I think it's something that's only going to be used in Nintendo games anyway.

2139
02:16:50,597 --> 02:16:52,198
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that they're requiring, I don't think.

2140
02:16:52,319 --> 02:16:56,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if any of these developers are secretly already working on something for this new system.

2141
02:16:56,261 --> 02:16:57,362
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm curious about.

2142
02:16:57,382 --> 02:16:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it.

2143
02:16:58,423 --> 02:16:59,944
[SPEAKER_07]: You think this is a Nintendo-only thing?

2144
02:17:00,164 --> 02:17:04,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is something they're going to push, and it's probably going to be one game, and I don't think you'll see it ever again.

2145
02:17:05,568 --> 02:17:15,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't think... I mean, honestly, with this in here, the problem is if this is... We're expecting this to be implemented in a Zelda game.

2146
02:17:16,525 --> 02:17:21,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, are you going to be able to tell what kind of an impact this had on a Zelda game?

2147
02:17:21,867 --> 02:17:25,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is a title that's going to sell like crazy anyways.

2148
02:17:26,169 --> 02:17:31,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would think that they would want this something on, you know, something that doesn't sell very well.

2149
02:17:31,591 --> 02:17:33,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even Mario Galaxy didn't sell that well.

2150
02:17:33,992 --> 02:17:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe something like that is where we can see an actual impact on this.

2151
02:17:36,913 --> 02:17:40,474
[SPEAKER_06]: But with Zelda, it's just going to sell like crazy and be like, oh, it worked.

2152
02:17:40,674 --> 02:17:42,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, it's just stupid.

2153
02:17:43,655 --> 02:17:43,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2154
02:17:44,116 --> 02:17:44,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's...

2155
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to sell tons of copies anyways because people are dumb and they'll buy whatever people tell them is good.

2156
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:56,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And Zelda is going to get tens out of ten because...

2157
02:17:57,776 --> 02:17:58,236
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good franchise.

2158
02:17:58,256 --> 02:18:00,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's fanboys out there that are reviewing that stuff.

2159
02:18:00,958 --> 02:18:05,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though, like, you know, Twilight Princess, in my opinion, I don't think that's a 10 out of 10 game.

2160
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not even an 9 out of 10 game.

2161
02:18:06,802 --> 02:18:07,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

2162
02:18:07,943 --> 02:18:09,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first Zelda game.

2163
02:18:10,225 --> 02:18:11,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the GameCube one.

2164
02:18:11,626 --> 02:18:13,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the, not the GameCube, the Nintendo 64 ones.

2165
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:15,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't care for it too much either.

2166
02:18:15,348 --> 02:18:20,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But the... I just was not interested.

2167
02:18:20,772 --> 02:18:22,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It just didn't hold my interest in...

2168
02:18:23,843 --> 02:18:26,204
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sad because I'm really interested in the Zoli games.

2169
02:18:26,744 --> 02:18:30,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they don't have an objective perspective on the game.

2170
02:18:30,384 --> 02:18:31,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's it.

2171
02:18:31,945 --> 02:18:32,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfectly.

2172
02:18:32,585 --> 02:18:34,165
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's going to be like Grand Theft Auto.

2173
02:18:34,325 --> 02:18:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 10 out of 10.

2174
02:18:35,025 --> 02:18:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Gears of War, 10 out of 10.

2175
02:18:37,606 --> 02:18:39,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they don't even have to work on it anymore.

2176
02:18:39,346 --> 02:18:39,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's guaranteed.

2177
02:18:40,047 --> 02:18:40,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what you do.

2178
02:18:40,847 --> 02:18:45,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You build up a franchise and you get to the point where it's like, you know, you can do whatever and people are still going to buy it.

2179
02:18:45,028 --> 02:18:45,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2180
02:18:45,588 --> 02:18:45,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.

2181
02:18:46,548 --> 02:18:47,089
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, then.

2182
02:18:47,129 --> 02:18:48,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out some emails from the listeners.

2183
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:48,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2184
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:48,510
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2185
02:19:14,045 --> 02:19:19,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week we invite you to send us emails at mailbag at orangelunchradio.com and usually DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads the emails.

2186
02:19:19,709 --> 02:19:22,251
[SPEAKER_07]: However, she's not here tonight, so I am filling in.

2187
02:19:22,631 --> 02:19:27,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually have quite a few emails tonight, so I want to try and get through these as fast as I can.

2188
02:19:28,355 --> 02:19:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read this first email.

2189
02:19:29,515 --> 02:19:30,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Chaz.

2190
02:19:30,996 --> 02:19:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR gang.

2191
02:19:33,038 --> 02:19:35,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a long-time listener of the show, but it's my first time writing in.

2192
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:39,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I listen to you all every Monday at my desk while hard at work here in the frozen tundra known as Chicago.

2193
02:19:40,243 --> 02:19:43,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I listen to a lot of the other video game podcasts out there, and OLR is by far the best.

2194
02:19:44,025 --> 02:19:44,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

2195
02:19:45,365 --> 02:19:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have much to say in the way of video games today, but consider this my love letter to the show.

2196
02:19:49,467 --> 02:19:51,027
[SPEAKER_07]: How hard does OLR rock?

2197
02:19:51,107 --> 02:19:51,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me count the ways.

2198
02:19:52,228 --> 02:19:54,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, real gamers with real opinions.

2199
02:19:54,268 --> 02:19:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing commercial here.

2200
02:19:55,449 --> 02:19:55,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2201
02:19:55,749 --> 02:19:56,849
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the things we pride ourselves on.

2202
02:19:56,869 --> 02:20:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're definitely not commercial, based on the comments and, like, crap that we... Brought to you by Nintendo.

2203
02:20:03,111 --> 02:20:05,252
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, have you checked out GameTap this week?

2204
02:20:05,332 --> 02:20:05,732
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just kidding.

2205
02:20:06,232 --> 02:20:08,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, awesome segments.

2206
02:20:08,373 --> 02:20:10,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic Game of the Week and FUs of the Week rock my world.

2207
02:20:10,934 --> 02:20:11,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

2208
02:20:12,274 --> 02:20:14,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, good friends with great chemistry.

2209
02:20:14,115 --> 02:20:19,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki with his blistering honesty, Jamie's hilarious interludes, and Rob's fun-loving and sincere take on gaming culture.

2210
02:20:20,518 --> 02:20:24,139
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just a few of the reasons I am and will continue to be an OLR fanboy.

2211
02:20:24,339 --> 02:20:27,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, on a personal note, I'd like to give a special shout-out to Rob.

2212
02:20:28,843 --> 02:20:39,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's so great and so important to have an openly gay gamer's voice being heard in the community.

2213
02:20:39,768 --> 02:20:51,453
[SPEAKER_07]: As a gay man myself, you know as well as I do how severely underrepresented and occasionally maligned gay sexuality has been portrayed through the games we've played and how rampant homophobia continues to be in the online gaming sphere.

2214
02:20:52,053 --> 02:20:54,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for letting listeners know your stand on these issues.

2215
02:20:54,995 --> 02:20:59,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It means a lot to me and also to those who are unable for whatever reason to speak up for themselves.

2216
02:20:59,559 --> 02:21:00,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great work.

2217
02:21:00,259 --> 02:21:01,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, is he single?

2218
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And not a minor?

2219
02:21:03,101 --> 02:21:03,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Shush.

2220
02:21:04,222 --> 02:21:04,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Shush.

2221
02:21:05,483 --> 02:21:06,924
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was very nice.

2222
02:21:07,725 --> 02:21:12,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's letters like those that make me feel good about doing this show for free for seven years.

2223
02:21:13,109 --> 02:21:13,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly.

2224
02:21:13,809 --> 02:21:14,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Tear, tear.

2225
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:17,532
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, when one says it's right, it's tough.

2226
02:21:17,732 --> 02:21:19,574
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really tough sometimes because, you know.

2227
02:21:19,594 --> 02:21:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so hard.

2228
02:21:20,274 --> 02:21:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I'm saying, you know, the nice thing is being gay is getting more and more accepted.

2229
02:21:26,117 --> 02:21:26,798
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting there.

2230
02:21:26,938 --> 02:21:31,840
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, even though Prop 8 in California didn't pass, it was just, yeah, I know, I know, Victoria, don't get me started.

2231
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:36,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very slim margin compared to Prop 22 of several years ago.

2232
02:21:37,083 --> 02:21:37,783
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting there.

2233
02:21:37,844 --> 02:21:40,885
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, more and more, especially in the youth, no more gay people, what have you.

2234
02:21:41,325 --> 02:21:44,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's funny because in the gay world, it's like, oh, you play video games?

2235
02:21:45,408 --> 02:21:46,448
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a kid thing.

2236
02:21:46,468 --> 02:21:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why don't you listen to Madonna or do fashion shows?

2237
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:51,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, seriously, you know, like, it's hard.

2238
02:21:52,132 --> 02:22:01,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there was a long time where I didn't feel comfortable when I met guys for the first time, like, telling them, yeah, I do an online radio show about video games on the weekends because it's like, whoa, nerd alert, but now I don't give a shit.

2239
02:22:02,919 --> 02:22:10,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm to that point where I've kind of seen there's enough out there that, you know, there's people out there that

2240
02:22:12,102 --> 02:22:15,143
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to like me for both elements, if that makes sense.

2241
02:22:16,623 --> 02:22:18,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I don't want to get too into it.

2242
02:22:18,724 --> 02:22:19,824
[SPEAKER_02]: We can relate to you, Rob.

2243
02:22:20,064 --> 02:22:20,364
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

2244
02:22:20,884 --> 02:22:31,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Because girl gamers, I mean, like, you know, a lot of them are kind of, I guess, not really tomboyish, but they kind of shun, like, female convention.

2245
02:22:31,807 --> 02:22:37,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not all of them are bottle blondes that get their nails done every day and wear a lot of makeup, so it's kind of the same.

2246
02:22:38,969 --> 02:22:39,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting perspective.

2247
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:40,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2248
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:41,130
[SPEAKER_07]: True, true.

2249
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:43,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to another email.

2250
02:22:43,971 --> 02:22:49,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And, okay, this kind of ties into a story we reported on earlier, but obviously we weren't here last week.

2251
02:22:50,313 --> 02:22:55,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator writes in, Hey everyone, I thought I'd email you folks about some news that I received the other day that you might want to share.

2252
02:22:56,194 --> 02:23:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I have heard via both 1up.com, Greenspeak.com, and G4 that Ziff Davis has sold the 1up network of sites along with EGM to UGO, not to be confused with Yu-Gi-Oh!, for some undisclosed sum.

2253
02:23:07,638 --> 02:23:09,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Subsequently, Yu-Gi-Oh!

2254
02:23:09,198 --> 02:23:10,499
[SPEAKER_07]: is, now I want to say Yu-Gi-Oh!,

2255
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:17,042
[SPEAKER_07]: has fired approximately 30 1UP employees, including some of the more well-known and popular personalities.

2256
02:23:17,462 --> 02:23:26,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, EGM has been officially killed off, and although no one mentioned them specifically, it looks like the audio and video podcasts have been axed as well, including 1UP FM, Retronauts, and so on and so on.

2257
02:23:26,626 --> 02:23:30,027
[SPEAKER_07]: On a personal note, I really feel bad for those that got the ax earlier this week.

2258
02:23:30,347 --> 02:23:38,411
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones I recognize, I know they produce top-notch material, whether it be for the sites, podcasts, or the magazines, and inject their own personality into said material to keep it from going stale.

2259
02:23:38,951 --> 02:23:46,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope for the best for them, but given the particularly craptastic economy as of late, I'm afraid there's the potential they may leave the video games journalism biz.

2260
02:23:46,356 --> 02:23:48,618
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the case, the industry would suffer a great loss.

2261
02:23:48,998 --> 02:23:52,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, it really sickens me that they killed off EGM, a long as hell running magazine.

2262
02:23:53,201 --> 02:23:57,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it bad enough that OPM was killed in 06 and Game for Windows earlier this year?

2263
02:23:57,944 --> 02:24:01,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, websites are fine and dandy, but magazines still have a place though.

2264
02:24:01,486 --> 02:24:03,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Case in point, which would you rather bring to the can?

2265
02:24:03,547 --> 02:24:04,728
[SPEAKER_07]: A mag or a laptop?

2266
02:24:04,848 --> 02:24:05,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Or worse, yes, a desktop.

2267
02:24:06,049 --> 02:24:07,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, it's like this guy read my mind from earlier.

2268
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:08,391
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

2269
02:24:09,631 --> 02:24:14,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only that, but for some people such as myself, we like the feel of holding a mag in our hands.

2270
02:24:27,159 --> 02:24:36,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, I still have every single solitary issue of OPM, original PlayStation Magazine, all 112 and every single issue of EGM since my OPM subscription rolled over to EGM.

2271
02:24:37,086 --> 02:24:38,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering, what are your opinions on this?

2272
02:24:38,947 --> 02:24:45,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that based on user-generated comments on various sites, blogs, etc., that most people are uber-pissed and vowed never to visit 1up.com again.

2273
02:24:45,732 --> 02:24:49,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, what other podcasts, websites, and mags would you recommend to fill the void?

2274
02:24:49,455 --> 02:24:56,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I want to avoid GameSpot because of their reputation and credibility has been severely tarnished early last year over that Army of Two firing debacle.

2275
02:24:58,464 --> 02:24:59,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the email.

2276
02:24:59,345 --> 02:25:09,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show, but the point that he brought up that I thought was interesting was that last paragraph was based on everybody complaining, vowing never to visit 1up.com and all this stuff again.

2277
02:25:10,717 --> 02:25:11,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

2278
02:25:11,557 --> 02:25:14,858
[SPEAKER_07]: EGM has really gone through a lot of changes since the beginning.

2279
02:25:14,918 --> 02:25:17,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a lot of people that worked there in the first couple years work there now?

2280
02:25:18,019 --> 02:25:19,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very few.

2281
02:25:19,579 --> 02:25:23,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that because most of the people working at 1up.com were in their early 30s or late 20s.

2282
02:25:24,001 --> 02:25:27,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So they would have been like teenagers when the magazines first came out.

2283
02:25:27,962 --> 02:25:28,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2284
02:25:29,682 --> 02:25:33,365
[SPEAKER_07]: These magazines have already changed the guards a few times.

2285
02:25:33,565 --> 02:25:45,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question back to you guys is, yes, these guys integrated their personalities into the show and everything, which in turn probably ended up being bad for 1up.com because this would have never happened had they never had those podcasts.

2286
02:25:45,593 --> 02:25:46,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about it.

2287
02:25:46,473 --> 02:25:50,496
[SPEAKER_07]: If they never had those podcasts, if they never built up that personality, it's kind of like a double-edged sword.

2288
02:25:50,836 --> 02:25:54,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably really helped sell their site, but at the same time, now they're having to deal with this.

2289
02:25:54,539 --> 02:25:57,341
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you'd never really gotten to know those writers as well as you did?

2290
02:25:57,741 --> 02:25:59,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you have cared so much about this news?

2291
02:26:00,103 --> 02:26:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting.

2292
02:26:01,305 --> 02:26:03,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I bet this kind of stuff has happened before.

2293
02:26:03,568 --> 02:26:08,777
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't care because you didn't feel that connection to them from reading their Twitters, looking at their podcasts, so on and so on.

2294
02:26:10,039 --> 02:26:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2295
02:26:11,394 --> 02:26:12,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2296
02:26:30,086 --> 02:26:30,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

2297
02:26:46,448 --> 02:26:47,409
[SPEAKER_07]: There's what?

2298
02:26:47,549 --> 02:26:49,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamercast Network, I think they're called.

2299
02:26:49,951 --> 02:26:51,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you like Xbox.

2300
02:26:51,212 --> 02:26:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a lot of Xbox-centric shows over there.

2301
02:26:53,533 --> 02:26:55,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Look for some of the networks of shows.

2302
02:26:55,234 --> 02:27:00,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's kind of what 1UP was, was a network, except it was a little different because they were all still produced in-house.

2303
02:27:00,998 --> 02:27:05,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas, I think in the case of all games, Gamercast and whatever other networks you can think of.

2304
02:27:06,182 --> 02:27:06,622
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the other one?

2305
02:27:06,642 --> 02:27:07,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Platform Nation, I think, is another one.

2306
02:27:10,424 --> 02:27:11,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Evil Avatar a network?

2307
02:27:11,865 --> 02:27:12,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know off the top of my head.

2308
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:15,408
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, all these kind of networks are

2309
02:27:16,948 --> 02:27:19,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the difference is that 1UP produced all those in-house.

2310
02:27:19,449 --> 02:27:23,630
[SPEAKER_07]: These are more, everybody produces their own little silo show and they come together on these networks.

2311
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:26,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, check out.

2312
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:30,631
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of people that love games that would love to talk about them with you out there on the internets.

2313
02:27:31,171 --> 02:27:35,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And, obviously, if you still feel connected to the 1UP guys, it sounds like they're doing their own show.

2314
02:27:35,712 --> 02:27:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So, maybe it'll last for them.

2315
02:27:37,673 --> 02:27:38,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2316
02:27:40,339 --> 02:27:40,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2317
02:27:41,521 --> 02:27:44,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Platform Nation is the... I said them right?

2318
02:27:44,807 --> 02:27:45,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

2319
02:27:45,308 --> 02:27:45,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

2320
02:27:48,411 --> 02:27:53,793
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, just for the live listeners only, and I apologize, I'm too lazy to edit this kind of stuff out of the podcast.

2321
02:27:54,494 --> 02:27:56,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the stream is skipping now.

2322
02:27:56,394 --> 02:27:58,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like a CD that's skipping or something.

2323
02:27:58,355 --> 02:27:59,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on our end, guys.

2324
02:27:59,676 --> 02:28:00,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's going on.

2325
02:28:01,496 --> 02:28:02,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I have had cable issues.

2326
02:28:04,037 --> 02:28:08,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not get to go to a WoW raid on Thursday because of Comcast cable issues.

2327
02:28:08,739 --> 02:28:11,841
[SPEAKER_09]: God forbid you miss your story of the castle.

2328
02:28:11,861 --> 02:28:12,381
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

2329
02:28:12,561 --> 02:28:13,001
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

2330
02:28:13,221 --> 02:28:16,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, it was the dragon battle, Malygos, that I missed.

2331
02:28:17,563 --> 02:28:21,886
[SPEAKER_07]: and I was the only one attuned for it so the whole guild didn't get to go because I couldn't sign on because of Comcast.

2332
02:28:21,926 --> 02:28:23,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was big drama.

2333
02:28:23,567 --> 02:28:24,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Big drama.

2334
02:28:25,368 --> 02:28:26,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I don't know what's going on.

2335
02:28:26,469 --> 02:28:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's us.

2336
02:28:27,289 --> 02:28:28,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the server.

2337
02:28:28,830 --> 02:28:29,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's up.

2338
02:28:29,591 --> 02:28:34,674
[SPEAKER_07]: But the podcast will be up in its entirety along with last week's podcast this week on the stream.

2339
02:28:35,274 --> 02:28:35,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Promise.

2340
02:28:37,996 --> 02:28:38,796
[SPEAKER_07]: More emails.

2341
02:28:38,897 --> 02:28:40,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I just closed the mailbag.

2342
02:28:40,518 --> 02:28:40,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoops.

2343
02:28:41,258 --> 02:28:42,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, Ron.

2344
02:28:42,459 --> 02:28:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

2345
02:28:43,319 --> 02:28:44,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you guys want to say on that last email?

2346
02:28:45,281 --> 02:28:45,801
[SPEAKER_07]: About other...

2347
02:28:47,476 --> 02:28:48,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you touched everything.

2348
02:29:16,226 --> 02:29:19,171
[SPEAKER_07]: When the line reaches the end, it continues on the other half of the screen.

2349
02:29:19,852 --> 02:29:22,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that this game is the right step for the rhythm game genre.

2350
02:29:22,477 --> 02:29:28,127
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always two to three people waiting to play the game at Sunnyvale Golf Land, which shows that Technica just might keep arcades going somewhat longer.

2351
02:29:29,025 --> 02:29:29,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it.

2352
02:29:30,086 --> 02:29:33,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I hate to be the pessimist, but one game ain't gonna happen.

2353
02:29:33,488 --> 02:29:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

2354
02:29:36,210 --> 02:29:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The touchscreen in the EBA meets luminous gameplay allows for more freedom of movement and play styles as opposed to, say, Beatmania 2DX or DDR.

2355
02:29:43,374 --> 02:29:47,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen players use one hand, both hands, one or two fingers, all of their fingers, and so on.

2356
02:29:48,792 --> 02:29:49,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2357
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, being a touch-the-notes game as opposed to hit notes as they pass a red line game, it's harder to sight-read a song.

2358
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:23,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen otherwise good players fail a song because of the offbeat notes.

2359
02:30:24,353 --> 02:30:30,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Songs that are faster tend to be also harder than slow songs because the notes are more spaced out and you have less time to survey the notes.

2360
02:30:30,819 --> 02:30:32,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping something good comes out of having a card.

2361
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:41,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one myself, and so far it's only apparent features are modifiers, which you use max points on, and Platinum Crew mode, which is some sort of online mode I'll discuss later when it's activated.

2362
02:30:42,087 --> 02:30:44,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, our machine is looking to get an update in a few days.

2363
02:30:44,288 --> 02:30:45,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we'll get some new songs about it.

2364
02:30:46,089 --> 02:30:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Also a minor but nice touch, there's a headphone jack below the touchscreen.

2365
02:30:49,552 --> 02:30:51,773
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's hard to hear the game, using headphones can help.

2366
02:30:52,273 --> 02:30:52,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2367
02:30:52,754 --> 02:30:54,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll see some of you at Sviggle.

2368
02:30:54,595 --> 02:30:54,855
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

2369
02:30:54,895 --> 02:30:59,258
[SPEAKER_07]: This email was brought to you by Beat Rock 3 from Papa Music, home of the never-ending Falling Books.

2370
02:31:00,979 --> 02:31:01,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

2371
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:04,781
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds interesting.

2372
02:31:05,081 --> 02:31:06,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try this touch game.

2373
02:31:07,022 --> 02:31:07,842
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds interesting.

2374
02:31:08,543 --> 02:31:13,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm supposed to be in South Bay February 7th anyway, and I'm taking Victoria with me.

2375
02:31:13,125 --> 02:31:17,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe I'll take Victoria to the arcade because we have Rocky in the South Bay on the 7th.

2376
02:31:18,427 --> 02:31:20,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we can swing by and check out this game.

2377
02:31:20,708 --> 02:31:22,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you want to go play video games, Victoria?

2378
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:24,730
[SPEAKER_09]: OMG, totally.

2379
02:31:25,210 --> 02:31:25,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2380
02:31:26,371 --> 02:31:27,171
[SPEAKER_07]: She just rolled her eyes.

2381
02:31:27,471 --> 02:31:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to play DDR, Victoria?

2382
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:30,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an epic fail at DDR.

2383
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:33,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I fat ass on the damn thing?

2384
02:31:33,101 --> 02:31:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, on easy, I'm like, oh girl!

2385
02:31:35,482 --> 02:31:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh girl!

2386
02:31:36,582 --> 02:31:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a break!

2387
02:31:38,543 --> 02:31:40,323
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play pinball or something that's less stressful.

2388
02:31:40,384 --> 02:31:41,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Holla!

2389
02:31:42,164 --> 02:31:45,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Victoria's ass is not fat, it's just round.

2390
02:31:46,846 --> 02:31:48,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I like big butts and I cannot lie.

2391
02:31:49,166 --> 02:31:50,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't think Victoria's fat, but whatever.

2392
02:31:50,947 --> 02:31:51,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she's not at all.

2393
02:31:51,907 --> 02:31:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: She's beautiful and single.

2394
02:31:55,388 --> 02:31:57,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop trying to pimp me, Irene.

2395
02:31:58,604 --> 02:32:00,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at all.

2396
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read another email here from...

2397
02:32:07,052 --> 02:32:11,353
[SPEAKER_07]: RJ, because I don't see another signature here, so I'm just going to say RJ.

2398
02:32:11,753 --> 02:32:16,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, I'm using my lovely iTouch to send this email, so be warned, Jamie, if the grammar Nazi bar is high.

2399
02:32:16,674 --> 02:32:17,154
[SPEAKER_07]: You lucked out.

2400
02:32:17,174 --> 02:32:19,815
[SPEAKER_07]: You read me tonight, and I have terrible grammar, so I don't judge the others.

2401
02:32:20,375 --> 02:32:29,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just finished Infinite Undiscovery and Lost Odyssey, and I'm planning on getting The Last Remnant next, which I've heard is a slightly generic story, but a robust and interesting battle system, so I'll tell you what I've experienced next time.

2402
02:32:29,517 --> 02:32:30,457
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2403
02:32:53,585 --> 02:32:57,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevertheless, both leave you satisfied at the end and don't suffer from rehashed plot points.

2404
02:32:57,846 --> 02:32:59,546
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wish, story is better.

2405
02:32:59,826 --> 02:33:00,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2406
02:33:00,326 --> 02:33:01,987
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wish, story is better.

2407
02:33:02,087 --> 02:33:04,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Lost Odyssey is and has superb presentation.

2408
02:33:04,787 --> 02:33:09,028
[SPEAKER_07]: With Infinite Undiscovery gameplay, in my opinion, fun yet repetitive at parts.

2409
02:33:09,388 --> 02:33:11,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hesitate on getting either.

2410
02:33:12,269 --> 02:33:16,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So interesting because I gave up on Infinite Undiscovery because the beginning is terrible.

2411
02:33:17,270 --> 02:33:17,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2412
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:17,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2413
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:19,510
[SPEAKER_07]: PS, Rob, Queen was the better 70s band than ABBA

2414
02:33:44,309 --> 02:33:45,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Queen.

2415
02:33:45,329 --> 02:33:46,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Queen is amazing.

2416
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:47,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Queen is amazing.

2417
02:33:47,290 --> 02:33:49,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Freddie Mercury was... I know.

2418
02:33:49,750 --> 02:33:51,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Freddie Mercury is a god.

2419
02:33:51,911 --> 02:33:53,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Freddie Mercury was a god, really.

2420
02:33:54,171 --> 02:33:55,552
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I'm sorry.

2421
02:33:55,672 --> 02:33:56,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Abba's still number one.

2422
02:33:56,692 --> 02:33:58,392
[SPEAKER_07]: But Queen is like seriously two or three.

2423
02:33:58,732 --> 02:33:59,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

2424
02:33:59,193 --> 02:34:00,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Two or maybe three.

2425
02:34:00,133 --> 02:34:00,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe two or three.

2426
02:34:00,693 --> 02:34:05,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Bowie's kind of... Oh, from Labyrinth.

2427
02:34:06,014 --> 02:34:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.

2428
02:34:06,574 --> 02:34:06,894
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2429
02:34:06,914 --> 02:34:07,595
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thoughts on that.

2430
02:34:09,195 --> 02:34:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a couple more here.

2431
02:34:10,675 --> 02:34:12,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I know we have a lot of emails tonight, but that's alright.

2432
02:34:12,436 --> 02:34:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a lot of...

2433
02:34:14,176 --> 02:34:18,684
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's for Fart Princess, which we haven't called it that tonight, but Fart Princess.

2434
02:34:19,044 --> 02:34:22,990
[SPEAKER_07]: No, since Rice or Fart Princess, which, by the way, can I say this about Fart Princess real quick?

2435
02:34:23,611 --> 02:34:24,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on WoW last night.

2436
02:34:24,994 --> 02:34:27,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do you have to bring this up?

2437
02:34:27,097 --> 02:34:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

2438
02:34:27,498 --> 02:34:27,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2439
02:34:28,487 --> 02:34:32,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And for an hour, she was talking about farts in guild chat.

2440
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:35,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not an hour, it was like five minutes.

2441
02:34:35,654 --> 02:34:36,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like an hour.

2442
02:34:36,454 --> 02:34:37,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incidental.

2443
02:34:37,335 --> 02:34:41,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You were talking about farts for an hour.

2444
02:34:41,639 --> 02:34:43,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And Vlad kept talking to me.

2445
02:34:43,681 --> 02:34:45,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously someone was interested in what I had to say.

2446
02:34:47,444 --> 02:34:54,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Rice Princess is here tonight, this is from Amaze Satsuma, I'll go ahead and ask, how did you all like the latest Battlestar Galactica episode?

2447
02:34:54,346 --> 02:35:01,948
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know the BSG talk is in, was going to happen sooner or later with her here, so I thought I'd give it a helping hand.

2448
02:35:02,328 --> 02:35:05,309
[SPEAKER_07]: No spoilers, I haven't watched it yet because I'm still on season 3.

2449
02:35:05,629 --> 02:35:09,810
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't spoil anything, but I am depressed beyond belief.

2450
02:35:10,931 --> 02:35:14,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to elaborate more, but I can't because then I'll start getting into the spoilers.

2451
02:35:15,592 --> 02:35:17,473
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2452
02:35:36,053 --> 02:35:37,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was stupid.

2453
02:35:38,354 --> 02:35:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's not a spoiler, but I'm hoping that it wasn't an actual revelation of the final Cylon, that it was just speculation on behalf of one of the characters in the show.

2454
02:35:50,336 --> 02:35:51,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

2455
02:35:51,596 --> 02:35:57,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it pretty much is confirmation that it is the last Cylon, but if that is the last Cylon, I'll be upset.

2456
02:35:58,798 --> 02:35:59,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

2457
02:36:01,218 --> 02:36:01,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's enough.

2458
02:36:01,638 --> 02:36:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't say any more.

2459
02:36:02,299 --> 02:36:02,459
[SPEAKER_02]: No BSG.

2460
02:36:06,026 --> 02:36:11,691
[SPEAKER_07]: One other email from our old buddy DMN who wants to update you on the March Madness competition that's going on.

2461
02:36:11,751 --> 02:36:17,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember this was the controversial one last year where Super Metroid beat Chrono Trigger and I got hate mail for a year because of it?

2462
02:36:17,335 --> 02:36:20,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as you deserve.

2463
02:36:20,518 --> 02:36:22,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is your chance to write what has been wronged.

2464
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:24,401
[SPEAKER_07]: You can send your top 25 to...

2465
02:36:27,403 --> 02:36:28,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Breast Lull, I guess is his name.

2466
02:36:29,183 --> 02:36:32,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a specific email address you actually want to send those to.

2467
02:36:32,884 --> 02:36:33,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a Gmail address.

2468
02:36:33,864 --> 02:36:34,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me look it up real quick.

2469
02:36:34,785 --> 02:36:36,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the last week to do so, by the way.

2470
02:36:36,325 --> 02:36:37,385
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like six days left.

2471
02:36:38,025 --> 02:36:41,666
[SPEAKER_07]: uslmadness, all one word, at gmail.com.

2472
02:36:42,226 --> 02:36:45,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to send those into Breast Lull as fast as you can because you only have six days left.

2473
02:36:45,867 --> 02:36:48,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the rundown of the top 25 so far.

2474
02:36:48,188 --> 02:36:53,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, this is only determining the seeds for the head-to-head competitions that will happen later on.

2475
02:36:53,729 --> 02:36:54,249
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not...

2495
02:37:57,201 --> 02:37:59,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band is the number one game of all time.

2496
02:37:59,983 --> 02:38:04,546
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you consider that music game fans is our roots, I'm not surprised.

2497
02:38:05,146 --> 02:38:10,830
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you would disagree, here's your chance to send in your list to make Super Metroid number one so it gets a little higher.

2498
02:38:10,990 --> 02:38:12,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck is Pokemon on there?

2499
02:38:14,073 --> 02:38:15,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like Pokemon.

2500
02:38:15,614 --> 02:38:16,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

2501
02:38:16,334 --> 02:38:18,236
[SPEAKER_07]: If you disagree, again, get those lists in.

2502
02:38:18,256 --> 02:38:19,096
[SPEAKER_07]: You have six days left.

2503
02:38:19,376 --> 02:38:19,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2504
02:38:20,337 --> 02:38:21,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're closing the polls.

2505
02:38:21,718 --> 02:38:22,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you going to send in a list?

2506
02:38:22,959 --> 02:38:23,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Your top 25 of all time?

2507
02:38:23,639 --> 02:38:24,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

2508
02:38:25,049 --> 02:38:27,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know my... I'm secure in my decision.

2509
02:38:27,951 --> 02:38:29,432
[SPEAKER_02]: My top five games of all time.

2510
02:38:29,612 --> 02:38:31,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to validate it.

2511
02:38:31,913 --> 02:38:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just stuck up, bitch.

2512
02:38:33,134 --> 02:38:35,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it for the emails.

2513
02:38:35,175 --> 02:38:40,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send your own email in for reading.

2514
02:38:41,359 --> 02:38:42,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Rob.

2515
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:43,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak English!

2516
02:38:45,097 --> 02:38:47,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God Jamie's not here, I would have just got a fail award.

2517
02:38:47,318 --> 02:38:48,900
[SPEAKER_02]: She would have thrown a taco at you.

2518
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to some gaming news, and then we're going to take some calls on the Skype line at 1-877- You mean Victoria's going to take calls?

2519
02:38:56,865 --> 02:38:57,805
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2520
02:38:57,905 --> 02:38:59,306
[SPEAKER_06]: In a little bit, we still have some stories.

2521
02:38:59,567 --> 02:38:59,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

2522
02:39:00,867 --> 02:39:06,071
[SPEAKER_06]: This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we'll be getting the brand new game, The Maw.

2523
02:39:07,071 --> 02:39:10,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Maw is being put out by Twisted Pixels.

2524
02:39:10,712 --> 02:39:23,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an adventure platformer that places you in the role of Frank, an alien stranded on a strange planet with the Maw, a strange blob-like creature that acts like his only friend and ultimate weapon all at the same time.

2525
02:39:25,036 --> 02:39:29,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, it will be available for 800 Microsoft Points.

2526
02:39:29,337 --> 02:39:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be out on the 21st.

2527
02:39:31,597 --> 02:39:33,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I remember correctly, I think the Maw was...

2528
02:39:35,063 --> 02:39:39,688
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a winner of some award during PAX but I can't remember what it was

2529
02:39:40,939 --> 02:39:41,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

2530
02:39:41,579 --> 02:39:44,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it one of those indie games that was featured in the center?

2531
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was.

2532
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:46,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember hearing about that.

2533
02:39:46,781 --> 02:39:47,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

2534
02:39:48,761 --> 02:39:49,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Very neat.

2535
02:39:49,521 --> 02:39:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2536
02:39:50,742 --> 02:39:55,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Fable 2, which I'm finally going to get a chance to play this week because Loki helped me get hooked up with a copy of Fable 2.

2537
02:39:56,603 --> 02:39:57,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to check that out this week.

2538
02:39:57,704 --> 02:40:00,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know this is a game that DarkSakura has been playing a lot.

2539
02:40:00,784 --> 02:40:03,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen her on Xbox Live a lot until this game came out.

2540
02:40:04,065 --> 02:40:06,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently she's been playing with OLR people and stuff.

2541
02:40:06,246 --> 02:40:09,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to get on there and finally get to play some Fable 2.

2542
02:40:09,447 --> 02:40:10,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not a big fan?

2543
02:40:10,587 --> 02:40:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

2544
02:40:11,268 --> 02:40:13,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have to go back and play because I want to finish it.

2545
02:40:14,549 --> 02:40:15,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It's short.

2546
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:17,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking about getting the download content though for it.

2547
02:40:18,111 --> 02:40:19,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I can start Fallout 3.

2548
02:40:19,252 --> 02:40:21,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe Lost Odyssey.

2549
02:40:21,994 --> 02:40:23,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to go back to Lost Odyssey.

2550
02:40:23,274 --> 02:40:24,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think I'm going to check out Fable 2.

2551
02:40:24,915 --> 02:40:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I might even play it tonight and force Victoria to watch some of it with me.

2552
02:40:27,937 --> 02:40:28,357
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

2553
02:40:30,739 --> 02:40:31,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Victoria?

2554
02:40:31,159 --> 02:40:32,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I just caught Victoria's attention.

2555
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to play some Fable 2 tonight.

2556
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a video game.

2557
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:37,191
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going, yippee.

2558
02:40:37,331 --> 02:40:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have my laptop.

2559
02:40:38,151 --> 02:40:40,352
[SPEAKER_07]: You can chat with your hoes on AOL.

2560
02:40:40,372 --> 02:40:40,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be fine.

2561
02:40:40,892 --> 02:40:46,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You can marry people of the same sex or have multiple husbands and wives.

2562
02:40:47,114 --> 02:40:51,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been watching Sauce, or Tiara, whatever you want to call her.

2563
02:40:51,455 --> 02:40:52,756
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been on this show a couple times.

2564
02:40:52,796 --> 02:40:55,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been watching her tweets that have been updating us on the progress of her.

2565
02:40:55,997 --> 02:40:57,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like she's having a lot of fun.

2566
02:40:57,457 --> 02:41:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she has two husbands and a wife and a child named Optimus Prime.

2567
02:41:01,258 --> 02:41:02,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to check this out.

2568
02:41:02,879 --> 02:41:03,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2569
02:41:04,318 --> 02:41:09,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow, speaking of Fable 2, the download content, not Whole Island, finally came out.

2570
02:41:10,423 --> 02:41:14,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there's a weapon in it called HAL's Rifle.

2571
02:41:15,728 --> 02:41:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: The funny thing about it, it looks exactly like the assault rifle from Halo.

2572
02:41:20,231 --> 02:41:20,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

2573
02:41:21,012 --> 02:41:21,432
[SPEAKER_07]: HAL?

2574
02:41:21,953 --> 02:41:22,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo?

2575
02:41:23,794 --> 02:41:28,799
[SPEAKER_07]: 59 damage per shot, 24 shots per clip, and it has an empty augment slot.

2576
02:41:28,819 --> 02:41:32,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically, they kind of made a little Halo lol joke in the download content.

2577
02:41:33,735 --> 02:41:34,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, lol.

2578
02:41:36,096 --> 02:41:36,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2579
02:41:37,497 --> 02:41:40,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment says, Sky, why are you forcing Victoria to do things?

2580
02:41:40,358 --> 02:41:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What is she, your girlfriend?

2581
02:41:42,579 --> 02:41:44,059
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but kind of.

2582
02:41:44,079 --> 02:41:46,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she's like one of my hags.

2583
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:47,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And she has to crash here all weekend.

2584
02:41:48,581 --> 02:41:50,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got two of my hags here tonight.

2585
02:41:50,522 --> 02:41:51,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very special.

2586
02:41:51,182 --> 02:41:55,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the least I could do for him letting me stay here and not sleep in my car.

2587
02:41:57,699 --> 02:41:59,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the least that she can do as his hag.

2588
02:41:59,739 --> 02:42:02,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We have hag duties, you know, that we have to do.

2589
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:03,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is some of it.

2590
02:42:04,521 --> 02:42:05,181
[SPEAKER_07]: What did they say?

2591
02:42:05,641 --> 02:42:11,042
[SPEAKER_09]: If the hag don't like you, the fag... If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you.

2592
02:42:11,062 --> 02:42:12,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But that goes the other way around, too.

2593
02:42:13,803 --> 02:42:14,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

2594
02:42:14,603 --> 02:42:16,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to approve if anyone Victoria or Irene dates.

2595
02:42:17,083 --> 02:42:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: This is true.

2596
02:42:18,264 --> 02:42:18,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to approve.

2597
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:20,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

2598
02:42:21,524 --> 02:42:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't ask that on the radio, for God's sake.

2599
02:42:26,913 --> 02:42:28,695
[SPEAKER_07]: If I didn't, I would have said something already.

2600
02:42:29,555 --> 02:42:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And you, Irene, have been your man a long time.

2601
02:42:33,138 --> 02:42:34,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been with my man.

2602
02:42:34,459 --> 02:42:37,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I disapproved, I would have said something a long time ago.

2603
02:42:37,361 --> 02:42:38,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have bitch slapped the shit out of him.

2604
02:42:38,782 --> 02:42:39,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have bitch slapped you.

2605
02:42:40,403 --> 02:42:43,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, because Irene makes no qualms if she dislikes somebody I'm dating.

2606
02:42:43,726 --> 02:42:46,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we know.

2607
02:42:47,909 --> 02:42:53,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he was saying that she wants to get a second wife to do all the cleaning and cooking because she doesn't do any of that.

2608
02:42:54,273 --> 02:42:54,634
[SPEAKER_06]: You should.

2609
02:42:54,654 --> 02:42:54,914
[SPEAKER_08]: You should.

2610
02:42:56,926 --> 02:42:58,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow, I'm sorry, we got derailed.

2611
02:42:58,847 --> 02:43:01,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, if you become a gay man, that will be easy.

2612
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you'll get a bunch of hags who will do that for you.

2613
02:43:04,209 --> 02:43:05,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I have straight hags?

2614
02:43:06,130 --> 02:43:08,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's no such thing as a straight hag.

2615
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:08,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ridiculous?

2616
02:43:08,991 --> 02:43:10,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I am going to pioneer this.

2617
02:43:10,511 --> 02:43:12,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have your cake and eat it too, Matt.

2618
02:43:12,592 --> 02:43:13,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can.

2619
02:43:14,053 --> 02:43:15,393
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do you do with cake?

2620
02:43:15,473 --> 02:43:16,674
[SPEAKER_07]: You should take applications.

2621
02:43:18,223 --> 02:43:19,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you have a radio show.

2622
02:43:20,104 --> 02:43:22,464
[SPEAKER_07]: You should solicit applications for some straight hags.

2623
02:43:22,744 --> 02:43:27,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, because, see, street hags, that's actual real hags, and no one likes real hags.

2624
02:43:29,667 --> 02:43:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You should just put on the application, four-toothed minimum.

2625
02:43:32,368 --> 02:43:33,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No fat chicks.

2626
02:43:36,943 --> 02:43:37,204
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2627
02:43:37,584 --> 02:43:42,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, SSJ100Matt says, Loki needs to find a girl who's into airsoft.

2628
02:43:42,470 --> 02:43:42,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, though.

2629
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:44,172
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not trying to set him up on a date.

2630
02:43:44,232 --> 02:43:45,994
[SPEAKER_07]: He's very happily married.

2631
02:43:46,054 --> 02:43:47,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Him and Nellie get along fabulously.

2632
02:43:47,055 --> 02:43:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wants a maid that works for free.

2633
02:43:50,959 --> 02:43:51,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2634
02:44:08,286 --> 02:44:12,389
[SPEAKER_07]: for Nellie to nag so that she gets it out of her system before you get home.

2635
02:44:12,669 --> 02:44:15,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank God.

2636
02:44:15,411 --> 02:44:16,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

2637
02:44:18,473 --> 02:44:21,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the airsoft stuff... It doesn't even have to be a woman.

2638
02:44:22,176 --> 02:44:24,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been good when it comes to the airsoft stuff.

2639
02:44:26,176 --> 02:44:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, sorry, OLR Studio Drama, you know how we tape in the garage basically, very thin wall.

2640
02:44:30,979 --> 02:44:33,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can hear the neighbor like yelling at a dog or something.

2641
02:44:33,421 --> 02:44:34,822
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hear it all the way here in the garage.

2642
02:44:35,082 --> 02:44:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I hope he's not throwing his weed out.

2643
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I think somebody just threw a taco across the street at the dog.

2644
02:44:40,506 --> 02:44:40,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2645
02:44:40,766 --> 02:44:41,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back.

2646
02:44:41,587 --> 02:44:41,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2647
02:44:42,548 --> 02:44:42,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

2648
02:44:43,863 --> 02:44:44,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hungry.

2649
02:44:44,923 --> 02:44:45,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

2650
02:44:45,404 --> 02:44:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to game news here.

2651
02:44:47,104 --> 02:44:57,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about last week how there was a game that possibly will get removed off of the App Store relatively soon if Nintendo caught wind of it, and that was the Game & Watch game.

2652
02:44:58,007 --> 02:44:59,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now there's another Nintendo game.

2653
02:44:59,888 --> 02:45:01,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Duck Hunt is now available for $1.

2654
02:45:01,969 --> 02:45:03,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, I forgot to download the Game & Watch game.

2655
02:45:04,209 --> 02:45:04,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit.

2656
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:05,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

2657
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:07,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know if it's... It might still be up there.

2658
02:45:08,030 --> 02:45:09,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you just better check.

2659
02:45:11,712 --> 02:45:14,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Duck Hunt is available now for a dollar.

2660
02:45:15,576 --> 02:45:16,697
[SPEAKER_02]: One dollar.

2661
02:45:16,957 --> 02:45:17,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, one dollar.

2662
02:45:18,798 --> 02:45:21,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have everything in the game.

2663
02:45:21,341 --> 02:45:23,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Ducks and no annoying dog.

2664
02:45:23,883 --> 02:45:25,744
[SPEAKER_06]: You move the cursor around and shoot ducks.

2665
02:45:27,105 --> 02:45:27,966
[SPEAKER_02]: All for a dollar.

2666
02:45:28,246 --> 02:45:28,927
[SPEAKER_06]: All for a dollar.

2667
02:45:29,467 --> 02:45:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bargain.

2668
02:45:32,110 --> 02:45:34,712
[SPEAKER_07]: But the laughing dog isn't in it, so what the hell's the point?

2669
02:45:36,199 --> 02:45:37,380
[SPEAKER_02]: You shoot ducks.

2670
02:45:37,681 --> 02:45:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, maybe they didn't like the dog.

2671
02:45:41,545 --> 02:45:43,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, who cares?

2672
02:45:43,887 --> 02:45:48,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence the reason he prefaced that statement with annoying.

2673
02:45:48,211 --> 02:45:52,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sorry, I'm looking for the Game & Watch games right now to see if they're there.

2674
02:45:52,475 --> 02:45:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're there.

2675
02:45:53,156 --> 02:45:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the name of it?

2676
02:45:56,191 --> 02:45:58,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... Crap.

2677
02:45:59,192 --> 02:46:01,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I searched for Game & Watch and didn't find anything.

2678
02:46:01,233 --> 02:46:02,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, just one second.

2679
02:46:02,793 --> 02:46:03,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I can find it for you.

2680
02:46:03,874 --> 02:46:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It is... It's not called Game & Watch.

2681
02:46:07,535 --> 02:46:10,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called... Alright, you look while I talk about the next story.

2682
02:46:10,176 --> 02:46:10,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

2683
02:46:10,896 --> 02:46:14,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's GW Chef, GW Parachute, GW Fire.

2684
02:46:14,778 --> 02:46:15,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look for GW.

2685
02:46:15,798 --> 02:46:17,079
[SPEAKER_07]: GW, thank you.

2686
02:46:17,239 --> 02:46:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'll look at that after I read you this story because this is pretty exciting, okay?

2687
02:46:22,501 --> 02:46:23,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the Commodore 64.

2688
02:46:24,482 --> 02:46:25,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you love the Commodore 64?

2689
02:46:25,802 --> 02:46:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it, yeah.

2690
02:46:26,742 --> 02:46:31,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember, if I start talking this, you are standing in front of a White House.

2691
02:46:31,444 --> 02:46:32,624
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a mailbox here.

2692
02:46:32,884 --> 02:46:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Zork?

2693
02:46:34,405 --> 02:46:35,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Zork!

2694
02:46:35,285 --> 02:46:36,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly right.

2695
02:46:36,546 --> 02:46:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You have been eaten by a Gru.

2696
02:46:38,406 --> 02:46:39,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I knew you were going to do that.

2697
02:46:39,707 --> 02:46:44,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and obviously Zork actually had a couple other games that came out later, like Zork Grand Inquisitor.

2698
02:46:44,288 --> 02:46:45,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of cute, funny games.

2699
02:46:46,369 --> 02:46:49,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently Zork is coming back as an MMO.

2700
02:46:50,816 --> 02:46:50,976
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2701
02:46:51,096 --> 02:46:52,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Legends of Zork.

2702
02:46:52,998 --> 02:46:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Wiggity what?

2703
02:46:54,178 --> 02:46:57,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Joel Online is resurrecting the Zork franchise.

2704
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:58,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game called Legends of Zork.

2705
02:46:58,761 --> 02:47:01,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a casual browser-based MMO.

2706
02:47:02,004 --> 02:47:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's up just yet, but they actually were interviewed by Grandma Sutra recently, and they have mentioned that the game is going to feature microtransactions.

2707
02:47:09,849 --> 02:47:12,190
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play it on the computer or the iPhone.

2708
02:47:12,871 --> 02:47:13,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

2709
02:47:14,112 --> 02:47:14,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

2710
02:47:14,592 --> 02:47:15,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

2711
02:47:15,793 --> 02:47:16,654
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you so upset about?

2712
02:47:16,674 --> 02:47:18,615
[SPEAKER_07]: My phone just died.

2713
02:47:18,855 --> 02:47:18,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2714
02:47:18,995 --> 02:47:19,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Victoria's phone died.

2715
02:47:19,856 --> 02:47:20,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Big drama.

2716
02:47:20,848 --> 02:47:22,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could bring it back to life.

2717
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:26,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how fast it's going to be before people get eaten by a Gru.

2718
02:47:27,192 --> 02:47:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2719
02:47:27,913 --> 02:47:29,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to push Irene in front of a Gru.

2720
02:47:29,354 --> 02:47:29,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2721
02:47:30,554 --> 02:47:35,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to push you off the edge of something from Impossible Mission.

2722
02:47:35,558 --> 02:47:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2723
02:47:37,699 --> 02:47:40,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost did that for the classic game tonight, but it was Loki's turn.

2724
02:47:40,701 --> 02:47:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, I love that game so much.

2725
02:47:41,982 --> 02:47:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Loki's turn.

2726
02:47:42,683 --> 02:47:46,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually found another Commodore 64 game I wanted to do first before Impossible Mission.

2727
02:47:46,745 --> 02:47:50,668
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get the sound bites from that game and use it like sometimes in here.

2728
02:47:51,095 --> 02:47:54,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay a while, stay forever.

2729
02:47:54,438 --> 02:47:54,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a minute.

2730
02:47:55,499 --> 02:47:59,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game so much, but I couldn't ever play it because I was only like 10.

2731
02:48:02,006 --> 02:48:05,129
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I never realized what it was he was saying in the beginning of the game.

2732
02:48:05,389 --> 02:48:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Another visitor.

2733
02:48:06,851 --> 02:48:09,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2734
02:48:10,034 --> 02:48:13,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay a while, stay forever.

2735
02:48:15,393 --> 02:48:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

2736
02:48:15,953 --> 02:48:17,034
[SPEAKER_02]: What else does he say?

2737
02:48:17,354 --> 02:48:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him my robots or something.

2738
02:48:19,115 --> 02:48:19,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

2739
02:48:19,435 --> 02:48:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the next story.

2740
02:48:21,276 --> 02:48:22,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more stories before we open up the sky blind.

2741
02:48:23,917 --> 02:48:24,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry.

2742
02:48:24,317 --> 02:48:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.

2743
02:48:24,557 --> 02:48:24,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

2744
02:48:25,898 --> 02:48:26,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

2745
02:48:27,438 --> 02:48:29,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's other fun stuff.

2746
02:48:29,979 --> 02:48:32,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about Klonoa coming out on the Wii.

2747
02:48:33,141 --> 02:48:35,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually been out on the Wii already in Japan.

2748
02:48:35,702 --> 02:48:40,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, will be coming out over here pretty soon, actually.

2749
02:48:40,584 --> 02:48:44,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been announced that sometime in 2009 it will be available.

2750
02:48:45,521 --> 02:48:46,803
[SPEAKER_06]: or possibly April.

2751
02:48:48,625 --> 02:48:49,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it might move.

2752
02:48:49,546 --> 02:48:49,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

2753
02:48:50,367 --> 02:48:51,028
[SPEAKER_02]: April 4th.

2754
02:48:51,849 --> 02:48:52,890
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not April 4th.

2755
02:48:53,190 --> 02:48:53,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

2756
02:48:54,632 --> 02:48:56,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great day to release stuff.

2757
02:48:58,590 --> 02:48:59,171
[SPEAKER_07]: April 4th.

2758
02:49:00,452 --> 02:49:03,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, when these games come out, you can rent them at Game.

2759
02:49:04,277 --> 02:49:04,718
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2760
02:49:04,858 --> 02:49:07,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Game is not here in the US.

2761
02:49:07,201 --> 02:49:09,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're looking confused, like, what the hell is Game?

2762
02:49:09,323 --> 02:49:14,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a big competitor for the GameStop EB behemoth over in Europe, and it's also in Australia and parts of Asia.

2763
02:49:16,292 --> 02:49:21,717
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually are only in the business of selling new and used games right now, but soon they are going to rent games.

2764
02:49:21,757 --> 02:49:31,986
[SPEAKER_07]: They partnered up with a group called Swap Game, so they're going to be offering folks over in the UK the option of paying a monthly subscription fee that will allow them to rent two games at a time.

2765
02:49:32,386 --> 02:49:33,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a GameStop employee.

2766
02:49:34,788 --> 02:49:36,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, interesting business model, though.

2767
02:49:36,990 --> 02:49:38,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that's going to make them a lot of money?

2768
02:49:39,332 --> 02:49:41,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Rental, it couldn't hurt.

2769
02:49:41,894 --> 02:49:43,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it, well...

2770
02:49:45,071 --> 02:49:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

2771
02:49:45,371 --> 02:49:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of those sites are making money.

2772
02:49:46,632 --> 02:49:50,794
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to do a mail service where they're going to mail out the games or something, I don't know.

2773
02:49:50,854 --> 02:49:54,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just thinking that if I ever opened up a game store, I'd want to name it Store.

2774
02:49:54,635 --> 02:49:58,517
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because let's just get it as broad as possible.

2775
02:49:58,717 --> 02:49:59,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Store.

2776
02:49:59,278 --> 02:50:01,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck getting any new releases, though, from a place like this.

2777
02:50:01,839 --> 02:50:10,603
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always wondered, like, because movie rental stores always rent games, but it never made sense that game stores never rented games.

2778
02:50:10,743 --> 02:50:10,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

2779
02:50:11,363 --> 02:50:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: GameCrazy.com

2780
02:50:31,283 --> 02:50:31,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

2781
02:50:32,024 --> 02:50:35,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of GameCrazy as not like an independent thing.

2782
02:50:35,467 --> 02:50:38,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of them as like part of Hollywood video.

2783
02:50:38,470 --> 02:50:38,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2784
02:50:38,871 --> 02:50:40,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, that's a movie.

2785
02:50:41,293 --> 02:50:51,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And GameStop wouldn't do it because they would cut into their used game sales because, you know, why bother paying $30 for, you know, a $40 game or something like that when they can rent it for $7 and beat it?

2786
02:50:53,344 --> 02:50:58,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They could still do the buybacks of the used games and then rent out those games as a buyback.

2787
02:50:58,267 --> 02:51:00,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides, those games they consider new.

2788
02:51:00,648 --> 02:51:01,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, they put a little sticker on them.

2789
02:51:02,128 --> 02:51:02,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say this.

2790
02:51:02,909 --> 02:51:07,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty in chat says it sounds more immediate than Gamefly if it weren't a mail-based return system.

2791
02:51:07,551 --> 02:51:08,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's true.

2792
02:51:08,471 --> 02:51:10,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people don't like to do the mail thing.

2793
02:51:10,252 --> 02:51:19,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Netflix is huge, but they're still blockbuster because sometimes, you know, just like even last night, Victoria was over, I was here, bored, done with WoW, let's watch a movie.

2794
02:51:20,257 --> 02:51:20,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But

2795
02:51:21,297 --> 02:51:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Rentals

2796
02:51:49,531 --> 02:51:52,614
[SPEAKER_06]: available over Xbox Live or something like that.

2797
02:51:52,634 --> 02:51:54,996
[SPEAKER_06]: You download the game and you have it for seven days or something.

2798
02:51:55,476 --> 02:51:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably just a matter of time.

2799
02:51:58,198 --> 02:52:02,061
[SPEAKER_07]: If they could make money off renting the game then selling the game, that would be amazing.

2800
02:52:02,642 --> 02:52:04,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a smart business move.

2801
02:52:04,724 --> 02:52:04,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.

2802
02:52:06,618 --> 02:52:22,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it for stories tonight We're going to get into some last minute stories But first we want to take your calls on the Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you have the Skype program and want to talk to us that way Let's go to the phone and take some calls Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2803
02:52:23,631 --> 02:52:25,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?

2804
02:52:25,192 --> 02:52:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, not much, how you doing Ranma?

2805
02:52:27,434 --> 02:52:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good So I've got a couple of things I want to discuss Alright

2806
02:52:33,214 --> 02:52:35,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a quick question for you, though.

2807
02:52:35,237 --> 02:52:37,982
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you bought EGM?

2808
02:52:49,809 --> 02:53:07,234
[SPEAKER_07]: about a couple of months ago I still had a subscription okay that's cool I'm just curious because I bet there's some people that are sad you know I was sad to see EGM go but I haven't bought it in like 10 years you know what I mean so but I'm just kind of curious on what side of the fence you're on there so you were still a regular reader of it so okay you're sad to see it go

2809
02:53:07,950 --> 02:53:08,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

2810
02:53:08,650 --> 02:53:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that, Die Hard, Game Fan, and GamePro.

2811
02:53:12,151 --> 02:53:15,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the three magazines I read all throughout high school.

2812
02:53:15,792 --> 02:53:16,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it for me.

2813
02:53:16,652 --> 02:53:17,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't GamePro still around?

2814
02:53:18,393 --> 02:53:22,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's still around, but Die Hard, Game Fan died after like two or three years.

2815
02:53:22,274 --> 02:53:28,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that because at the time, it was the only magazine available that had an in-depth review about import video games.

2816
02:53:30,945 --> 02:53:32,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird, obscure fact about GamePro.

2817
02:53:32,926 --> 02:53:33,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to say this.

2818
02:53:33,727 --> 02:53:34,688
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what a nerd I am.

2819
02:53:34,888 --> 02:53:36,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you remember way back in the day.

2820
02:53:36,549 --> 02:53:38,450
[SPEAKER_07]: If you read GamePro for a long time, you'll remember this.

2821
02:53:39,111 --> 02:53:53,520
[SPEAKER_07]: A long, long time ago, they had a contest to get, I think it was 250 people, or maybe it was 50 or 250 people that were going to be part of an exclusive club that would get to write reviews for games or something like that for possible inclusion in the magazine or something.

2822
02:53:53,540 --> 02:53:54,881
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a long time ago, so bear with me.

2823
02:53:55,141 --> 02:53:56,062
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is what I remember.

2824
02:53:56,122 --> 02:53:59,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the fourth grade or fifth grade or something, and I wrote in a letter.

2825
02:53:59,444 --> 02:54:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I got picked as one of them.

2826
02:54:01,205 --> 02:54:01,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2827
02:54:01,505 --> 02:54:02,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, in fourth grade.

2828
02:54:02,946 --> 02:54:04,027
[SPEAKER_07]: But they never did anything with it.

2829
02:54:04,907 --> 02:54:05,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Boo.

2830
02:54:06,608 --> 02:54:11,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got anything else other than the letter that said, you know, congratulations, you got selected, and then they never did anything with it.

2831
02:54:11,791 --> 02:54:12,892
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's just funny.

2832
02:54:13,132 --> 02:54:13,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just a rant.

2833
02:54:13,913 --> 02:54:15,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever I think of GamePro, I think of that.

2834
02:54:15,514 --> 02:54:16,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2835
02:54:16,654 --> 02:54:19,776
[SPEAKER_07]: From when I was like, maybe it was a little late, like sixth grade, but I was young.

2836
02:54:19,836 --> 02:54:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I was young.

2837
02:54:20,717 --> 02:54:21,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Dork.

2838
02:54:24,279 --> 02:54:24,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, kind of sad.

2839
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:30,002
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, some of those magazines are still around, but I sadly don't think this will be the last one to fold.

2840
02:54:31,892 --> 02:54:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if any more fold because, honestly, I mean, as many video gaming sites there are, it's getting to the point where it's like video gaming industry with news and stuff is getting very saturated.

2841
02:54:42,955 --> 02:54:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like every other site someone has a video game review site or blog or something like that, whereas me, I'm on the opposite spectrum for what I cover.

2842
02:54:50,796 --> 02:54:52,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard to get that kind of information.

2843
02:54:52,897 --> 02:54:55,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2844
02:54:55,618 --> 02:54:56,598
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did you want to talk about tonight?

2845
02:54:57,469 --> 02:55:00,350
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I totally forgot.

2846
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will do a brief review about The Last Remnant.

2847
02:55:03,750 --> 02:55:05,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game I just picked up yesterday.

2848
02:55:05,531 --> 02:55:06,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, please do.

2849
02:55:07,271 --> 02:55:17,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it plays like Final Fantasy XII, but when it comes to the battle sequences, it turns into a complete tactical-style game, which I'm really enjoying a lot.

2850
02:55:18,314 --> 02:55:18,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

2851
02:55:18,614 --> 02:55:19,414
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the story?

2852
02:55:20,314 --> 02:55:23,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard kind of mixed reviews on this game, so I'm kind of curious.

2853
02:55:24,488 --> 02:55:40,696
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember correctly, the story is about a brother and sister who are going to meet up with their parents, but the sister is kidnapped, and he goes through his travels to find his sister, and you're discovering what these last remnants are, or these relics, for all types of different types of power that you can get.

2854
02:55:42,257 --> 02:55:42,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2855
02:55:44,558 --> 02:55:51,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, I'm like four or five hours in, and just like a regular tactics game, if you're not fully prepared, you will get killed on the first quest.

2856
02:55:53,443 --> 02:55:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2857
02:55:56,771 --> 02:56:01,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this something for like a hardcore tactical game fan only or can anyone get into it or what?

2858
02:56:02,933 --> 02:56:03,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this.

2859
02:56:03,513 --> 02:56:12,515
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not really into tactics games but there are some tactical games that are very simple and you want something simple like that, this would be a good game to pick up.

2860
02:56:12,555 --> 02:56:17,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't pay the $59.99 retail price tag for it.

2861
02:56:17,676 --> 02:56:18,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it on sale for $39.

2862
02:56:19,036 --> 02:56:21,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say when you see it for $39, then pick it up then.

2863
02:56:23,017 --> 02:56:23,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

2864
02:56:24,438 --> 02:56:25,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

2865
02:56:26,070 --> 02:56:28,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

2866
02:56:28,812 --> 02:56:30,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I remember one more thing and I'll get out of here.

2867
02:56:30,413 --> 02:56:30,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2868
02:56:30,713 --> 02:56:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember a long time ago I sent in a letter, an email about which games I should get for my 360?

2869
02:56:37,237 --> 02:56:39,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Yes, I think so.

2870
02:56:40,239 --> 02:56:43,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually picked up each of the games that you guys recommended for me.

2871
02:56:44,982 --> 02:56:45,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

2872
02:56:46,003 --> 02:56:47,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got around to doing so.

2873
02:56:49,845 --> 02:56:50,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what did you think?

2874
02:56:51,747 --> 02:56:52,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay...

2875
02:56:53,305 --> 02:56:54,725
[SPEAKER_03]: BlueDragon I'm still playing.

2876
02:56:54,765 --> 02:56:55,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy that.

2877
02:56:55,905 --> 02:57:01,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving Saints Row and I'm loving Crackdown and Marvel Ultimate Alliance is definitely a fun party game.

2878
02:57:03,627 --> 02:57:05,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, cool.

2879
02:57:05,047 --> 02:57:05,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good.

2880
02:57:05,367 --> 02:57:06,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad our reviews did some good.

2881
02:57:08,048 --> 02:57:08,728
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are awesome.

2882
02:57:08,748 --> 02:57:09,328
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I tell you?

2883
02:57:09,868 --> 02:57:10,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I do love you.

2884
02:57:10,668 --> 02:57:11,928
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like we pay you to say that.

2885
02:57:13,649 --> 02:57:14,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait until you come out here again.

2886
02:57:16,049 --> 02:57:16,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2887
02:57:16,629 --> 02:57:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hopefully soon.

2888
02:57:18,049 --> 02:57:20,490
[SPEAKER_07]: It is one of my goals for 09 to get back to New York City.

2889
02:57:20,530 --> 02:57:21,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It just probably won't happen until later in the year.

2890
02:57:22,861 --> 02:57:23,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be waiting.

2891
02:57:23,822 --> 02:57:24,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good one.

2892
02:57:25,144 --> 02:57:25,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2893
02:57:26,145 --> 02:57:26,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2894
02:57:26,526 --> 02:57:26,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2895
02:57:26,866 --> 02:57:27,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, Ranma.

2896
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2897
02:57:30,892 --> 02:57:31,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2898
02:57:32,074 --> 02:57:33,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

2899
02:57:33,636 --> 02:57:36,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Jason coming to you with one less tooth in his mouth.

2900
02:57:36,912 --> 02:57:42,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, I know we've both been having dental drama this week, except yours sounds a little more severe, so I'm really sorry to hear it.

2901
02:57:42,814 --> 02:57:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, mine went a little bit crazy, but my mouth's been fine ever since Thursday.

2902
02:57:48,055 --> 02:57:49,175
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about, then.

2903
02:57:49,475 --> 02:57:50,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So, isn't it the worst?

2904
02:57:50,496 --> 02:57:52,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I don't want to think about my mouth, because then it's just going to hurt more.

2905
02:57:53,997 --> 02:57:57,878
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen what Deakman's done for the OLR beta?

2906
02:57:58,398 --> 02:57:59,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he was giving it to me.

2907
02:57:59,738 --> 02:58:02,359
[SPEAKER_05]: He showed me the link just a couple minutes ago, and I was...

2908
02:58:03,320 --> 02:58:03,940
[SPEAKER_05]: and Run with it.

2909
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot more attractive pretty instantly, I gotta say.

2910
02:58:07,101 --> 02:58:07,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

2911
02:58:07,901 --> 02:58:08,742
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a nice job.

2912
02:58:08,902 --> 02:58:15,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta get you kids to work together behind the scenes to help make it happen so we can launch the new website because I'm all excited now.

2913
02:58:17,805 --> 02:58:19,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we gotta show it to Jamie though.

2914
02:58:19,305 --> 02:58:21,726
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not here tonight to give it her okay, but she'll love it too.

2915
02:58:21,766 --> 02:58:22,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I know she will.

2916
02:58:23,206 --> 02:58:28,548
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not gonna be... How can you look at the current site and go, oh, the current site's better.

2917
02:58:28,888 --> 02:58:29,668
[SPEAKER_07]: You really can't.

2918
02:58:29,688 --> 02:58:30,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new site's pretty awesome.

2919
02:58:31,569 --> 02:58:31,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot

2920
02:58:32,009 --> 02:58:32,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I can agree with that.

2921
02:58:55,809 --> 02:58:56,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man?

2922
02:58:56,670 --> 02:58:58,471
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he changed it, I think, to a Space Invader now.

2923
02:58:59,072 --> 02:58:59,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

2924
02:58:59,392 --> 02:59:07,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Because somebody else uses a little... Like, the Pac-Man is right next to this little radio-looking thing, and it looks way too similar to another show's logo.

2925
02:59:07,458 --> 02:59:09,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, eh, we don't want to do that.

2926
02:59:09,380 --> 02:59:10,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't want to ruffle any feathers.

2927
02:59:10,901 --> 02:59:13,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So I suggested a Space Invader, and I guess he ran with it.

2928
02:59:13,964 --> 02:59:14,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen the new logo yet.

2929
02:59:15,064 --> 02:59:16,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway... I just completely lost you.

2930
02:59:16,646 --> 02:59:18,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't tell me I just completely lost you.

2931
02:59:18,427 --> 02:59:19,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll open up... No, I'm here.

2932
02:59:20,028 --> 02:59:20,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

2933
02:59:21,449 --> 02:59:21,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us?

2934
02:59:23,735 --> 02:59:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we having internet issues going on?

2935
02:59:26,097 --> 02:59:27,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I blame you and nobody else.

2936
02:59:28,238 --> 02:59:29,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not dump him.

2937
02:59:29,359 --> 02:59:36,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Jason, if you can hear me, why don't you tell us what you really called in for tonight before I hijacked website talk.

2938
02:59:37,525 --> 02:59:38,486
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't hear me now, right?

2939
02:59:38,506 --> 02:59:39,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's my echo.

2940
02:59:40,628 --> 02:59:41,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, two questions.

2941
02:59:42,349 --> 02:59:43,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2942
02:59:44,490 --> 02:59:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question from Ryan, but she's too shy to get on the microphone because she's like that.

2943
02:59:49,674 --> 02:59:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: How long did EGM 2 last?

2944
02:59:53,388 --> 02:59:53,889
[SPEAKER_07]: EGM2!

2945
02:59:53,989 --> 02:59:55,450
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right!

2946
02:59:55,470 --> 02:59:57,912
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a spin-off magazine for a little while, didn't they?

2947
02:59:58,592 --> 03:00:00,174
[SPEAKER_07]: That's retarded.

2948
03:00:00,254 --> 03:00:01,014
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I remember.

2949
03:00:01,375 --> 03:00:09,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Famitsu was a weekly magazine, so they felt, I think for a short time there, that there was going to be like... Didn't EGM2 come out in the middle of the month or something?

2950
03:00:09,522 --> 03:00:10,322
[SPEAKER_07]: To offset it?

2951
03:00:11,263 --> 03:00:12,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I never... She had it.

2952
03:00:13,305 --> 03:00:14,326
[SPEAKER_05]: FYI, you went off the air again.

2953
03:00:14,366 --> 03:00:15,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not very long.

2954
03:00:15,827 --> 03:00:16,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a year.

2955
03:00:16,968 --> 03:00:17,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a year.

2956
03:00:19,150 --> 03:00:19,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2957
03:00:20,782 --> 03:00:22,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Just ignore the complaints about the stream in chat, Jason.

2958
03:00:22,984 --> 03:00:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to just keep going with the show.

2959
03:00:24,505 --> 03:00:28,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it in the background, and I noticed a very specific loop.

2960
03:00:29,189 --> 03:00:29,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

2961
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:30,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So about a year.

2962
03:00:31,151 --> 03:00:31,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

2963
03:00:32,012 --> 03:00:32,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2964
03:00:32,392 --> 03:00:33,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely not the source.

2965
03:00:33,913 --> 03:00:34,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

2966
03:00:34,273 --> 03:00:34,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

2967
03:00:34,634 --> 03:00:34,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2968
03:00:35,434 --> 03:00:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: EGM2 ran from July 1994 to July 1998.

2969
03:00:39,298 --> 03:00:41,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was actually four years.

2970
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:42,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2971
03:00:43,061 --> 03:00:43,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I was way off.

2972
03:00:44,850 --> 03:00:50,714
[SPEAKER_05]: She had a subscription to both and I've never heard of it but she wanted to know so I am making you people do it for me.

2973
03:00:51,055 --> 03:00:51,675
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

2974
03:00:52,315 --> 03:00:56,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I got that from Wikipedia and I believe everything I read on Wikipedia so there you go.

2975
03:00:56,278 --> 03:00:58,100
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just because I'm older than Jason.

2976
03:01:00,782 --> 03:01:01,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2977
03:01:02,213 --> 03:01:03,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams.

2978
03:01:03,094 --> 03:01:04,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's apparently something on the PS2.

2979
03:01:04,776 --> 03:01:04,896
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2980
03:01:21,242 --> 03:01:23,243
[SPEAKER_07]: They released a little later on.

2981
03:01:23,323 --> 03:01:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was on the PS2, but there was two versions of Silent Hill 2.

2982
03:01:26,665 --> 03:01:32,787
[SPEAKER_07]: The second version, Restless Dreams, has an additional scenario where, don't you play as Maria or something?

2983
03:01:33,448 --> 03:01:34,268
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really short.

2984
03:01:34,368 --> 03:01:34,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's short.

2985
03:01:34,988 --> 03:01:35,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a lot.

2986
03:01:35,849 --> 03:01:37,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you're getting a whole second game.

2987
03:01:37,649 --> 03:01:42,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like another little quick scenario that just gives some additional insight to the story.

2988
03:01:42,512 --> 03:01:46,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like a little bonus disc add-on that they released slightly later.

2989
03:01:46,513 --> 03:01:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

2990
03:01:46,753 --> 03:01:47,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a bonus chapter.

2991
03:01:47,874 --> 03:01:49,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't even think of it as a full game.

2992
03:01:49,295 --> 03:01:50,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very short.

2993
03:01:50,215 --> 03:01:50,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2994
03:01:50,515 --> 03:01:51,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even really a game.

2995
03:01:51,676 --> 03:01:54,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think you really do much.

2996
03:01:54,298 --> 03:01:55,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You do one thing and that's it.

2997
03:01:55,599 --> 03:01:59,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Restless Dreams, I believe, was originally for the Xbox expansion.

2998
03:01:59,402 --> 03:02:02,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think they re-released it on the PS2 with the Restless Dreams thing.

2999
03:02:02,585 --> 03:02:03,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

3000
03:02:06,542 --> 03:02:30,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through and I replayed all the Metal Gear Solids and then that led up to the time that we got the PS3 and I played Metal Gear Solid 4 all the way through and our next run through series is Silent Hill and I'm barring the dental madness I've been playing through Silent Hill 1 and I think I might be finishing that off tonight and since obviously Silent Hill 2 is the next one in line and I came across that I had never heard of it before

3001
03:02:32,915 --> 03:02:34,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll like Silent Hill 2 a lot!

3002
03:02:37,310 --> 03:03:05,031
[SPEAKER_05]: She was wondering if we were just going to skip the first one and as much as I want to because the game plays like hell and it really looks really bad I don't know if it's the PS2 doing something back in Pat but it has some really weird effects on our TV We were both thinking of just skipping the first one but she doesn't remember much of it and I fell asleep through some of it when I wasn't the one who played it in the first place so I kind of wanted to go through it the whole way and see it

3003
03:03:05,471 --> 03:03:08,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm admittedly using a walkthrough all the way through it.

3004
03:03:08,335 --> 03:03:12,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So that hint system is actually viable to some situations, Loki.

3005
03:03:12,340 --> 03:03:22,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm cheating all the way through it, but I'm getting the entire story in the manner it was supposed to be presented to me.

3006
03:03:23,362 --> 03:03:43,396
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm playing the game to some extent so that's kind of enough for me nice yeah yeah and you want to play through one because it's not necessary but it's good to play through one when you play through three because it'll kind of give some insight into three's story also so I watched Silent Hill the movie what do I need to play the game for because it's

3007
03:03:44,545 --> 03:03:49,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're like Victoria, you'll think it's crap unless you give some insight to the series.

3008
03:03:50,007 --> 03:03:54,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I have to admit, if I'd never played the games, I would have thought the movie was kind of random.

3009
03:03:54,709 --> 03:03:55,709
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

3010
03:03:55,769 --> 03:03:57,210
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is this pyramid thing?

3011
03:03:57,470 --> 03:04:00,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, the movie was made for the fans.

3012
03:04:00,811 --> 03:04:03,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish they would do this sequel.

3013
03:04:03,732 --> 03:04:04,593
[SPEAKER_05]: On that same line.

3014
03:04:05,653 --> 03:04:07,974
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the better video game movies, amazingly enough.

3015
03:04:08,014 --> 03:04:10,155
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite video game movie, I ain't even gonna lie.

3016
03:04:10,535 --> 03:04:11,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to watch it right now.

3017
03:04:12,276 --> 03:04:13,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too, I've been wanting

3018
03:04:13,496 --> 03:04:15,738
[SPEAKER_07]: We should go get it on Blu-ray and then watch it.

3019
03:04:16,178 --> 03:04:17,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it on Netflix?

3020
03:04:17,099 --> 03:04:19,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then we could party watch it or something like that.

3021
03:04:19,401 --> 03:04:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have that built in yet.

3022
03:04:20,942 --> 03:04:23,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they have that feature built in yet.

3023
03:04:25,206 --> 03:04:29,409
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd call each other and try to press play at the same time and do it that way or something.

3024
03:04:29,469 --> 03:04:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

3025
03:04:30,190 --> 03:04:30,810
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be fun.

3026
03:04:31,150 --> 03:04:34,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it on Justin.TV or something.

3027
03:04:34,613 --> 03:04:35,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, we've got to let you go.

3028
03:04:35,794 --> 03:04:36,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Take some more calls.

3029
03:04:38,016 --> 03:04:39,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for all you do for the website too.

3030
03:04:39,437 --> 03:04:40,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Between you and Deakman...

3031
03:04:40,978 --> 03:04:43,679
[SPEAKER_07]: 2009 is going to be the best year ever for our website.

3032
03:04:43,739 --> 03:04:44,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited.

3033
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure as hell hope so.

3034
03:04:45,039 --> 03:04:45,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been long enough.

3035
03:04:46,220 --> 03:04:52,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so excited because I'm all jazzed to write again for the website and I know TR has been wanting to do reviews.

3036
03:04:52,162 --> 03:04:55,082
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually going to have a functional website and I'm so excited I could tinkle.

3037
03:04:55,263 --> 03:04:55,863
[SPEAKER_02]: You're jazzed.

3038
03:04:56,883 --> 03:04:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we're going to let you go, Jason.

3039
03:04:58,404 --> 03:05:07,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a month to move as we're closing on Tuesday and then I'll do my best to be really on top of it.

3040
03:05:07,466 --> 03:05:08,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it, buddy.

3041
03:05:09,207 --> 03:05:09,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care.

3042
03:05:10,410 --> 03:05:11,331
[SPEAKER_07]: See you.

3043
03:05:11,351 --> 03:05:11,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

3044
03:05:13,132 --> 03:05:13,393
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3045
03:05:13,433 --> 03:05:15,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang, we got calls coming in back to back.

3046
03:05:15,314 --> 03:05:18,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is going to be the last one, though, because we're running kind of long tonight.

3047
03:05:18,097 --> 03:05:19,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3048
03:05:19,057 --> 03:05:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

3049
03:05:21,058 --> 03:05:21,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's GS68.

3050
03:05:44,491 --> 03:05:51,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So about the whole hint system of how the game pretty much plays for you, there's always something like that in arcade games.

3051
03:05:51,253 --> 03:05:52,613
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called unlimited continues.

3052
03:05:54,554 --> 03:05:57,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you have to feed it a quarter every time you want to continue.

3053
03:05:58,755 --> 03:06:04,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but at home, if you have free play, you just keep pressing start and you eventually get to the end of the game.

3054
03:06:04,977 --> 03:06:06,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no need to use any skill.

3055
03:06:06,798 --> 03:06:11,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Like playing the Ninja Turtles game on the Xbox, you can just get all the continues you want?

3056
03:06:12,403 --> 03:06:14,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or unlocking free play in Ikaruga.

3057
03:06:16,199 --> 03:06:17,820
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even just let the bosses time out.

3058
03:06:18,720 --> 03:06:32,907
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, but you know, I also think of the old, you know what you're talking about, kind of reminds me of, could anyone, and I gotta ask Loki this, I've gotta ask Loki this, could you actually beat Contra on the NES without up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start?

3059
03:06:32,967 --> 03:06:33,688
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's fucking hard.

3060
03:06:34,528 --> 03:06:38,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the point, though, you have to be good at it to, it can be done.

3061
03:06:39,250 --> 03:06:42,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that, you know, I need to play it more.

3062
03:06:42,984 --> 03:06:46,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play more to be able to learn the patterns and that kind of stuff.

3063
03:06:46,767 --> 03:06:48,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the whole point.

3064
03:06:48,148 --> 03:06:50,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't be just like, oh, look at this.

3065
03:06:50,610 --> 03:06:53,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even when we did that, we still didn't beat it.

3066
03:06:53,652 --> 03:06:54,813
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking hard.

3067
03:06:55,994 --> 03:06:56,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

3068
03:06:56,494 --> 03:07:03,379
[SPEAKER_02]: The continue system was kind of an antiquated method to have gamers feed quarters into the machine.

3069
03:07:03,399 --> 03:07:04,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point.

3070
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:09,724
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to start all over again, unless you put it in a quarter, and then it just carried over onto consoles.

3071
03:07:09,744 --> 03:07:10,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people were used to.

3072
03:07:10,624 --> 03:07:11,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose it's like,

3073
03:07:13,897 --> 03:07:22,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the internet is acting up again, but you're kind of cutting in a little bit in and out.

3074
03:07:22,899 --> 03:07:24,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and say what you wanted to say.

3075
03:07:24,159 --> 03:07:30,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to bring up DJ Max Black Square, which I got this week.

3076
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:45,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's alright, I guess.

3077
03:07:45,821 --> 03:07:53,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the songs are pretty good, and they're pretty hard, but I hate the club tour mood, because some of the missions are, like, really stupid hard.

3078
03:07:54,324 --> 03:07:57,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one feature, and then there's two other features that really piss me off.

3079
03:07:57,986 --> 03:08:04,128
[SPEAKER_00]: One, sometimes, the... Andy just dropped.

3080
03:08:04,629 --> 03:08:05,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, you there?

3081
03:08:05,789 --> 03:08:07,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this, I'm gonna ask real quick.

3082
03:08:07,690 --> 03:08:09,050
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having these weird problems tonight.

3083
03:08:09,271 --> 03:08:12,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the American version that you're talking about, or is this the new one that came out in Korea?

3084
03:08:13,985 --> 03:08:14,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Korea.

3085
03:08:15,486 --> 03:08:15,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my bad.

3086
03:08:16,127 --> 03:08:16,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I didn't know.

3087
03:08:18,289 --> 03:08:24,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically sometimes the music will cut out and continue, but it will lag really badly.

3088
03:08:26,715 --> 03:08:28,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it'll lag like a few seconds.

3089
03:08:30,919 --> 03:08:33,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any crazy-ass videos like there were in the earlier games?

3090
03:08:38,305 --> 03:08:41,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, the physics in the office is all the correct feature.

3091
03:08:41,507 --> 03:08:42,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you press...

3092
03:08:43,482 --> 03:08:50,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder why they don't do DJ Max on the DS They are, and it is the arcade one that they don't do on the DS Arcade one, like, sometimes

3093
03:09:15,014 --> 03:09:18,797
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Max One of my friends is really into it and keeps begging me to check it out, so I probably will at some point.

3094
03:09:34,211 --> 03:09:56,782
[SPEAKER_07]: at least when it comes out in America but I do want to try this arcade version that's at Sunnyvale Golfland hopefully it's not gone I guess GS68 was saying in chat earlier that it looks like it's probably going to be gone by the time I get there so that would suck because I guess it's in this weird beta test or whatever so we'll see anyhow Loki do you have any last minute stories for us before we wrap up the show yes that's what I've been doing

3095
03:09:58,533 --> 03:09:59,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Some interesting ones.

3096
03:09:59,373 --> 03:10:03,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple has actually rejected a game from Yut Saito.

3097
03:10:04,074 --> 03:10:06,375
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember him from the Seaman series.

3098
03:10:06,935 --> 03:10:08,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he had a game coming out.

3099
03:10:08,995 --> 03:10:14,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was like Seaman 2 on the iPhone.

3100
03:10:14,756 --> 03:10:16,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Gabo.

3101
03:10:16,577 --> 03:10:20,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a spiritual successor to Seaman, but with a caveman instead.

3102
03:10:21,478 --> 03:10:28,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, they said due to unpleasant gameplay, they axed the game and they're not allowed to put it on the App Store.

3103
03:10:29,133 --> 03:10:30,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about that.

3104
03:10:30,873 --> 03:10:34,894
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of crap on the App Store, so I'm kind of surprised, actually.

3105
03:10:34,974 --> 03:10:36,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is why apples suck.

3106
03:10:37,615 --> 03:10:38,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You just had to work that in there, didn't you?

3107
03:10:38,855 --> 03:10:39,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

3108
03:10:40,596 --> 03:10:43,977
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't really a gaming story, but it has a game addict with it.

3109
03:10:44,317 --> 03:10:56,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's a game addict in Beijing who was 23 years old and was rushed to a hospital after swallowing five pieces of saw blades in order to attempt to commit suicide.

3110
03:10:57,760 --> 03:11:06,064
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently he had been talking incoherently about how to win his favorite computer games after being sent to a Beijing hospital ICU.

3111
03:11:06,184 --> 03:11:13,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was another one of those cases where he was a gamer and that's about the extent that it was related to video games.

3112
03:11:13,407 --> 03:11:15,087
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy had issues way beyond video games.

3113
03:11:15,107 --> 03:11:18,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to talk about swallowing saw blades and that was kind of neat.

3114
03:11:18,269 --> 03:11:19,469
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty extreme.

3115
03:11:19,489 --> 03:11:21,030
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty extreme, I'll give you that.

3116
03:11:22,196 --> 03:11:23,656
[SPEAKER_06]: House of the Dead Overkill

3117
03:11:40,762 --> 03:11:59,712
[SPEAKER_06]: 1299 euros or pounds or something like that I think it's euros and it's um part of they're also going to have a big bang box um set that's going to have both that and uh two of those guns which they're calling the hand cannons and they look like pretty sweet guns so that's kind of cool um

3118
03:12:01,383 --> 03:12:02,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is pretty big news.

3119
03:12:03,224 --> 03:12:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIII is coming to Japan in 2009.

3120
03:12:07,747 --> 03:12:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we'll be making it out overseas and everywhere else April 2010.

3121
03:12:13,471 --> 03:12:17,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So April 2010 is the earliest that we'll see Final Fantasy XIII.

3122
03:12:18,014 --> 03:12:26,060
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I hope that we'll see it a lot sooner because I will be importing the Blu-ray Special Edition for Advent Children.

3123
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:27,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that so bad, but...

3124
03:12:28,717 --> 03:12:30,717
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have to wait until 2010, then we have to wait until 2010.

3125
03:12:30,757 --> 03:12:31,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's not surprising.

3126
03:12:31,758 --> 03:12:32,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little disappointing.

3127
03:12:34,018 --> 03:12:38,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially because we do these things on the OLR forums, the annual predictions.

3128
03:12:39,620 --> 03:12:46,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob with 2Bees does this thread every year, and he does a really good job tabulating and everything, and everybody makes their predictions for the year, and we see how many of them come true.

3129
03:12:46,441 --> 03:12:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already lost on two of my predictions.

3130
03:12:48,462 --> 03:12:50,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I said there'd be a new Rock Band game this year.

3131
03:12:50,322 --> 03:12:53,843
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not going to be, they've already said, because of the Beatles game, which makes sense.

3132
03:12:53,883 --> 03:12:57,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have been smarter and known that, that they don't need a new Rock Band game with the Beatles game.

3133
03:12:58,164 --> 03:12:59,985
[SPEAKER_07]: and also now this.

3134
03:13:00,085 --> 03:13:05,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I said that Final Fantasy XIII would finally come out this Christmas and now it looks like it's going to be next year.

3135
03:13:05,567 --> 03:13:07,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I might get half credit for the Japanese release date though.

3136
03:13:08,248 --> 03:13:15,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and like I said, I'll try to import the Blu-ray for Advent Children because it's going to have a demo on it.

3137
03:13:16,044 --> 03:13:17,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally wanted to check that out too.

3138
03:13:17,645 --> 03:13:18,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I might even import it for that.

3139
03:13:18,725 --> 03:13:19,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

3140
03:13:19,686 --> 03:13:21,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the demo is supposed to be like two hours long, they said.

3141
03:13:21,686 --> 03:13:22,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is pretty crazy.

3142
03:13:23,567 --> 03:13:25,148
[SPEAKER_06]: CES09.

3143
03:13:25,228 --> 03:13:29,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft has been... Apparently was talking to somebody.

3144
03:13:31,331 --> 03:13:32,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

3145
03:13:55,001 --> 03:14:03,363
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see here also there's going to be a special edition Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children PS3 coming out in Japan.

3146
03:14:04,083 --> 03:14:10,065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in cloud black and it's got a nice little symbol there etched into the front of it.

3147
03:14:11,165 --> 03:14:13,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the 160 gigabyte PS3s.

3148
03:14:14,046 --> 03:14:21,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll also come with it's got a Final Fantasy 13 trail version set which is with

3149
03:14:23,960 --> 03:14:25,562
[SPEAKER_06]: The Final Fantasy XIII demo, I guess.

3150
03:14:25,642 --> 03:14:28,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Blu-ray Disc Set.

3151
03:14:29,326 --> 03:14:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Which will be available for 49,980 yen.

3152
03:14:31,088 --> 03:14:31,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Approximately $551 US.

3153
03:14:31,989 --> 03:14:32,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And... Very cool.

3154
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently...

3155
03:14:43,035 --> 03:14:45,440
[SPEAKER_06]: FFVII Advent Children Complete English Language Options

3156
03:14:54,469 --> 03:14:54,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

3157
03:14:54,910 --> 03:14:55,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

3158
03:14:57,292 --> 03:14:58,473
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some funny stuff.

3159
03:14:58,553 --> 03:15:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem Critical Hour is coming along quite well, says 3D Realms.

3160
03:15:03,878 --> 03:15:05,920
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not remember what these are, actually.

3161
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:11,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Hour was the game that they're putting out on the PSP.

3162
03:15:12,045 --> 03:15:15,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new game trilogy, I guess.

3163
03:15:15,629 --> 03:15:18,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also having some on the DS as well.

3164
03:15:19,571 --> 03:15:23,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But all I have to say is, finish Duke Nukem forever first!

3165
03:15:23,986 --> 03:15:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop going on to new things!

3166
03:15:26,906 --> 03:15:29,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Finish one, then you get to work on new games.

3167
03:15:51,401 --> 03:15:59,749
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the last thing EA is prepping a new game called Spore Hero and of course it will be related to Spore it's coming out on Wii and DS alright

3168
03:16:00,501 --> 03:16:00,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

3169
03:16:01,662 --> 03:16:06,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then and get everybody's final thought and get on out of here.

3170
03:16:06,384 --> 03:16:10,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, our stream is crashing left and right and we're starting to lose listeners because of it.

3171
03:16:10,325 --> 03:16:13,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a sign that we've probably been running too long.

3172
03:16:13,607 --> 03:16:14,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.

3173
03:16:15,247 --> 03:16:17,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, we're going to go get around everybody's final thought.

3174
03:16:17,328 --> 03:16:20,489
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to say thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.

3175
03:16:20,609 --> 03:16:23,771
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've enjoyed what you've heard, please tell two friends about our show.

3176
03:16:23,991 --> 03:16:28,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It's how we spread the word about our show and get it out there, the little program that we do.

3177
03:16:29,133 --> 03:16:30,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Victoria and I'm young and I'm single and I'm sexy I'm beautiful

3178
03:16:42,407 --> 03:16:48,491
[SPEAKER_07]: and giving her opinion and everything, especially in the first part of the show, although she started to tune out during the second half of the show.

3179
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:48,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

3180
03:16:50,252 --> 03:16:51,734

[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

3186
03:17:00,379 --> 03:17:02,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3187
03:17:02,941 --> 03:17:05,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know when the website's going live.

3188
03:17:06,021 --> 03:17:07,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The website, I don't know.

3189
03:17:07,602 --> 03:17:08,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get too excited.

3190
03:17:08,923 --> 03:17:10,004
[SPEAKER_07]: It might not be until next month.

3191
03:17:10,044 --> 03:17:13,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to make sure Deepman and Jason get it worked out.

3192
03:17:13,826 --> 03:17:15,547
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will try to get it up fast.

3193
03:17:16,008 --> 03:17:17,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do whatever I can to get it working.

3194
03:17:18,349 --> 03:17:18,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

3195
03:17:19,430 --> 03:17:19,650
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3196
03:17:20,351 --> 03:17:21,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

3197
03:17:23,233 --> 03:17:23,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cold in here.

3198
03:17:24,690 --> 03:17:25,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I haven't been running the heater.

3199
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:26,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's getting cold in here.

3200
03:17:27,211 --> 03:17:27,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

3201
03:17:27,891 --> 03:17:28,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

3202
03:17:28,891 --> 03:17:32,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And my final thought is I need some Orogel.

3203
03:17:33,233 --> 03:17:33,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Wah.

3204
03:17:34,173 --> 03:17:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo-hoo.

3205
03:17:34,893 --> 03:17:35,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Cry.

3206
03:17:36,033 --> 03:17:36,293
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3207
03:17:37,054 --> 03:17:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

3208
03:17:37,534 --> 03:17:43,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys once again for staying with us all night long, especially you live listeners that have suffered through several outages tonight.
