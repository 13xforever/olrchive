Forged Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, January 25th, 2009, GameTap removes some of its free games,

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Dawn of War 2 disappears from GameStop, and did we both finally win a movie award?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
We do tape live on Sunday nights every week at AllGames.com,

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
and it's all brought to you by myself, Rob Roberts, and my wonderful co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Worship me!

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Back after a week of absence. What were you doing in your week of absence?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Writing the charter for my cult.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Wonderful. Yes, this is a conversation carried over from Bobby's show,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
which can be heard before us Sunday nights live.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Official drink is Propel.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
And DarkSakura apparently is going to be fixing the economy by starting a cult,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and somehow this is going to fix the economy.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
My plan is brilliant.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Because the companies aren't making enough money because the consumers aren't buying

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
because they don't have money because they've been losing the equity in their home

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
and going into foreclosure and blah, blah, blah.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So I'll tell you what.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Give me all your money.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
I will go and pump money back into the economy on my wild spending spree.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
Help the banks by getting the biggest mortgage ever, which I will be paying off with your money, of course.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
And personally revitalizing our bank and credit system.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
And what about everybody else who's broke because they gave you money? What are they going to do?

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Well, when the economy's better high, they'll get new money.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
And jobs. They'll be jobs to accommodate my shopping spree.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You know, whenever I think about cults...

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
And there's more.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
With the stuff I decide not to keep any longer, after my wild shopping spree,

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
I put it back on eBay, and all these people who now have jobs to accommodate my needs

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
can buy the stuff off of eBay. It's brilliant.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And I replenish my money.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Every time I think about cults, because we are a video game show.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I know you didn't mention a single video game in your cult,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
but maybe that's what you'll spend money on is pinball machines or something.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
But I think of the cult in Earthbound. Do you remember that?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
God, I can't remember the name of them, but they wore the little purple things.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
They all looked like eggplants or whatever, and they spoke in the funny language.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Does anybody remember what I'm talking about?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I know the chat room must at chat.orangelandsradio.com.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Somebody will name it for me.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Earthbound. You went to Happy Happy Cult. Wasn't that their name? Happy Happy Village or something?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I think that was it. It was the Happy Happy Cult.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Loki, are you a member of the Happy Happy Cult?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
No, I'm not playing Earthbound.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Earthbound's a great game.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm sure it is.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
What have you been up to this week, Loki?

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Still trying to get Grand Theft Auto 4 to work on my PC.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, that's right. You were quite a difficult piece of that.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Basically, what it comes down to now is I'm going to have to actually reinstall Windows 4 to work.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
That's quality developing right there. Quality.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
When a game requires you to reinstall your operating system for it to work correctly.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Good job. Kudos, Rockstar.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Have you thought about calling customer support or anything just to see me?

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
I post on GTA forums and they have Rockstar Toronto is actually there helping people.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Are other people-

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Not me, though.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Are other people having the problems you're having?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, some people are having the same problems I'm having. No one's helping them either.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And people are also having other problems.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
There's a new patch that came out that caused even more problems. So awesome.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
What are you talking about? There's no problem.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Sweep under the rug.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, it's less than 1%.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
See, they pulled the old Microsoft bit where it's less than 1% of our customers are having problems with Grand Theft Auto 4.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It's just they have to be the most vocal of the bunch.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
How does it feel to be less than 1%, Loki?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I- I'm special.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I have three words for you.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Better Business Bureau.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I have more words for you.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm pirating their next game and I'm not buying their shit anymore.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I- See, listen, I was originally-

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
How is that gonna hurt them?

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
It's not. It's gonna save me spending 60 bucks on a game that will work for a month and then stop working.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
That's magically as if, you know, for no reason whatsoever.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
They don't care.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
That's money that could potentially go into your cult.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Hey, listen, now-

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
But, the first rule of my cult is stab in the face anyone who wrongs you.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm just saying that-

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Figuratively or literally, please.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay, now I'm just saying originally I had pirated this game, okay?

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I was gonna do that, but you know what, I'm like, it's a quality game, they deserve my money.

04:55.000 --> 05:05.000
So I went out and purchased a retail copy of this game and so I could, you know, install mods, you know, play online if I really wanted to, but I wasn't really interested in that.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I just really wanted to, you know, I felt that this deserved my money.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Goes to show you what happens when I pay for stuff.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Remember the last game that I paid for?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Spore.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh yeah, that sucked.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
It sucked really hard because it's crap.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Because they're like, it's so awesome, you gotta buy it.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And then you buy it and you're like, ha, it's crap.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Ha ha, we tricked you.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
So if it's so much crap, why are you not really gonna do anything about it then?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Cause there's nothing I can do.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
There's plenty you can do.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay, I can call their customer service and they go, oh, I don't know what's wrong.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, you can, you know, send a letter in to the CEO.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
You can write the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Or he can get on his podcast and tell hundreds of people of the, or I guess.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm just saying, okay.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm overestimating our list.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
He can tell dozens of people.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
This is the problem I have is that people, I'm just gonna say it for the FUs.

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm just saying though, I mean, I've been more than, more than, I've been more than generous to them, I should say.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Cause, I mean, you know, at our work we have, you know, a LAN set up and everything.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
And I've purchased copies of Grand Theft Auto IV on 360 for each one of those systems.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
That's five different systems that have that game.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I think overall I purchased about six copies of that game.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I mean, I'd say that's more than generous.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
And the fact that I was even, you know, generous enough to go beyond that and purchase the PC version of the game.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
The least they could do is help me out with my problem.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
They don't seem to give a shit.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So you know what? I don't give a shit either.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And the next game that they put out, that's Grand Theft Auto, that happens to be on PC.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
You better believe I'm not gonna pay for it.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Now when it comes on 360, yes I will.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I'm just like that.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I gotta buy it for the 360 cause it's awesome.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
And yes, and sadly enough, I'll probably be buying the download content that'll be coming out for Grand Theft Auto IV.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And I may even buy the download content for each one of those systems.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That's $100 right there.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
But you know what? I don't know.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
I think unless they come out, cause basically what it is now, it's oh well something in your system is causing it not to work.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Really? Thanks for narrowing it down to something in my computer causing it not to work.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I was worried that it might have been the birds outside.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
You don't want to see me on the phone with customers.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
It's basically, you know, they told me, you know, people on the forums said, okay, uninstall all this stuff and reinstall it.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
So I did all that. I did everything that could possibly affect this game.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Unstalled it, reinstalled it, all my codecs, everything.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Literally, I'm gonna have to reinstall Windows in order to get it to work.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Which is fine cause, you know, I don't really care.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
But it's annoying. I even went and reinstalled and reinstalled Service Pack 3 just to see if maybe that would fix it.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But of course not.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh, and it doesn't help either. That takes 40 minutes to install Grand Theft Auto.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Whew, alright. Well, hey, our chat room at chat.orangelandrater.com is making a request.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Of course, we always like to have the chat room involved during our show tonight.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
A request that if Loki does decide to call customer service, please, please record it and play it on a future episode.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
But here's my thing. Here's my thing. I don't want to go too far into this.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
But, I mean, is calling customer service, I mean, a lot of those reps, no disrespect, they do a very thankless job, you know, but...

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I did customer service.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Right, and I teach for it. But, you know, they're kind of given a script. They're given limits.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
They can't change a lot at their level. If he really wants something to happen, he's gonna have to get attention of people upstairs.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm going through the right routes. I'm going through GTA forms and they have the developers on there actually reading people's comments.

08:37.000 --> 08:51.000
So they're supposedly looking into things. They're supposed to also be, you know, PMing people to get, you know, their system specs and the DX dialog, you know, output and that kind of stuff to see what exactly is causing problems.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Because I'm not the only one that's having these issues and this last patch was supposed to fix it, but it hasn't.

08:57.000 --> 09:08.000
It made it load a little bit further, you know, I got past three different character screens and then it flashed the fourth one and then stopped working instead of just, you know, freezing on the third one.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
But I don't get why I don't change anything in my system. It works for a month and then all of a sudden it stops. Period.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
Just stops working and no matter how many times I uninstall it, reinstall it, do whatever, it does not work. That doesn't make any sense.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Dark Soccer is dying to make a comment and then we gotta move on to gaming weeks.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
It's actually about customer service. Rob, have you done customer service yourself?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, it's the industry I work in.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But have you answered the calls?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Yes, of course. I have to to be able to teach him.

09:37.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, not necessarily my work, but I did customer service and I can actually say that script is like only good for the first month of the job and after that a good rep is gonna know their shit, know who to go to, and know how to solve your problem.

09:52.000 --> 10:03.000
No, no, no. Don't get me wrong. I mean, especially, you know, at the place I work, we've got great reps. You know, I just say that a lot of times, unfortunately, their hands are a little tied in what they can and can't do.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
There's certain processes, procedures, rules in place. There's only so much they can do and they'll go, they'll do whatever it takes for the people on the line.

10:09.000 --> 10:20.000
But, you know, again, I don't work in the video game industry either and neither do you and I think our industries give us a lot more leeway in those types of freedoms than a video game company. You know what I mean?

10:20.000 --> 10:30.000
It's a little easier for you to investigate a loan or my people to get claims paid that need to be or whatever than to fix a game. You know what I mean?

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
I don't know if that makes sense, but, so, I don't know. I just think in their world it's a lot more limiting.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
A, if you work in that world and care to disagree with us, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, I would actually like to know how video game customer support goes.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I'd actually like to hear more about that too. So, something

10:53.000 --> 11:06.000
I still think that there's way too many parallels from one to the other and I've talked to people who've done tech support that there's ways to get the help and ways to get the official answer.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
Alright, let's move on. We've got to talk about our gaming weeks and usually we start off, each of us talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.

11:14.000 --> 11:23.000
But, I want to deviate a little bit tonight. I'm actually going to let Loki start tonight because he checked out a game that I think a lot of our long-time listeners are going to be interested in because it's a music-based game.

11:23.000 --> 11:34.000
He kind of got a sneak preview at this. I have not heard a lot about this game outside of this show, but, I don't know, Loki, does it look to be something I should be keeping an eye on?

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
Yes, definitely. It's a brand new game. A lot of people may be familiar with DJ Hero, which is supposedly coming out from Activision later this year.

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
There was another music game that's also turntable-based that's going to be coming out from a company called Genius Products and they don't really put out a lot of games.

11:54.000 --> 12:11.000
They just started getting into game distribution. They're mainly a movie publisher, but now getting into game publishing, they did the Line Rider game, I believe, and the Halo Interactive board game.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
But, they are getting beyond that to a music game called Scratch the Ultimate DJ.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
Now, what this game is, what makes it kind of unique, is the game relies a lot on actual turntable techniques.

12:26.000 --> 12:36.000
What's kind of cool, they showed us a video of it because, unfortunately, the original plan was they were going to bring a demo or something for us to try out.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Unfortunately, the game is too early in development that they couldn't do that.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
They actually had footage that they showed me that I can't share with you guys, unfortunately, because it's also very, very, very early.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
They'll have stuff later on that they'll be rolling out in either February or March detailing the game.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
They've got a really good marketing plan behind it, so there's going to be a lot of footage on this all of a sudden.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
What's kind of cool, though, the game itself plays a little bit like Beatmania.

13:05.000 --> 13:16.000
It's got the different bars coming down the screen that you've seen in most music games, and there's a side of the screen that shows the turntable section.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
They're highlighted and stuff.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
What is kind of unique about it, though, is the controller itself, which is made by Newmark.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
I mean, it's actually made by Newmark. It's not a licensed product from Newmark. It's literally created by Newmark.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
It's actually a turntable that looks like a Newmark turntable.

13:36.000 --> 13:49.000
Then you've got five keys next to it, kind of like a Beatmania arcade-style controller, except they're all in a line, kind of like the Guitar Hero fret buttons, but a lot bigger and kind of nicer looking.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Next to that is actually a crossfader.

13:52.000 --> 14:06.000
So during those sections that you can scratch in, you can actually do real turntable techniques with it, and the game will pick up on that and award you points and award you saying,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
okay, you did this, this, and this, you know, type of techniques.

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
What's also cool about the game is you will not get penalized for hitting keys when there's not keys in the game.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
They actually encourage you to kind of remix or, you know, freestyle a little bit, which is kind of cool.

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
So, yeah, right now it's set to come out in June. It's going to be about $100 retail, and PlayStation 3 and 360.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
It looks pretty awesome. It's pretty much everything that you would expect from Beatmania.

14:38.000 --> 14:49.000
You know, the controllers, ambidextrous. They're going to have like 60 songs. It's licensed hip-hop and R&B, which may not be for everybody, you know,

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
and that kind of turned me off of it at first, until I actually saw it being played, and it's pretty cool.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
Some of the tracks that I think they have confirmed for it so far, like Flashing Lights by Kanye West.

15:03.000 --> 15:14.000
Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Peter Piper by Run DMC, Hot in Here by Nelly, Milkshake by Killas.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Awesome. Awesome. Instant Sale.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
Friends by Houdini, Party Like a Rockstar by Shop Boys, and Don't Sweat the Technique by Aaron B. and Ray Kim.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
So basically, you're talking about a game. It looks like Beatmania, you know, and a question coming from our chat is, you know,

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
GS68 is making the Konami Will Sue joke. Do you think it's going to be something that's too close to comfort for Konami?

15:40.000 --> 15:49.000
Their controller is different enough. I don't know if they consume because of the controller, since it's not just the way it functions is a little bit different.

15:49.000 --> 15:59.000
Also, the interface itself is different than Beatmania. The way the screen looks, it's almost like a candy cane, I guess,

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
because kind of towards the left side of the screen, you'll see like a turntable spinning, and the notes come off the turntable,

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
and they kind of turn around, and then they come down like Beatmania would.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
But, I mean, it's similar in the way it's played, but I don't know. I mean, I'm sure they'll try to sue them anyways, but...

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
Part of the way you describe it, though, makes me think that like Beatmania and Kraken DJ spawned.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, with the whole crossfader and everything, it does kind of sound like it's like a mix of them.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
And the scratching, it's like a love baby of the two. But no techno.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
You know, we have a lot of people in our chat who are in that Beatmania mindset thinking like,

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
oh, if this game's going to have like a Beatmania-style controller, you know, I see Acidic Vampire says, I want techno.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
But that's the thing. Techno does not have scratching in it, usually. That's why they basically stuck to hip-hop.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Could do, though, good drum and bass.

16:50.000 --> 17:00.000
They could, and I don't see why they can't. I mean, it's just that they're really focusing on music that's going to be scratchable,

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
that you would hear scratching in. Another cool thing about it is they're going to have a microphone port on it

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
that you'll actually be able to sample yourself or whatever and mix it into the actual songs.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
A wiggity-wiggity-whack. I could see myself yelling that in the microphone over and over.

17:19.000 --> 17:28.000
And some other cool stuff they were saying that they're going to have, you know, some sort of way to play back your performances or something,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
which is kind of cool.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
You know what's funny? Does anybody remember way back, I know you guys will, but, you know, kind of asking the listeners,

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
does anybody remember way back, like when Beatmania first came out in the US?

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm not talking about the game they put on the PlayStation 2. I mean when they actually put the five key machines in arcades.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Does anybody remember what they called Beatmania when they put the five key machines in arcades?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Hip-hop mania.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
That's right. And was it hip-hop mania? Not at all.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
But what's funny, the game he's describing sounds like it could be called hip-hop mania, which is kind of funny.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Things have a way of coming full circle like that.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Hey, there were those of us who were still playing BM98 back in those days.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Anyway, there's a lot of non-music game people that are like, what the hell are these people talking about?

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
It looks cool. They're going to have a lot of tie-ins with, you know, like the G-unit clothing and stuff like that.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
It's just, it's very, I don't know, it looks good. I'd say definitely give it a shot.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out about it as it gets closer.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
They're going to be really marketing this pretty heavily, and I think it's going to be a really awesome game.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
Because when you consider, now because I kept asking them about like DJ Hero and stuff like that.

18:36.000 --> 18:45.000
The difference between them and DJ Hero is DJ Hero is going to be more, basically the aim of the game is to mix two songs together.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Whereas this is actually about scratching. So, I don't know, it looks pretty cool though so far.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
Let me ask the chat room about this though. I'm going to ask a question to chat and we'll read some of your responses in a minute.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Because I know we have a lot of people that have been listening to us for a long time, so we have a lot of music game fans in chat.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
Does this game interest you even though the music may not be the type of music you're used to in these types of games?

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Because I don't think we've had like a real, I should say one that can be taken very seriously.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I mean we've had the what, Move It To The Streets or whatever that game was called.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
The Dance Battle or whatever. And we had that one random Xbox Live Arcade game.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm talking about, you know, this sounds like it's going to be pretty, chat room are you interested in this game even though it's going to be hip hop and not techno?

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
Chat room. And I ask the same question to Jamie. Is this of interest to you?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Not really. I probably won't play it. I mean I'll probably check it out.

19:41.000 --> 19:57.000
But I actually really didn't like Kraken DJ. And I really have no interest in any of that music. Except for like, you know, the exception of the two pretty classic ones mentioned.

19:57.000 --> 20:11.000
You know, Run DMC and Rakim. But I really have no interest in that music at all. I really have no interest in the hip hop lifestyle really.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't care for it. I don't really have an interest in the game.

20:16.000 --> 20:26.000
That's my big sticking point too is that, you know, it's like I have an appreciation for some of that, you know, like you say, like the classics and some of those and even the silly dance songs like Milkshake and stuff.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It used to be cool.

20:28.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah. But I don't know. I kind of worry. A hundred dollars is a lot to ask. But I'll probably give it the benefit of the doubt. I'm definitely interested in checking it out. I really want to check it out.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
Because, you know, if the interface works well and it's put together well, that's when I think we need to lobby these people to do the techno one we want. I don't know.

20:45.000 --> 20:57.000
Well, I mean, and they're going to have not all of the music is going to be licensed. I think some of it they're actually making. So very well, I don't see why they couldn't do like house music or something like that that would have, you know, scratching in it.

20:57.000 --> 21:10.000
I mean, it's just I know that there can be some techno songs they could have scratching it, but you would normally not hear a techno artist if you went to a club scratching out stuff with it. It just wouldn't make any sense.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Sure.

21:11.000 --> 21:25.000
You know, and song lists are so critically important in music games, too. You know, why didn't any of us buy Karaoke Revolution Country Edition? Because none of us really rabidly listen to country. You know, it's always going to be a big selling point for music games.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
It makes it very interesting when you're kind of like a music game fan.

21:28.000 --> 21:42.000
I mean, we're literally like five months away from this. So, I mean, there's going to be a lot coming out about it. You'll be able to form your opinions based on what you see at that point. I mean, but right now, I mean, it's so very early. So but it looks good so far.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
The name of the game one more time, Loki?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Scratch the Ultimate DJ.

21:45.000 --> 21:57.000
All right. Let me read some comments from chat and then we'll get into our gaming weeks with Dark Soccer in just a moment. Again, I asked the chat room, are you interested in this game? Does this game sound interesting to you, even though it's not the typical type of music you've seen in other music games that have come out here?

21:57.000 --> 22:12.000
YYR says, yes, it does. Act Def says, it does. But what's turning me off is the price. Let's see. Buchi Kawa says, personally, I play beat big games for the music, but I have a broad interest when it comes to music. I'll play it.

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
YYR says, I would like spending the music that we could actually hear in a club. Tiger class is probably not because I don't listen to hip hop.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
Biohaze says, I would only be interested if you could load music from your hard drive and play it from that. Otherwise, not interested. Frisbee says, simply, no, not interested.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, if they had like an in-store demo or something, I'd at least try it once.

22:34.000 --> 22:45.000
Liu Shen says, not really. Songs kill it for me, to be honest. Acidic Vampire says, I agree with Dark Tetsuya. I'd have to try it out first before I can judge it, but I'm not really into hip hop, but it could be fun.

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
Misty says, I'd probably get it eventually when I can eBay it for like half price. Milkshake is an in-joke bonus for me. There you go.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
Two words would actually swing it a little bit for me. Beastie Boys.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
How about 911 is a joke?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
That's some old school public enemy.

23:02.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, I mean, there's going to be like 40 some songs and that's only like six of them. I mean, like I said, it's five months away. And we don't even know anything about like DJ Hero. I mean, that game could be completely lame. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be much different other than exchanging out a turntable for, you know, the guitar controller.

23:22.000 --> 23:32.000
We'll be very interested to see what develops. We definitely have an eye on this game. Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about games we've had our eyes on this week, or in Dark Soccer's case, the past two weeks. How was your gaming week?

23:32.000 --> 23:45.000
Actually, it was pretty bare because I started school this week. I pretty much just played some Fable and a little Ragnarok and that was it. I just really have not had a whole lot of time to play much of anything else.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
School does that, doesn't it?

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
Oh, I played some Katamari on my phone, but I kept getting interrupted. So I haven't gotten past the first stage. Oh, and lots of solitaire.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Awesome. Loki.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
And I finished a book.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
What's that?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
V, the second generation.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
How was that?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
That was freaking amazing.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You've talked a lot about V.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Book review.

24:07.000 --> 24:22.000
Okay, quick. For those that don't know what V is. V, it was a series that came on in the early 80s about these visitors from outer space who came trying to be, you know, on the surface they were friendly. It turned out they were trying to steal all of our water and eat everybody.

24:22.000 --> 24:34.000
And they were really lizard people underneath. And you can actually read the DVDs, but the creator of the first series did not like how they continued the series when they did the TV series in V, The Final Battle.

24:34.000 --> 24:42.000
So he actually wrote a book about what the world would be like 20 years after what he envisioned going on happened.

24:42.000 --> 24:52.000
And it's, it's like watching, it reads like watching the episodes. It's very, very visual and, you know, in far as how it's been in the description.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
And it's just a fantastic book. So if anyone's a fan of V, get the book, just get it, get it, get it.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
And yes, Robert Englund was in V. He was in there as Willy and that character is in the book.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
That was a question from our chat room, acidic vampire. Very, very nice.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Who knew that you were going to get a book review listening to Orange Librator tonight?

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm fucking literal, okay? I love reading. Books are fun.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Books are fundamental.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
Books are fun to burn. Just kidding. How was your gaming week, Loki, outside of...

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Not very, not very well. It's just, uh, Grand Theft Auto IV. That's basically it. Just played it at work and really went...

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
But not on your PC.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, most definitely not on my PC.

25:33.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, that's basically it. Unfortunately, I wanted to play some other things. I keep trying to go back to Fable 2.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
And I really need to finish, and there's no way I'm going to finish it in time,

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
Lost Odyssey because, god damn it, if Star Ocean is not coming out in like a month from now,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm not going to ever finish Lost Odyssey.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
All right. I didn't know you were a big Star Ocean fan.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm not a big Star Ocean fan, but it looks awesome, so I've not played any of the Star Ocean games.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
The first one was okay. I didn't finish it.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
I guess I'm the only one that actually played quite a few games this week.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I pretty much spent all of my gaming time on one game,

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
but I actually spent a lot of time, like for me, a large amount of time on Fable 2,

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
which is kind of one of those games I meant to check out last year, but you know, the holidays are so busy.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
There were some games I said, look, I'm not going to get to these games until January, February.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
Loki was good enough to loan me a copy of Fable 2, a legit copy, thank you,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
based on what we talked about earlier in the show. This was a legit copy.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It's a lot of fun. I'm having way more fun with this one than I did the first game.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Are you being evil?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
No, I'm being good.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I'm ambivalent.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I'm going to play it once good and then once evil, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Like, I really love how the world's very open, but this was the hilarious thing.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
This struck me as great because I started playing it right after we wrapped last week's show,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
and one of the big things, I know you weren't here, Dark Soccer, but one of the big things,

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
and Rice Princess was here, and her and Loki got into it over the story about Nintendo

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
and how Nintendo is going to be putting this, you know, they patented, I should say,

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
not necessarily putting this in, but patenting this mode where you're going to be able to just,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
at a touch of a button, get little videos that help you with the game

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
and even just skip right over certain parts of the game or watch them played for you.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's like basically turning games into movies or whatever,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
and Loki was very vehemently against this, saying, like, I'm not going to buy the gown.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
But what struck me as funny is that Fable 2 is almost one step away from that

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
because that little gold path really makes it easy to know where to go

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
and what kind of stuff to do.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
But you have the option of turning it off.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
That is true.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
You can turn it off, and you can also turn this other thing off we were talking about last week.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
Until I learned the world well enough, I actually kind of needed it.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I still definitely need it, but I veer from the path all the time

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
because I'm always afraid I'm going to miss treasure or something.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
But the fantastic thing about this game is it reminds me a lot of Oblivion,

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
which is a game I really loved because there was just like an open world,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
do whatever you want, go wherever type of thing.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
But, you know, it has that multiplayer aspect to it,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
and it's kind of in a much different art style, a much different presentation.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, the most important question about this, Rob, what did you name your dog?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Wienerschnitzel.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I named mine Dumbass.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Did you?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Because the dog is stupid.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Bark, bark, bark.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
What? I already got that treasure box, stupid.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
But I don't know. I'm having a lot of fun with the game,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
just kind of running around and doing stuff and dancing for villagers

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
and trying to get people to marry me, although it hasn't been successful so far.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I guess I'm just not dancing enough or what.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
There's something that you need to do, Rob.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Huh.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
An achievement that you need to unlock, and this is one that Tiara told me about.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Okay.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
When you get the pelvic thrust emote, then you need to go to the sheriff in the marketplace,

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
strip naked, target him, and do the pelvic thrust.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
What happens? Do you get thrown in jail for a loop?

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
You find a thousand gold, and you get an achievement for it.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
Is the achievement called that really drives you insane?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I think it's just called the perv or something like that.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh, that's a pervert.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
And also, if you're playing with somebody and you dance together,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
then you get more achievements for playing with friends and stuff.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
That's cool. I haven't really been focused on the achievements.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I've gotten some just naturally playing through the game.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I got the achievement for being in an orgy. That was fun.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, the game's very adult.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
You can get the polygamist.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
I searched the drawers in one house, the cabinet or whatever, and I found a condom.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
I was like, wow, this game's kind of an adult nature.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
I was all in the ground and found condoms, okay?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It's so stupid. I was like, I don't want this. Ew.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Who would bury condoms in the ground?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
God damn it. Dumbass the dog.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Wow, dumbass the condom-sniffing dog. Amazing.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
That's it. We have to do a fable webcomic.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
The Adventures of Little Sparrow and Dumbass the Dog.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Although I'm going by Master Chief because I have the special edition.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
But yeah, I've just been having fun just kind of messing around.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
The one thing I notice about Fable 2, your character never has to sleep.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Like ever. That's kind of interesting.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
You can.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
You can, but my character's been awake for like two weeks straight now.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
If you have a house, Rob, I'll tell you this, and you haven't slept for a little while,

30:29.000 --> 30:36.000
you can get the animal magnetism as your status or something, and if you sleep it goes away.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Interesting.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So you can actually be like ugly.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
Right now my character needs to seriously buy a lot of celery.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
For what?

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
Because she's been eating meat pie, and she's a little chubby.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
ActDeafed in chat says, VGCats beat you to that webcomic idea and linked to VGCats recent edition.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I'll have to look at that a little later.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I haven't looked at VGCats in ages.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
The rest of my gaming week, I have some news that might come as a bit of a shock to some of our regular listeners.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
I made a conscious decision this morning to cancel my World of Warcraft account.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Why are you applauding that? Don't be mean.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I'll see how long it lasts.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
She's skeptic.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
No, but just, yeah, I cancelled it.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Why?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I don't need to say much more.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
Nothing anybody did in game, no drama, nothing like that, but just kind of the thing that it really was starting to feel like.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Even I was starting to go, I'm playing this game too much.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
So I pulled the plug, because I can do that.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I have enough self-control where I can do that.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
So I might not have much, but I had enough where I was finally just able to recognize, you know what, I'm starting to treat this like a second job.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
I need to step away.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
At what point would you just say done?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I need to level up in real life for a little while.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
So that's my big shocking news.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Yeah, we'll see how long it lasts.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
I know, be skeptical, it's fine, I deserve it.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Especially after quitting and going back to Final Fantasy XI.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
But I do want to make it clear, I did not quit World of Warcraft to go back to Final Fantasy XI.

32:08.000 --> 32:14.000
I can safely say, I have had lulls, but I'm still playing Ragnarok online!

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
After eight years, nine years, sorry.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
You know what, and now that I'm finally done with WoW for the foreseeable future, I should actually go check out Ragnarok for a little bit.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
But I also, here's the problem, I don't want to ditch one MMO and then just go play another MMO.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
The good thing about Ragnarok though, is that really, especially if you play on a private server, it's just like, oh whatever.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Okay, I'll do this, okay I'm done.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
It's not like, ugh, grind!

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh, actually Rob, I'll tell you what, I'm actually going to be joining another private server for a different game.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
We are starting V.O.L. Army on Phantasy Star Online.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Really?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Another Blue Burst server.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Are those still around?

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
They are, and they have all the Japanese quest updates, and people are translating them.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Weird.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Is it official, or is it all under the table bootleg stuff?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It's all under the table, but Sega don't care.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Huh.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Sega was actually letting you transfer some of your characters over.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
I really liked Phantasy Star Online, and that's not, you don't get that immersed in that, you know what I mean?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
It's something that you can sit and play through a little bit, you can play it all day if you want to, you can play it a little bit if you want to.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And you can also kick wrappies.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Which is fantastic, I hate wrappies.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
So, you should do that.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Alright.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
As I say 100, Matt's suggesting I go back to DDR.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Actually, I would love to play DDR, but they don't really have a machine around here.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
We should play.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
We'll see, we'll see.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Alright, anyway.

33:35.000 --> 33:42.000
Okay, we've talked plenty about gaming weeks, we're like more than 30 minutes into the show, we haven't even touched gaming news yet.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But first, I want to say housekeeping.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Real quick, housekeeping.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I think this is great.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio, part of what makes this show so special and has made this show last so long is the fan community we have behind the show.

33:55.000 --> 34:05.000
And the listeners that we have that come out on Sunday nights, you know, it might not be a huge group, you know, we don't have the following that some of these very large game spots, one ups, whatever the world have.

34:05.000 --> 34:15.000
But, we have a small, loyal following, and they have put together a new little game, it's called Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
And it's like a DDR clone thing, I believe it's like an expansion you actually load into StepMania or something like that.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix, the demo or what have you was released, and you can load it into StepMania.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
It's all these in-jokes from Orange Lounge Radio, but now in DDR.

34:31.000 --> 34:40.000
Like they have Still Alive as one of the songs, and then I don't know, some recording of me singing a DDR song from like five years ago somehow made it in here.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Whatever, if that's what you want to hear.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
They've got all these interesting little songs in there, so check that out.

34:45.000 --> 35:00.000
It's available right there on our web forums at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which also, if you weren't listening last week, there's a new Orange Lounge Radio website on the way, finally, and it's beautiful and we can't wait to get it launched.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Lies! Lies!

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I know, I won't believe it until I see it either.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Well, you did too.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Big thanks to everybody in our community that helped out with that, because we didn't do anything.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
We didn't.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
We did.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Well.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
That looks nice.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Yes, we approved it.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
But this is why Jamie thinks she can start a cult, because shit like this happens.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
She didn't ask for it.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It's been presented to her as a gift.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
It's an offering.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
They like to please me.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Is the Jamie pleased?

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
My people. My people.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
My people.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Alright, anyhow.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Let's go ahead and get into gaming news.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
We haven't talked to anything about gaming news yet.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Let's please get into that.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yes we did.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
What?

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, you know, we talked about Scratch.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
That was more of like a gaming exclusive.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Let's get into the news that you read everywhere else on the internet now.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Yes.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Of course, we are big fans of Katamari.

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
And, you know, Takahashi's brand new game, Noby Noby Boy, which I still don't know what exactly you have to do in this.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
But ironically, Katamari is not fans of us.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Yes.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
How I forget.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
How 2006 with me, I know.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I know.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Anyways, Noby Noby Boy will be available on the Playstation Network February 19th.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
It is coming out at a whopping five bucks.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Hell yeah.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
That's a price I could pay.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
The price is right.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Now, has anybody figured out what the hell you do in this game yet?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It looks like a really fucked up version of Snake.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
You, I guess, stretch and eat things.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
I don't know.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
It's kind of creepy.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
They should make a live action movie where, like, Noby Noby Boy is, like, devouring the world.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
It's like replace all the tripods from War of the Worlds with Noby Noby Boy.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That'd be hilarious.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
But anyways, no.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.000
No idea, but there is going to be some sort of thing that, I guess, Noby Noby Girl, which you don't see in the game.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
As you're playing the game and stretching and becoming longer, Noby Noby Girl gets longer as well.

36:59.000 --> 37:07.000
And all the combined, basically everybody in the world that's playing this game contributes to her getting longer.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
And after she gets, you know, so long, it unlocks a new level for you.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
So everybody is kind of working to unlock new levels.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's just a cute idea.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
That reminds me of old school, and here I go with the music game stuff again, but it reminds me of old school DDR Max 2.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
With the unlocks that, you know, you basically have to play the game over and over and over again.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
It's something the whole arcade community basically had to do to do the unlock.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Which I think is an excellent idea.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
And then they release the codes, which retarded the whole thing, basically, by releasing the codes.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
The world, the clouds look like tasty fluffy donuts.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Don't talk about food, you're going to make me hungry.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
Are they talking about releasing a demo or anything so I can at least try this game out?

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
Or am I just going to have to basically throw $5 into the wind and hope that, you know, just because it has the Katamari guy's name on it, it's cool?

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
There's no mention of a demo at all, but most of the PSN games do get demos.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Some do not, but most of them do.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
What ever happened to him making childhood playground equipment?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I think he has.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Interesting.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
And you know, I don't want to know what his playground equipment looks like.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Since he always comes up with these crazy things that eat things and roll over things and absorb them.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Probably kind of scary.

38:18.000 --> 38:25.000
It's like Takahashi's Borg playground equipment, become one, assimilate into the playground equipment.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, also on PlayStation Network, LittleBigPlanet has not released anything in a little while.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
They had that big Metal Gear Solid thing right before Christmas, and they were kind of on holiday break.

38:34.000 --> 38:41.000
But they are coming back, apparently, on January 26th, I believe, which is tomorrow?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I think that might be over in the UK, I don't know.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
But basically as of this next week, you're going to start to see some new costumes show up on the PlayStation Network.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It starts with the Chinese New Year costumes.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Oh, I see.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
They come out on January 26th, the rest of the costumes go with the regular updates.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
The cool thing is the Chinese New Year costumes are going to be free.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
They haven't said exactly how much the other packs are going to cost.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
Including a Groundhog Day costume, a Valentine's Day mini pack, an Ape Escape costume, and a Toro costume.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Both of which are from Japan.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And a Wipeout costume kit.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Which is kind of interesting.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
But what I also thought was, and caught my eye, was on January 29th, with the Groundhog Day costume,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
a God of War mini pack is coming out with a Kratos costume.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
And I don't know if that means a God of War level thing?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Which it sounds like it might be.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
That would be the download content that was available if you pre-ordered the game and game stuff.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That's the other thing I'm wondering.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Or is it just the...

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Well, I got one of those.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Even though I didn't pre-order the game, they gave me the slip anyway.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
It was only a costume.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It wasn't a lot of other stuff.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
There were stickers also that were with that, I think.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Were there? Maybe there were. I just don't remember getting them.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
Because remember the big controversy was someone made a level, a God of War level with those stickers

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
and it got banned from there because...

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
Well then if that's coming out, where's the Heavenly Sword and all the other stuff that was supposed to come out too?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
That's my other question.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Well...

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Later?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Hmm.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
I guess so.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
But I guess this would be a sign for those that got frustrated because they didn't get the pre-order bundle.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
They will be able to get the content, although you can betcha it's going to cost money.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
You can betcha.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
It'll cost money.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Especially in this economy.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
They gotta make money wherever they can, right?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I guess so.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
But, you know, money is...

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Wonderful.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
I was gonna say running short and the recession's hitting, you know.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
It's really on a worldwide basis.

40:28.000 --> 40:39.000
Eidos closed, they're actually closing their Manchester studio so that they can do just the big name games

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
instead of, you know, developing smaller ones.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
They wanna put as quoted as high quality titles that will deliver long term franchise value.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Whatever.

40:50.000 --> 40:57.000
So basically it's just 14 people and all they did was make mobile games.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
But...

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Still, for those 14 people, you know.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
And there's been a lot of, you know, just cutback news across the industry.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Every week we're reporting on something.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
And, you know, I know when we were doing the call earlier with Bobby Blackwell from the show before us,

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
you know, he's been joking about how his show is just one downer after another.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Not, you know, because it's bad content.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
But just the news has just been layoff, layoff, layoff.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
And then even, you know what, I don't know if you guys know this.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I think we talked about it a little on the show last week.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
But there was the Gamerscore blog at Xbox site that, you know, they did a lot for the community.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
And in fact, they were a big reason why we were able to get our gamer pic.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
They worked with all games for us to get our gamer pic on Xbox Live Marketplace.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
The team was laid off on Thursday.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Aww.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I know. Bummer, huh?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
That's just...

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
It's especially kinda, ooh, kinda hit you right in the gut when some of these people were famous for the podcasts

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
and vidcasts that they had developed that caught Microsoft's eye and hired them on.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
And some of them had, like, relocated themselves out there.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
And unfortunately, the world works in mysterious ways.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
But for what it's worth, I was laid off about seven years ago from a job I really enjoyed.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
It had nothing to do with gaming, but it was just, you know, the people and stuff.

42:12.000 --> 42:20.000
And getting laid off from that job led me to a job that eventually I liked so much more in, like, a full career.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
So, you know, I'm hoping that others, although, you know, are getting laid off and stuff,

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
hopefully when things settle down and the economy starts to come back,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
because what goes down must go back up eventually,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
people are gonna find something they really, really like and hopefully it won't be such a bad thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
So, that's my little philosophical moment for the day.

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
Sorry to be Miss Sunshine, but, you know, I'm just a ray of freaking sunshine today, aren't I?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
You're poopin' rainbows.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Somehow I don't think I'd be welcomed in your cult, pooping rainbows.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Sure, you can poop some rainbows in my cult.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Right. That's what I do.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
Rob is the high priest of rainbow poop.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Well, you make it sound so dignified.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Alright, anyway, sorry to those 14 folks. Hopefully they'll bounce back eventually.

43:09.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah. Well, in other fun news, there's another PSP firmware update.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Hooray!

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
You may remember there was an exploit that was recently discovered using GripShift

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
that would allow people to run homebrew on a PSP 3000 system.

43:31.000 --> 43:40.000
Well, you can imagine that this new 5.03 firmware addresses security vulnerabilities.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And basically it's layman's terms for we fixed the GripShift exploit, now you can't do it anymore.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
So if you want to run homebrew onto your, you know, PSP 3000, I suggest that you don't update your system yet

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
and just wait for them to find another way.

43:55.000 --> 44:02.000
The few more days before they figure out a way to put a custom firmware onto the PSP 3000 and then it won't matter anymore.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
How many days has it been since this came out?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Man, like a week or so.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Ooh, they're slackin'. The hacking community's slackin'.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Usually it takes them, what, like 48 hours to get around the latest Sony patch?

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
It's a new, firmwares aren't, I mean, making new firmwares is not a big deal.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
And a lot of times if it's something like this that just fixes one little vulnerability,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
they're not going to make a custom firmware for it.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
But developing a firmware for a new system like the PSP 3000, that's different.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Because they have to find a way to load it on there and that kind of stuff.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
So that's a little bit complicated.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
But once they do that, then, you know, any other updates, like say a 5.1 or 5.2 or something like that,

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
that change a few things, add a couple features, those they can incorporate pretty easy.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
Because they normally don't change the firmware too much from update to update.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
They're just adding different things or updating different PRXs and stuff.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
Alrighty. Well, you know, we don't get to report very often about PSP games that sound pretty interesting

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
because, you know, not to say there's like no interesting games on PSP, but it's been a little while.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
The PSP's been kind of lacking on a lot of the big games lately.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
But this game sounds kind of interesting. It's a game called Yusha 30, which translates to the name Brave 30.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
And apparently this showed up, I think, in a recent edition of Fumicha magazine.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
It's a countdown that everyone thought that was Zelda 2.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
Oh, okay. I see. Well, what it is, it actually ends up being a game that,

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
the 30 plays a significant thing in the game because you play four different games,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
but you play them 30 seconds a piece.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
Each of the four games has their own character, their own mode, like one of them's a side scroller,

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
one of them's a shooter, one of them's a strategy game, and one of them's an action game.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
But you play them 30 seconds at a time.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And there's, I guess, some type of clock in the middle of the screen,

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
and then after the 30 seconds is up, you go to another mini-game.

45:51.000 --> 45:58.000
Interesting. I don't know, but a game like WarioWare that's made up of nothing but 30 second games is actually kind of cool.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
So this could be very interesting. I don't know. It's very Japan.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
But I wonder if they'll bring it over here. Looks like it could be kind of cool.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
Maybe. Game Guru says, so it's WarioWare with less games. I don't know, not necessarily.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
It could be that, you know, the mini-games are all different types of side scrolling games,

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
different types of shooting games. But I would say it's, yeah, like a WarioWare meets an RPG,

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
like Act F says. Sounds a little bit like it. I don't know.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
It'll be hard to say until I can actually play the game, right?

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
So we'll see. That'll be coming out eventually.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
Well, here's something for our rumor mill, if we don't mind.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
Actually, I'm sorry, that's not a rumor mill. I was looking at the wrong story.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Well, no.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm just pissed off over my USB gloves. They're not warming up.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I have USB handwarming gloves.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
How exactly hot can USB handwarming gloves get?

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
They're freaking hot, because I got the cheap shitty ones that don't have any padding on the inside,

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
so it's like, I'm going to burn your palms now.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
So I have to use them, though, with my USB hub, and they don't get as hot using my hub.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Anyway, so how about some Wipeout love?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Wipeout?

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Actually, this actually is a rumor.

47:14.000 --> 47:26.000
Sony is considering bringing a port of Wipeout to the PSP, as you know.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
PS2.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
PS2, sorry.

47:29.000 --> 47:37.000
Bringing Wipeout to PS2 has actually got the information from a European release list,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
so hey, maybe that could be it.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
It's actually Wipeout Pulse, sorry.

47:42.000 --> 47:52.000
And also, other things on that particular list is one of them is Fat Princess to be out in March.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I really don't know.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
That game looked kind of cute, but again, it's one of those things where it's like,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
a lot of these PlayStation Network games, like we see trailers and teasers for them,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and it's like, WTF?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I need to know more about these games.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Like, put this up there, Fat Princess up there with this Noby Noby boy or whatever.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Kind of interesting.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
It's the PSP one? Is the PSP going to the PS2 again?

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Yes.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
Okay, that makes sense then.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Alright, well, we'll see.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I mean, I like the Wipeout games. I have the download one.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I have the NEGCon.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I'm glad to have another reason to use it.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Alright.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
Well, there's some other games coming out in case you can't wait until March.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
This week there's a few games, starting off with MLB Front Office Manager

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
Kind of the baseball take on NFL Head Coach.

48:47.000 --> 48:54.000
Also on PS3 and Xbox 360, Afro Samurai coming to us from Namco Bandai.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Looks pretty cool.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Very bloody.

48:58.000 --> 49:04.000
Movie tie-in game Coraline coming out on Wii and PS2.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I don't think there's a DS for that.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Looks okay.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
On DS, Imagine Cheerleader.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Yet another game geared towards girls.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
And then, kind of a neat little DS game, The Chase.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Felix meets Felicity.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
This is supposed to play a little bit like Kirby's Canvas Curse.

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
And basically you're running through a city trying to avoid things so you can get to your date.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Which is kind of neat.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Some other stuff.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh, there is a DS version for Coraline.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
How'd I miss that?

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
Nobunaga's Ambition Iron Triangle for PS2.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
They're still putting those games out.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Crazy.

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
And then probably one that a lot of people are waiting for, DJ Max Fever on PSP this week.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
And some games that people are not waiting for, Jojo's Fashion Show for the DS.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
What?

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
And Petz Horse's Ranch on DS as well.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
And also supposedly this week, although I think it's next week,

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Rygar the Battle of Argus on the Wii.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And that is it.

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
You know, I saw a song list for the DJ Max game show up on, I think it was Bamani Style,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
one of those websites that's still very exclusive on their music games.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
And I'm a little disappointed because I have to say this.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Look, I understand DJ Max has this very rabid fan base and is very popular,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
especially amongst those that like the K-pop and all this.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
But do they really want to sell this game or not?

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Because I'm looking at the song list and it's telling me they don't want to sell this game

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
to anybody who's not a hardcore music game fan.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
And I don't mean that as a slam against the game because, you know,

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
it's kind of a neat little 2DX clone for your PSP or whatever you want to call it.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
But there's not a damn licensed song on the list, at least that I can recognize.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
I read this whole list and I don't recognize any of these songs.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
I realize DJ Max fans recognize these songs from the Korean version of the game.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
But they already import the Korean version.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
You have to understand, you are like the minority of the minority of the minority of video game buyers.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
Like, the rest of those people, what is going to be the incentive for them to buy this game?

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
You know what I mean?

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
There is no incentive.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
And I know, and some people scoff.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
What, licensed songs and DJ Max?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Well, do they want to sell it or not?

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
I mean, I just, I'm kind of surprised that with them kind of trying to put out this game in the US,

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
they don't want to give me something I would know.

51:33.000 --> 51:39.000
Again, you know, I respect DJ Max, I understand why it has such a loyal following and all that stuff,

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
but there's, they're not going to win over any new people with this strategy.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Does that make sense?

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Yeah.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
So, I guess that's just me.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
Oh, I just like the ad before you start, Japanese release dates.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Yes.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
And this kind of ties in with Japanese release dates.

51:58.000 --> 52:06.000
I preordered the Blu-ray of Advent Children, the one with Final Fantasy XIII, the demos.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Nice.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And I'm having that bitch overnighted when it comes out.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Nice.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
In April.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
When does that come out?

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
April.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
That would be awesome.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
We will have Final Fantasy XIII.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Fire up the Justin TV for that again.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Hell yeah.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
Also, hey, speaking of Blu-ray, if Dark Soccer can do a book review, I can do a Blu-ray review.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
I bought on a whim, Repo, the genetic opera on DVD.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
It's awesome.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
It's from the guy who did Saw, and I think the Saw movies are kind of dumb.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Or no, I think he did Saw 2 and 3 and all that.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
I think those movies are kind of dumb, but this movie was awesome.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
It's like a 70s glam rock, but it's like an opera, and it's a horror movie.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
It's amazing.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Anyway, I just wanted to say that, because Usain Blu-ray reminded me of that.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
Comments from chat, I went on that thing about DJ Max, GS68, who I know is a big DJ Max fan.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
He called and did the review on the arcade version before on the show.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
GS68 says, it's DJ Max. I don't expect licensed song.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, I know you don't, but again, you're the minority.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Surely you understand that.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
It's just like back in the day, there weren't that many licensed songs in DDR.

53:09.000 --> 53:17.000
Whereas fans of DDR didn't care if they brought a DDR game over here that had no licensed songs,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
just all Konami artists.

53:19.000 --> 53:28.000
If you're trying to expand your audience, or bring it over to basically introduce people that haven't played DJ Max,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
it's easier to do that with songs that they may recognize.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
They can go, hey, this is in there, I can play this.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be successful.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
I mean, look at Beatmania, which tried to do that as well, and that didn't work out too well.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
So, I don't know.

53:45.000 --> 53:56.000
Well, okay, but the thing is, though, that, you know, again, DDR didn't really gain steam here until well into the PlayStation 2 mixes.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
You know what I mean? Like, we had that first mix on PlayStation, which was, you know, even the fans laughed at it.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Conomics, which was basically fan service, nothing but.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
Then we started getting into, like, you know, DDR Max on the PlayStation 2.

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
And then, really, I think probably about Max 2 was when we really started to see, like, a lot more licensed songs in the US DDR games,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
and that's also when the game took off.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Really took off.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
You know, the first few games showed it was probable.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Maybe the same thing will happen with DJ Max.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I don't know, but we'll see.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Anyway, sorry.

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
I think, if anything, what will help DJ Max will be DJ Max Technica when it comes out in the DS.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
And if they decide to bring that over here, because there's a lot more people that play the DS,

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
and, you know, if they decide, maybe throw in a couple, like, I'd say even five licensed songs,

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
and that'd probably be maybe enough to get people to kind of look at it.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Well, we'll see. We'll see.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Anyhow, a lot of music game talk tonight. It's almost like the OLR of yesteryear.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
Japanese release dates. Talking about games that are going to be coming out in Japan this week.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
Ninja Blade on the Xbox 360, January 29th.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
It's pretty fun.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
As well as Tom Clancy's End War and Tomb Raider Underworld come out on the Xbox 360.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Heading over to the PlayStation 3.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
Tomb Raider Underworld also shows up in Japan, as well as Lost Planet Extreme Condition getting a price reduction.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Again, that's in Japan.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
I anticipate there'll probably be a few people that want to import that sucker.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
That finally shows up on the Nintendo Wii. It's been forever.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Wasn't Crystal Chronicles supposed to be a launch game?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
And then it's kind of changed quite a bit.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
On the PlayStation 2, hey, funny, wouldn't you know it?

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
Dance Dance Revolution X gets its debut in Japan this week on the PlayStation 2.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And the Japanese versions are always better somehow.

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
AR Tenelico 2, Melody of Metaphalika Premium Edition comes out also in PlayStation 2.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
See, you didn't butcher that like I did last week.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
What?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
I said you didn't butcher that like I did last week.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Oh, sorry.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Soul Eater Battle Resonance comes out in Japan.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Do you want?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
What is this game all about?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
It's based off of a manga that's pretty hardcore cool.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Cool.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Trying to build, like, the ultimate weapon.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
Also a game called Harukanaro Toki no Naka de Yuminoko Hihashi comes out.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Special comes out as well. I have no idea.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
But that's from Koei, so I bet anything is some type of RPG.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.000
It was previously released on the Nintendo DS to celebrate Koei's 30th anniversary.

56:28.000 --> 56:33.000
Some more scenes that now have Voiced and all that, so it's a DS game upgrade.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
On the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time also gets its release on the DS this week in Japan.

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
Civilization Revolution gets a localized release for Japan, as well as a game called Vampire Kishi DS comes out from D3.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Sims 2 gets price reduction over in Japan if you haven't checked that out yet and you want to.

56:50.000 --> 57:02.000
And lastly, on the Sony PSP, Memories Off No. 5, Togerita Film comes out, as well as Princess Maker 4 Portable gets a price reduction.

57:02.000 --> 57:11.000
But probably the price reduction you're more interested in is Rockman Dash and Rockman Dash 2 coming out together in a value pack this week in Japan.

57:11.000 --> 57:19.000
Also, by the way, actually a couple other games, Soul Eater Battle Resonance gets released on the PSP and Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2.

57:19.000 --> 57:29.000
There you have it, your Japanese release dates. Let's move on over to the kingdom that is united, the UK.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Dork.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Yes.

57:32.000 --> 57:40.000
Actually, really not a whole lot of anything. Two games on the 30th, Cake Mania 2 and the chase Felix Meets Felicity.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Cake Mania.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
And Felix Meets Felicity. These sound like real winners.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Chase is supposed to be pretty good.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
If it's Felix the Cat.

57:50.000 --> 58:00.000
No, it's the Chase. It's that one that's coming out in the US also. It looked okay. It's different, but is different appreciated? Not always. I don't know.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Alright, there you have it, your UK release dates.

58:02.000 --> 58:10.000
Something else that might be appreciated is the new PopCap game, Pagle. Well, it's not that new, but it's new to Xbox Live Arcade.

58:10.000 --> 58:17.000
It's supposed to be coming out in the first half of 09, if I were to guess, probably March, since I think that's when the DS version comes out.

58:17.000 --> 58:25.000
And that's also when the new PopCap Arcade hits, Volume 2, which also features Pagle.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
So it makes sense that it would come out before that.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
Haha. There's logic for you.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
No word on what the price is going to be.

58:34.000 --> 58:41.000
Apparently people are thinking though that it's going to be 100 Microsoft points. Makes perfect sense, because I think all the other PopCap games were also 10 bucks.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Did you hear about the leak on Twitter about the iPhone version of Pagle?

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
I don't think that's really a leak.

58:47.000 --> 58:58.000
I thought that news was kind of already out there, but apparently they made a tweet about the iPhone Pagle, which by the way, I believe was in response to our very own DJ Tyrant who used to do a show on our old station.

58:58.000 --> 59:11.000
I remember, because I follow PopCap and DJ on Twitter, and he said something about, like, I was just playing Pagle, the game is fun or something like that, I wish I had it on the iPhone or whatever.

59:11.000 --> 59:21.000
And then PopCap I think made that response, I don't remember, I'm sorry if I misappropriated this information, but I remember it came up right after that conversation, is that PopCap made this tweet like, oh yeah, it's going to come out on the iPhone.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
And then the tweet disappeared and all the game blogs jumped on it.

59:24.000 --> 59:32.000
But I was always kind of like, I thought they had already said that Pagle was going to come out on the iPhone. I mean, duh, right?

59:32.000 --> 59:40.000
I mean, even if it wasn't said, is it really that hard to figure out? What systems doesn't PopCap write for? Right?

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Yeah.

59:41.000 --> 59:51.000
But just interesting, and somebody said it best on Twitter earlier this week, Twitter's becoming the place where people are actually getting the news, and that's kind of scary.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
Well, Rob, do you watch much CNN?

59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I read CNN.com, but I reload that a lot at work, but I don't watch the station.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I want to say, I think it's the Situation Room, but one of the programs on there actually reads comments off Twitter, the CNN Twitter, and responds to comments about stories that are going on.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, we used to do that.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Kind of like how we use our chat room.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
We used to do the Twit thing, but we stopped.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Actually, you know what's funny? I was going to bring back the Twitter thing tonight, and I'm not just saying that. Look, I already had it reloaded.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Already here on the screen, ready to go. I was going to do it during the break.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
All right, all right. I was just going to say, yeah.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yes, we are bringing back the Twitter interactivity tonight.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:42.000
There are things that I normally post on my Twitter that are news-related. Thank you for reminding me. I completely forgot about it.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
What did you post on your Twitter? Can I go back and read them on air?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Go right ahead. I don't care.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Let me see. Because I don't remember. Sometimes, a lot of the things you write on Twitter, you've already told me about in the past.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Sometimes.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You talked about Scratch. Oh, the Lego game. Nobody caught that one, huh?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
No.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You figured out Lego Rock Band is shit, and you know what the new Lego game is.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Yeah.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You want to find out? Go find Loki's Twitter. I'm not going to read it for you.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's probably just one of them.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
All right. I'm sure they're going to do a million Lego games anyway. Hey, let's talk about another game they're going to do a million of.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero Metallica is on its way, and Metallica themselves have decided to leak what is going to be the complete song list of the game.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I'm not going to read through every single song here. I'll just kind of mention some of the songs that catch my eye.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Creeping Death, Enter Sandman, Fade to Black, Fuel, King Nothing, Master of Puppets, Nothing Else Matters, One, Seek and Destroy, Memory Remains, hopefully with Marianne Faithful intact because that song is awesome because of her.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Whiplash.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Some other artists that are showing up in the game, Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Judas Priest, Leonard Skynard.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Is it Turn the Page?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, it's Turn the Page.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Why don't they just do Metallica's cover?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I don't know. Leonard Skynard is in it. Motorhead.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Cool. Ace of Spades?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Yes, Ace of Spades. Queen with Stone Cold Crazy.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
You know what? I just figured it out.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
What?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Those are all songs that Metallica has covered.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I think a lot of these are, yeah.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Because the Garage Inc album, remember?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Oh, that's right.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I know they've done Stone Cold Crazy because I've got it on my phone. They've done the other one.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Ace of Spades?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I don't remember if they did Ace of Spades, but I know that they did Turn the Page because that's one of my favorite covers of that song ever.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Also Slayer, Social Distortion, System of a Down, Thin Lizzy, lots of stuff in here.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I do want to also mention, this is what I thought was kind of interesting also.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:19.000
If you have the download content that was the Death Magnetic CD for download, it will actually work the ten tracks into the game's campaign mode.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000
If you already own World Tour on Wii or Playstation 2, you'll get Broken, Beaten, Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
They'll already be on the disc for you since download content is kind of different on Wii and Playstation 2.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I thought that kind of interaction was interesting.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And they also announced that, what was it?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The game will be coming on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the end of March on the 29th and then the PS2 and Wii later.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Now the question is, this isn't set up like World Tour with the other instrument setups or anything?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
No, it is. It's basically like Rock Band now.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Well, damn it. I'm going to have to buy it because it's Metallica.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Wow. What role will Metallica play in your cult?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The official band of the universe.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Alright.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Not interested. Sorry.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah, I quit your cult. No, I'm just kidding.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I thought Abba got to be the official band of the universe. I'm very disappointed.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Abba gets official pop band of the universe.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
See, that would be a game right there.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Tweak62 says 80s Metallica is great, 90s Metallica is pretty okay.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
They should have a game where 80s Metallica battles 90s Metallica and see who wins.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
How about Abba vs. Metallica?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That should be a game.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Alas, Abba, we knew you well.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
As you get stomped in the face by Lars Ulrich.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
No, all Abba would have to do is dress Metallica.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Alright, anyway. Let's move on with more news.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Do we gotta...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Of course. That's what we do on this show. I don't know if you heard.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Virtual Console!

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hey, hey.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
There's stuff out.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
This is UK stuff, right?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I like stuff.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Coming out to Virtual Console in the UK is Mario Golf for 1000 Wii points because it was Nintendo 64 game.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And Wonder Boy in Monsterland from the Sega Master System, which will be 500 Wii points.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
You know what's funny? We were just playing that like three days ago.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Well, Dan was. I wasn't.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Awesome.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
We had our entire Sega, well not our entire Sega collection, but we at least had the Genesis world portion of it sitting out.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And then Dan brought out the Master System.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So, we were just playing this the other day.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Very cool.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yep.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Very cool.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I haven't been following Virtual Console in the US. What did we get? Do you remember?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Anybody remember?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Stuff. I don't know. I don't buy anything on Virtual Console.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I haven't either. It's been a long time.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I haven't fired up the Wii in a while either now that I've ruined Animal Crossing for my wife again.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Did your wife officially quit Animal Crossing?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Yeah, she's done with it because I ruined it for her. I started cheating.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Sorry to hear it.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That's because, you know, I got bored with it. There's nothing more I can really do.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
What else was there to do but cheat?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Exactly. It's fun to cheat. It's fun to steal. Like, especially when those animals piss you off because they're being just assholes.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And you just go into their house and steal all their shit. It's like, ha! How do you-

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
How do you steal their stuff?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
There's a code. There's a code where you can pick up their stuff, furniture, move it around.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The only thing is it doesn't save it, I don't think, so you can't just do that.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But it did sort of in the game that we played because I stole all the stuff and they have, like, crap on the floor now.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It was just, like, random junk that was lying around.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You know what I would love to see? It's been a while since we've had an OLR dream game.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I would love to see a game that kind of takes that art style of Animal Crossing or what have you and mixes it with, like, Grand Theft Auto.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I was on the same page with you.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
When a villager pisses me off, I want to put a hit on him.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So what you're basically saying is you would like to see a game that's like Grand Theft Auto but-

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Don't even say Happy Tree Friends because that shit ain't gonna cut it.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That game was shit, okay?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
No, I'm not saying the game was shit. I'm talking about the actual show.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But even then, Happy Tree Friends is- the violence is almost, like, so ultra-violent that it's crap. You know what I mean?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Like, Happy Tree Friends-

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It got really old.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It got really old, exactly. Happy Tree Friends got really old.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I watched three episodes and decided that I didn't like it anymore.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000
But I want something where when the villagers piss me off, I can go in the house in the middle of the night and steal their stuff and sell it.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Like, I want a dark version of Animal Crossing.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Animal Crossing Underground.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Or something like that.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Or Animal Taking.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I want to be able to kidnap animals.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Alright, anyway.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Let's move on. Other virtual console news, I guess.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Anyways, so.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
There's a brand new game coming out. It's almost like I made it or something, but it's not.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It's called Super Meat Boy.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And it's co-created by Edmund McMillen.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And apparently, I'm not really sure what it is.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I guess it's a Flash game.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Kind of similar to N+.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And it'll be coming out to the virtual console sometime soon, apparently.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But they have a little teaser site available for it now. Super Meat Boy dot com.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Meat Boy.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
GS68 says Super Meatroid. Then I'd buy it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yeah, it's actually on Newgrounds. They have the Flash game, so you can check it out.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I guess it sounds sort of similar to, you know, Castle Crashers or something, but not.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
What if, instead of calling it Super Meat Boy, they called it Super Bacon Boy?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
This game would be the top-

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
It doesn't look like bacon.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It would be the top- Well, they need to go back and edit the sprites or something and make it Super Bacon Boy.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Because it would be the top-selling WiiWare game ever.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Like, even more than Strong Bad and all that stuff. Super Bacon Boy.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That was a big mistake, whoever made that decision to change bacon to meat.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
But, uh, yeah. Apparently it's extremely hard.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Well, I guess it'll be a challenge then.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
If you don't cut it, you don't cut it. Ha!

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Rob, give me a pretzel.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Stop making bad jokes and I will.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Andrew's not here to do it for us.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
No more free handouts, says GameTap.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And it happened on Thursday. They removed 97 games from the free lineup of games.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But look, in this economy and with the whole changing of the hands that went on over at GameTap, right?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Because Metabully bought them out or whatever.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Or I think they went up for sale and Metabully bought them.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
You knew some changes were going to come.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
That's two-thirds of the free games are gone.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Including some games like Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars Professional, Bust and Move Again.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Kicks!

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Uh, yep. Kicks.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Tomb Raider Legends.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You know, Rainbow Islands.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So on and so on.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
No more free handouts for you.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
However, it should be pointed out, you can still play these games on GameTap.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
You just have to pay for it.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You know what? This makes me even more not want to use our service.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Why?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I was actually considering, you know, signing up for GameTap.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And then, now there's no point.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Well the games are there, you just have to pay for them now.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I was going to pay for other games, but I don't want to play for shit I already own.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Which is damn near everything on that list.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
At least the good ones.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You know?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
You know, I'm going to be honest, I used to talk a lot about GameTap on the show,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
but I did finally cancel my account a few months ago.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Just, you know, I just wasn't playing it enough.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But now that I'm not playing WoW, who knows? I might have to go back.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
We'll see.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And plus, I was a little sad I couldn't play Missed Online anymore.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Even though it was weird, the game was very weird,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
there was something about it that made me want to play it once in a while.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I have something there that you should play.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I found my DVD copy of Pissed.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Oh god.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It's the parody of Missed.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I've actually remembered that game.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Sadly.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Somewhere I've got Monty Python, it's a complete waste of time, but anyway.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Alright, I've got a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to our break tonight.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Well this next story is Lost Planet.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Oooh.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
News on the sequel, finally?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
News on the movie.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Oh, now this is what Capcom spent their whole E3 talking about, right?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:48.000
They are saying that it's going to cost between 150 to 200 million dollars.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And that's just a crazy, crazy, crazy ass budget.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
However, you know why it's going to be completely awesome?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
It's written by David Hayter.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Aha.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
The voice of Solid Snake.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But seriously, wasn't Titanic made for like 180 million dollars or something?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Like in that Pearl Harbor movie, was that it?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That cost like a shit ton of money to make?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
It cost like 200 million dollars or something?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
This one's written by David Hayter.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's just, I understand that, but most movie goers have no idea who the fuck he is.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
He might be like a prince in your cult or whatever.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
The first X-Men movie.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh that's right he did, okay.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Fuck yeah he did, he was a good one.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I stand corrected, I stand corrected.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
But still, that's a big budget.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
That's a big risk.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Hope it pays off for him.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I hope so, because it's David Hayter.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And also it's directed by the guy who did Spider-Man.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Sam Raimi?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Uh, Avi Arad though.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I'm pretty sorry.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Produced, not directed.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Oh okay, I was going to say.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Whoa whoa whoa.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
No.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Now we're talking Army of Darkness here.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
No, I meant produced.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Alright, we'll see.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Sorry, I was checking out Super Meat Boy.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
He was playing with his meat.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
It's exactly like N+.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
You were playing with your meat, Loki?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yes, I was playing with my meat.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It's exactly like.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
During the show?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Loki.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I know.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's so unexpected of me.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
There was an announcement made this week.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Remember everyone was saying, hey, what happened to the Indiana Jones game?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Well, that Indiana Jones game that they were showing us before, not coming out.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
At least right now.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But there is a different Indiana Jones game which looks pretty cool.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It's Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It's coming to the Wii and the DS this spring.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And they had a cool little trailer online that kind of showcased typical Indiana Jones-esque stuff.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Apparently, though, they said that it's also been rated for the PSP.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And possibly they're thinking PS2 because if it's coming to the PSP, you know, they'd pour a lot of games over to the PS2 anyways.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So, very, very cool.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Well, maybe that Lost Planet movie that Dark Sakura was talking about earlier will get nominated for an Oscar someday.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Hopefully, though, with a budget like that, it will not get nominated for a Razzie.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And if you've never heard of the Razzies, the Razzies are the things that happened the day before the Oscars.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And it's translated to this.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Exactly. Well, that's what it is, a Golden Raspberry Award.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.000
And I think they literally dip something in like cheap gold plating or something and they value the award at like $5 or something like that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Well, they give away these Razzie awards to the worst of the worst movies of the year.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And I think I read somewhere this year, The Love Guru got nominated for more Razzies than any other movie.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
That was that Mike Myers movie that came out during the summer a lot of people did not like, right?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Well, somebody else that is going to be getting a Razzie, Uwe Boll.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
That's right, Uwe Boll has been nominated in five categories this year.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Worst Picture for In the Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale has been recognized as one of the worst films of the year.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
It's been nominated there.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000
However, now he might win that, but it might, you know, Love Guru did get ten nominations, so it might beat it.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But here's the other thing you should recognize.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Uwe Boll has been guaranteed an award at the ceremony.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
He is going to earn the Lifetime Recognition Award of Worst Career Achievement.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
This is all the clap he earns.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Linda Blair has earned this award.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Erwin R. Allen earned this award.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And Ronald Reagan once earned this award as well, because remember, he was an actor before he did all that other stuff.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:55.000
So, Uwe Boll is going to be getting a type of Lifetime Achievement Award from the Razzies for his shittatious films.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Awesome.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Congratulations to Uwe Boll for finally getting recognized with the Hollywood Movie Award.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Now he can say, but now, see, now he can say the award-winning Uwe Boll in his movies.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah, he won shit.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
There he goes.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They should just poop and dip it in gold and get it to them.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
They just might.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But now the question is, will he show up to collect it in person?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Because some people have a sense of humor about it.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Very few people go to collect their awards in person, but Halle Berry actually showed up the year she won Worst Actress in Catwoman.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
She actually showed up to collect the award in person and told off the people in the crowd, but in a joking way.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And that's cool that she recognized that the movie was shit and could kind of make fun of herself.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
You guys have to kind of laugh at that.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And if I recall correctly, didn't Uwe Boll show up at Penny Arcade Expo in 07?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
When they couldn't get Jack Thompson, they got Uwe Boll and he came out on stage.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I mean, with all the shit that guy gets, that takes guts.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
He is a boxer.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
YYR in our chatroom is convinced he will.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
He will pick it up.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
He loves to be in front of the camera.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
We'll see.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And Tigerclaw actually links...

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Media whore!

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Apparently, he's already written a speech.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Tigerclaw has linked me to an article that apparently he already wrote some weird speech about,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I'm glad to be nominated as best supporting actor against stars like Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan and so on and so on.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
He's just deluded.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
You all know that's not a good thing, right?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
This isn't a word for you being bad.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Although I hope that wasn't Pierce Brosnan and Mamma Mia.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
How dare they give Mamma Mia a Razzie nomination?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
How dare they?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Oh, yeah, good grief.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I realize Pierce Brosnan was pretty shitty in that movie.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Why isn't that nominated for best picture, Rob?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That's what I'm wondering.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
That's what I'm wondering.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
This is the part of the show where we bestow our own honor upon a classic video game.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Can someone update our wiki?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
That Dark Sakura has claimed worthy of being a part of her cult.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Although sometimes if the wiki is not updated, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, which is on our website,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
she gets frightened that she might accidentally pick something that's been picked before.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But I believe this pick is brand new.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
It is. That I know.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Alright, so here it is, your classic video game of the week, Dark Sakura.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
What should the kids be playing this week?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
The game of the week is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Which is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, if kind of dumb.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Gives it up a little bit, Rob. That's just an interview.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Did you hear music?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Okay.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Now, the Alex Kidd games were their own little fun dinky platformers.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was an attempt that Sega wanted to do to actually parody their own titles.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You know, how there was Parodius for Gradius.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And, you know, Kidd Dracula for the Castlevania series.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
The game was originally going to be called, it was actually Shinobi Kid.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And it was just going to be a parody. You hear the music.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's the music from Shinobi.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You hear? Anyway.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So, it was going to be just a cute little parody of Shinobi.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000
And it ended up becoming an Alex Kidd game.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So that they could perpetuate in series.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Keep in mind, this was before we had Sonic. This is Sega Master System era, y'all.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And, it was a little funny thing about it.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The first boss, do you see what he looks like, Rob?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
He looks like Mario. His name is supposed to be Mario.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
He does kind of look like Mario and he throws fireballs.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But he's wearing a samurai outfit.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And the more you jump on him, he shrinks.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
How funny.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
His name was Mario, which was supposed to be King Mari.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
But they changed it to Kabuto.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But they were even going to do, like, a golden axe and a fantasy star.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And then we got Sonic.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
But yeah, it's just a cute little platformer. You've got four stages in it.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Where you have the Kabuto stage, Raid of the Helicopters, the Jungle, and Battle with the Dark Ninja.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000
So, it's a pretty fun little game. I really always like playing this game.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
This isn't an Alex Kidd game. Do you have to do those damn Janken fights?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Actually, Rob, I don't remember.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You want to know exactly how long it's been since I've played this game?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
A while.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Um...

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We'll say a while.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:03.000
My freshman year of college, I traded all of my Nintendo systems for all of my friends' Sega systems.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
For a week.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Just so I could see what the big deal was. That's when I developed my Sega love.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I had his power-based converter and played the shit out of this game.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And, um, Castle of Illusion.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh, the boss of this level looks kind of like the Oppa Oppa. I get what you're saying.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Yeah.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Oh, funny. Okay.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
This is a big, fun parody game.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And I love the music. I just think it's great. And I really like- I really love a lot of the Sega Master System games.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I also love the American boxes for them, just because they're so shitty and generic.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
They have, like, cute artwork, blah blah, grid background.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But yeah, this was an Alex Kidd game.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:57.000
You know, I actually liked a lot of the other, though, Alex Kidd games, because there was the Alex Kidd Miracle World.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And, um, High Tech World. That was another one.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
But this one is actually my favorite of the Alex Kidd games.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Alright, there you have it. Your classic game of the week. Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
A parody-rific game of some of Sega's great franchises.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
That is gonna do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
We've got plenty more news to report on in Part B, so stick around, guys.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And hey, those of you that use Twitter, keep an eye out during this break. Show us your tweets.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
We'll read some of your responses when we come back after this little break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 25th of 2009.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
With our 310th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
These numbers are getting so high, it's just obscene.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And yes, that's starting with one. We've been doing this a little while.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Anyhow, show us your tweets.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
We asked on Twitter during the break, what should Rob do now that he left World of Warcraft?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And during the break, you guys responded.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
GS68 says, get Castle Crashers.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
ActDev says, update the podcast in time. That or play more games on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Jeni702 says, Rob should spend his leftover WoW subscription money on a super huge sandwich with bacon.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Om nom nom nom. That's actually a very good idea.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
HarryAKA says, he should check himself into rehab before he relapses.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
MistyOLR says, I don't know, work on the OLR shirts so I can do some pimping during Hey Sen.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's a good idea.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
ZakuPilot256 says, Rob should seek addiction counseling to prevent a relapse.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
BlueSwim says, Rob should play kick the ferret with, of course, the ferret.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Just joking, DarkSakura. I heart the ferret.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000
XLink777 says, start a new drug habit or tossing a few tacos at people that don't like Abba.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I love it when we get last week's jokes incorporated into the show.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Oh, DarkSakura, I wish you were here for that story.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Some kid threw a taco at his mom over a video game.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And he got sent to jail.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
The mom called the police. The kid went to jail.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That's fucking stupid.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
What a way to teach him a lesson, though.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
GioVedea says, doing anything is better than playing WoW.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
DarkTetsuya says, start the cult with DarkSakura.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
DJ Tyrant says, play Persona 3 and 4.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Had no idea Rob left because I'm playing WoW right now.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
SchmittyDog says, Rob should either create an Abba tribute band or work on his musical career.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Have you heard me sing?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Crowzee says, he should make a WoW theme level on LittleBigPlanet and hope it doesn't get taken down by moderation.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000
There actually was a WoW theme level on LittleBigPlanet and it was actually kind of funny.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Biohaze20, the last one I'm going to read here, says, wait until something better is out.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Who knows when?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Who knows when?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Perhaps it will be one of these games we're going to talk about in this next segment in some of the news.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Is it a game you're going to talk about, Loki?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Do you have the game I should be playing instead of WoW?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I don't know.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Apparently it's a brand new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brawler.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Never mind.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That was originally revealed last month.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I can't believe they're titling it this, but yes.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Apparently trying to capitalize on the popularity of Super Smash Brothers, it's officially titled TMNT Smash Up.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Yes, that is clever, Ubisoft.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Way to go.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Apparently it's going to feature arenas that will change throughout the battles as you might remember something similar to Power Stone 2.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Or even Smash Brothers, I guess.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:04.000
You'll see players defeating their opponents either by knocking them off the stage or by emptying their health meter entirely, which can be filled with pizza.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Wow, if this does not sound like a ripoff of Smash Brothers.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I'll still play it. It's Turtles.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
But it says apparently this is targeted for the Wii.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.000
It says there will be no motion controlled attacks, though Waggle isn't ruled out for other aspects or context since the moves and stuff.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
It's described as dark and gritty as far as the graphic style.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And I guess Turtles co-creator Peter Laird is penning the single story or single player story.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And currently, as far as the roster goes, Ninja Turtles and Splinter are confirmed.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Alright, whatever.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I don't know, it's neat.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I don't know, I'm a little apprehensive about these types of games.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Turtles!

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It'll never be as good as it was right when the arcade game and the original NES game were out.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's just not.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The original NES game was not good.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
The NES game blew.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Yeah, okay, but at least it had a good soundtrack.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But the arcade game was the best.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
The best home version of any teenage mutant Ninja Turtles game was Turtles in Time.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
End of story.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
That was pretty good. I'll give it to you.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It was perfect.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Alright, this might be perfect.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I don't know if there's a space for Rob Halford in your cult, Dark Sakura.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
If you forgot, Rob Halford is the frontman of the band Judas Priest.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And he has copyrighted a new video game title.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It's called Metal God.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And this was discovered, a trademark that was filed on January 11th.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It covers computer games, video games, and game controllers for computer games.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Huh, Guitar Hero ripoff?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
But just would like Death Metal songs? Who knows.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Death Metal Hero? Sounds good to me.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Actually, this could be kind of cool.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000
But honestly, if you're going to put out a Metal God game, I have one thing to tell you.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
GWAR or GTFO.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
That's all I have to say about Metal God. GWAR or GTFO.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You can get GWAR outfits in Rock Band.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
That is kind of cool, but it's not the same thing as actually playing GWAR.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
True.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So, GWAR or GTFO. I hope you're listening, Rob Halford.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I say that like he actually is.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I don't know.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
We know you're an avid fan of our show.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
A Death Metal game could be kind of fun, actually.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I don't know.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It's funny, though, because Robert M.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Good point, Robert M.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Robert M. points out, first trailer for Guitar Hero Metallica said,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Unleash your Metal God.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Interesting.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And Robert M. goes, coincidence?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Good catch. I didn't even catch onto that.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
We'll see. We will see.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Halo!

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
What about it?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Is that a band? Is that a GWAR song?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Halo Wars, Rob.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
What about it?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
There is going to be a demo for Halo Wars on February 5th,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and it's going to have a beginner and advanced tutorial

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
so that you can learn how to play the game.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And you can just say, Fuck the tutorial! I'm gonna play!

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Also known as Loki Mode.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Is that Loki Mode?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
F the tutorial sometimes.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Like Mirror's Edge, because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing in that.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Mirror's Edge is hard.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
You can also play through the first two missions from the story mode.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The demo includes one of the multiplayer maps, Chasms,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
and you can play it in skirmish mode against an AI,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
or you can play as a covenant in that game.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It's supposed to be out in Europe on February 27th with a limited edition.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
We'll have the mythic map pack.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And I don't know when the US version is to be out.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
March 3rd.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
March 3rd. Okay.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm like a frickin' encyclopeo at the games.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I swear to God, I don't like...

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Hey, it makes you great on the show!

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I also don't know if that beta date is for us or for the UK,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
but it's definitely for the UK.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I just don't know if it applies to us as well.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide thing.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's the fifth for us, yeah.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
It's a demo.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I'll check it out!

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I own all the Halo games.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
They're better, better, better, better, better,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
be a Red vs. Blue introduction or something in it with Sarge.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Do you want a reference somewhere in the game?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
We'll see. Maybe a unit. We'll see.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I do vote that they should have a new downloadable campaign that's Red vs. Blue,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
because that would be awesome.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Just like they're doing with the ODST stuff,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
but it just has a download campaign.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Talking about video game inspired fan tributes,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I don't remember if I mentioned this on the show.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I think I mentioned this before we went live,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
but something, believe it or not, I finally saw for the first time,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
ironically, the day I quit WoW,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
was the Guild.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I don't know if you've ever seen this.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It's this YouTube thing that kind of parodies the whole world of Warcraft.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I only saw the first little four-minute episode,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
but it's hilarious.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And I just want to tell you, people aren't that bad.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Actually, some people are that bad,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
but I was never that bad,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
if you've seen the Guild.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And that Felicia Day, she is very cute.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
She's quite cute.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I've heard of her, and I know people loved her at PAX and all that stuff,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
but I'd never really seen her before.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
She was quite cute.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
No, I did not see Dr. Horrible yet.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I was too busy playing WoW.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
You need to watch it!

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I'll check it out!

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
To go back to what I was talking about,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
about the TMNT fighter thing,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I forgot when we mentioned this the first time.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.000
It's actually being put together by some of the ex-Brawl team,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
which is probably why it's a little bit like Brawl,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
and Team Ninja.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Oh, interesting.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So if it's by Team Ninja,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
does that mean we're going to get April O'Neil with ginormous tits?

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I was thinking the exact same thing.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I'm being yelled at by chat for never seeing Dr. Horrible.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I'll see it eventually.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Eventually.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Three parts, Rob!

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
All right.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Three!

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I'll watch it!

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Eventually.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Mini Ninjas, this is a game that's being put out by IO Interactive.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
You may remember them of putting out such games as the Hitman franchise,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
or I think they did maybe Kane & Lynch as well.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
This has actually been rated by the ESRB.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
It's E10+.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It's kind of a cute action game.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I also talked about it about a year ago from last spring.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Unfortunately, no one remembers that.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Looks pretty awesome from what I remember,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
and they do have a video online for it.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It's got cute pandas and dogs and stuff in it,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
but it's an action game.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's that broad family appeal type stuff.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And who doesn't like Mini Ninjas?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Now, I don't know.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I guess Mini Ninja sounds better than Big Fat Ass Ninja.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Well, it's also better than...

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
God, what the hell is that crappy movie franchise?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Three Ninjas.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah, it's better than Three Ninjas.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Or Pocket Ninjas, because that movie also sucked.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Or Little Ninjas.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Isn't that also a Three Ninjas type movie?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Yes.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Oh god, I remember watching that.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
It was so horrible.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
What was the...

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
He called the guy a...

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Don't make me go back to that place, Loki.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000
What was that, the Dollar Tree video thing?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Never buy a video for a dollar, because you get what you pay for.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Well, here's something you can buy relatively cheap.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Crystal Defenders.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
This is a game put out by Squeenix.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
It's a mobile and iPod game.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
It's about defending towers, basically.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
It's actually going to be coming out for consoles,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
according to Fumitsu Magazine.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
They're going to put it out on WiiWare.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It's called Crystal Defenders R1.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It's going to have Wi-Fi connection support in it,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
and I'm not sure exactly what that means.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
If that means it's going to be Internet,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
or some type of functionality with a DS, or what have you.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
It's coming out in Japan on January 27th.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Hey, that's this week.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
1,000 Wii Points is what it's going to cost you.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions are in development.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
They're going to be updated versions of the original game,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
but are much further out in the future,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
as they have no price or release date.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So, if you are a Squeenix fan,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
specifically Crystal Defenders,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
or are curious in checking this out,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
it's going to get a lot easier for you,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
especially if you don't really like to play games on your telephone.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Well, we know DarkSakura likes to play games on her telephone.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
During the show.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
During the show, but at some point,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
she's going to have to stop playing games during the show,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
and answer your emails at our mailbag.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Every week, we invite you to send us emails

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
We pick a few of our favorites,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and read them for you right here on the air,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
and respond to them.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
So, DarkSakura, open up the mailbag.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Send us some mail.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Just three.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Alrighty.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Hi!

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I'm a late comer to this podcast,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and I found out while browsing various podcasts on the Zune Marketplace.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Hey.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Well, thank you, Zune Marketplace, for the plug.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I'm glad I've stumbled onto it,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
as it's a very entertaining podcast.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Greeting aside, I've decided to email the mailbag

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
in response to Skye's interest in Left 4 Dead.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I can say Left 4 Dead is much like Mario Party,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
in that it's best played with best friends,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and not by yourself.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You shouldn't worry too much about it being horror,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
even though my most cowardly horror movie loathing friends enjoy Left 4 Dead.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
This is mainly because Left 4 Dead is less a survival horror game,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
and first person shooter, as it is a party game.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I explained it to one of my friends best when I said Left 4 Dead

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
was pretty much rock band with the undead.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Listener, Ross.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
P.S. I've decided to join your Steam community group,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
but are there only 19 people in it?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I know there's got to be more listeners than that.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Maybe a little encouragement from the show?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Join it!

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I don't even remember where the Steam community's at.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I know it's going to sound horrible.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I don't even know if I'm in it.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I don't think I am, so I'm going to have to look it up.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I didn't even know we had a Steam community.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
It must have come up like once in a show a long time ago,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
like when I first got Steam, and probably because I never used it,

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
it lost Steam.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
But I will check it out, and I want to get Left 4 Dead,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and another game I've been eyeing getting on Steam is Mirror's Edge,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
because I kind of want to check that out.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
For some reason, I'm feeling like playing it on the PC as opposed to a console.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So we'll see.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I will check out Left 4 Dead, though.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Yeah, go find the Orange Mountains Radio Steam community,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
and I'll plug it next week on the show, and then I'll play it,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
and then I can play with listeners,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
because I don't know a lot of people that play PC games.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So I'm sure there's a...

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
There you go.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
We'll see.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Next email, dun dun dun.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Actually, I got two emails from the same person,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
and one is a continuation, so let's just go for it.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Okay.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
To start with, my brother just won a PlayStation 3 at work.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Let me reiterate.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
My brother won a frequent PlayStation 3 at work,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
an 80 gig model specifically.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
He's gotten GTA V prologue, he's getting GTA IV,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and getting, um,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
and my getting little big planet, ArtGivens.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't care for SingStar, though.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
We already have Rock Band 2 for the Wii,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
and as well as a dedicated karaoke machine.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And yes, I really like Rock Band 2,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
even though I may have to get more SD cards for downloadable content.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Getting the game for the PS3 wasn't in my mind at the time,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
since nobody expected him to win the console,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
plus getting all the instruments again for a new system

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
rather than using the Guitar Hero instruments would be prohibitively expensive.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
True dat.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000
My Guitar Hero World Tour somehow got the cymbal wires cut slash torn.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Probably it's having a sensitivity issue,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
so I've gone ahead and replaced it with the Wii RB1 drum kit.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Um, soon we'll see third-party drum kits for all the systems

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.000
as common as third, um, as third-party is, um, as common as third-party guitar controllers.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Um, also, dude, you could actually solder the wires, too, and fix it.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Um, anyway, I haven't seen, um, I have Saints Row 2

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and the ported form of Orange Box on my Gamefly list.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I have to see what else to look into.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
My brother's a subscriber of Netflix,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
and will be changing most of his rental list to Blu-ray versions of the movies.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Is the PS3 Netflix streaming currently available?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Um, Xbox 360.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yeah, it's only on Xbox 360.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Or, um, well, I don't think you can, using your PC, you might...

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No, you can watch movies on your PC.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Well, I know that, but I'm not sure if you can use it, like, the Netflix on PC as a media, um, media server

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
and then stream it to your...

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
No, I think it uses its own applications. I don't think you can do that.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Yeah, they do have an application out there that will actually stream whatever's on your PC monitor.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:40.000
So, using that, then yes, you could probably stream Netflix, but that, you know, you'd have to find that first.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So, there you go.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Any more emails?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
There's... I haven't even done Rob.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Oh, sorry!

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I didn't conclude this one, Rob.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And just for the heck of asking, will the TV tuner units for the PSP and DS,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
although generally not readily available in the United States, become obsolete with the digital transition?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Probably.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
What a good question.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Well, I'm not sure. Well, obviously not in Japan, because, you know, they're not switching over there.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I mean, that's only in the US.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
So, um...

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I would think yes, they're going to be obsolete.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
If they're using the same type of technology, if they're not receiving digital TV signals,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
which I doubt they are, then it's not going to work.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The TV tuners for the DS and stuff over there work with their network.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
It's not the same as ours over here.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000
You can't tune in our stations with that TV tuner, basically.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
So, you wouldn't be able to use them anyways.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I guess it depends how it works.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
If it's basically hooking up rabbit ears to your DS, then it's not going to work.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
But if it's somehow feeding...

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Because I thought it was a digital streaming service over there. Was it one seg or something like that?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I don't know.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
But I know it's not compatible over here.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.000
That's why they haven't brought it out over here, because, you know, you can't use it on our network.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Not that I don't think that many people would be interested in streaming or watching live TV.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I don't know. I guess it could be useful.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Well, to conclude the email...

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
By the way, it was from Robert M., by the way. Just saying.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
The second portion that was sent says,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
As if my last email wasn't long enough, since I found them for $20, I went ahead and purchased the orange box.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Good choice.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Burnout Paradise as well as LittleBigPlanet.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Hopefully my brother can invest in a second controller.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm replacing OrangeBox with Fallout 3.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
He found LittleBigPlanet for $20? That's a hell of a find.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I'd say so.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Good for you.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Unless he just means that he just purchased it.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I think the other two were $20.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000
OrangeBox and Burnout Paradise would most likely be in the less expensive range.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
That's it.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Those are some good choices though.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
It's over!

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That's it? For emails?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Yes.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
What a weak selection.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
No offense to the people that did email us, but we didn't get a lot of emails.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Well, speaking of Burnout Paradise, you're going to be able to play a lot more things in it soon.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Of course, I'm talking about some updates that are coming out.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
They're going to have the Party Pack DLC.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Remember, originally they were going to have the Burnout Ultimate Party Box.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
That was going to be coming out.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Actually, in the US, it's only coming out now as download content unless you buy the PC version.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
The UK, though, is getting their own releases for that.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:39.000
On February 6th, though, we will be getting the update along with the Party Pack download content, which will be charging that.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Lots of new stuff.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Of course, they're going to be adding some new trophies and other enhanced visuals and stuff.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
In fact, the list of stuff that they're doing here...

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:03.000
They're going to have an in-game store, which is kind of cool, so you'll be able to browse while connected to the Criterion Games network.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And you'll be able to see all the game updates and purchases and stuff like that.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Tweaked vehicle handling. Earlier cars are now tweaked to be easier for newcomers to use.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000
And these cars are now slower, harder to crash, and less likely to spin out at low speeds.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Junkyard sorting. You'll be able to compare the stats of the cars and you'll be able to filter out cars and bikes.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Upcoming download content vehicles.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Stunt run timer change. They have a different timer now that starts much slower than before.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Allows beginners more wiggle room to start a combo.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Let's see here. They've rebalanced the events. All events have been modified to accommodate the new car speeds.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:54.000
They have road rage tweaked a bit. Players are no longer able to get additional time once they've reached the target score.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Let's see here. Enhanced visuals. They're going to be fixing some of the in-game billboards and smashes.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Stuff's easier to spot. Lighting's been tweaked to make it more vibrant and easier to drive at night.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:19.000
They have a new restart function so if you fuck up during a race you can restart it which is nice instead of having to just drive all the way back to the starting point.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And then easier barrel rolls. And barrel rolls are now automatic.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
That's a lot of stuff.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:41.000
And then of course the upcoming premium download content. The party, toy cars, and legendary cars I think are all coming out on the 6th.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.000
That would be cool. And new trophies of course tying in with that download content.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Awesome. I love it. They have one that's sound the horn on the silver lake super jump in the Calvary bootlegger.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Cause that was the, you know, generally.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I know I love how they have all their cute little new names for the vehicles. I thought that was especially cute how they get around the copyright there or what have you.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Well speaking of download content, some very very highly anticipated download content probably by our very own Loki is the Lost and the Damned.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:29.000
That is the official name for the new downloadable expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 that is coming out on the Xbox 360 and only the Xbox 360.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
The Lost and the Damned is coming out February 17th. That's right we finally have a release date. February 17th.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
As far as how much it's going to set you back, 1600 Microsoft points. That's 20 bucks.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Apparently though it will be about 10-20 hours of new gameplay, new missions, new music, new weapons, and apparently membership to a biker gang.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.000
One thing apparently that's not in it though is the voice actor who originally did Nico's voice in Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I remember reading a story about that as well this week. Apparently just cost too damn much money for him to come back.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Well he was saying that he wanted more money or should have asked for more money and he's not coming back because of that.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
The other thing that kind of sucks too is that Lost and Damned download content is basically it's own game.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So when you download that you don't get new weapons in like say the normal Grand Theft Auto game and stuff.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Because they say it just doesn't make sense that Nico would have access to grenade launcher or something like that.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I say fuck that. Who gives a shit about continuity? I mean I want my damn tanks and stuff.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But yeah I will have to download this because it looks pretty awesome.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But it's not something that's going to be fluid with the original game. It's like really a separate game.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Well they're going to have a portion that kind of crosses over with Nico.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
But it's very brief. I mean like he's in it for just a second during a cutscene.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Because they're going to have to copy paste his voice acting from before if the guy's not coming back or get a guy to impersonate him.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Yeah which is kind of lame. I think they should just put out a pack later that's just over the top stuff like bring back the flamethrower.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
They were going to have the flamethrower in this game and they cut it out. It's lame.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Bring back the flamethrower, the minigun, the tanks. Just go crazy with it.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And the Animal Crossing village.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And they should bring zombies in there. Like have it where you defend Liberty City against a zombie attack or something.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Totally rip off, you know, was it 28 days later or something like that.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Alright, well we will see what ends up happening with this new download content when it is released in February.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I'm sure the internet will be all over it. We'll see.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I'll tell you something else the internet's all over.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Porn!

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'm kidding. I just like throwing crack.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000
No, Mega Man! Star Force 3 actually.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Mega Man is actually going to be in two Nintendo DS titles.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
There's going, and it's in the Star Force series.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.000
There's Mega Man, Star Force 3, Red Joker, and Black Ace.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Which actually looks pretty cool.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I actually haven't played any of the Star Force games before.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But it's sort of an action RPG with what they call noise changes.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000
So you can actually use 100 different noises to combine that changes Mega Man's look in the game.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And also changes his abilities based off of earth, wind, air, and fire.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Fire being the greatest of all time of course.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
And you can trade noises with other Nintendo Wi-Fi players.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So it's supposed to be out in the summer.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
It looks sweet!

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I want more side scrolling Mega Man. At least we got Mega Man 9.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
It's a little hard to complain.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Why can't that be ported to DS is what I want.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
There you go.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Just make Mega Man 10.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
But make it easier for dumb-dumbs like me.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
No, keep it hard. It gives you a sense of accomplishment.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Yeah.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Well, you know there's a game that's coming out, or I should say it's not coming out.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's a mature game by the name of Winter.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It was being put out by the team N-Space.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Basically they were behind the GameCube game Geist, which was kind of not that successful.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Apparently they ran into a problem though with their sales and marketing groups.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Apparently the game, they could not get behind a survivor horror title on the Wii.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And in spite of great sales like on the Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles and stuff that's similar to this,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
they didn't get the green light to basically make this game, which is lame.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
But the game itself, very much like Silent Hill.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000
If you exchange the fog in Silent Hill for snow, you basically have Winter right there.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So I think they should sell the engine off to Konami to make another Silent Hill game on the Wii.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Because it looked like it was basically Silent Hill 2, just now, you know, on the Wii.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That sucks, you know, a somewhat serious looking survival horror game and they don't want to do it.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But yet they'll remake Resident Evil 4.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000
It seriously was so much of a rip-off of Silent Hill, it's not even funny.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.000
You could have called it Silent Hill and people went, oh my god, Silent Hill, you know, that close.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
So what about Silent Snow?

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Is this game just going to slip into obscurity forever?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Do you think it's possible this game could show up?

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
It could come back, you never know.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I mean, they're going to have, was it The Lost Mountain or something like that,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I think is one of the survival horror games coming out on the Wii.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And there's some other ones, I mean Sadness, whenever the hell that actually comes out.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Didn't Sadness end up getting cancelled or something?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
No, I don't think it's still being worked on.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
That game looked pretty amazing and then just kind of disappeared.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Yeah, it may come back later if they start doing more games that are like adult on the Wii

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
and they end up being successful.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Because they can say, hey, you know, maybe we should put out this game.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Because if you look at some of the games, like for example, Too Human,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000
that thing was in development since the Nintendo 64 having Cameo.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Those weren't exactly great games, but still, it could come out later on.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Just because it's not coming out now, if they don't find that it's appropriate,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
they can just shelve it and go back to it later or something.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Alright. Well, another game that you may not get to play, at least very easily, is Dawn of War 2.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And this is Warhammer 40,000, so obviously there's several Warhammer series fans out there.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
What's kind of interesting about this, now of course you can get the game,

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
but you're not going to be able to get it at GameStop.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And there's an interesting little tug of war going on here.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The rumor is it has to do with the game's association with Steam.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Apparently, on January 15th, GameStop, they were taking pre-orders for Dawn of War 2.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
It's going to be a strategy game, by the way, if you have no idea what type of game we're talking about here.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And then suddenly it just disappeared.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
GameStop.com is no longer offering the game.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.000
If you call a GameStop store, they will tell you that Dawn of War 2, you can't pre-order this game.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000
But apparently, previously, you were able to get a chapter command war gear set

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
if you pre-ordered the game through GameStop.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
So what the hell's going on?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
The game didn't get cancelled. In fact, they just mentioned that the game went gold.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.000
THQ is behind the game, and they actually bumped up the release date.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So apparently, though, something's going on with Steam.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.000
The game is requiring you to install Steam, and of course, Steam being the way that you can get games online.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Apparently, GameStop corporate not happy with this.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
But the weird thing is, don't Valve games make you install Steam too?

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah, because it's Valve's programming.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000
But yet they carry those games. GameStop will carry Orange Box and those type of games.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Hmm.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
However, GameStop is kind of pissed.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Well, a lot of this is kind of rumor, or what have you, but it would make sense

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:30.000
because GameStop does not like it when digital distribution occurs before the game is released in retail.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And this kind of goes back to when Penny Arcade Adventures came out.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Yeah, but I have to ask, why do they even care? Because they don't really give a shit about PC titles.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Because if you've seen their PC selection, it's like a shelf. I mean, seriously, who gives a crap?

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I don't know, maybe it's the principle of the thing.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:54.000
It's like, oh, you're really cutting into our PC sales, which are, like, very small anyways. Who cares?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Anyway, take this news with a little bit of, you know, caution, because it's not necessarily, you know, it could be some very strange misunderstanding,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:11.000
but a lot of people are reading into that the game is just not available.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Because I don't understand why they wouldn't carry a game, because, I mean, that's potential for people to trade in other things that they make a high margin off of,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
you know, to buy said game.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I mean, hell, they're doing it now, I mean, it's so ridiculous, they're doing it now with download content cards.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Oh, I'm gonna trade in some games to get a card to go download something off of Xbox Live Arcade?

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I mean, like, or, you know, The Lost and Damned, or the new Tomb Raider levels and stuff like that.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000
It's like, really? Why don't you just buy a card? You know, a points card. It's the same thing.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I don't know. It's retarded.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Alright, well, we'll see if this is true or not. One of my friends that works at GameStop is swearing to me up and down that the game is still available for pre-order in the computer.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:04.000
So, who knows, it could be some weird misunderstanding that got spun, but either way, that's what the internet's saying this week, so we'll see.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
But I agree with Loki, you know, not that GameStop is really into PC sales anyway, you know?

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And for some people, there's never gonna be a replacement for walking in, grabbing a box in your hand, having the instruction manual, all that stuff.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:25.000
You know, as I say, why do people buy CDs anymore? You really don't need to, in this day and age.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:32.000
It's still better to, you can actually, on Amazon now, you can buy all of them as MP3s without the proprietary crap that iTunes has.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
iTunes actually got rid of it.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Yeah, iTunes did just get rid of that. That means you can actually get it as an MP3 format.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Yeah, it's definitely not on their website, that's for sure, and they have the other games available on their download service.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
But, you know, I don't know.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I'm sure we will see an official corporate response from one of the two in the next week, so you can probably bet we'll hear something about this next week.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well, how about some different type of news?

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
How about something different? How about everybody getting along and living in peace and harmony?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And pooping rainbows, like you said earlier?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Only you're allowed to poop the rainbows, Rob.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Sorry.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You're the official rainbow pooper.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Thank you.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000
So, um, the dude that did Braid, Jonathan Blow, that makes me snicker.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
You're so mature.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I know.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Anyway, is working on a 2D RPG.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
What?

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yeah, he's working on a 2D RPG, but, um, it's, uh, I really don't know what else to say about it.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:46.000
It's just, it looks like a 2D platformer type of RPG-ish sort of thing.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Um, but he said that he, um, wants to say that, um, the, they're trying, I guess, trying to do something specific with the actual way the game plays.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000
There's really not too many details on it, and he, I squeezed the ferret by accident.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
And, um, and, uh, he actually doesn't really have, you know, that much attention that he's paying to it.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
It's more like going, okay, I'm gonna work on the RPG.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Ooh, shiny!

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
So, in other words, he'll do whatever he damn well pleases, but this is what's capturing his attention right now.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Yeah.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
RPG.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Hmm.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Well, okay.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:31.000
At least he's not developing it for the DS, and he's not gonna lock himself into a room because he can't get a dev team.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Hey, that guy, that guy apparently, uh, finally let himself out of the room, trashed his room.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
That guy had issues.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Let's throw a fit now.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I don't even remember that guy's name, and even if it did, I wouldn't want to say it.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I totally forgot about the guy, except I sort of remember us talking about it.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Yeah, remember the guy, he locked himself in the room and was throwing a fit because Nintendo wouldn't send him a dev kit or whatever?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Oh, the retard.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Yes, he finally quit his little tantrum and trashed his entire room on his way out.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I know, I know.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
But yet, here we are talking about him, and lots of people did, so whatever.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
His game looked lame anyways.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Yeah.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
What do I care?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I mean, it's like, he's like, I need a dev kit.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I'm like, no, I don't want to play that game.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
That game looks stupid.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I don't care if he wastes it.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
It looked, seriously, it looked like something you'd make with RPG Maker.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Like the old RPG Maker.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Not anything good.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Sorry.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I don't know.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Maybe he put ZZT on the DS.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Yes, they do.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
ZZT on the DS.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Yes, they do.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I say yes.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Alright, more news.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Alright, well, in the tradition of download content for EA games, Skate 2 has now put out some download, well, I wouldn't even call it download content, you download a key to unlock crap.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Basically, it's a time is money pack, it costs you 400 Microsoft points, and it will unlock all locations, skaters, and gear that can be earned by playing through Skate 2's career and online modes.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000
So basically, for people that don't want to play the game, it'll just unlock everything right there for you.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Which begs the question, why even buy the game if you don't want to play through it?

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So it's pay to unlock content.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Yes.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Which I always hate in video games.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
It's pay to unlock cheat codes.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
That's basically it.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
They've done this before.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
With other games, right?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Yep, Tiger Woods, uh, I'm trying to think of what else.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Ah, other EA games.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
News about pay to unlock content makes me angry.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
And here, yeah, AcidicVampire says it perfect in chat.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Chat.orangeworms.com, he says it's for lazy asses.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Absolutely, it is for lazy asses.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So to anyone that's actually going to support this kind of content and encourage them to put out this content in the future,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I'd like to dedicate a little piece of angst to you.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
FUs of the week time, DarkSakura.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:11.000
My biggest FUs go to, um, incessant bitching without the will to do anything about it.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And I'm not saying that that's what anybody in this room was doing.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I am saying that I have been hearing nothing but people bitching all week about stupid shit.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
That they could just say something and it would be fixed.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.000
That, you know, why are you complaining to me? What the crap can I do about that?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.000
You know, or the, I'm up all night worrying about it.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
What can you do about it at night? Worry about it when you can do something about it.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
That's what my mother does.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
She'll tell me about how she stayed up all night long worrying about something.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
It's like, well, you're just making it worse.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And I've been accused of being bitchy about it.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:04.000
But you know what? I really have, you know how much sympathy I have for the incessant complaining without doing shit about it?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Zero.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Mother Teresa, you ain't.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Well, Mother Teresa was a bitch.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Rob.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Only on this program.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:24.000
No. Mother Teresa liked to make people suffer because it made them closer to God.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:31.000
This is true. That's why all of her little hospitals were nothing better than hovels.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
She wouldn't deliver medicine and would do nothing to ease her pain.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I didn't mean to open a can of worms during the FUs by analogy.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
So yes, Mother Teresa was a bitch.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.000
What if you were suffering from starvation? Wouldn't that make you closer to God because you're dying?

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
In her opinion, yes.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Also, Gandhi was a racist. But anyway.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Less controversy, more angst.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
That's true.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:08.000
At any rate, it's just, you know, for example, I have a friend who says she's gonna listen to the show and never dies.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
And you know who she is. I'm not going to say on the air.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Who, at work, does nothing but complain about work.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
About the same thing over and over again.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And complains about her family.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
The same thing over and over and over again.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
And it's the same crap that she does too.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000
And we're like, well, you know, all you have to do is this and you can fix it.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But blah blah blah blah blah.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Same thing over and over and over and over again.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
You know, I know other people will be like, oh, well, I don't like this situation.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I'm like, well, get off your ass. Do something.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000
You know? I don't like my butt, so I go walking every day at lunch.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000
You know? And also, this goes in with it as well.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I also don't like for people to look for a crutch. You know what I mean?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
To put all of their hopes in one place and expect that that is going to be the end all.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Oh my god.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And I would like to right now offer an apology to our president.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
The very awesome and we have a handsome president too.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
But I would like to apologize to President Obama on behalf of all the fucking morons

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
who thinks he can fix all the shit that's wrong in the government.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.000
He might be able to get us started on the right path.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
He might make a lot of good things happen.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I have a lot, you know, I've got faith in him.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000
He's, you know, so far he's made good on everything he said he was going to do, right?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:50.000
You know? A person with that much integrity is going to try to do the best job he can.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.000
But it's, you know, don't think that he's going to do all this shit for you.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
You've got to help.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
You know, everyone's got to start taking some responsibility for their own happiness

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
and for their own, you know, their own well-being.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000
You can't just say, hmm, my life sucks, and expect it to get better,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
expect someone to go, I'll solve all your problems.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
That's not how it works.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
You know, there are no superheroes.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
You just have to get off your ass and do it yourself.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
If you can't do it by yourself, ask someone to help you.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
But life doesn't fix itself.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
You have to, you have to help, you know.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
If you see someone out there doing good things, they probably could use your hand helping them out.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I bought ten cans of cat food, by the way, to help these people who were fostering homeless cats

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.000
at their own house in a no-kill shelter because they were trying to do some good in the world.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
And because I believed in what they were doing, I contributed.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
You know, cat food is an example.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
But I'm just saying, you know, if you want something bad enough, make it happen.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
It is a bummer, though. The economy didn't magically change overnight.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Did really. Who expected it to?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
No, I know. I know.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
If anyone expected it to, they're fucking stupid.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I know. Hopefully soon. Hopefully soon.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
All right. Anymore. We gotta move on.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
No, I'm sorry for ranting.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
That's all right. Low-key.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000
F.U. Rockstar Games for making a crappy PC port of Grand Theft Auto IV.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Just reiterate that until I fix it.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And F.U. 2, the spring TV lineup for having too many damn shows on that I need to watch that happen to be on at the same time.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I can't do that. And you can't keep putting out cool shows.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Because then I get distracted. And it's not good.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I can't watch American Idol, Lie to Me, NipTuck, House, possibly Heroes.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Although it's supposed to suck this season, but I still gotta see how bad it's gonna suck.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Fringe. And some stupid dance competition show.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
So you think you can dance?

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
No, it's that International Dance Stars or something like that.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
It's got the Groove Blues on it, so I wanted to watch it.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Uh, is that it?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
That's it.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
My F.U. goes to the headache I have setting in.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Boo-hoo. I'm gonna have to go run in the house and take some ibuprofen.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Otherwise, um, I don't have a lot of F.Us.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I'm... I'm just... I'm in just, like, a bleh mood.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
F.U. to being bleh.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
That's what I feel like. I feel like, bleh.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
There you go.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Uh, all right. That's gonna do it for the F.Us of the Week.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
More angst next week.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Blow?

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Blow.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Almost like a murloc, but I shouldn't say that because I'm now, uh, recovering from WoW.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
If you were listening earlier in the show.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Okay, but I gotta say this. I was not, like, addicted to WoW.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Like, I hate it because I made this thing in my live channel earlier,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.000
and I'm having people tell me these stories about people who are really, really addicted to WoW.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Like, okay, I was never that bad. I know how to go outside.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I was social. I went to work. I paid my bills.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
So, whatever.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Anyway, I don't want to get on that tangent.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Uh, I will talk instead about this.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
We were mentioning, um, or the chat room, I should say, was mentioning.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
When Dark Soccer was talking about Obama, somebody had made the comment about

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
he's the first president that did his addresses on YouTube.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Tigerclaw said that in the chat room.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Obama is the first president to post YouTube videos of his addresses.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
So, very interesting how YouTube has come a long way.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000
The Xbox Marketplace, too. All the different, um...

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
All the inauguration stuff. Yeah, that partnership.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I think they're also in the PlayStation Network, I don't know.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
MSNBC.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Um, and also, um, that actually, again, this is something I was watching on CNN.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Something that I think is cool.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I think we're gonna actually see a whole lot more of this coming out of the White House, too.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Um, he said that he wanted to be, um, much more transparent and available for the public.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
He said the president is a public servant, and that's true, right?

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I think we're gonna be seeing a whole lot more.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Because, you know, there's actually a Spider-Man comic with Obama in it, too.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
But then, didn't he not let cameras in when he retook the oath?

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I don't think that was him.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Just in case he fucked up again.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
No, he didn't fuck up.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
The guy repeating it... No.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
He said it right.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
The dude repeating it to him fucked up.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
It was just one of those awkward...

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Fired!

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I just like how he just smiled and was like, did you screw up?

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I don't want to get too political, but the whole fact that they had to do it a second time was ridiculous anyway.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Because there's an amendment in the Constitution that says Obama was president whether he said,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I like cupcakes, up there on the stand or not.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Which I do approve of that message.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
That should be the new inauguration. I like cupcakes.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Hired.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Anyway.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And I'm rich, bitch!

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
But I'm saying, I'm saying, my point was, look for more of this.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this massive internet interaction with our government coming up.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
So I think that's pretty cool.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Well, speaking of massive internet interaction, there's a whole version of Street Fighter that you can play on YouTube.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I believe it's some type of tie-in.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
On YouTube?

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Yes, on YouTube.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I believe it's some type of tie-in with Soda Toys or whatever because they keep featuring this.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
But it's interesting and I'll play it here in the background here.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000
It's like this whole little Street Fighter thing and as you play it, you can click on a button while it's flashing to make a move.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
It uses like the branching YouTube technology or whatever.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
And so I can select my fighter.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So let's pick Zangief because he's the gay one.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
So I clicked on him.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And it took me to Zangief versus Guile.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
And now all the buttons are flashing, I can do stuff.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
So like I clicked Y.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000
And it took me to another video where I got punched in the face by Guile.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
But I'll click A now and try to hit him again.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And I get to hit him in another video.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Where I got kicked in the face again.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I am not very good at YouTube Street Fighter.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Because you have to hit it when it flashes.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I hit it when it flashed.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
No, you stopped.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
See?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Oh.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
You have to hit it right when it flashes.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Go.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Oh wait, I'm Guile.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I'm playing against Zangief, huh?

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
So I guess this is a good thing.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Woohoo.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Anyway, so it's like this whole little interactive Street Fighter game.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
The user's name if you want to see this.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Patrick B-O-I-V-I-N.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Unfortunately there's no real easy way to link a YouTube.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
But that's it.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Interactive Street Fighter on YouTube.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Kind of interesting.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You know there's something though that I actually am curious about.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Did you ever play Mugen?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
That was the fighting creature on Fighter, right?

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yeah.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.000
That was a long time ago when the chat was talking about there should be an all games interactive versus Orange Lawn's radio like fighting game.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And they were going to do it in Mugen except nothing ever happened.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Well I actually, I've kind of got an idea for doing an Orange Lounge inspired Mugen.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
There'll be more to come from this.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I would like to speak to people who are familiar with doing custom characters for Mugen and sprite editors.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
That's all.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Alright.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
But how about some different stuff?

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Jason's yelling at me in chat saying,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Fuck, there's no easy way to link to YouTube. Link the first video.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Now I can do that for you guys in chat but remember it's a radio show.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I can't like exactly sit here and go, okay, go to YouTube.com uppercase L, uppercase P, uppercase, you know.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I can't exactly read that little garbage code there.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Anyway, sorry.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
That's what tiny URL's for.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I guess. Even tiny URL's kind of pokey.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
You know what one of my favorite games was though, Rob?

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
What is that?

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
When it came out a few years ago?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Hydro Thunder!

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Dude, that game is still at a lot of arcades.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
It's like one of the only actual arcade games you see in arcades.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I freaking love that game.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And I played the crap out of it on Dreamcast.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Hell yeah.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Well, guess what?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:47.000
There's going to be a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder called H2 Overdrive.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I know.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:56.000
But I'm looking at pictures and it looks totally like how Hydro Thunder looks.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
It basically is Hydro Thunder.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
They remade some of the levels from the original game.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
So why don't they just call it Hydro Thunder 2?

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Because someone owns a trademark for that.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Oh, lame.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
This is supposed to be out I think by Raw Thrills.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.000
So they actually should be seeing it at the ATEI Expo in London.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:22.000
If any of our listeners in London are going to be there, do take pictures, please.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
But yeah, it's official.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
In fact, 1UP has a preview of it with the video and everything.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So check it out.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Coming to an arcade menu maybe?

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
So there.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
We'll see.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Sounds awesome.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000
It's going to be in the corner of all the pizza places now.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:50.000
So there was some games talked about during Ubisoft's financial earnings.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I guess they have a conference call.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Of course, some of these franchises that they're bringing around, not that surprising.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Including Assassin's Creed 2.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000
And this is all coming between now and March 2010.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:13.000
So Assassin's Creed 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, which was supposed to come out a long time ago and kept being delayed and delayed and delayed.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
So that's not surprising.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
A new Ghost Recon game.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Of course, Beyond Good and Evil 2, because that's already been announced.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:31.000
And also they let another title slip that they weren't supposed to talk about, but Red Steel 2 is going to be coming out at some point.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Now with Wii Motion Plus.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
How did that slip in there?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Oh, by the way, Red Steel 2.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
No, he's like...

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I forget what it was.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It says we have lots of products coming for the Wii next fiscal year.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
We have Red Steel...

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
GS68 in chat calls it Red Shit Teal 2.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Red Steel was very disappointing.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
But this isn't a surprise, though.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
I've heard them talk about Red Steel 2 before.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Well, they have to fix a lot of stuff if they're going to do that.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
But you know what, though?

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Conduit looks awesome.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
I don't know. We'll see.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Maybe they can do it.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Alright, when I was telling you my Warcraft story earlier about how I left and everything.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I assured you I did not do it to go back to Final Fantasy XI.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
And after some news this week, Lord knows if I could, I might have been banned.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Because apparently tons of the hardcore players were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Although, just joking, obviously I would not have exploited a cheat in the game as these people did that got banned.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:52.000
That's right, hundreds of people were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week for discovering an issue that allowed players to create multiple items for certain treasures and rewards in areas such as salvage and assault by exploiting the game system.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:02.000
This was some type of bug. Apparently it's been out there for a while. And Squeenix finally did some emergency maintenance on November 26th.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:08.000
That was a while ago. They went back, I guess, for all those logs and all that stuff and figured out who did this.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:14.000
They temporarily suspended 400 players and 550 players who committed serious misconduct.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
We ban you!

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
You can never play again.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So there it is. Apparently a lot of these banned players were long-time Final Fantasy XI players.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
So who knows, maybe they did you a favor!

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:38.000
No, but that's got to really suck to put a lot of time into a game like that and then suddenly wake up banned one day.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
And I get told in chat by my buddy Miklatov, he says,

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:48.000
You couldn't if you wanted to, Rob. You never made it to Endgame. That's true, I never did make it to Endgame. I played how many years of Final Fantasy XI and I never got to Endgame?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Nine months of WoW when I was in Endgame. And it sounds like if I played on Jamie's pirate server I could probably get to Endgame content in Ragnarok in about an hour.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
No, no, no.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
That's like 20 minutes.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:14.000
No, not even that actually. You can get to level 150 no problem after rebirth. But it does take longer to level to 255.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:21.000
But that's interesting though. Man, these guys, you could say, hey they cheated, they deserved it.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.000
But that's very interesting that they let this exploit go on for so long and then they retroactively did that. Boy.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.000
You know what, if they're not hacking the game, if it was just like a bug in the game that did that, I don't think they should punish them at all.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I mean, to be honest, if it's your poor programming that's caused this duplication glitch, I think you should fix it and that's the end of it.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.000
They should have fixed it a long time ago instead of saying, oh, well you exploited this glitch that was in the game. I mean, I don't know.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Well, Warcraft's kind of done some similar things. For example, I was reading a story about a guild that downed one of the new bosses called Sarthurium.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000
And one of the hardest things to do in WoW right now is take out the boss Sarthurium with what's called all three drakes up.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Basically you fight a boss and three mini bosses all at once. And this guild found this way to exploit the boss fight by, I don't know, you drag him to some type of lava or something.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:20.000
And basically if you just let it go on and on and on for five hours, you can win this fight. So it's more of an endurance thing, but you have to do it for five hours.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:30.000
So they exploited it, got the title for doing it because you get a title if you do it, bragged about it on the official WoW forums and found themselves with a temporary ban.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
All the people that were involved and got a rollback on the clock because of it.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
That's kind of lame.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I remember when I was playing on IRO, if there were item duplication and things to happen like that, they'd do rollbacks. Because doing an inventory wipe of just one character would be kind of crappy.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Alright, anyway. Well, that's going to do it for our stories tonight. We will get to last minute stories very soon, but we do want to open it up to you guys and let you guys have a say and give us a call.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
If you want to give us a call, our Skype line is open. It's 1-877-GAME-OLR. That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the United States and Canada.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Or you can give us a call on our Skype. It's Orange Lounge Radio is the name on Skype.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:28.000
And we have opened up the Skype line and we're waiting for your calls. So while we wait for the buffer from our live chatty to get to the people listening so they know it's open, do we have a quick last minute story, Logan?

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Yeah, remember that patent that they had for a directional sensing DS card? Well, apparently it's being used for some stargazing app that's coming to Japan.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
That could be kind of interesting, actually.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Well, the app's actually pretty expensive. It's 8,190 yen.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Oh my gosh, it costs a lot for that kind of motion sensing technology.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
It charts over 9,300 stars, planets, suns, and moons.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Strange. Hey, we got a call on the Skype line. Let's go to it. Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. This is that guy that you can probably guess who it already is.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
In case there's people listening for the first time, you should probably introduce yourself.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Hi, guys, I'm Jason.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Hi, Jason. Jason, our fearless webmaster. We're getting a new website soon, right?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
We are.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:17.000
I'm so freaking excited. Have you talked to Deek? We're going to have to come up with a title for him, too, because Jason is the webmaster, but Deek wrote the site.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000
So now we're going to have to think of a title for Deek, too. I don't know.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I was kind of trying to mold that over in my head, and I hadn't come up with anything yet.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Well, we'll think about it.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
But definitely, Reddit is very important in all of this.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Yes, very, very important, and we have to think of a way to thank him publicly, so we'll think of something.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Anyhow, Jason, what did you call out tonight?

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I don't know if you guys talked about this in your gaming weeks. I didn't see it in the show roll, and I missed the start of the show.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.000
People aren't supposed to know that you can see what we talk about before the show.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I have secrets.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Alright, what's up?

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Special privileges.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:01.000
So, Konami Digital Entertainment released a certain demo. I don't remember if it was last week or this.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Is it sparking any... have you guys already talked about this?

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:10.000
We talked about it last week. During my gaming week last week, I mentioned, I'm assuming you're talking about Dance Dance Revolution Lite S or whatever it's called?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Was this seriously last week?

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Yes, actually, here's the thing. Konami put out the press release this week, but the game's actually been on the store for like ten days.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:28.000
But Konami is finally acknowledging its existence, which is weird, because one thing I will say about the game that I didn't say before,

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
one of the things that's in the game is this feature where you can hit the little thing, and it goes to Konami's website.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Touch Konami is what they're calling it, their little iPhone development page.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I don't wish to touch them.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Well, if you go to Touch Konami's website, they only have the Japanese website up.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You see a little placeholder for United States, and I think, I'm assuming Britain, but there's nothing that you can't press them.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
You can only go to the Japanese site, which I can't understand.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Do you know if that's still the case?

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.000
So I thought when I saw the press release...

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.000
There you go. He's actually going into it right now.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.000
My thought was that you would go to the website now that they put the press release out, and you could actually look at the website now.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
But no, that's not up either.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000
So I don't know why they waited till now to put out the press release, but they did.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000
I'm just that behind. I only saw this, I just kind of stumbled across it during the week.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Did you know there's also a Silent Hill game on the store?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I think I saw it, and I just didn't get it, because I went to their company little section of the iTunes store, and I wanted to see what else they put up.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:39.000
It's not even... They slapped Silent Hill sprites on a 3D maze game. It's not even anything.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Although the music's kind of cool, so I guess there's that, but yeah.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Yeah, and Touch Konami still has not changed.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Japan is deep black, and United States and Europe are gray, and you can't do it.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
That's right, can't do it.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Well, what did you think of the demo?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000
So what did you think of the demo? I already talked about it last week, and now you know to go back and listen, but what did you think of the demo?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.000
This sure is hell more impressive than any other mobile version of the game that's come out yet.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Granted, the last time a mobile version of the game came out was, what, the original Game Boy?

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Yeah, but dude, the Xbox version had a better frame rate than the iPhone one does for me.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
I don't get why that's a bad thing.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:24.000
It's fluid and everything, because I'm making fun of it, because the Xbox one had those crappy, skippy frame rate issues, and like, my iPhone thing will skip while I'm playing the game.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:33.000
It's a very nice-looking demo, and it's very pretty and flashy and very showy, and the song they picked is pretty good, but yeah.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:41.000
I can perfect attack those songs on real DDR, and I can't even get a full combo yet on the phone version.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Yeah, I haven't managed a combo yet either.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:49.000
It's tough. But it's a demo, it's free, it's hard to knock it, DDR fans will eat it up, so...

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Depending on how expensive it is, I'm considering getting it when they actually release it.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.000
That is what they're trying to sell their finalized product on, so we'll see.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:09.000
And it is technically impressive for what it is. There's a character in the background, I haven't actually sat down and really started memorizing it to see if it's random or not, but there's a nice series of visualizations.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Everything in the game looks damn near the way it should be, the way it has been.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:24.000
The character in the background, the music quality is beautiful. It's impressive, and I just have to see how much they're gonna charge for when it actually comes out.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:33.000
You have to remember, despite all my bitching about Songlist and everything, I mean, frame rate and everything, you have to remember it's a freaking cell phone game, and not bad.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
For a cell phone. For a cell phone game.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And like I said, especially compared to all of their other mobile releases thus far, which is also a very hard comparison, but it's still very valid.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
True. Any other thoughts, Jason, before we let you go?

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
My arms hurt a whole lot.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Sorry to hear it.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I was gonna make a masturbation joke, but I guess since you've actually moved, you have a legitimate excuse, and I'll let you go just this once without making a joke at your expense.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Alright, bye Jason.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Night.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000
You wanna give us a call? 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Loki, another story to tide us over?

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Yeah, sure. Let's see. Well, there's another WiiWare title that we forgot to talk about.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Pole's Big Adventure, which is coming from Sega. It is a parody of a bunch of 8-bit games.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:35.000
It takes place, I guess, it's developed by the Phantasy Star Universe producer, and there are 100 hidden gangs in the game, including, for example, if you eat a mushroom, your character will grow beyond the size of the screen.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Very ironic, considering Dark Sakura was just a minute ago talking about, you know, in part A, I should say, about an hour ago, talking about a 8-bit parody Sega game.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
No, no, no, no. I mean, she was talking about, like, Alex Kidd in Shinobi World. It's not making reference to it. It's funny that all these years-

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Yeah, Mario. Also, I'm watching The Little Big Planet, Super Mario, Sack Brothers level.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:03.000
It's- I've played that level. It's interesting. Anyway, the phone lit up again. I want to go to it. Hi, caller, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Uh, this is Spazinator.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Um, I just want to double-check and make sure I heard you right. Did you just say earlier in the show that you gave up WoW?

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Run that by me again?

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Did you say that you gave up WoW?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Yes, earlier in the show, in part A, I'm taking a long, extended, long, long break from WoW.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Is that even possible? It's like, you know, you're making the experience like saying that the Buffalo Bills is going to win the Super Bowl or something.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:44.000
It is true. I'll post the screenshot of my cancelled account if you guys don't believe me, but it's true.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Uh, DarkSakura, maybe you want to check to see if you're, like, breaking a fever or anything like that.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:57.000
You know, that doesn't seem to really, you know, make a whole lot of sense.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:04.000
You know, simply because I know you are a big fan of WoW, and DarkSakura is a big fan of Wrecking Rock.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:10.000
You know, you guys gave it up both games. You know, it seems a little out of place, you know?

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:17.000
I'm a huge fan of WoW, but I was a bigger fan of the people that play WoW and the people that I interacted with in my guild.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:23.000
But it's not like I'm dead, and many of those people I already knew before I played WoW, and I will continue to know.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:29.000
But, um, WoW is just getting to the point where it was like a second job, and, you know, I just need to take a break.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I'm not knocking the game. Blizzard has put a phenomenal game out there that people give a lot of unnecessary shit to.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:42.000
But for the show, this is going to be great, because I've got like a million video games to catch up on, so it's going to be great.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Well, for what it's worth, I know you kind of touched on it a little while ago, but, you know, if you're looking for another MMO, personally, I can recommend Final Fantasy XI.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:08.000
You know, at least on the two servers that I'm on, which are, like, Odin and Alexander, there's a lot of really great people on there, and, you know, we're constantly, like, doing stuff.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:17.000
You know, whether it be, you know, stuff for, like, the new expansion, Wings of the Goddess, doing all.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I gotta say this, Fazinator, Loki and I actually played Final Fantasy XI for, like, three years for an ungodly long time.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I hear a lot has changed in the time I was away while I was gone in WoW, and a lot of it sounds really interesting, but it's just kind of a place I'm not really interested in going back to.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000
But again, not knocking the game. There's a lot of great things about Final Fantasy XI. I hope you guys have a blast.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But I think for me right now, I don't want to quit an MMO to just go play another MMO, at least until the Star Trek MMO comes out.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Then I might change my mind. But for right now, I'm not really seeking another MMO.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:28:01.000
You know, I've tried Warhammer, I've tried WoW, I've tried Ragnarok, I've tried, you know, a lot of these games, and for right now, I think I just need to go outside.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Or play, you know, and play console games, too. There's a lot of great console games I need to play.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Yeah, it's true. Well, you know, thanks for taking my call. I don't want to take up too much more of your time.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I mentioned there's probably a lot of people trying to call in, so...

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:22.000
No, it's no problem, and I'm glad I can clarify and get the questions answered, and I know there's probably a lot of people that are like,

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Oh my gosh, what? This is big news. But, you know, I'm trying not to make it such a big deal, because I don't think it needs to be a big deal.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:36.000
If it was a big deal, then that insinuates that it was too big a part of my life, so it just further justifies my need to take a break.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Anyhow, thanks for the call, Spazinator, and have a good one.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:46.000
A comment from RicePrincess, who's listening right now. Of course you love RicePrincess, she was here last week.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.000
If Rob's going to play an MMO again, it's going to be Hello Kitty Online. Very tempting, Hello Kitty Online.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Very tempting to at least look. There's Hello Kitty Online. Yeah, I believe it's free. I might have to do this.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Another one looked interesting. 1877 Game OLR, Orange Lawns Radio. What, DarkSucker? I like Hello Kitty.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Me too. Loki? I was going to say, they keep advertising that free, was it Fusion, I think, Fusion Fall or something like that? The Cartoon Network game?

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Oh yeah. You know, again, I have such a huge backlog of Xbox and Playstation 3 games I need to play, I don't want to look for another MMO right now.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:30.000
The only exception I might make is something like, actually, something like Phantasy Star Online actually sounds like a lot of fun.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Because, you know, as DarkSucker has said, you can play it forever, or you can play it for like five minutes, pretty much. You know, just do one little area.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.000
That sounds more tempting than anything else I've heard so far.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Yeah, damn it. This is the, that one Swede. That called like on your year show and didn't know what to say, actually.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.000
That one Swede. We love Swedish people. They gave us ABBA, remember? No, I'll stop making those jokes.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
What is on your mind?

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:18.000
What was I going to say? Well, I played like a few more PC games. Plus, I haven't quit WoW, I just, speaking of WoW, I haven't quit WoW either.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.000
But this month I can't play because I'm too poor to actually pay for it.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Other than that, well, what was I going to say? Yeah, F.E.A.R. 2, the demo was released.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Yes, somebody sent me a Twitter message telling me I had to, I don't know if it was you, somebody on Twitter, actually I think it was Twitter, sent me a message, Twitter or Facebook, sent me a message saying you need to check out F.E.A.R. 2, it's the best demo I've played in a long time.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:56.000
I did queue it up on my PlayStation 3 to check out, so I will definitely see that for next week, but I'm assuming you've already played it.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Yeah, of course I played it on a PC. The thing is that the last five minutes of the demo is really kicking ass. I'm not even sure if I'm going to spoil it, but you get to pilot this mecha thingy.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.000
You get to pilot a mech thingy?

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yeah, you get to pilot some sort of robot, whatever, especially since, if I remember right, the developers of F.E.A.R. 2, Monolith, they released an old game of theirs called Shogun Mobile Assault, whatever, yada yada, something.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Which was a hybrid of a bit of everything, since in that game you could pilot big robots, and they are quite big fans of piloting robots.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Here's my question about F.E.A.R. 2, was it scary?

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Yes, it was. If you're going to play it on PS3, I don't even know, but I will say this, apparently it requires an almost hefty computer to play.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Even though I can say that, well, I played it on my old, one of the first generation core duo 2, and it rolled just fine. But then again, I didn't crank it up until, like, massive, so...

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And what more? Oh yeah, Dawn of War 2 has been the multiplayer beta for that, has started.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Oh, and how's that going?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:33.000
That's going just fine. It's sort of almost played, almost, almost. Well, it is Dawn of War, but it's most character-focused, in the sense that it's really commander-based, or something.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Random question for you. Did you hear our story earlier about the brick and mortar store GameStop, huge here in the US, I don't know if you have them over there, refusing, well, rumor, refusing to sell this game in their stores because of the digital distribution. Do you think that would hurt this game?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Well, here's the other thing, is that, well, I don't even, it might do, but here's the other thing. First of all, I got into the beta due to the following fact that I did bought Soulstorm on Steam.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And since THQ does have their, most of their games on Steam, or at least a few of them, that was due to that.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Alright, well, okay, Ripper, we're going to let you go try to get one more call in, but keep gaming. It sounds like even though you mentioned you were poor, you're still finding ways to get your game on through all these demos and beta tests.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:54.000
That would be a good one, because at least I know the plug's going to get pulled on Tabula Rasa before too long, so I can't get that sucked into it. Good suggestion. Alright, okay, we got to let you go, buddy, but have a good one.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:02.000
All the way from Sweden, my friends, AK Ripper, giving us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio. We love hearing from the international listeners, it's always a good time.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR in the US and Canada, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Do we have another last minute story, Loki?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Mario Kart Source PC mod is being worked on right now, and of course using Half-Life 2's source engine, they're making a Mario Kart mashup game that takes the best features of all the other games and throws them all in the one. I am very excited about this news, because Mario Kart with custom levels, oh yeah, that'll be awesome.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Good times, good times. Let's go to the call of phones. Take one more call before we're out of here for tonight. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Legend of Zaku. Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Nothing much, just spending another lazy Sunday at home.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Me too. But I do this internet radio show thing on Sunday nights, I don't know if you've heard.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:15.000
But yeah, I guess basically it's been going off with Microsoft and everything, pretty much you reap what you sow in terms of delivering products which basically call for people to get laid off.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Oh, are we talking about the whole Windows Vista being blamed for the recent Microsoft layoffs?

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:34.000
I guess. Well, either that or they're just trying to outsource the rest of the jobs. But besides the point, it just sucks to see that the folks created Flight Simulator pretty much getting canned.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I mean, they didn't have anything to do. That's a damn good tool for pilots.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
That's a game I remember from when I was a kid.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Not only is it a game, but it's a resource for people who are really big into flying.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000
True, true. It's hard to call that a game. It really is a simulator.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:37:02.000
But it can be considered a game in that sense. I mean, you do it to each his own, whoever enjoys flying around for several hours in a virtual plane.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I gotta ask you this, I'm sorry if this is what you wanted to call in and talk about, but I have to ask you because I know you're a big, big fan of Beatmania 2DX and that whole series.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I don't know if you've been listening since the top of the show tonight, but Loki was talking about a new game at the top of the show tonight called Scratch, which is like a hip-hop version of Beatmania 2DX that's coming out this June. Thoughts?

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000
No, I'm not into hip-hop, unfortunately.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:42.000
There are certain songs in 2DX, for example, certain other songs that are faster to scratch on. Damn, I wish I could name them off the top of my head.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Yeah, I mean, to each his own, I guess, as long as it allows a person to actually literally scratch on the DJ, I mean on the turntable, and if the controller for it is actually any good, if it's just like cracking DJ with only two turntables and maybe a crossfader, it could be a lot more realistic than 2DX.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:11.000
We'll see. Zaku, did you have any other thoughts for us before we let you go and wrap up the show tonight?

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Um, besides that, download that Fear 2 demo. I don't care for what system you have, PS3, 360, or your PC, get that shit.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yes, sir.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Let's get it down. Get it fucking down.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I'll do it, because Zaku told me to.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Alright, Zaku, you have a good one.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Yup.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Have a good one, Zaku. Yup.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000
He's awesome.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:45.000
One of the several OLR listeners I've met in person. In fact, I am trying to get back to New York City this year, just to heads up, folks. I don't know when, but it's one of my goals.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:51.000
If I told you why I'm really going to New York City, though, you'd laugh at me, but I do have a friend that lives out there, as you all know, and I'm trying to get back out there this year.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Want to hear something awesome?

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
What's that, Louis?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Well, we're thinking of, because I remember I have that company vacation that I can take, that $1500 one, so we were going to go to Seattle, but it's kind of boring if you just go there for Seattle.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
I love Seattle.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Yeah, whatever. Okay, so we're thinking of going to Disneyland instead. But now, since Conan O'Brien's taken over for Jay Leno, he films in LA.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
That's true. That's true.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
When's he starting? In the summer?

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Soon, I think. I mean, they're already seeing who's filming.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.000
You're going to spend your $1500 vacation on LA? I mean, no offense, but you can drive to LA on the weekend, for God's sake.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Well, Nellie hasn't been there yet.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Well, you should go to the East Coast. New York City's a wonderful place to go.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Yeah, but the thing is, they only cover $1500. I mean, that's the flight right there. We don't want to spend there.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000
No, no, you can get a JetBlue flight out of Sacramento for $250.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Yeah, but still, though, that's...

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.000
You can actually get, every so often, Southwest does the two-for-one specials, too.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
True.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.000
It's just, you know, we just want to, I don't know.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:09.000
LA's not terrible. And, you know, you would have an extravagant LA trip for $1500. You know, you could pamper yourself a little bit. I'm sure the wife will like that, but...

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Disneyland!

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.000
And Disneyland is pretty fabulous.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:21.000
We would go to Disneyland and maybe Universal Studios. I do want to see Conan, though, since my dream to go to Price is Right with Bob Barker hosting is, you know, long past.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.000
You should still go to Price is Right. I would love to see Loki and the wife on a game show. That's what I want to see.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:30.000
You guys need to go on one of those...

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
It would never happen.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000
You guys need to go on one of those low-budget game shows like Lego.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
I don't have the game show appeal. I'm not, like, some crazy redneck or, like, you know...

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Dude, you do a radio show on the internet.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I...

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000
About video games. That's a pretty awesome niche.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And no one gives a shit. No one gives a shit. You tell them that and they're like...

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Yeah. You're not in the military, are you? No? Sorry. You go back to the audience portion of the...

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I don't know. I would never... They would never call me on one of those shows.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.000
It would be awesome, but no, they would never do that. Never, ever, ever.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.000
It's just like I've given up on getting, like, the employee of the month thing at my work because that'll never, ever happen.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:16.000
I love this. D5T1. I don't know if there's an easier way to pronounce that. In chat, D5T1 suggests Supermarket Sweep.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Hey, dude. Supermarket Sweep is awesome. Is that still on TV?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I don't know if they make new episodes. I think it's on PAX or something. I think...

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Surely that guy's still hosting shows. He could be. They could still be doing it.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Supermarket Sweep's awesome.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Dude, Loki would, like, load that card up with those turkeys. Be awesome.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:42.000
I think all of us want to go on Supermarket Sweep. Who doesn't want to go on Supermarket Sweep?

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Hold on. I'm actually, thanks to the powers of Wikipedia, I'm looking it up right now.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:57.000
No, it looks like it went off the air in 2003. They probably still run it in repeats, but that's that. 2003 is when it stopped.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000
And I don't hate New York. It's just it's so damn expensive to travel there.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:10.000
It's not... New York was my first pick. And it was just, you know, it wouldn't work out as far as, like, you know...

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:19.000
We don't want to spend our own money, and the problem is that $1500 can only be used on the hotel and on travel.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.000
And I don't think we could do... It's all weird, because it has to be booked through, like, Expedia and stuff like that.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I don't know. It's lame, but...

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
I'm going to find you a fun $1500 trip that's better than LA. I'm going to make it my mission for $1500.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Well, there's only certain cities I can go to, so...

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Alright, alright. We'll see, we'll see.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Well, I actually am going on vacation again.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I wanted to make sure that I said something about it. Not really a vacation, it's more like a family visit.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I'm going to Washington. To Prosser, Washington.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Wait, is that mean you're going to be gone next week?

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Yes.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Oh, what a bummer!

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Yes. I doubt I'll have internet or anything.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Well, gosh, Dark Soccer.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
I'm going to visit Dan's family, which, you know...

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000
And, no offense, Ranma, I'm not going to go crash with you if I travel to New York City with my wife.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
No, that's not going to happen.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Yeah, even the wife wouldn't have lots of sex while they're on vacation. They're not going to do it in your spare bedroom.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000
No, if we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on vacation in a nice hotel and stuff like that.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
We're not going to just go crash at someone's house.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.000
That's something like if I was going to an anime convention or something in New York City.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Plus, Nelly would freak.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Yeah, if it were just me...

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
You don't know the wife.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000
If it were just me traveling to New York City for something, then, yeah, that would be probably fine.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000
But, you know, not with the wife. No, that doesn't work that way.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Alright, anyhow, we've got to wrap up the show and get the hell out of here.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Yeah.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Let's get everybody's final thoughts.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Dark Sakura, welcome back and see you next in two weeks, I guess.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
What a bummer, because next week we have the...

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Bobby's not on the air, so we've got a lot of time to kill next week, so we'll see what happens.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
But enjoy the trip to Prosser.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
We're driving.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
It's a pretty drive, though.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Seventeen fucking hours.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Make the best of it. Take pictures. Bring it back.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Get you to poo with your hubby.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Any final thoughts on the show before we go?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I want some ice cream.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Ice cream does sound delicious. Very delicious.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:24.000
My final thought is...

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.000
The only thing better than ice cream is that ice cream that was made out of Samoas.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
And I don't care what they call them now.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
The caramel delights are sort of the crap Samoas.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Loki, what's your final thought?

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Final thought is...

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I need to find a song for Cage Match.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I know which song I want, but it's in my car and I don't want to walk out.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Dude, I think you won the last time we did a Cage Match.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Well, I also like the song by Uncle called Burn My Shadow.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.000
It's in the new teaser trailer for Fuel.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Which is going to be the next kickass racing game I'm really into.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Basically, from the creators of Dirt and Grid.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:02.000
They're doing a racing game that's in an alternate future.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Where weather has changed the face of Earth.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.000
And basically, you're racing through tornadoes and shit.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
So, that sounds awesome.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000
And they actually have a video of racing through tornadoes.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
So, I'm done with that.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:24.000
This is kind of a bummer final thought from YYR in our chatroom.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Of course, he's the man who made Snake 360.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
We had him on the show a few weeks ago.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000
As of right now, the Snake 360 contests are now over.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.000
F you to the major gaming sites for not covering them because not enough people entered.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I can't even give away all the prizes.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Bummer.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Sorry to hear it.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
We'll take your prizes.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
But no, in all seriousness.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.000
As I was telling somebody, I gave somebody advice earlier in the week.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I gotta remember, Rome wasn't built in a day.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000
So, sometimes it takes a long time.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.000
We did OLR for many, many years with only like a dozen people listening.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Before we finally broke it and got two dozen people listening.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
And that's about where we're at now.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
So, no.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
But again, and I say this at the end of every show.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Remember, it's the community that helps make Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And without you guys, life would suck a lot.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000
And we would not be as motivated to do the program.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.000
So, thank you guys, as always, for tuning into this program and spending your Sunday nights with us.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Please, if you like the show, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Help us spread the word because, again, we don't have any major.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
We don't get covered by the major gaming sites either.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Unless, you know, they're accusing Loki of breaking an NDA or something.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
We don't get any coverage from major gaming sites either.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
So, we only get word of mouth.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
That's really it.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.000
So, leave us a nice review on iTunes or any other podcast site.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Help spread the word for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.000
But until next time, myself, Dark Soccer in two weeks.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.000
And Loki next week will be back to do it all over again.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.000
