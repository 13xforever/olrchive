25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	42000	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
42000	44000	We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio
44000	46000	www.allgames.com
46000	50000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
50000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me every week as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura
55000	56000	Jamie Summers
56000	57000	Yo
57000	58000	How are you doing?
58000	59000	Um, my hands are sore
59000	60000	From what?
60000	61000	From crocheting
61000	62000	Crocheting?
62000	63000	Yes
63000	65000	Is that where they're calling it now?
65000	69000	Oh no, I see you actually have yarn there that you are crocheting something
69000	70000	What is that? Are you?
70000	72000	I'm making a pot holder
72000	73000	Are they kitten mittens?
73000	74000	No
74000	75000	Oh okay
75000	80000	Actually this is just my practice sheet because I'm probably going to put it over there with my dolls or something
80000	85000	But my mom, I actually called my mom to ask her to crochet something for me
85000	88000	And she's like, well I've got arthritis now I can't do it
88000	90000	She's like, you can teach yourself how to do it
90000	92000	I was like, well I haven't done it since I was 10
92000	93000	She's like, oh I bet you could
93000	95000	So I was like, maybe I can
95000	99000	So I sat down with a needle and lo and behold I taught myself how to crochet again
99000	104000	Don't you love it when little dares like that inspire you to do something?
104000	109000	Well now though I found tutorials on how to do like hats and stuff
109000	114000	So I think I'm going to make hats for everyone for the holidays
114000	115000	Oh fun
115000	116000	So everyone gets a hat
116000	117000	OLR hats
117000	118000	Everyone gets a hat!
118000	120000	I'm poor, everyone gets a hat
120000	123000	I wish I could say that OLR was started out of spite
123000	126000	But OLR was started because we were really bored
126000	127000	Yeah
127000	130000	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki
130000	131000	Hello
131000	132000	How are you Loki?
132000	133000	I'm good
133000	134000	Do you have a hat on in your neck of the woods?
134000	135000	Crocheting?
135000	136000	Sorry, excuse me
136000	137000	No
137000	139000	By the way though I know you catch that Kitten Mittens reference
139000	142000	And I watched that episode last night finally
142000	144000	Because they have that on the
144000	146000	They have the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on On Demand
146000	148000	And I was watching it
148000	149000	LOL
149000	150000	That's all I have to say
150000	151000	LOL is all I have to say
151000	152000	They were selling them
152000	153000	Is that a real website?
153000	154000	Yeah it's a real website
154000	155000	You can buy dick towels
155000	156000	Love it
156000	157000	If you guys don't know what we're talking about
157000	159000	Does your cat make too much noise?
159000	161000	I just have to say
161000	163000	In 2009, I know we talk about video games
163000	165000	We talk about a lot of other crap too
165000	166000	Just deal
166000	169000	That's how we fill three hours here at Orange Lawns Radio
169000	172000	A lot of great television this year
172000	175000	I haven't usually been so much into TV
175000	177000	Because I'm too busy playing WoW among other video games
177000	180000	But there's just been a lot of great shows this year
180000	181000	It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
181000	183000	Modern Family I love
183000	185000	That show is hilarious
185000	187000	Glee is great
187000	190000	It tickles my gay fancy
190000	191000	There's just been a lot of great shows this year
191000	193000	V has been pretty cool
193000	195000	I hear it's sacrilege to the original
195000	197000	But since I didn't watch the original
197000	198000	I'm not as attached
198000	200000	I don't know how Dark Sakura feels about the new V
200000	201000	It's alright
201000	202000	I'm loving it
202000	203000	I like it okay
203000	205000	If I had never seen the original
205000	208000	I actually watched the original
208000	210000	All of them when they aired
210000	213000	I hope sci-fi network airs them
213000	214000	Or something so I can go back and watch it
214000	216000	I've actually got DVDs
216000	218000	So if you ever want to have a V party
218000	219000	That would actually rock
219000	221000	My roommate is really interested in watching the old one too
221000	223000	One of the aliens was played by Robert Englund
223000	224000	Nice
224000	226000	The funny, silly one, Willy
226000	227000	I heard about that
227000	228000	Yeah
228000	229000	His first thing he says
229000	230000	Can you help me? I am just
230000	232000	There's a clip on YouTube
232000	235000	Of the hamster scene
235000	238000	What with Diana opening her mouth up
238000	240000	And swallowing the guinea pig
240000	241000	Yes
241000	242000	Amazing
242000	244000	I hope they reference that in the new one
244000	245000	Anyway sorry
245000	246000	OMG spoilers
246000	247000	Not really though
247000	249000	Because we don't know what's going to happen in the new one
249000	251000	The new one is taking a lot of liberties with the old one
251000	255000	But if I'm right it's the same guy
255000	256000	Doing some of the writing
256000	257000	Yeah
257000	260000	And the other half of the creative minds behind the new V
260000	262000	Is the folks that did the 4400
262000	264000	Which was a pretty good sci-fi show on USA
264000	265000	If you ever saw that
265000	267000	And one of the lead actors is from it too
267000	269000	But I'll tell you what though
269000	273000	If I sit you down through the original series
273000	275000	Then you have to read the book that I got
275000	277000	The guy who wrote the original series
277000	279000	And you can tell he's obviously a screenplay writer
279000	282000	But he wrote a book finishing it the way he wanted to finish it
282000	283000	Instead of how the final battle was
283000	285000	This would be the perfect like thanksgiving
285000	287000	Post thanksgiving plan
287000	288000	If I didn't already have plans
288000	290000	Well I have plans on Friday night anyway
290000	291000	Don't
291000	292000	Yeah me too
292000	293000	Saturday
293000	294000	I can't I'm going to be gone for the weekend
294000	295000	Well you're no fun
295000	296000	I know I know
296000	297000	Monday
297000	298000	But I'll be back Sunday
298000	299000	But we have the show so
299000	300000	Sunday morning
300000	301000	We'll figure something out
301000	303000	Sunday morning bagels and V
303000	304000	We'll figure something out maybe
304000	305000	If I'm back in time
305000	306000	We'll see
306000	307000	We'll get um
307000	311000	We'll get jelly donuts and pretend that they're hamsters
311000	313000	And watch our lizard people
313000	314000	I would say this though
314000	315000	V would make a pretty kick ass video game
315000	316000	Spoiler
316000	317000	They're lizards
317000	321000	V would make a pretty kick ass video game
321000	322000	I think there was one
322000	323000	Was there really?
323000	324000	I think that there was one
324000	326000	I bet there was one like on like the apple 2e or some shit
326000	327000	That's what I want to say
327000	328000	Let me let me find out
328000	329000	Please do
329000	331000	Meanwhile
331000	333000	Let's get into the way we always start off the week show
333000	334000	And how was your gaming week
334000	336000	Don't get your google foo on just yet
336000	337000	DarkSakura
337000	338000	Because uh
338000	339000	A the chat room
339000	341000	Our lovely chatters at chat.orangelaunceradio.com
341000	342000	Will probably beat you to finding it
342000	344000	Tigerclaw is probably already halfway there
344000	345000	Tigerclaw
345000	346000	Tigerclaw
346000	347000	Tiger
347000	348000	I can't talk tonight
348000	350000	Tigerclaw is probably halfway there to finding it already
350000	351000	Um
351000	352000	And uh
352000	353000	You got to do your gaming week
353000	354000	How was your gaming week DarkSakura?
354000	355000	Well um
355000	357000	I actually did not play any well
357000	360000	Cause again I have to remind myself that I still have the game
360000	361000	Actually no I take that back
361000	362000	I did pull it up
362000	363000	And then um
363000	364000	I had to go some more
364000	365000	Um
365000	367000	I played some Sims um
367000	373000	I've watched Dan play through some modern warfare 2 and ODST
373000	374000	And um
374000	375000	He got these awesome headphones
375000	376000	I love them
376000	377000	They're the best present
377000	378000	He ever got himself for me
378000	382000	Because I can't hear a damn thing that's going on on TV when i'm trying to sleep
382000	385000	No Sub Warfare going
385000	386000	Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom
386000	387000	Boom
387000	388000	Whenever I'm trying to you know
388000	389000	Go to bed
389000	391000	Especially now since I have to go back to being at work at 6am
391000	401000	But I've been playing a lot of peggle. I've actually really gotten back into playing a lot of solitaire.
401000	409000	I'm trying to learn how to play the Baker's Game on solitaire and Spider solitaire, which I kind of don't like.
409000	411000	And now I'm crocheting.
411000	413000	Isn't Spider solitaire included with Windows XP?
413000	415000	Yeah, but whatever.
415000	418000	They only have themselves to blame.
418000	420000	They should have called it solitaire 2.
420000	427000	Now, this is something I'm going to try to do, because it is kind of gaming related since I miss playing Breakout on my Linux box.
427000	430000	You can just download it.
430000	442000	I sent my laptop back to be fixed, and I swear if they put that Windows shit back on it, I am going to start off that laptop booting Linux, installing Linux, and then asking them for a refund of my Windows license.
442000	444000	I found out you can do that.
444000	464000	Never boot up Windows. When you order anything from Dell and put in a different OS on it, you can put in, as long as you've got proof and everything, you can put in for a refund of your Windows license so that you do not have to, if you're not paying for Windows, if you're not using Windows, why should you have to pay for it?
464000	466000	Interesting.
466000	479000	I always assumed, because it was part of what you were buying, sometimes you buy maybe a bundle of movies, like for instance, recently I bought the Star Trek Next Generation bundle of Blu-rays, because I wanted all the movies on Blu-ray.
479000	484000	I didn't really need Nemesis, but it just comes with it, so I might as well take it, right?
484000	501000	Well, that's kind of a different thing, because you pay, I think, $150 for a Windows license when you get Vista, XP came on my laptop. I didn't use it. I actually never used it.
501000	509000	Quick side question. What do you think of Google OS, because there was a lot of news about that this week, which is kind of based on Linux. Really? It looked interesting.
509000	523000	I think what they're going for with the whole netbook thing, I could not see myself using it on a desktop. Again, granted, maybe I need to see a little more about it. It doesn't look like a desktop OS to me, but it looks like a great little netbook thing, which is what they're going for anyway.
523000	546000	I might give it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I am as happy as I could humanly be with Linux Mint on my laptop. It does everything I need it to. Multiple desktops. I mean, literally, you slide your screen over, and you have a new desktop to put shit on. But you can monitor everything through your little thing.
546000	547000	So like a Mac?
547000	549000	Does a Mac do that?
549000	553000	Or like my computer at home with icons that just scroll on to like...
553000	558000	You have to hook up four monitors to see them. I remember that. It was funny.
558000	573000	But no, in this case, it's like you could have multiple monitors hooked up, or you could just go slide. Hold it down, and slide it over, and it gives you a little arrow to pick your desktop. You can have it show up in a cube, so you can rotate your cube and pick the screen that you want.
573000	583000	You know, usually screen real estate isn't a problem for me, because I run my windows at the smallest possible resolution where I need magnifying glasses installed in my eyes to be able to see the screen.
583000	589000	I'm talking about on a netbook. On that little... My netbook is a 10-inch netbook. This is perfect for me.
589000	591000	It's not the size. It's how you use it.
591000	602000	Yeah. But it means that I don't have to deal with everything cluttering up my taskbar. I can just go from window to window and don't have to worry about anything.
602000	605000	Since we are a show about games, do you do any gaming on Linux Mint, or is that not really...
605000	606000	Well, I told you I was playing Breakout.
606000	607000	Oh, okay.
607000	618000	Also, one of the things that I downloaded right before my laptop decided that it was going to take a bath in the backseat of my car was Doom.
618000	624000	Because Doom and Doom 2, they opened the source code, so they actually have them on Linux.
624000	625000	Nice.
625000	633000	And so I was thinking about going back into Hurt Me Plenty mode, just because I love the name of Hurt Me Plenty and Ultraviolence.
633000	637000	All right. Comments from chat. Got to start reading some comments from chat, because there's some good stuff here.
637000	643000	Gold anthro in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, which, by the way, I need to throw this plug out there at some point.
643000	647000	You don't even have to be attached to the web anymore to get to our chat room.
647000	653000	Thanks to the allgames.com iPhone and iTouch app that is out there, if you look for that on the store.
653000	658000	They built this into the app now. If you click on the schedule button, connect to chat, there's a new function.
658000	662000	Now, allgames.com has their own chat room, and for whatever reason, I can't even explain this.
662000	667000	It's a historical thing. I don't know. We have our separate chat room from Orange Launch Radio.
667000	672000	But they actually built it into their chat room. So if you type slash O-L-R, you join our chat room.
672000	675000	Isn't that neat? I thought that was very cool and they didn't have to do that.
675000	678000	So whatever you want to do just getting that to the chat room, do it.
678000	682000	That means I might have to just randomly hop into the chat room while I'm at work.
682000	685000	You should. I know. I'm thinking of doing the same thing on my phone. It's kind of a neat little app.
685000	687000	I mean, while I'm on my break at work.
687000	690000	Of course, of course. Hey, anyway, comments from chat, such as this one.
690000	699000	Goldanthro says, I got Linux Mint because of Jamie, and so did my best friend, and it's a great alternate OS, even for us PC gamers.
699000	701000	So there you go, a little endorsement there.
701000	707000	Well, another thing, too, that I really like, since we're kind of on the subject of games and Linux Mint,
707000	717000	is that a lot of PC and Mac environment stuff, they actually do have clients that you can run within Mint to sort of emulate Windows.
717000	723000	Basically, I'm trying to remember what exactly it's called. I want to say the Wine environment.
723000	730000	And there's a few others, but like, I've seen screenshots of people playing, you know, Sims on Linux.
730000	738000	And so there's all kinds of ways around it, so you can actually, I think with Linux you can have the best of all the worlds,
738000	745000	but the best thing about it is that you really don't run into having to worry about spyware or all this other crap,
745000	748000	because people are like, oh, well, fuck, it's Linux. Who uses that?
748000	753000	And I got to say this. Linux Mint, it's a nice little friendly sounding name, too.
753000	758000	It's much more friendly than say, like, Linux Anchovies or Linux Meatloaf or Turkey Surprise.
758000	766000	Another good thing about it is that it is made understanding that you're going to have users coming from Windows or Mac backgrounds,
766000	774000	and that, it's very easy. In fact, when you have to do a kernel update, I've done two kernel updates, and it's freaking easy.
774000	780000	And if you have a problem with one, you have the option when you boot up of picking an earlier kernel so you can go back and modify it.
780000	788000	So if you get something that may say, oh, well, we'll optimize your memory better, then you can download that one and run it,
788000	793000	or we'll optimize your graphics better, then you can download that one and run it. It depends on what you want to do.
793000	796000	It's, like, super customizable. I love it.
796000	801000	All right, other comments from our chat room. Tigerclaw was unable to find anything on a V video game,
801000	807000	so I'm convinced it doesn't exist, because Tigerclaw has the best Google Foo skills of, I think, any of our listeners.
807000	812000	However, uh-oh, Jamie's ready to throw down. But, here, Tigerclaw does say,
812000	820000	I saw a Q&A from the VentureBeat site about video game creator Jace Hall, and it does mention about a potential video game based on V.
820000	825000	And he links to an article over there in our chat room. So, there you go.
825000	828000	All right, more gaming weeks. Loki, how was your gaming week?
828000	838000	Still very slow. Just playing Grand Theft Auto, still.
838000	844000	Actually, haven't really played a lot of other stuff. Still trying to get a chance to play Borderlands,
844000	848000	but I keep getting distracted by working on the arcade cabinet, which is coming along quite well.
848000	854000	It's actually, I got all the ROMs on there, all the themes I could find for Hyper Spin on there.
854000	863000	Now, I was actually this morning going through and taking out some of the themes that are for clones and stuff like that,
863000	870000	because I'm gonna try once I get everything on there, because I just kind of downloaded all the ROMs for MAME all at once,
870000	875000	because I didn't know really what I wanted. So, I was just like, okay, I'll just get everything. Makes it simple.
875000	881000	Problem is, though, there's like multiple ROM dumps, multiple clones.
881000	885000	So, you get all these extra games you gotta scroll through, which is absolutely annoying.
885000	890000	I mean, I know there's way to do lists and whatnot, but I actually want to physically delete these.
890000	894000	So, I'm gonna go through eventually and delete all the clones I have on there,
894000	901000	and then I have to go and actually make some new themes for some of the games I play a lot, like Gals Panic and that kind of stuff.
901000	917000	So, that's why I started today, and just had to compile a new version of MAME that actually gets rid of the NAG screen and that kind of stuff.
917000	921000	But I got to test a few things out. I tested a little bit of Street Fighter this weekend.
921000	929000	I tried a little bit of King of Fighters, because I'm trying to do a different setup for my Neo Geo stuff.
929000	935000	And, I don't know, all it seems to play very nice, so that'll be cool.
935000	944000	Just really kind of working on that for now, I guess, until I, I don't know, move on to something else.
944000	949000	Hold on, Jamie wants to butt in here, because, Jamie, what'd you find? You found something on the internets?
949000	955000	I sure did. The V game came out for the Spectrum, the ZX Spectrum.
955000	961000	And, let's see, what else? The Amstrad CPC.
961000	967000	So, yeah, you can, actually, if you have the Spectrum emulator, it was actually put out in 1986 by Ocean Software.
967000	971000	So, round one of Google-Fu goes to...
971000	973000	Dark Sakura!
973000	977000	Here was an earlier one. It came out in 1985.
977000	985000	And then, funny, and then there was this one, also in the ZX Spectrum 48K.
985000	991000	But, the one in 1986 was the better of them.
991000	993000	I will link this other link in the chatroom.
993000	994000	Alright.
994000	997000	Because it has the picture of the lizard person face.
997000	999000	Better luck next time to our dear pal, Tigerclaw.
999000	1002000	Alright, sorry, Loki, anything else for your gaming week?
1002000	1004000	No, that's pretty much it, yeah.
1004000	1010000	Alright, my gaming week was more of the same. I've still been playing WoW and all that other crap I play week in and week out.
1010000	1017000	But, I did spend some quality time with a new game that I decided to check out this week based on some happy, positive things I was reading around the internet.
1017000	1024000	And that game is Torchlight, which is a game that is by some of the team that worked on Diablo and Diablo 2 back in the day.
1024000	1035000	And it's really easy to get the demo on Steam and you can play through the first little boss in the game.
1035000	1043000	And the game really feels like Diablo a lot, but it's a little more cartoony, kind of set in a different type of world.
1043000	1047000	A little bit of WoW-ish type stuff mixed in because you actually have quests.
1047000	1056000	The only drawbacks to the game is that there's no multiplayer and you're limited to the three classes in the game, which, you know, granted, that's what the original Diablo was limited to.
1056000	1064000	But you can use talent points much as you could, and if I remember right, in Diablo 2, you can use those to mold your character many different ways.
1064000	1069000	So, you know, it's not like you're just stuck in three different skeletons. You can kind of mold that.
1069000	1074000	The lack of multiplayer is probably the biggest drawback for me, which is a little bit unfortunate.
1074000	1080000	But here's the thing is that the game's only 20 bucks, and I think for the value you get out of the game, it's pretty cool.
1080000	1086000	Because it's such a great little retro throwback and, you know, if you like those dungeon crawler exploration games, it's great.
1086000	1094000	And there's many different difficulty levels within the game. Like, if you want to play on easy, like I started playing on, it's super easy.
1094000	1096000	Like, you're just not going to die. Ever.
1096000	1103000	And then you can step it up to basically, you know, hurt me plenty and so forth, like there is in Doom, although of course they're called other things in this game.
1103000	1109000	You know, again, honestly, I couldn't even really pay attention to what the plot was in the game because I just kept thinking,
1109000	1115000	this is so much like Diablo, but it feels like, you know, kind of like a new, I don't want to say like a sequel,
1115000	1121000	because obviously there's an official Diablo sequel coming, but a new game in that sort of same vein as Diablo 2.
1121000	1128000	And I think fans of these games, like if you ever played Diablo Diablo 2, which were huge PC games, you're going to like Torchlight and get a little kick out of it.
1128000	1135000	Even if not, I think it's worth just trying the demo because the demo will entertain you for like two hours at least, and it's free.
1135000	1138000	So go grab it on Steam and see if you like it. You got no reason not to.
1138000	1143000	And again, I really want to encourage you, even though the game does have its drawbacks, you know, that there's no multiplayer,
1143000	1148000	and that was what made Diablo 2 such a huge thing, for 20 bucks, the value is awesome.
1148000	1155000	Because like Diablo 2, they still charge 30, 40 bucks for, I want to say, like the battle chest.
1155000	1160000	I think they still charge 30 bucks for. I don't have a store in front of me, but I think that's about what they charge.
1160000	1164000	So, you know, you get a great deal with Torchlight, and so I definitely think it's worth checking out.
1164000	1167000	That's probably the only new game I played this week, but I had fun with it.
1167000	1171000	So I am making it a goal of mine to make sure I check out at least one new game every week for the show,
1171000	1176000	because, you know, I'm going to co-host a radio show about video games, and I probably need to make sure I play a lot of games.
1176000	1180000	But it can be an expensive habit, because remember, video games, unlike your favorite websites out there,
1180000	1185000	video game companies do not send copies of games to us for free.
1185000	1187000	Very rarely. It's happened before, but very rarely.
1187000	1192000	So usually that type of game playing is coming out of our own pockets,
1192000	1196000	and the economy is taking its toll on us here at OLR, just like it has anyone else.
1196000	1198000	So we'll try our best, though.
1198000	1201000	We certainly will try to play as many demos and all that fun stuff as we can.
1201000	1204000	So, let's see.
1204000	1208000	Questions from the chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.
1208000	1211000	Ricky Go Mac asks, does WoW work on a Mac?
1211000	1214000	Yes, it works on a Mac. World of Warcraft works on a Mac.
1214000	1220000	In fact, Blizzard is one of those companies that's always been very good about getting their games to work on PC and Mac.
1220000	1224000	I want to say, I don't know so much about Diablo. I can't state for sure that one,
1224000	1229000	but I think Warcraft 3 plays on both, and all the future WoW expansions play on both.
1229000	1230000	So there you go.
1230000	1237000	Deakman in chat says, loving Torchlight, it's the first Diablo-like game I've ever liked.
1237000	1239000	Before we get into gaming news tonight, and speaking of Deakman,
1239000	1245000	I do want to take a minute to acknowledge and further thank the masterminds behind our website,
1245000	1248000	and that's Deakman and VX Jason XV.
1248000	1250000	They both do kind of separate stuff for our website.
1250000	1253000	VX Jason XV kind of does the server admin stuff,
1253000	1256000	whereas Deakman is kind of like in charge of the actual website itself.
1256000	1259000	And both of them do a great job really helping us out,
1259000	1261000	because I don't know about Dark Soccer and Loki,
1261000	1264000	but I'm just not smart when it comes to building websites anymore.
1264000	1266000	So, you know, their knowledge has been so good for us,
1266000	1268000	and the reason why I bring it up, especially this week,
1268000	1270000	is because we had a lot of server issues this week.
1270000	1272000	In fact, if you tried to send us email towards the end of the week,
1272000	1274000	it probably bounced because we were having some server problems.
1274000	1278000	But they fixed it, and they do all this for free.
1278000	1281000	Just like we do, they do it all for free because they love the show,
1281000	1286000	and just, you know, we need to acknowledge them as part of what makes OLR work,
1286000	1289000	the part that you don't hear every week on the show.
1289000	1291000	But it's important.
1291000	1293000	Well, I do have some other news on a technical nature,
1293000	1295000	something that we discussed before the show too.
1295000	1296000	Sure, what's up?
1296000	1298000	I'm going to be doing new album art for us.
1298000	1301000	That's great, because I was just thinking earlier this evening,
1301000	1304000	and to segue into this, we now have a Facebook fan page.
1304000	1306000	An official Facebook fan page is out there now.
1306000	1308000	Although we've always had a Facebook group,
1308000	1310000	Facebook about a year ago,
1310000	1312000	and we really should have jumped on this when it first started,
1312000	1314000	made it a lot easier to make like a fan page
1314000	1316000	where we can deliver updates to your feed,
1316000	1318000	and we promise we're not going to spam like crazy.
1318000	1320000	You know, we'll do it tastefully,
1320000	1322000	and just kind of have a central hub that I think will work
1322000	1325000	a little more better functionality-wise
1325000	1327000	to have like an OLR fan page.
1327000	1328000	So we've added that on Facebook,
1328000	1330000	and we're trying to get up to 100 fans,
1330000	1331000	because once we get 100 fans,
1331000	1333000	that's when our little like,
1333000	1336000	that's when we move into the next stage of having a fan page.
1336000	1338000	We can have like a short URL and all the statistics.
1338000	1341000	It's kind of like in Spore, how you have different levels.
1341000	1345000	You know, your little cell becomes a living creature.
1345000	1346000	See, we're in the cell game right now.
1346000	1348000	Once we get up to 100 fans,
1348000	1350000	we'll actually get to build a creature.
1350000	1351000	That's basically what we're waiting for.
1351000	1352000	So check that out on Facebook.
1352000	1354000	It's awful. It's awful, awful, awful.
1354000	1358000	I was such a big Dragon Ball Z fan back in the day
1358000	1360000	that when you said cell game,
1360000	1361000	I instantly started thinking of that.
1361000	1363000	No, not cell shaded.
1363000	1364000	But you know the game that's like flow?
1364000	1365000	No, cell game.
1365000	1367000	There was a whole art called the cell game.
1367000	1368000	Oh, okay. Gotcha.
1368000	1369000	Gotcha.
1369000	1371000	But anyway, what was making me think that is
1371000	1373000	I was trying to find artwork to upload to our Facebook,
1373000	1375000	and I was thinking, you know,
1375000	1376000	as I was uploading the album art,
1376000	1379000	I was like, dang, we took this picture back in like,
1379000	1381000	2005, you know?
1381000	1384000	And even though we took some new pictures since then,
1384000	1386000	sadly, none of the pictures of that photo shoot
1386000	1390000	were really workable for album art, you know?
1390000	1391000	Sometimes it just doesn't come out.
1391000	1394000	So we might have to try either A, another photo shoot,
1394000	1395000	or B, Dark Sakura, I think,
1395000	1397000	is going to cook up some hand-drawn album art,
1397000	1398000	which will be fun.
1398000	1404000	Yeah, I'm considering ripping off one of my favorite bands.
1404000	1406000	TigerKlonChat says,
1406000	1409000	It won't be long until someone makes an official OLR iPhone app.
1409000	1412000	You know, I don't have the first idea how to do something like that,
1412000	1415000	but hey, if you're interested in that sort of thing,
1415000	1417000	you're into development,
1417000	1418000	we can give it our blessing.
1418000	1420000	Just show us what your ideas are,
1420000	1423000	and we'll help promote the crap out of it.
1423000	1425000	All we ask is that it's a free app,
1425000	1426000	because, you know, the show's free,
1426000	1429000	so we'll have to figure out other ways to pay you,
1429000	1431000	such as love and adoration.
1431000	1432000	I don't know.
1432000	1433000	Anyhow.
1433000	1434000	Porn.
1434000	1435000	Porn.
1435000	1436000	Tripple porn.
1436000	1439000	Tripple porn.
1439000	1440000	What the hell is wrong with you?
1440000	1442000	Tripple porn is just watching them eat.
1442000	1444000	I think that's all the housekeeping I wanted to get into tonight.
1444000	1445000	Facebook fan page,
1445000	1448000	which I'll link and chat shortly if someone else hasn't already done it,
1448000	1450000	and all that fun stuff,
1450000	1451000	and Twitter, of course,
1451000	1452000	we're on there, OLR,
1452000	1454000	and all that great stuff.
1454000	1457000	Did you drop your yarn?
1457000	1458000	Are we okay?
1458000	1459000	Dark Sakura just had an incident.
1459000	1460000	She dropped the yarn.
1460000	1462000	Luckily, Shermie didn't run to attack the yarn.
1462000	1464000	Is Shermie, the cat, a fan of yarn?
1464000	1466000	Shermie's a fan of sitting on her ass.
1466000	1469000	Okay, so no yarn play for her.
1469000	1472000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1472000	1473000	Loki, start us off.
1473000	1476000	You got a slew of updates for us tonight, don't you?
1476000	1478000	Yes, lots of stuff.
1478000	1481000	Well, we had some updates from Sony Online.
1481000	1486000	They were covering the PlayStation Network in a big ol' presentation,
1486000	1489000	which, of course, they put out on the internet as well.
1489000	1493000	And there's some interesting changes that they're talking about
1493000	1499000	making and some other ways they're planning on expanding the Sony Online brand.
1499000	1501000	One of the things that they're planning on doing, of course,
1501000	1505000	is expanding the PlayStation Network infrastructure to non-gaming devices.
1505000	1508000	And what that means is you may see, you know,
1508000	1512000	connectivity with, say, like, Sony branded TVs, perhaps.
1512000	1515000	Sony, you know, Vio computers.
1515000	1516000	Who knows?
1516000	1520000	Mobile devices, possibly Sony phones.
1520000	1525000	So, you know, it's interesting, I guess.
1525000	1528000	And they're going to try to kind of connect everything together that way.
1528000	1533000	I'm always wondering if they should just change the name of the PlayStation Network since,
1533000	1537000	you know, like maybe Sony Online Network or something like that.
1537000	1538000	I don't know.
1538000	1546000	One of the other things that's also going on is they're trying to also kind of create a brand with this,
1546000	1549000	you know, online network as well.
1549000	1556000	And they're saying that one of the major selling points, you know,
1556000	1563000	of the PlayStation Network is also all the features like downloading games, music, and movies and whatnot.
1563000	1569000	And they're thinking that expanding that to, you know,
1569000	1572000	all their devices would be a good value for the customers.
1572000	1576000	Kind of like a little bit like how iTunes works and stuff where you can, you know,
1576000	1583000	download stuff to your, was it the, I think your media center for iPhone.
1583000	1584000	Apple TV, is that what they call it?
1584000	1586000	Apple TV, that's what I meant, yeah.
1586000	1589000	You can download stuff to that.
1589000	1590000	I don't know.
1590000	1592000	It's interesting.
1592000	1597000	Well, I mean, this is Sony's whole thing this year is this whole it only does everything.
1597000	1599000	Well, and that whole thing, it only does everything, you know,
1599000	1602000	is that they're trying to sell this machine based on only games.
1602000	1604000	It will not make me waffles.
1604000	1605000	I've tried.
1605000	1607000	It looks like a Foreman grill and it doesn't make me waffles.
1607000	1610000	It does look like a Foreman grill, so it will at least look like a grill.
1610000	1611000	Not so much now, though.
1611000	1612000	It's slightly slimmer.
1612000	1614000	It's like a Foreman slim, you know.
1614000	1619000	But this is their whole marketing thing this year, which, you know, to be fair,
1619000	1622000	we've given Sony its fair share of shit on this show.
1622000	1626000	And, you know, like I always say and like we always say,
1626000	1629000	we will razz a gaming company when they deserve to get razzed,
1629000	1631000	but we'll give them praise and they deserve to get praised.
1631000	1634000	And I think Sony is finally getting it this year, you know.
1634000	1636000	They've done a lot of smart things this year.
1636000	1639000	And one of them is this whole it only does everything campaign
1639000	1642000	because I think that's really the PlayStation 3 strength.
1642000	1644000	I think it really does do everything, you know.
1644000	1646000	I want it to play good games.
1646000	1648000	There are a lot of great games.
1648000	1649000	Which it doesn't really do.
1649000	1651000	No, there's a lot of good games on PlayStation 3.
1651000	1652000	I don't know.
1652000	1655000	It doesn't do everything, but it does do a lot, so.
1655000	1657000	I want it to do things well.
1657000	1663000	I still say Blu-Ray is worth more weight than I think a lot of people gives it credit for.
1663000	1665000	I'm not trying to be a Sony fanboy, but I'm telling you.
1665000	1668000	No, but all I use my PS3 for is the Blu-Ray.
1668000	1674000	It doesn't have any games on it that are really good that we can't already get on Xbox 360.
1674000	1678000	Little Big Planet, Demon's Souls, some of the PlayStation Network games like Fat Princess,
1678000	1679000	Pixel Junk.
1679000	1680000	I really didn't care for Little Big Planet that much.
1680000	1682000	But the thing, though, about Blu-Ray, though.
1682000	1683000	That was my favorite game that came out last year.
1683000	1685000	I mean, it was fun and then the novelty wore off.
1685000	1689000	It's not as big of a draw as it was with DVD, though,
1689000	1692000	because people don't give a shit about upgrading to Blu-Ray right now.
1692000	1695000	I mean, not as much as they did with DVD where everyone's like,
1695000	1698000	Oh my God, a DVD! Let's go and replace our library with that shit.
1698000	1700000	But then now, a few years later, like,
1700000	1702000	Hey, wait a second, I just bought a bunch of DVDs.
1702000	1704000	Why am I going to go buy Blu-Rays?
1704000	1706000	So they haven't really adopted it as much.
1706000	1712000	It does help sell the system, but it's also not really something that kind of,
1712000	1715000	I don't know, it's not a huge driving force for it.
1715000	1718000	Well, on top of that, you can also, for people who want a Blu-Ray player,
1718000	1722000	you can get better Blu-Ray players for cheaper than a PS3 costs.
1722000	1727000	But that being said, though, it's a lot easier to update your Blu-Ray player,
1727000	1731000	or even with the PlayStation 3 firmwares and stuff,
1731000	1734000	because I hear a lot of complaints from people,
1734000	1737000	Oh yeah, I bought this Blu-Ray disc and I went and popped it into my player,
1737000	1740000	and I need a new firmware update.
1740000	1743000	Well, how the fuck do you do that with a Blu-Ray player?
1743000	1745000	Well, unless you have it connected to the internet,
1745000	1749000	you have to actually go burn a disc, pop it into your player,
1749000	1752000	and do all that stuff on your PC.
1752000	1755000	That's going to be eel, because I heard one of the big things
1755000	1757000	that's supposed to be a Black Friday deal this year
1757000	1760000	is that Walmart's going to have a $98 Blu-Ray player.
1760000	1764000	And I'm thinking, well, that's cool for people that want to get into Blu-Ray.
1764000	1766000	Certainly that's much cheaper than a PlayStation 3,
1766000	1768000	but I'm thinking in the back of my mind,
1768000	1770000	does this thing connect to the internet?
1770000	1772000	Is it going to have Blu-Ray live?
1772000	1775000	Granted, how many people really use that Blu-Ray live stuff?
1775000	1776000	Probably a minority.
1776000	1781000	So the average family will probably be able to do just fine with this player without it,
1781000	1784000	but you make a good point about the firmware,
1784000	1789000	is that unlike DVDs, you have to make sure these Blu-Rays are on top of the firmware.
1789000	1792000	I'm surprised they don't come on the discs.
1792000	1795000	Well, they can't because there's so many different players out there.
1795000	1798000	I mean, you could probably fit all the firmwares on that disc,
1798000	1802000	but they're just not going to because they don't care.
1802000	1806000	Something else that they're looking into is also a possible revenue stream
1806000	1808000	for their online service as well.
1808000	1809000	What does that mean?
1809000	1813000	That there's going to be some content on there that's going to be a paid service.
1813000	1817000	So whereas everything is free right now, that may change.
1817000	1821000	They're talking about possible models including PSP rental services,
1821000	1826000	also maybe some MMOs and whatnot.
1826000	1830000	I don't think they're going to just all of a sudden change the whole service to being paid,
1830000	1836000	but there may be certain optional aspects that you may have to pay for later on down the road.
1836000	1838000	But of course, they haven't announced anything officially yet,
1838000	1841000	but it's something that's probably going to come.
1841000	1847000	And then finally, Sony is expecting the PlayStation Network to pull in 50 billion yen
1847000	1850000	in their 2009 financial year.
1850000	1854000	And of course, they're saying that right now they've got 33 million registered accounts
1854000	1859000	on the PlayStation Network, which is a lot more than they have actual systems out there.
1859000	1862000	So of course, people have multiple accounts because you can make as many as you want.
1862000	1865000	I have four.
1865000	1874000	They have a high ratio of active users, about 5.4 million daily unique user sign-ins,
1874000	1878000	and 1.4 million daily PlayStation Store visits.
1878000	1886000	And of course, downloading volume has been increasing, 25 petabyte downloads a month.
1886000	1888000	That's a lot of downloads.
1888000	1894000	And of course, their digital sales is really growing.
1894000	1898000	Going to some comments from our chat room, DJ Rama S is actually correcting me.
1898000	1904000	The Black Friday Magnavox player that's at Walmart, $78, not 98.
1904000	1905000	That's a good price.
1905000	1907000	It's not bad at all for a Blu-ray player.
1907000	1912000	You have to make sure it's a good Blu-ray player.
1912000	1914000	And it's going to be bottom of the barrel if it's $78.
1914000	1915000	Let's face it.
1915000	1916000	Come on, get what you pay for.
1916000	1919000	Game Guru says in chat, this firmware junk is going to kill Blu-ray.
1919000	1922000	It just makes Blu-ray more complicated than DVD.
1922000	1924000	I've got to be honest.
1924000	1930000	I don't know if I see it that same way because that whole firmware thing is not very well advertised.
1930000	1931000	I think a lot of people don't know.
1931000	1934000	I put it in the same vein as HDTV.
1934000	1935000	That's even worse, though, if they don't know
1935000	1937000	because then they're going to pop in.
1937000	1939000	Say they go rent a movie and they pop it in.
1939000	1940000	They're like, what the fuck?
1940000	1941000	I can't play it.
1941000	1943000	And then they're pissed off.
1943000	1945000	Yeah, but they've already bought the Blu-ray player.
1945000	1946000	It doesn't matter.
1946000	1948000	They're still pissed off, though, and now they're just like, fuck it.
1948000	1951000	I'm just going to buy my movies on DVD.
1951000	1952000	Well, okay.
1952000	1957000	My other thought, though, is that the HDTVs.
1957000	1960000	A lot of these, this is going to be a huge thing this holiday season, too, is HDTVs.
1960000	1965000	And you see this in a lot of Black Friday ads is that HDTVs are coming as low as like $200, $300.
1965000	1972000	But what a lot of people don't realize about those very cheap HDTVs is that a lot of them are 720p.
1972000	1977000	Those TVs are only capable of 720p, which is considered high def.
1977000	1981000	And to most people, they're probably never going to notice the difference.
1981000	1985000	Like, grandma is going to notice the difference from her old TV,
1985000	1988000	but she's not going to know that she's missing 1080.
1988000	1990000	She's not going to notice that that's missing.
1990000	1995000	Like, for instance, even the HDTV I own, because I adopted kind of early and still tried to keep it cheap,
1995000	1998000	my HDTV won't do 1080p.
1998000	2000000	It'll do 1080i, but it won't do 1080p.
2000000	2005000	And I'm kind of at that point where I'm like, dang, I wish I'd gotten a TV that did 1080p.
2005000	2009000	Honestly, you're not going to be able to tell unless your TV is like 60 inches and, I mean...
2009000	2010000	Which it's not.
2010000	2013000	And so that's why I haven't replaced it, but, you know.
2013000	2018000	But the reason why I bring that up, I think a lot of people that go out and buy these deals and buy these TVs
2018000	2025000	don't know that what they're getting is not the, I guess you could say, quote quote, real high def,
2025000	2028000	or the high high def, or whatever you want to call it.
2028000	2032000	And, you know, folks in chat are saying, do you really need 1080p?
2032000	2035000	I don't know. Maybe I'm just weird. I can tell the difference.
2035000	2037000	But just barely. But I can tell.
2037000	2039000	It's not that big a deal.
2039000	2042000	A lot of those Sony games only play at 720p anyways.
2042000	2045000	And that's true, and a lot of TV shows only broadcast to 720p.
2045000	2048000	But your Blu-rays will go up to 1080p.
2048000	2050000	So, anyhow.
2050000	2052000	Just thought I would bring that up.
2052000	2057000	Let's move on to some other stories that also have to do with Sony, and it comes with firmware updates.
2057000	2060000	There's been a lot, a lot of firmware updates in Sonyville this week.
2060000	2064000	We'll start with the PSP, which got a firmware update to 6.20.
2064000	2069000	And a lot of what is new in this firmware update, and of course this being Sony's portable system,
2069000	2074000	is that now they have the PlayStation Network digital comics reader installed.
2074000	2077000	That's in the new extras section of the cross-media bar.
2077000	2083000	But keep in mind, this service is not actually launching until December, is when it's going to launch in most regions.
2083000	2086000	That would be Australia, UK, US.
2086000	2093000	There will be, early 2010 is when you're going to see it in French, German, Spanish, and so forth.
2093000	2095000	Japan will get their manga service very soon.
2095000	2100000	There's also some other little updates there as well, is that, you know, you can do some things with playlists,
2100000	2104000	and that apparently there's now TV in there as well.
2104000	2107000	I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I guess there's a TV category.
2107000	2108000	I wonder if that's for the TV shows.
2108000	2109000	I think it's just TV shows.
2109000	2111000	So that they're not looped in with movies.
2111000	2114000	I don't think it's like suddenly a TV tuner, or we'd probably hear much more about it.
2114000	2117000	I think it's just a different way of sorting some of the content from the PlayStation Store.
2117000	2119000	That was the big news on the PSP this week.
2119000	2124000	PS3, I would say, got a significantly bigger update, unless of course you're a big comic book fan.
2124000	2129000	PlayStation 3 got firmware 3.10, and some of the big changes they made in this
2129000	2134000	is that now you can pick a color for your little friends card, or whatever they call it,
2134000	2138000	and that's also what shows up in the bar as you scroll through your friends list,
2138000	2140000	and you can elect your own color.
2140000	2145000	This took me a little while to find how to do this, so just a tip from me to you.
2145000	2149000	Go in and view your own card, like on your own friends list,
2149000	2152000	and then you'll notice on the side is a little color swatch thing,
2152000	2156000	and you can pick that, and you can pick between like 20 different colors.
2156000	2160000	So I picked green, of course, because my PlayStation 3 name is Green Sky,
2160000	2163000	so it would make sense to pick green.
2163000	2165000	And then some other folks picked other colors.
2165000	2167000	I see my friends list filling up with colors.
2167000	2171000	And of course the other big, big change is that they now have Facebook integration,
2171000	2177000	and this is where now you can't really view Facebook on your PlayStation 3
2177000	2180000	unless it's through the web browser, and they do say they made changes
2180000	2183000	or updates to the web browser to make Facebook more friendly,
2183000	2187000	but don't expect to see it streamlined in your cross-media bar or anything.
2187000	2191000	No, I would say your PlayStation 3 will now serve as Bejeweled Blitz,
2191000	2196000	Farmville, Mafia Wars. It will now publish to your profile.
2196000	2198000	The nice thing is, though, there are different settings,
2198000	2201000	and you can turn them on or off, whatever it's going to do.
2201000	2204000	So you can set it to publish trophies to your profile.
2204000	2206000	I think that's the one I have turned on.
2206000	2211000	You can set it to publish whenever you download things from the store to your profile,
2211000	2212000	and that would include demos.
2212000	2214000	I turned that one off because that's kind of private.
2214000	2217000	I don't want anyone knowing that I'm downloading Hannah Montana.
2217000	2218000	Porn!
2218000	2220000	All right. You can't get porn on the store.
2220000	2224000	And then the third thing is that you can turn it on for game specific,
2224000	2228000	like if developers want to implement Facebook editions in their game,
2228000	2233000	think about how Uncharted 2 would publish to your Twitter, that type of thing.
2233000	2234000	You can turn that on or off.
2234000	2237000	So I have it off right now until I see what developers are doing with it,
2237000	2241000	because you know there's going to be some games that just really don't use it tastefully,
2241000	2243000	but there will be other games where it's kind of cool.
2243000	2245000	More stuff for me to block.
2245000	2248000	And that's what a lot of people are saying, more stuff for me to hide.
2248000	2251000	I went ahead and turned on the trophies because I said,
2251000	2254000	okay, this isn't much different from the Bejeweled Blitz trophies.
2254000	2256000	If people are going to publish those, then I can publish my trophies,
2256000	2259000	but the rest of it I turned off for now.
2259000	2264000	By the way, also, one other non-really advertised update in Firmware 3.10,
2264000	2268000	now you can actually report your errors directly to Sony.
2268000	2271000	Kind of like when your Windows system crashes in a program,
2271000	2273000	you can click a button to submit information to Microsoft.
2273000	2276000	That whole type of thing is built into your PS3.
2276000	2279000	It's been hard for a lot of the gaming blogs to test
2279000	2282000	because you can't really force your PlayStation 3 to crash very easy,
2282000	2286000	but Sony assures that that functionality is in there.
2286000	2287000	So maybe you'll hear more about that later.
2287000	2290000	Also not widely talked about, there is a new photo application
2290000	2293000	that you can download into your media bar.
2293000	2295000	I haven't played a whole lot with this,
2295000	2298000	but it basically kicks your photo viewing up to the next level,
2298000	2301000	does some different things with the gallery and the viewing.
2301000	2305000	And one feature of your PlayStation 3 maybe you've never thought of before,
2305000	2308000	you could have it cycle through photographs while you're at a party or something
2308000	2310000	and be a virtual picture frame, if you're into that.
2310000	2314000	I don't know, not everybody wants to show off their pictures like that,
2314000	2317000	but just an idea of how you could use that.
2317000	2320000	So lots of updates to the various Sony platforms this week.
2320000	2323000	Well, in Virtual Console there's been some updates
2323000	2326000	that I'm pretty sure are making people happy.
2326000	2332000	Coming on the 23rd, we get to see the SNES Mario Kart for 800 points.
2332000	2334000	That's pretty cool.
2334000	2338000	And I guess they're trying to give us more things to be thankful for.
2338000	2342000	Also coming out, even though there's not a date for it,
2342000	2348000	is the SNES version of Pilotwings and the N64 Smash Brothers.
2348000	2352000	Prices and dates are pending.
2352000	2355000	So that's pretty cool.
2355000	2358000	Do you guys notice a trend here with Nintendo in the past month?
2358000	2360000	I don't know if anyone else has picked up on this,
2360000	2364000	but they've been really trying to do a lot of this fan service in the past month,
2364000	2368000	and I'm not sure if this has any correlation to the holidays or what's going on.
2368000	2370000	Loki, I'd be curious your thought on this.
2370000	2372000	I mean, look at this.
2372000	2374000	All these fan games are promising to deliver now.
2374000	2377000	All the games we've been wanting since Virtual Console first launched.
2377000	2380000	Pilotwings, Mario Kart, Smash Brothers, etc.
2380000	2383000	And we just got Final Fantasy last month and so forth.
2383000	2386000	We're getting a lot of these big, big games on Virtual Console.
2386000	2391000	And we're finally seeing awesome updates to 8-bit games,
2391000	2395000	like we wish they'd done a long time ago, with Excitebike.
2395000	2399000	And finally, demos for WiiWare games.
2399000	2402000	All this happening in the past two months.
2402000	2404000	What gives?
2404000	2407000	Well, I think it's just about time that they put them on there,
2407000	2412000	and also just some stuff for Christmas to get people interested,
2412000	2414000	especially people that just buy new systems,
2414000	2417000	to get them interested in what's coming out.
2417000	2422000	So maybe to entice these people that are jumping ship to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this Christmas.
2422000	2425000	I just think it's just a matter of time that they've released this stuff.
2425000	2427000	I don't know.
2427000	2430000	Comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelandtraded.com.
2430000	2433000	ActDef says, yeah, Super Mario Kart. Pilotwings sucks, though.
2433000	2435000	Bite your tongue. I love Pilotwings.
2435000	2438000	Now, do they have Pilotwings 64 on there?
2438000	2440000	I don't know if that's on Virtual Console.
2440000	2442000	I have yet to check that out, if it's there.
2442000	2445000	I never played Pilotwings 64. I just remember the old school one.
2445000	2448000	That was a launch title on Super Nintendo, if I remember right.
2448000	2450000	They should do some new Mario Kart games.
2450000	2454000	Like, do a new Mario Kart game, done the Super NES way or something like that,
2454000	2456000	with multiplayer and everything.
2456000	2458000	That would be all kinds of awesome.
2458000	2461000	Although, I've got to say, Mario Kart Wii was still pretty decent.
2461000	2465000	It's still decent, but you can make new tracks and stuff like that pretty easy,
2465000	2470000	or even import some of the Game Boy Advance ones or something.
2470000	2473000	That would be kind of cool, though, if they could go on that retro kick.
2473000	2475000	I love Pilotwings.
2475000	2478000	Even though there was only maybe five or six different sports you could do in there,
2478000	2483000	the game went on for a while, and it was a very, very hard game.
2483000	2487000	I love Pilotwings. That was one of the best Super Nintendo games.
2487000	2490000	I think that's one I don't have, actually.
2490000	2494000	The launch games on Super Nintendo all held up really freaking well.
2494000	2498000	Amongst almost any console I can think of,
2498000	2500000	I think the Super Nintendo has had some of the best launch titles.
2500000	2502000	I mean, think about it. Mario World, F-Zero.
2502000	2506000	No, actually, I don't think Mario World technically launched with a console.
2506000	2508000	If I remember right, that came out a couple weeks later.
2508000	2509000	It was a holiday bundle.
2509000	2513000	I think the only games that launched with the system were F-Zero and Pilotwings.
2513000	2515000	I could be wrong on that.
2515000	2517000	It's been many, many years.
2517000	2520000	It's been a good 15-some-odd years since that console launched.
2520000	2525000	But I seem to recall that F-Zero and Pilotwings were the launch titles.
2525000	2529000	And they were both awesome, awesome games.
2529000	2532000	Loki, let's move on with some more news.
2532000	2535000	Yes, and it's kind of funny, though.
2535000	2539000	We may have talked about it in the past.
2539000	2544000	I know we've talked about it in the past, about how people were boycotting Modern Warfare 2
2544000	2547000	because no dedicated servers.
2547000	2553000	A lot of the stuff that they thought Infinity War was kind of ignoring and just removing out of the game.
2553000	2558000	And of course, as you would expect, because it is a PC title,
2558000	2564000	hackers have already gotten their hands on it and have pretty much fixed the problems, actually.
2564000	2571000	They have actually enabled their own dedicated servers and also some other cheats or whatnot
2571000	2575000	or fun stuff to play around with on the dedicated servers as well,
2575000	2582000	including super jumps, infinite ammo, rapid-fire grenades, all sorts of crazy stuff.
2582000	2587000	But it's actually pretty awesome, at least now that you can actually play around dedicated servers.
2587000	2590000	And that should make a lot of fans happy as well.
2590000	2595000	In fact, I remember seeing, they were showing the sales for the PC version of Modern Warfare 2.
2595000	2601000	And actually, it didn't seem like the sales were affected too much by any sort of boycott.
2601000	2605000	And that's kind of also prevalent with the stuff we talked about last week,
2605000	2611000	where there was a screenshot showing the clan of people boycotting Modern Warfare 2,
2611000	2614000	actually playing Modern Warfare 2.
2614000	2620000	But it is kind of cool, though, that hackers can come around and actually add value to the game.
2620000	2625000	And one of the other things that they found out as well, kind of with all the hacking and stuff,
2625000	2631000	is that there's some new game modes that haven't quite been unveiled yet,
2631000	2633000	possibly stuff that they're going to patch in later on,
2633000	2640000	including a new mode, VIP, which apparently is very similar to Counter-Strike,
2640000	2644000	which captures a flag with, I guess, a single flag between two teams,
2644000	2649000	and Global Thermonuclear War, which one side has to capture the nuke
2649000	2652000	and hold it for a certain amount of time in order to win.
2652000	2661000	And of course, this stuff you can enable using the hacked-in debug console, which is in there,
2661000	2662000	which is kind of cool.
2662000	2667000	And the thought is that this is going to come out later on as possible download content,
2667000	2672000	maybe even on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions as well.
2672000	2676000	So it makes sense that they would add value to it later on,
2676000	2679000	but it's kind of neat, though, that this stuff's already there.
2679000	2683000	I guess, I don't know, people don't pay to unlock content too much,
2683000	2687000	but if this is going to be a free patch later on, that might be kind of cool.
2687000	2690000	But if we've got to pay for it, that kind of sucks. I don't know.
2690000	2693000	Did we already kind of suspect that this was where the game was going,
2693000	2695000	is that we're going to have to pay for all this extra stuff,
2695000	2696000	which is why they locked it out in the first place?
2696000	2701000	Yeah. And I kind of think it's funny, it only took them like a week or two
2701000	2704000	to actually unlock all this stuff that's on there.
2704000	2708000	I mean, it just goes to show you, you can piss people off enough,
2708000	2712000	especially in the PC versions, you know, there's hackers out there that will find a way around it
2712000	2715000	to get the game to do what they want.
2715000	2719000	And that kind of makes me think, you know, when StarCraft II comes out,
2719000	2722000	that sucker's getting cracked open immediately.
2722000	2728000	It's very interesting how game companies are convinced that their games are hack-proof,
2728000	2733000	and I think, you know, people need to realize that that's just not possible.
2733000	2737000	Anything you don't want to happen with your game, you better not include on the disc,
2737000	2740000	because it will be found and it will be implemented, you know?
2740000	2746000	It's just one of those things, with the technology the way it is now, it's just not possible.
2746000	2750000	It is not possible to keep this stuff hidden from hackers.
2750000	2753000	Especially, you know, and a lot of this sometimes comes to, you know,
2753000	2758000	I hate to revisit a topic that's years old, but I think it's partially relevant.
2758000	2761000	A lot of it has to do with lazy coding or un-coding,
2761000	2764000	and I would go back to hot coffee in Grand Theft Auto.
2764000	2766000	That shit should have never been an issue.
2766000	2769000	Should have never ever been an issue, because you know what?
2769000	2772000	That truly was supposed to be taken out of the game.
2772000	2773000	I believe it.
2773000	2775000	That should have been taken out of the game, but you know what?
2775000	2780000	Lazy coding, they took out the pointer that would call up that little subroutine
2780000	2783000	that would run the hot coffee game, and lo and behold,
2783000	2787000	if you left the data on the disc, it was going to be discovered.
2787000	2789000	All a hacker had to do was put that pointer back in.
2789000	2792000	And going to Rockstar, I mean, all their stuff is kind of lazy coding anyways,
2792000	2795000	because everything is in text files.
2795000	2797000	They're easily editable.
2797000	2799000	I should know.
2799000	2804000	If you want something taken out of your game, you have to take it out of the game.
2804000	2807000	It's crazy.
2807000	2810000	Toagak in chat asked a question.
2810000	2814000	Wasn't there like porno hidden on a disc for some console and the author got sued?
2814000	2815000	I don't remember.
2815000	2821000	There was one, I think it was like Bloody Roar 2 on the Playstation 1
2821000	2824000	had some sort of like erotic pictures or something like that
2824000	2828000	of the actual characters or something like that in there.
2828000	2830000	I want to say that was the game that had that.
2830000	2835000	And then of course there was, you know, SimCopter with all the gay sex or whatever.
2835000	2838000	Oh, yeah. No, SimTower, wasn't it?
2838000	2839000	No, SimCopter.
2839000	2840000	Was it Copter?
2840000	2842000	Yeah. Funny.
2842000	2845000	Well, anyhow, moving on to something not so funny.
2845000	2849000	Lawsuits and what some might actually consider a frivolous lawsuit.
2849000	2851000	I don't know. You be the judge.
2851000	2855000	Apparently there is a law firm out there, Abington IP.
2855000	2861000	They're investigating what they call a convenient wave of Xbox Live banings
2861000	2862000	that have happened recently.
2862000	2866000	The firm is saying that the tens of thousands of banned Xbox Live subscribers
2866000	2871000	who use their consoles, they deserve damages, money, what they call recompense
2871000	2873000	due to the timing.
2873000	2878000	They think because this banning happened just before Modern Warfare 2 happened
2878000	2883000	was released and, you know, well after Halo 3 ODST came out,
2883000	2887000	this was to make Microsoft as much money as possible
2887000	2890000	because clearly that was the motivation behind this whole thing, right?
2890000	2892000	So what is...
2892000	2894000	Oh, sorry. There's a...
2894000	2895000	Dan's iPhone.
2895000	2898000	Oh, a cell phone ringing behind me. This is throwing me off.
2898000	2902000	Please, when entering the OLR Studios, be sure to silence all cell phones and pagers.
2902000	2909000	All right. Anyhow, now this is weird because they're trying to do this class action lawsuit here
2909000	2913000	that apparently they're going to try and get a refund for the pro-rated
2913000	2916000	what was left on your Xbox Live subscription.
2916000	2919000	But it's weird because they didn't really ban the accounts, did they?
2919000	2921000	No, and that's the thing is they didn't understand it.
2921000	2927000	What they thought was their thinking behind it is that people expecting to play these games online
2927000	2931000	or whatever bought more of a subscription for their accounts
2931000	2933000	in preparation for these new games coming out.
2933000	2937000	And because of that, then Microsoft went ahead and decided to ban consoles.
2937000	2943000	Well, they're totally ignoring the fact that one, these people modded their consoles in the first place.
2943000	2947000	So they're responsible for it.
2947000	2951000	They need to know what's going on.
2951000	2954000	I mean, come on. If you mod your console, you know at one point or another,
2954000	2959000	especially if you're playing it online, that you're going to get banned eventually.
2959000	2964000	By the way, Microsoft responded this week, or just actually today, I should say,
2964000	2966000	made a response to this whole thing
2966000	2973000	that basically, to sum it all up, they say that they have every legal recourse to do what they did.
2973000	2975000	They were well within their legal rights. That's the quote.
2975000	2976000	Of course they were.
2976000	2977000	Well within their legal rights.
2977000	2979000	Of course they were, and that's why this whole thing is really retarded
2979000	2982000	because, once again, they aren't banning their live accounts.
2982000	2985000	They're just banning the console from connecting on live.
2985000	2990000	And at the same time, kind of removing a little bit of the features of the console,
2990000	2995000	but nothing major, like you can't install your games to the hard drive anymore,
2995000	2998000	which, whatever, that's fine.
2998000	3002000	And also that, you know, obviously the console can't connect to the live anymore,
3002000	3006000	and you can't take your profile from the console or whatever to earn achievements offline
3006000	3009000	and then move them and connect them online, whatever, because it's corrupt.
3009000	3011000	Although there is a workaround for that.
3011000	3015000	But isn't this all in the agreements that you accept when you play games,
3015000	3017000	that you're not going to fuck around with the...
3017000	3019000	If you have your console modded, you're playing burned games,
3019000	3022000	whether it be a backup of your game, whether it be a modded copy of the game,
3022000	3024000	or a pirated version of the game.
3024000	3028000	You're playing burned games, and that's unfortunately, you know,
3028000	3030000	they're just assuming that you're a pirate.
3030000	3034000	And I mean, probably 99% of the people out there are pirating games,
3034000	3036000	especially if their console's modded.
3036000	3039000	Now what sucks, though, is the people that say didn't know their console's modded
3039000	3041000	bought it used, and then they get banned.
3041000	3043000	That kind of sucks.
3043000	3045000	But then again, once it, you know...
3045000	3049000	But that would be a reason to sue where you bought it from, not a reason to sue Microsoft.
3049000	3050000	Exactly.
3050000	3051000	Buyer beware.
3051000	3052000	Buyer beware, and then...
3052000	3056000	Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of these used places probably have clauses in their contracts, too,
3056000	3058000	that protect them.
3058000	3062000	Yeah, and people also trying to return these consoles, you know, to stores or whatever,
3062000	3064000	trying to exchange them out for a good one.
3064000	3068000	Of course, you know, if that security seal's tampered with that, you know,
3068000	3070000	you can't return it.
3070000	3073000	Of course, you can always buy a new security seal to throw on top of it,
3073000	3075000	and then return it, but hey, that's another story.
3075000	3078000	Dirty, dirty.
3078000	3081000	But yeah, there's a lot of things out there that you can do,
3081000	3085000	but really it comes down to it's the user's fault.
3085000	3088000	They knew what they were getting into, and you know what?
3088000	3091000	If you really want to go legit and buy another console, you can do that,
3091000	3095000	and then you can take your account, restore your account to the new console,
3095000	3097000	and you're good to go.
3097000	3099000	I had two consoles banned this week.
3099000	3100000	I had one.
3100000	3103000	So we play, you know, we used to play modded Grand Theft Auto games,
3103000	3106000	and you know, so all four of our consoles are modded.
3106000	3109000	So far, though, only two of them have been banned, and that's fine.
3109000	3112000	I mean, because I knew that was going to happen,
3112000	3114000	and we have preparations for that.
3114000	3119000	But the thing is I went and bought a new console, restored my account,
3119000	3121000	took like a few minutes, and I was good to go.
3121000	3124000	I mean, there's no real issues.
3124000	3129000	I mean, later on I have to actually go through there and change the...
3129000	3132000	so that all my download content works on my new console
3132000	3134000	without being logged in live.
3134000	3137000	I'll eventually do that, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
3137000	3139000	This almost sounds like a game to you,
3139000	3142000	like this whole, like, getting around it and everything,
3142000	3144000	because you're definitely not pissed off about this.
3144000	3145000	You knew the risks going into this.
3145000	3147000	No, I knew the risks. I knew it was eventually going to happen.
3147000	3150000	Especially, okay, we are playing a modified game,
3150000	3153000	so basically all the stealth crap that would be involved...
3153000	3157000	And to be clear, this is the number one reason why you're doing this in the first place,
3157000	3159000	is not to pirate the games like crazy,
3159000	3163000	but because you are modding the Grand Theft Auto games for lols,
3163000	3166000	and it's not something you typically take online,
3166000	3168000	although it sounds like you did, and that's what got you in trouble.
3168000	3171000	Well, yeah, because we had to play, you know, we played against each other,
3171000	3172000	and you can only play that online.
3172000	3175000	If it was a System-Link game, like, say, if I could do that with Saints Row,
3175000	3177000	we would have never taken it online.
3177000	3179000	We would have just been playing, you know, via LAN.
3179000	3180000	Gotcha.
3180000	3183000	And, god, I wish I knew how to mod Saints Row 2, because I'd do that.
3183000	3186000	But, you know, we can't, so...
3186000	3188000	And that's also funny, too, because when our consoles got banned,
3188000	3191000	we played Saints Row 2, because, you know, the Kinect, it's alive.
3191000	3193000	We got a backup game for everything.
3193000	3196000	You know, but, yeah, so it's an inconvenience,
3196000	3200000	but, you know, I knew what I'm getting into, and whatever, you know.
3200000	3203000	I have, luckily, you know, my first console got banned.
3203000	3204000	My sister has a modded console.
3204000	3207000	She doesn't play online because she doesn't have internet.
3207000	3211000	So, you know, I get her games, and I, you know,
3211000	3214000	gave her a modded copy of Grand Theft Auto, and she plays that.
3214000	3217000	But hers is red-ringed, and I haven't gotten a chance to fix it yet,
3217000	3222000	so I just gave her my banned console, and it works just fine for her,
3222000	3223000	because she doesn't give a crap.
3223000	3226000	She doesn't know anything about, like, you know, connecting the live and whatnot.
3226000	3229000	She just wants to play, you know, a game where you fly around in a police car.
3229000	3230000	So...
3230000	3233000	Quick question from ToaGak in our chat room, chat.idontwinsondestrated.com,
3233000	3235000	and I don't even know if he can answer this, Loki.
3235000	3237000	How do they know if your console's modded?
3237000	3239000	Has it been revealed how they're catching it?
3239000	3242000	They can tell, basically.
3242000	3245000	It doesn't matter how, if you play in a burn game or not,
3245000	3249000	because, you know, we, honestly, we haven't played Grand Theft Auto,
3249000	3252000	the modded game, since August.
3252000	3254000	I mean, whenever they patched it last.
3254000	3259000	They can tell because your, you know, the modded firmwares or whatever,
3259000	3263000	they don't return the same values for, like, some of the security checks or whatever.
3263000	3267000	They aren't sure what exactly is going wrong,
3267000	3271000	but there is something in there that is not returning the exact value or something
3271000	3274000	when they're doing a check of the disk.
3274000	3276000	So they can tell what firmware you have on the drive.
3276000	3278000	They can't actually read the firmware on the drive.
3278000	3286000	But, you know, they can basically kind of see that you have, you know, modified firmware,
3286000	3288000	and then they go ahead and ban your console.
3288000	3292000	Our good buddy, Dan, very, very well known to the show.
3292000	3293000	He's been on before.
3293000	3296000	He's standing in the doorway and wants to make a comment on this whole topic.
3296000	3297000	Please, Dan.
3297000	3301000	They know, because they're fucking Microsoft.
3301000	3304000	I got a quick question for you, though, because you work in retail and all this stuff.
3304000	3308000	Have you had people try to return Xbox 360 consoles that have been banned to you?
3308000	3309000	No.
3309000	3310000	Do you have a way to catch them?
3310000	3312000	They know that I would pimp-slap them.
3312000	3319000	You're well known in your retail company's business for pimp-slapping people that try to do that.
3319000	3320000	For slapping the hose.
3320000	3324000	Honestly enough, if somebody brought me a console that was banned,
3324000	3330000	and I tested it, and it worked, since we don't connect the consoles to Live as part of the test,
3330000	3332000	we wouldn't know.
3332000	3336000	But just take them to GameStop.
3336000	3338000	They can't fucking tell.
3338000	3341000	They're too stupid to be allowed to live.
3341000	3346000	The views and opinions expressed by Dan do not necessarily reflect those.
3346000	3348000	Yes, they do.
3348000	3353000	You can tell, because what they do is they can connect to Xbox's website.
3353000	3357000	There's the whole repair thing that you can connect to,
3357000	3361000	and you can actually put in your serial number and you'll see if your console's banned or not.
3361000	3364000	Because when you try to enter your console serial number in there, it'll say,
3364000	3368000	sorry, your console's banned, fuck you, and that type of stuff.
3368000	3372000	I think gold, anthro, and chat sums up the thoughts of the listeners very well.
3372000	3375000	Thanks for the advice, XD.
3375000	3378000	Anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.
3378000	3382000	Some more news before we get to the release dates and soon the Classic Game of the Week.
3382000	3383000	DarkSakura.
3383000	3387000	Well, in other news, it's about steam.
3387000	3389000	Because they're steamy.
3389000	3392000	It's nutritious. It's delicious. It's steam.
3392000	3394000	It's water.
3394000	3405000	Steam actually now has approximately 70% of the overall digital distribution of PC games.
3405000	3408000	And that's actually quite a bit.
3408000	3419000	And they're actually saying that the other ones, like impulse is 10% and others combined are 20%.
3419000	3422000	So that's in terms of actual revenue.
3422000	3424000	It's pretty crazy stuff.
3424000	3426000	I'm not surprised. I use steam.
3426000	3428000	And it's a pretty good mechanism.
3428000	3435000	And plus the fact that one of the major game publishers of beloved PC games is behind it.
3435000	3438000	So they throw in a free copy of steam with everything that you get.
3438000	3440000	I'm sure helps greatly.
3440000	3447000	I mean, you're talking about the creators of Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, all these huge PC games.
3447000	3450000	That's clearly got to be part of the contribution.
3450000	3456000	Whereas I think all these other companies don't quite have the same tie-in like Valve and Steam do.
3456000	3465000	Well, the other thing too is that they're also saying that a lot of the games integrate the Steamworks tools into their games early on.
3465000	3469000	So that they can lock them out from other distribution platforms.
3469000	3473000	And also it's because of how successful their DRM solution is.
3473000	3475000	So it's pretty big.
3475000	3478000	Yeah, because the Steam's whole thing, and I haven't played a whole lot with this.
3478000	3483000	But apparently it's very easy to take what you've kind of downloaded and go to another computer and install the software.
3483000	3488000	I don't think you can do it unlimited, but it gives you somewhat some freedom on to how many computers you can do this with.
3488000	3490000	Because it's set by your account.
3490000	3491000	Yeah, exactly.
3491000	3497000	My only complaint about Steam being a long-time user of it, I'm not a big fan of the interface.
3497000	3502000	I kind of wish that demos were easier to find.
3502000	3507000	And just, I don't know, the layout of the store is not exactly eye-catching or appealing to me.
3507000	3508000	I don't know.
3508000	3515000	It's hard for me to put my finger on, but it's just not the most user-friendly front-end, the store anyway, to me.
3515000	3519000	Like, I think it could be a little flashier in a tasteful way.
3519000	3523000	I don't know if what I said makes any sense at all, but that's just kind of my thoughts on Steam.
3523000	3526000	It's kind of sometimes hard to find things.
3526000	3527000	Sometimes, yeah.
3527000	3530000	But I mean, it is though pretty...
3530000	3537000	I think it tries to be cut and dried, but in some cases it does over-complicate a few things just with the demo mixed in and everything.
3537000	3541000	You know, how they have everything just mixed in and you have to really filter it.
3541000	3544000	Bond in chat says, they make you jump through hoops to get the demo.
3544000	3546000	And I think it's related to this.
3546000	3548000	Oh, talking about like audio surf specifically.
3548000	3551000	You know, I didn't have a hard time with the torchlight demo at all.
3551000	3553000	There's a little button there on the side.
3553000	3555000	But I think it would be neat if they just kind of like just had a screen.
3555000	3557000	You know, new demos to check out.
3557000	3559000	You know, and I don't know.
3559000	3560000	I don't know.
3560000	3562000	I would just lay it out a little differently, that's all.
3562000	3566000	But otherwise, I love the idea that they took that whole...
3566000	3570000	What was that other gaming platform that you could bring... Xgame or something?
3570000	3572000	What was that called? X...
3572000	3573000	Something...
3573000	3576000	There was something that you could bring up inside other video games and chat with people.
3576000	3579000	Yeah, I remember the Xfire.
3579000	3580000	Xfire, thank you.
3580000	3581000	That's what it's called, Xfire.
3581000	3585000	They kind of molded that with a video game store and that I think was a smart idea.
3585000	3586000	So...
3586000	3590000	Anyhow, those are my thoughts on Steam for being a user as long as I have.
3590000	3591000	By the way, there is an unofficial...
3591000	3593000	Well, no, it's really official.
3593000	3598000	I guess, you know, because I'm on it and, you know, I don't think there's any other OLR groups.
3598000	3601000	And if you want the link to that, just go to OrangeLunchRadio.com.
3601000	3606000	There's a whole little box on the side where you'll see the Steam logo among other big websites like Facebook and Twitter.
3606000	3612000	And you can click that and join our Steam community.
3612000	3613000	It's pretty cool.
3613000	3616000	Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates.
3616000	3617000	Yes.
3617000	3622000	Not a whole lot coming out this week, obviously, with, you know, Black Friday and Thanksgiving and whatnot.
3622000	3624000	The releases are kind of light.
3624000	3631000	But this week we have some miscellaneous stuff on the DS, including Photo Frenzy, which I believe is a picture-matching game.
3631000	3633000	Hello Kitty Party!
3633000	3636000	Rob's top game on the DS.
3636000	3638000	Yay!
3638000	3640000	What, you don't like Hello Kitty?
3640000	3644000	No, I love Hello Kitty, but come on, let's face it, the games are all going to be crap.
3644000	3645000	It's Hello Kitty Party!
3645000	3649000	Fighting Fantasy on the DS as well.
3649000	3658000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, with very little fanfare, Karaoke Revolution.
3658000	3660000	Hurrah.
3660000	3665000	Your Shape featuring Jenny McCarthy, and it comes with a camera.
3665000	3667000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wasn't that supposed to be last week?
3667000	3670000	Because I've seen her remember making fun of this game previously.
3670000	3675000	Yeah, I think I may have talked about it last week, but yeah, it's being delayed.
3675000	3686000	Seen it's Sparkle Vampire Edition coming out on the Wii, Tekken 6 coming out on PSP, and on PC Twin Sector.
3686000	3695000	And Rogue Trooper is being released on the Wii, kind of a port of the PlayStation 2 game.
3695000	3697000	And that's it.
3697000	3708000	Well, no surprise, it's kind of a slow week in releases because, you know, again, pretty much all the games needed to be out already to make it for Black Friday.
3708000	3711000	But there are still some releases over in Japan anyway.
3711000	3721000	We have a game called Mushi Himesama Futari, version 1.5.
3721000	3725000	I don't know if this is like an upgrade to a previous game or what's going on, but it looks like this is a game.
3725000	3727000	This is on the Xbox 360, by the way, and that comes out this week.
3727000	3733000	It's a fighting game, or I'm sorry, not fighting game, shooter game, but I don't know, the box makes me think it's a fighting game.
3733000	3737000	It's like a shooter game and it has pretty girls in the background there.
3737000	3740000	It looks like it's an upgrade of an old arcade game.
3740000	3744000	These are all the games I'm going to be getting on the Xbox 360.
3744000	3748000	So it looks like you only have this game in original mode and some upgrades to that as well.
3748000	3755000	This is a big release over there because there's a specific fighting stick coming out for it and all this stuff.
3755000	3758000	Sorry, shooter stick or whatever they call it coming out for this as well.
3758000	3761000	On the PlayStation 3, just some price reductions.
3761000	3765000	Fallout 3, Mercenaries 2, and Mirror's Edge get some price reductions this week.
3765000	3769000	Again, all of these games coming out on the 26th.
3769000	3781000	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, Naruto Shippuden Ryu Jinki comes out this week, as well as Star Sakura Puyo Puyo version 7.
3781000	3782000	Puyo Puyo!
3782000	3784000	I know you're a big fan of Puyo Puyo.
3784000	3787000	Sim Animals Africa also makes its way to Japan this week.
3787000	3789000	Sadly though, not a lot of big releases there.
3789000	3797000	.hack//The GU series is getting a big price reduction, so if you haven't checked that out in Japan, now's your time to do that.
3797000	3799000	That's on the PlayStation 2.
3799000	3803000	On the DS, Cooking Mama 3 comes out in Japan this week.
3803000	3809000	Yes, there's a third Cooking Mama game and it comes out this week in Japan, as well as a game called Roller Angels.
3809000	3810000	Go figure.
3810000	3819000	And then lastly on the PSP this week, Gaku in Heaven, Boys Love Scramble.
3819000	3821000	Gakuen means high school.
3821000	3824000	So that's what it's called, Boys Love Scramble.
3824000	3827000	I'm not sure what type of game this is.
3827000	3829000	It's an adventure game.
3829000	3831000	I do love scrambled eggs.
3831000	3833000	Well, it's a yaoi game.
3833000	3835000	I was thinking, does Boys Love me?
3835000	3837000	And then the picture came up.
3837000	3840000	Oh yes, it is that kind of boy love.
3840000	3844000	So if you want a yaoi game, here's the week to get it on PSP.
3844000	3846000	Come on, Loki, look at that screenshot right there.
3846000	3848000	Tell me you're not interested in that game.
3848000	3850000	That's on the PSP. I'm not interested in that game.
3850000	3853000	It's a dude nibbling on another dude's ear and he's all blushing.
3853000	3855000	Oh, well sign me up then.
3855000	3856000	No thanks.
3856000	3858000	I'll link that in chat.
3858000	3863000	Here's another example of a game you just can't get over here in America.
3863000	3865000	And why not? And why not?
3865000	3868000	There's actually places that will release the games in English.
3868000	3871000	You can get them at conventions, so yes, you can get them in America.
3871000	3872000	Oh, that's okay.
3872000	3873000	I have one.
3873000	3874000	But even yaoi?
3874000	3875000	Yeah.
3875000	3876000	Okay.
3876000	3878000	No, I take them back. Do I have one?
3878000	3880000	Chris has some.
3880000	3882000	One of our giggling lesbians.
3882000	3884000	Well, there you go.
3884000	3885000	Just thought I'd bring that up.
3885000	3887000	How about Europe release date Star Saga?
3887000	3890000	Yeah, on the 24th we have Gravity Crash.
3890000	3892000	I just think that's a cool name.
3892000	3897000	27th, Just Dance, Karaoke Revolution, Lego Rock Band, Muramasa,
3897000	3903000	The Demon Blade on Wii, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja 5,
3903000	3908000	and Resident Evil, The Dark Side Chronicles.
3908000	3909000	That's it?
3909000	3910000	The end.
3910000	3911000	The end.
3911000	3913000	We'll have more gaming news and then the classic game of the week
3913000	3915000	coming up in just a few minutes.
3915000	3918000	Yes, lots of fun stuff.
3918000	3919000	So it's interesting.
3919000	3924000	You may remember with the DS, Disney, they're doing something very similar
3924000	3927000	to this called, I think, DGamer.
3927000	3932000	Well, Ubisoft, not to be outdone by them or I guess even EA,
3932000	3935000	have a new service called Uplay.
3935000	3937000	And this is going to be something that's going to be coming out
3937000	3940000	starting with Assassin's Creed 2.
3940000	3944000	It's going to tie in with all the other games that are available
3944000	3947000	from Ubisoft going forward.
3947000	3953000	And it's kind of a little bit like an achievement trophy program.
3953000	3959000	And basically you can go online and link all these games
3959000	3963000	that you may own from Ubisoft going forward to this
3963000	3966000	and be able to share your achievements and whatnot with your friends.
3966000	3969000	It's also a little bit like the Rockstar Social Club
3969000	3972000	that they've got there for the Rockstar games as well.
3972000	3975000	So they've got a bunch of different services included
3975000	3978000	Win, Help, Share, and Shop.
3978000	3982000	And right now Win is currently in beta.
3982000	3986000	And Ubisoft is saying that Uplay Win is enabling players
3986000	3990000	to collect units based on their actions in games
3990000	3993000	and exchange them for rewards such as exclusive in-game content
3993000	3995000	or other digital items.
3995000	4002000	The first of which is an Altair outfit and access to the Auditor Family Crypt.
4002000	4006000	So that's kind of cool that you can earn stuff in games
4006000	4009000	and unlock rewards in your games as well.
4009000	4011000	Is this kind of a trend where the developers are going?
4011000	4012000	Is that they're kind of like,
4012000	4015000	well, we want our own kind of Xbox Live type thing,
4015000	4017000	or we want our own little reward system.
4017000	4019000	Because it seems like, isn't Activision doing this too?
4019000	4021000	And certainly Blizzard with Battle.net,
4021000	4022000	although that's different because that's PC.
4022000	4024000	Maybe though this is going to be something where they actually have
4024000	4027000	like, it's to kind of entice people to buy their games
4027000	4030000	instead of maybe pirating them.
4030000	4034000	Because in that way, with this you would get like a unique code
4034000	4038000	that would be, I guess, in your manual or something like that
4038000	4039000	to prove that you own this game.
4039000	4041000	Or buying them used.
4041000	4042000	Or buying them used, yeah.
4042000	4047000	Because I actually, console piracy doesn't strike me as
4047000	4051000	as big a problem as it is on PC or other platforms.
4051000	4053000	You know, it's a lot harder to do
4053000	4056000	and so I don't think it's, you know, as impactful.
4056000	4057000	I mean, I'm not trying to belittle it,
4057000	4059000	but it doesn't seem like it's as impactful.
4059000	4061000	But certainly the used game market,
4061000	4063000	if you have a code in the manual, well there you go.
4063000	4065000	That's what they're really going after is the used game market.
4065000	4066000	I mean, I'm not sure.
4066000	4069000	I haven't gotten a copy of Assassin's Creed 2,
4069000	4073000	though I'm expecting one to be coming soon.
4073000	4075000	Ubisoft usually hooks me up.
4075000	4079000	But I guess we'll find out when I play that.
4079000	4083000	I do like how you can have a rabbit as your icon.
4083000	4084000	Because rabbits are awesome.
4084000	4086000	I still gotta play Rabbids Go Home, man.
4086000	4088000	That looks funny.
4088000	4090000	Well, in other video game news,
4090000	4092000	especially in time for the holidays,
4092000	4094000	you know, something that's being popular this year
4094000	4097000	with the economy, you know, kind of in the state it's in
4097000	4099000	and, you know, people making less money
4099000	4101000	and all that unfortunate stuff is that
4101000	4103000	Layaway is becoming a little more popular.
4103000	4105000	You know, I was actually seeing a news story on this
4105000	4108000	not that long ago about how Layaway is kind of making a comeback.
4108000	4111000	And Layaway in a nutshell, for those that don't know,
4111000	4114000	is a way for you to kind of, I guess you could say reserve something.
4114000	4116000	In other words, you buy something at the store,
4116000	4117000	but you're not really buying it.
4117000	4120000	You pay a portion of the money and then you make payments on it
4120000	4122000	until, you know, Christmas or whatever.
4122000	4124000	And then you get the item.
4124000	4126000	And this is much different than a credit card
4126000	4128000	because a credit card allows you to actually take the item home
4128000	4129000	and then you make payments on it.
4129000	4131000	But Layaway is they keep it in the back
4131000	4133000	and then once you pay off the item, then you can take it home with you.
4133000	4137000	But it allows you to make sure that you are able to get a copy of something
4137000	4140000	or that you get something at a certain price or what have you,
4140000	4142000	which I suppose could be the only, you know,
4142000	4143000	I was kind of looking at this going,
4143000	4145000	I don't understand what the advantages of Layaway are,
4145000	4147000	but I guess these are really the two big ones is that
4147000	4150000	you actually make sure that you are guaranteed a copy of a hot toy
4150000	4152000	or whatever it is and at a certain price.
4152000	4155000	Well, this is affecting the worlds of video games as well.
4155000	4157000	In fact, Toys R Us made a big announcement this week
4157000	4160000	that their big gift, as they call it, the Layaway program,
4160000	4163000	now includes video game hardware.
4163000	4165000	This is a big request from customers
4165000	4168000	according to the CEO Jerry Storch of Toys R Us.
4168000	4174000	And apparently if you deposit 20% of the console's purchase,
4174000	4178000	including tax and what it is they call a $10 service charge
4178000	4180000	because they are going to hold the item for you in the back,
4180000	4182000	so think of it as a storage fee I suppose,
4182000	4185000	you can do this cash, check, credit card, whatever.
4185000	4189000	And then as long as you make payment in full before December 6th,
4189000	4193000	then you can guarantee that you are going to have a copy of this.
4193000	4194000	And you know with Black Friday coming up,
4194000	4199000	this is a good way to I guess motivate people to purchase things.
4199000	4202000	Although honestly, December 6th does not give you a lot of time.
4202000	4204000	That only gives you like maybe two weeks.
4204000	4207000	Check out what other retailers are doing though
4207000	4210000	because I know Kmart, you know as much as we joke about
4210000	4214000	nobody shops at Kmart, they do have a pretty big Layaway program there
4214000	4216000	from what I understand and you can put stuff on Layaway there
4216000	4218000	all the way right through till Christmas.
4218000	4222000	So anyhow, lots and lots of console models and makes
4222000	4224000	are on the list there.
4224000	4228000	And also just a side note, Toys R Us is also expanding
4228000	4230000	their video game trade-in program.
4230000	4233000	Now it will be including video game hardware
4233000	4235000	and it just began on Friday.
4235000	4238000	You go to the guest service desk and then they're going to scan your items
4238000	4240000	and they'll make an offer and if approved,
4240000	4242000	you get a little gift card for the value.
4242000	4245000	So lots of folks want to get in on that used game market
4245000	4247000	and now it's used consoles as well,
4247000	4250000	although I highly doubt you could put a used console on Layaway.
4250000	4252000	So there you go.
4252000	4257000	Going into some comments from chat,
4257000	4259000	AlphaCananagram says,
4259000	4262000	Layaway equals an ancient Walmart version of pre-ordering.
4262000	4263000	Frisbee says,
4263000	4266000	Layaway is also a good place to hide gifts from people.
4266000	4267000	That's a good thought.
4267000	4269000	I never thought of it that way, but that's really cool.
4269000	4271000	Let's see,
4271000	4272000	Bochekawa says,
4272000	4274000	Layaway is awesome unless you cancel.
4274000	4277000	Usually there is a canceling fee and it takes too long
4277000	4279000	for them to put it back on the shelf.
4279000	4282000	So if you're going to do Layaway, you might want to double check.
4282000	4283000	ActDef says,
4283000	4284000	Walmart doesn't do Layaway now.
4284000	4286000	They used to, but not anymore.
4286000	4287000	ActDef, you might want to double check
4287000	4290000	because I hear it's making a comeback at a lot of stores.
4290000	4291000	I don't know if Walmart's one of them.
4291000	4294000	I know Kmart was the one that I saw on the news this week,
4294000	4297000	but I wouldn't be surprised if Walmart does it to some extent.
4297000	4300000	And it might depend also on your store, ActDef.
4300000	4301000	I know you're in Mexico
4301000	4303000	and things might also be a little different down there,
4303000	4307000	but I want to say I've still seen the Layaway department at stores here.
4307000	4312000	Also, there's actually a lot of doll sites, actually.
4312000	4315000	Like one of the ones I go through, Junkie Spot.
4315000	4316000	If you're into the ball jointed dolls,
4316000	4318000	they've had a Layaway program forever.
4318000	4322000	So that just illustrates that specialty stores will also do Layaway.
4322000	4324000	Hey, if they can make a sale one way or another,
4324000	4326000	even if they have to hold on to the merchandise a little longer,
4326000	4328000	they're willing to do it, which is pretty cool.
4328000	4331000	You're also dealing with vile resin dolls
4331000	4334000	that cost upwards of 700 bucks sometimes.
4334000	4335000	Wow.
4335000	4336000	Expensive hobby to have.
4336000	4337000	See that big one there?
4337000	4338000	Yeah.
4338000	4341000	She probably cost about 1,000 bucks after she was imported.
4341000	4342000	Boy, oh, boy.
4342000	4344000	But you do have some lovely little dolls over there.
4344000	4345000	She was a gift.
4345000	4348000	And I see you just put your crochet work on one of your dollies over there.
4348000	4351000	You might want to take a picture of that for our website
4351000	4352000	so the listeners can see your hobby.
4352000	4353000	I'm starting a hat.
4353000	4354000	Fun.
4354000	4357000	Right now it's the size of a thumbnail, but it'll get bigger.
4357000	4358000	Yeah. I'll take a picture.
4358000	4359000	All right.
4359000	4361000	Anyhow, well, don't get up with the camera just yet
4361000	4365000	because it's your time to take us through the vault
4365000	4368000	and take us on a trip of yesteryear's games
4368000	4370000	in a segment we call the classic video game of the week
4370000	4372000	where Dark Sakura dives into the video game archives
4372000	4374000	and selects one game that she thinks,
4374000	4377000	damn it, you ought to be playing this game.
4377000	4381000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
4381000	4383000	I pulled out a sticky one.
4383000	4386000	I pulled out Ergize.
4386000	4387000	Ergize.
4387000	4391000	Or as it came out in America, God bless the ring, Ergize.
4391000	4395000	Let's take a listen to some of the music from Ergize real quick.
4395000	4400000	Go!
4400000	4401000	Sorry.
4401000	4402000	That's extremely loud.
4402000	4404000	I apologize.
4404000	4408000	That actually does sound like you're doing this a little bit wild.
4408000	4409000	Okay.
4409000	4412000	So Ergize, the big thing about Ergize when it came out,
4412000	4416000	now keep in mind I actually did play this in the arcade,
4416000	4419000	but the big thing about this one is that for the home version
4419000	4422000	you can play as a bunch of Final Fantasy VII characters.
4422000	4426000	You can play as Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Yuffie, Vincent, and Zack.
4426000	4430000	Well, the arcade still had Cloud and Tifa.
4430000	4433000	Yeah, I played that in the arcade.
4433000	4438000	But the home version had the other unlockables.
4438000	4442000	This is actually now a fairly rare game
4442000	4446000	because it didn't get a greatest hits release
4446000	4448000	and it's not being re-released.
4448000	4453000	So this is one of those ones like Einhander
4453000	4456000	that you're just not going to be able to find.
4456000	4459000	I'm sorry.
4459000	4464000	But anyway, the game actually has the same fighting system
4464000	4467000	as the Tobol series.
4467000	4471000	So it kind of plays a bit more like a grappling type of game.
4471000	4474000	You have your fixed view from one place.
4474000	4478000	You actually get pine characters and stuff. It's pretty neat.
4478000	4483000	But it actually, because it was done by Dream Factory,
4483000	4485000	it was developed by Dream Factory,
4485000	4490000	which is the same group that did the Tobol series.
4490000	4494000	It was put out by Namco in the arcades
4494000	4501000	and then published by Square in the U.S. for the console release.
4501000	4505000	And actually it is on the Playstation Network, I forgot to say.
4505000	4507000	But yeah, it's a big fighting game.
4507000	4509000	Is it really on the Playstation Network?
4509000	4510000	Yeah.
4510000	4511000	In America?
4511000	4513000	It came out last year.
4513000	4515000	Oh crap. I didn't know that. That's cool.
4515000	4517000	Well, I don't know if it's in America.
4517000	4519000	Maybe it's not, but it says it was.
4519000	4521000	Maybe one of the chatters knows.
4521000	4524000	The other cool thing about this though is that
4524000	4527000	you actually have a quest mode in it.
4527000	4531000	And the quest mode is actually really in-depth.
4531000	4535000	Like, you go through and...
4535000	4539000	It's like a hack and slash kind of action RPG sort of thing.
4539000	4542000	Where you can go and, you know,
4542000	4545000	smack things around in a randomly generated dungeon
4545000	4548000	and then go to town and sell stuff and do things.
4548000	4552000	I mean, it's the full-on action RPG mode.
4552000	4554000	And then you can do your character development
4554000	4557000	by one of those little five-point charts that
4557000	4563000	raises attack, magic, dexterity, defense, and speed.
4563000	4565000	Which you can actually raise by consuming
4565000	4568000	protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, or lipids.
4568000	4571000	So I would sell those since...
4571000	4573000	I don't really get it. Anyway.
4573000	4576000	So you can, you know, adjust your skills
4576000	4578000	that way by what you consume.
4578000	4581000	And then you get recipe books and you can
4581000	4585000	trade wine for recipes and buy stuff that way.
4585000	4589000	You get kind of like a stock market sort of...
4591000	4593000	monetary system going on here.
4593000	4595000	I'm kind of surprised this game wasn't
4595000	4597000	bigger than everything when it came out.
4597000	4598000	Because of the fact that, you know,
4598000	4600000	Final Fantasy VII was so freaking huge.
4600000	4603000	You know, this game came out during the period of my life
4603000	4605000	where I wasn't playing a lot of video games
4605000	4607000	because I was busy with college.
4607000	4609000	Which I've talked about frequently on this show.
4609000	4613000	But Final Fantasy VII I had plenty of time for at the time.
4613000	4616000	I made time for that game because it was so freaking epic.
4616000	4619000	And I remember playing this and thinking it was awesome.
4619000	4621000	Although I have to admit I never bought it.
4621000	4623000	I think I rented it or something.
4623000	4626000	But I'm just surprised it wasn't a huge freaking deal.
4626000	4629000	What do you think made this game kind of slip under the radar?
4629000	4631000	Is it because maybe the rest of the characters
4631000	4632000	weren't as recognizable or what?
4632000	4634000	I think that might have been part of it too.
4634000	4636000	Now keep in mind, the place that I used to go play this
4636000	4639000	in the arcade was at rescue lanes.
4639000	4642000	If you remember back in the days when they had a cool arcade.
4642000	4648000	It's the same place you used to go play like Blazing Star and all those.
4648000	4652000	And Dan and I used to just go and play this all the time.
4652000	4653000	It was really cool.
4653000	4656000	So we got it because we already knew the series.
4656000	4658000	And I think that the people that didn't get this game
4658000	4660000	got it for the Final Fantasy VII characters.
4660000	4664000	But I don't really think that it was promoted the way
4664000	4666000	that it needed to be promoted.
4666000	4668000	And on top of that, it really, as a fighting game,
4668000	4671000	is not, I would say, spectacular.
4671000	4673000	Nothing outstanding.
4673000	4675000	It's interesting though, because now we have Dissida
4675000	4678000	out on the PSP, which is basically a Final Fantasy fighting game.
4678000	4682000	And from what I understand, that game is doing much better.
4682000	4685000	Dissidia plays a lot different though.
4685000	4686000	Yeah, and for what it is.
4686000	4688000	A big battle game is what it is.
4688000	4690000	And it's also, you know, keep in mind, it's on PSP,
4690000	4692000	so the expectations are a little different.
4692000	4694000	It hasn't penetrated the marketplace quite the way
4694000	4697000	the PlayStation 1 did, which was epically.
4697000	4700000	Anything else to say about your classic game of the week?
4700000	4702000	Yeah, actually one of the regular characters in there,
4702000	4704000	I actually liked using her more than the Final Fantasy characters.
4704000	4708000	She was the yo-yo girl who attacked with yo-yos.
4708000	4709000	She was a lot of fun.
4709000	4713000	But also the one thing to tell you is that when you play with Sephiroth,
4713000	4715000	the background music is one big angel.
4715000	4716000	That's her.
4716000	4717000	That's your yo-yo girl.
4717000	4719000	Yeah, I was going to say, Yoko is the, Yoko yo-yo.
4719000	4724000	Well, her name is, let me go through the names.
4724000	4726000	Yoko Kishi-bojin.
4726000	4731000	You've also got Ken Mishima, which always makes me think of Tekken.
4731000	4734000	Although he looks like Ryan Fury in Tekken.
4734000	4737000	Han Dehan, who's a Taekwondo guy.
4737000	4742000	Prince Doza, who I always just laugh at his name.
4742000	4747000	Lee Shuen Sasuke, who's the ninja, because I mean his name's Sasuke.
4747000	4752000	Yasha Inoba, and Wolf Girl Joe, who was raised by wolves.
4752000	4756000	Oh, and you also have Koji Masuda, Clara Andrews,
4756000	4761000	who I guess is the token, I guess, gaijin of the game.
4761000	4768000	And Django, who's a sub-boss, I guess.
4768000	4769000	So yeah, it's pretty cool.
4769000	4771000	It has a cool soundtrack to it too, I think.
4771000	4777000	And, um, Air Guys actually did get re-released in Japan in 2000
4777000	4781000	that had a digital clock and a character diorama
4781000	4784000	and it came out with the Square Millennium collection.
4784000	4793000	So, and this is, um, it actually did, now this I barely want to forget.
4793000	4797000	For the US version it had an Air Guys Championship Tour
4797000	4800000	that was held at EB and Babbage's.
4800000	4801000	Oh wow.
4801000	4802000	1999.
4802000	4804000	It started in New York.
4804000	4808000	But yeah, and DigiCube released the soundtrack.
4808000	4809000	Alright.
4809000	4813000	It was also one of the joint ventures that Square did.
4813000	4815000	One of the only ones, I can think of.
4815000	4816000	Yeah.
4816000	4819000	Alright, well there it is, your classic video game of the week, Air Guys.
4819000	4821000	Available on the Playstation 1.
4821000	4824000	And certainly for a lot of Final Fantasy fans,
4824000	4827000	this game holds a place near and dear to people's hearts.
4827000	4828000	Weren't you a big fan of this one, Loki?
4828000	4830000	I seem to remember you talking about this one.
4830000	4831000	Yeah, it was awesome.
4831000	4835000	In fact, I have it on my cabinet, so I just have to see if it actually plays in MAME.
4835000	4836000	Very nice.
4836000	4837000	Very nice.
4837000	4839000	Alright, well, now that we've covered our classic game of the week,
4839000	4842000	it's time for us to bring Part A to a close.
4842000	4845000	But don't worry, we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4845000	4848000	Part B is coming right up, and in tonight's Part B we'll take your Twitter topics.
4848000	4850000	So if you have anything you want to fire at us,
4850000	4853000	quick, get to the Twitter and send us a message at OLR.
4853000	4856000	And then of course our rapid fire news tonight.
4856000	4858000	And we're going to talk about the video game awards.
4858000	4859000	The nominees were released.
4859000	4861000	And some Phoenix Wright coming to WiiWare.
4861000	4862000	Sounds pretty exciting.
4862000	4866000	So we will be right back in just a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4872000	4874000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio
4874000	4879000	as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 22nd of 2009.
4879000	4881000	A happy early Thanksgiving, of course,
4881000	4884000	to those in America that have the Thanksgiving holiday coming up.
4884000	4887000	And good luck on Black Friday, you guys,
4887000	4890000	if anybody's actually going to brave it out there at these stores.
4890000	4892000	Be safe, for heaven's sakes.
4892000	4894000	Don't step on anybody and kill them.
4894000	4897000	Although it sounds like a lot of stores are taking a lot of precautions with all that this year.
4897000	4900000	Also, people in retail, I'm sorry.
4900000	4901000	I'm sorry.
4902000	4905000	Exactly right. I'm very, very sorry to hear about that.
4906000	4908000	I'm checking out the Facebook, by the way.
4908000	4911000	We already have 64 fans on our Facebook page.
4911000	4915000	And we only need 100, again, to get from a cell stage to a creature stage.
4915000	4918000	So it looks like we might hit it, hopefully, by the end of tonight's show.
4918000	4922000	And we have one of our listeners commenting here on Twitter.
4922000	4925000	Alex Carson, I'm sorry, not Twitter, Facebook.
4925000	4926000	Alex Carson says,
4926000	4930000	I'll help you reach at least 100 fans if you mention me on the next show.
4930000	4931000	You're welcome.
4931000	4932000	So there you go. I did it.
4932000	4938000	So now, hopefully, I don't know what magical, mystical powers he has over Facebook,
4938000	4940000	but we'll take a chance there by giving a shout out.
4940000	4943000	Rob, you have now made us whores.
4943000	4948000	Although he does post a follow-up, I just sent out over 650 fan suggestions.
4948000	4949000	Awesome.
4949000	4952000	But careful, guys. Just make sure you're not spamming,
4952000	4954000	as long as folks you think would be truly interested in it.
4954000	4957000	But just I don't even really know what the fan suggestions thing is.
4957000	4961000	So just, you know, just want to check, just making sure.
4961000	4965000	All right. Anyhow, we're going to get back into tonight's show with some Twitter topics.
4965000	4968000	Heading on over to the Twitter, looking at our messages at OLR.
4968000	4973000	Just a couple of them tonight, because stupid me forgot to ask for them until just before tonight's show.
4973000	4980000	But, let's see, lots of comments, random things.
4980000	4983000	ActDeaf made some sandwiches to eat while listening to OLR.
4983000	4986000	Ironically enough, Loki had some sandwiches before the show tonight, didn't he?
4986000	4987000	So, delicious.
4987000	4988000	Subway, yes.
4988000	4989000	Yes, delicious.
4989000	4994000	Gamergirl wants to know, what's better, Super Mario DS or Super Mario Wii?
4994000	4997000	This is hard for me to answer, because I haven't really played the Wii one yet.
4997000	4999000	And I don't know if any of us really have.
4999000	5001000	I did play it a little bit at E3.
5001000	5004000	You know, I think they're just different.
5004000	5011000	And I hear that Super Mario Brothers Wii is like a great multiplayer game, but it's kind of, it's okay.
5011000	5012000	It's a single player game.
5012000	5015000	Whereas I think Super Mario DS is a great single player game.
5015000	5017000	And I have played that one, and it's a lot of fun.
5017000	5022000	So, maybe that's the distinction you want to make, is that if you're into a single player game, get DS.
5022000	5024000	But if you want to get a multiplayer game, get Wii.
5024000	5031000	Although at the same time, keep in mind the other big difference is that the DS one can go with you anywhere.
5031000	5033000	And it's probably a little bit cheaper, too.
5033000	5034000	So, I don't know.
5034000	5037000	For those reasons, the DS one might have a slight advantage if you haven't either one of them yet.
5037000	5048000	But if you have some brothers and sisters or, you know, other family members, people that live with you, whatever, significant others that would play this game with you, then maybe Super Mario Wii would be awesome for you.
5048000	5060000	And the last question tonight from Scoop20906 on Twitter says, Microsoft's new Zune Marketplace on Xbox 360 looks pretty cool and makes me consider getting a Zune HD.
5060000	5063000	Loki, have you checked this out on the Xbox 360 at all?
5063000	5065000	I know it was in the latest update.
5065000	5067000	Mine is still borked, so I haven't got a chance to look at it.
5067000	5068000	No?
5068000	5075000	I have not played with anything except for that one time that I tweeted on my 360, and that was the end of the update.
5075000	5086000	Which, by the way, I don't think I have seen a single tweet from the Xbox 360 from anyone outside of hi from my Xbox 360 or lol tweeting on 360.
5086000	5091000	I don't think I've seen anybody post an update from their 360 that wasn't about the fact that they're posting from the 360.
5091000	5093000	Because it's a pain in the ass.
5093000	5100000	Actually, there is something cool, speaking of tweeting on something other than, you know, your computer or your phone.
5100000	5105000	They created a way to use brain impulse to tweet.
5105000	5106000	What?
5106000	5111000	It's on times 50 inventions of the year.
5111000	5119000	Now, it takes like a full, I want to say, 15 minutes to do an 8 character tweet.
5119000	5131000	But they're working on technology so that like, you know, quadriplegics or amputees can use the internet.
5131000	5136000	Wow. That's crazy stuff.
5136000	5140000	But it's not the type of thing where it's like reading your brain and...
5140000	5146000	It works on the type of impulses you get when imagining something.
5146000	5152000	Well, wouldn't you be nervous about like a tweet going out like, I just pictured this chick naked.
5152000	5154000	You picture it by letter, by character.
5154000	5156000	That's still creepy.
5156000	5159000	Yeah, it's on times webpage.
5159000	5162000	That's kind of creepy. Like, I don't want my thoughts tweeted.
5162000	5167000	Even letters that I think about because what if I'm having a dream about Sesame Street?
5167000	5170000	Never mind.
5170000	5171000	Alright.
5171000	5174000	I'm sorry, it's just a little creepy for me.
5174000	5177000	Like, you know, if we're reading people's thoughts about letters.
5177000	5185000	I mean, although I appreciate that they're trying to think of ways to get handicapped folks that have severe handicaps to be able to do that stuff.
5185000	5187000	That's just a little creepy to me, doing it through the brain.
5187000	5192000	Because it's just a matter of time before the government installs a chip in the back of your brain and they know everything you're thinking.
5192000	5193000	Ah!
5193000	5196000	A matter of time before Johnny Mnemonic becomes real?
5196000	5197000	Yes.
5197000	5199000	Whoa.
5199000	5202000	Dude.
5202000	5204000	Ah, reading some comments from chat.
5204000	5209000	AlphaKananagram says, as long as it doesn't bring thought police any time in my lifetime, I'm okay with it.
5209000	5211000	Wasn't that like the plot of Minority Report or something?
5211000	5213000	I don't remember.
5213000	5214000	Or 1984, thank you.
5214000	5217000	AJ Mixx in chatroom says, wait, I'll guess. I can read your brain.
5217000	5220000	Oh my, is that true? Did you fall in love with some pretty girl?
5220000	5226000	Dark Tetsuya says, OLR is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
5226000	5228000	I see what you did there.
5228000	5237000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some fast news tonight. We call it rapid-fire news because they're just little things we want to talk about before we get back into some discussion. Loki's going to kick it off tonight.
5237000	5245000	Monopoly is coming to the iPhone. It's actually the regular version of Monopoly. I didn't know there was another version of Monopoly, but apparently it is.
5245000	5258000	The version Monopoly Here and Now, The World, which was the one that came out originally. This is not. The original Monopoly, $5 in the App Store.
5258000	5263000	So if you want to play Monopoly on the go, there you go.
5263000	5274000	3D Dot Game Heroes is coming to the US, which is awesome. Atlas is bringing it over, and it will be coming out over here on May 11th.
5274000	5281000	So no need to import it, although I know some people will. Although I don't know if I'm one of those people that will do that.
5281000	5286000	Keep in mind the PS3 kind of encourages it by being region-free, that's all I'm saying.
5286000	5301000	True. And then coming to Rock Band this week, actually, there's going to be some new songs, including a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers live anthology pack, including songs A Thing About You.
5301000	5310000	These are all live versions, of course. American Girl, Even the Losers, Here Comes My Girl, Mary Jane's Last Dance, and Refugee.
5310000	5316000	Aww, who doesn't know The Last Dance of Mary Jane? That song was awesome. Isn't that the one where he's dancing around with the dead body in the video?
5316000	5317000	It's Kim Basinger.
5317000	5322000	That's what Rock Band needs, music videos. Don't get me wrong, I like the epicness of the...
5322000	5329000	Remember how Amplitude and stuff would play music videos in the background while you were playing some of the songs? Rock Band needs that a little bit, I think.
5329000	5343000	That'd be kind of neat. And those are available, of course, for $2 each, or the equivalent on your system. Of course, you can get them in a pack, save yourself two bucks, and it's for 800 Microsoft points or $10.
5343000	5348000	And then an individual song's coming out this week as well. The Go-Go's with Our Lips Are Sealed.
5348000	5349000	Epic.
5349000	5350000	Islands of Seals.
5350000	5353000	Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent.
5353000	5363000	Why are they releasing that song and not Since You've Been Gone? Talk about an epic karaoke song. I haven't been to karaoke in a little while, but I'll tell you, I used to go to gay karaoke all the time.
5363000	5369000	A little gay bar did karaoke all the time. And I'll tell you what, some diva, male or female, would always be up on that stage singing,
5369000	5384000	Since you've been gone, I can't breathe. And that diva was you, of course, right? Usually. But I can't believe, when I wasn't too busy doing ABBA, when I can't believe that that epic karaoke song is not making its way into Rock Band yet.
5384000	5386000	Maybe it's coming to Lego Rock Band. I don't know.
5386000	5398000	Maybe. And then also, Pink, Who Knew? All those are available for 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $2.
5398000	5410000	All right. Well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news tonight. Talking about Dragon Age Origins, which has been getting quite a lot of press lately, there is some download content called Return to Ostagar.
5410000	5418000	It's coming to the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It's only going to cost you five bucks, and they're saying it's coming out during the holiday season.
5418000	5429000	This will allow your character to revisit Ostagar, the site of the Grey Warden's darkest hour, to reclaim the honor and learn the secrets of Ferelden's fallen king. So, nice to see that there's expansion.
5429000	5440000	From what I hear, the game itself is, like, epically long. So, if you're already bored with Dragon Age, maybe you gotta go outside. I don't know. I'm just saying.
5440000	5451000	All right. Hey, Cooking Mama is coming to arcades. That's right. Cooking Mama is making its way to arcades, and it's using a touch screen that kind of reminds me a little bit.
5451000	5468000	I don't know. When I'm kind of looking at it, it looks like, um, um, oh, God, the name escapes me. The big PSP game on, um, that made its way to, uh, ah, the PSP beat-matching game that's like 2DX that made its way to arcades.
5468000	5478000	DJ Max. Thank you, DJ Max. Right? That's, yes, Technica. That's the one that's in the arcades. God, why did the name escape me? It looks like that when you're kind of looking at it.
5478000	5486000	But you use your finger to do all the things that you would usually do with a knife or whatever. But, uh, some of the early screenshots of the game show raw fish.
5486000	5495000	So, it's like you're having to, like, chop off, chop up raw fish with your finger. Looks a little scary, but, uh, if you fuck up, don't worry. Mama will fix it.
5495000	5504000	Hey, uh, this week, by the way, was a big holiday for fans of Bomani, Konami's series of music video games, which, of course, this show started all about.
5504000	5517000	One of the big ones, Dance Dance Revolution. Well, it's still alive and kicking, and, uh, 20 November was the perfect opportunity for Konami to announce Dance Dance Revolution X2 and the location tests that are happening in Japan.
5517000	5528000	It looks like the first one scheduled for November 25th through December 3rd is when the first location test is happening there in Japan. For more information, you can head over to Konami's Japanese website, konami.jp.
5528000	5536000	Although, if the last few iterations of DDR, uh, are any indication, these games will make their way over to North America eventually, but they will be subpar.
5536000	5539000	Oh, I went there! How about some-
5539000	5540000	You did.
5540000	5546000	I sure did. How about, uh, more, uh, rapid-fire news? Dark Sakura.
5546000	5558000	Sorry, my needle was stuck. Well, Brazil, guess what? You got a PS2 now. The PS2 has finally launched in Brazil.
5558000	5559000	PS2.
5559000	5561000	The PS2.
5561000	5562000	Okay.
5562000	5579000	Yeah. So, um, they- and it's actually out for, um, $7.99, um, I'm not quite sure what BRL stands for. I know it's their monetary system, but the equivalent is $461.
5579000	5596000	So, yeah. Um, Super Monkey Ball 2 is coming to the iPhone. It will have 115 new levels, local multiplayer, um, enhanced controls, improved graphics, monkey bowling, monkey golf, and monkey target.
5596000	5612000	And, um, actually the former three are going to be free updates in 2010, but it will be, um, actually, um, out for, uh, 2 pounds 39 pence, so, over in the UK, so.
5612000	5627000	Um, and Star Trek Online, the open beta, is, uh, going to be starting on, um, uh, it looks like from the 12th to the 26th of January next year.
5627000	5643000	Uh, keys will be first come, first served. Um, you can get them on Star Trek Online dot com. Um, and you can actually still apply for a closed beta spot, but the, uh, closed beta is, of course, I don't think going to be lasting much longer.
5643000	5655000	Um, you can, um, the actual game, though, comes out on February 2nd. And I- sorry, February 2nd in North America, the 5th in, um, Europe.
5655000	5658000	Pardon me, can I fanboy for a minute?
5658000	5661000	I'm looking for-
5661000	5666000	I am so excited for Star Trek Online, you don't even know. Like, that's how big of a colossal nerd I am.
5666000	5673000	Oh, I'm gonna be, um, on this, um, like, waking up early in the morning to get my, uh, my, uh-
5673000	5685000	I'm so excited. Like, I just- the more I watch Star Trek, the more I love it. Like, seriously, I watched the new movie again over this weekend, and it was a bunch of us, uh, gay nerds getting together to watch the Star Trek movie.
5685000	5697000	And we were basically Mystery Science Theater-ing it, you know, making fun of it and stuff. I just had so much fun. And I- I loved Star Trek, and especially the new one, and hearing that this, um, is gonna kind of tie into the new one a little bit is very exciting.
5697000	5703000	So I'm very excited for Star Trek Online. I think it's the one thing that will finally tear me away from WoW. For good? I don't know.
5703000	5717000	Um, also, can I revisit the Brazil story real quick? Because I think one thing to keep in mind, although we're sitting here going lol at this whole thing, is that keep in mind, you know, in some of the countries we're in, you know, the US, Japan, even the UK, even though you guys bitch about release dates over there.
5717000	5726000	God, look at this Brazil. And, you know, we've had listeners call in from some foreign countries that aren't often well represented in video gaming.
5726000	5735000	Um, you know, kind of talk about this, that this is, you know, a problem, and why piracy runs so rampant in their countries is that, unfortunately, there's not a lot of official support in their countries for this.
5735000	5744000	Um, but, you know, a lot of the reason for that is, again, gaming is expensive, and often there aren't enough people to maybe support the launch of these systems.
5744000	5756000	So it's, even though we kind of sit here and lol at the PS2 just now being launched in Brazil, I guess maybe it's just because economically and, you know, the demand-wise, it makes sense.
5756000	5764000	Although, it is weird to hear, and I was seeing some comparisons, that to buy an official PlayStation 2 costs more money than it is to just, like, import one from the US.
5764000	5772000	So, WTF is the point. I don't know. But, regardless, one way or the other, it's out. So.
5772000	5774000	I guess they can play games in Portuguese?
5774000	5783000	Perhaps. Uh, Brad from PodCulture is pointing out, I'll probably be picking it up, too, in reference to Star Trek Online, my first PC MMO, actually.
5783000	5792000	Um, we're gonna have to figure out how to get, like, a clan or a guild or whatever, an alliance, a federation, I don't know what the hell they're gonna call it on there, because everybody's gonna be a captain of their own ship.
5792000	5798000	We're gonna need to figure out how to get, like, some type of official OLR, OL Army, in outer space.
5798000	5801000	I am officially making the OLRE in race, though.
5801000	5804000	That's awesome, but I think I just wanna play a Vulcan.
5804000	5808000	I wanna be a sassy Vulcan.
5808000	5811000	Yo, logic is shit.
5811000	5812000	Anyhow.
5812000	5814000	This is wrong.
5814000	5815000	So wrong.
5815000	5817000	What the hell you thinkin', bitch?
5817000	5819000	Anyhow.
5819000	5831000	And Act F says, uh, the USS Ferret. Dark Tetsuya says, the OLR prize. I'm so excited about Star Trek Online, you don't even know. Like, this is gonna turn into the Star Trek podcast for, like...
5831000	5834000	Loki is gonna have to be the one that keeps us grounded when this game comes out.
5834000	5837000	I signed up for the beta, but I'm probably not gonna play it. Just like I do with all the...
5837000	5839000	Give me your key!
5839000	5841000	I signed you up, too, okay?
5841000	5842000	Thank you.
5842000	5843000	I signed you up first.
5843000	5850000	Brad from Pod Culture says, sassy Vulcan. Isn't that just a Romulan with PMS? You know, I should just be a Klingon.
5850000	5854000	Honestly, if I'm gonna be sassy, then I need to just be a Klingon, but forget it.
5854000	5858000	She has to go around calling everyone a PTAH.
5858000	5861000	I totally wanna swear at people in Klingon. That's amazing.
5861000	5865000	I just know that's a... I used to know how to say your mother has a smooth forehead.
5865000	5870000	For your sake, I hope you are initiating a mating ritual.
5870000	5878000	Anyhow, sorry. I watched all the Star Trek movies when I was sick with swine flu, okay? Leave me alone.
5878000	5881000	I'm gonna try to find it. Everyday Klingon phrases. There we go.
5881000	5883000	Loki news, quick! Save us!
5883000	5890000	The Spike video game awards are gonna be coming soon, and of course the nominations are out.
5890000	5898000	With Uncharted 2 getting 8 nominations, Batman Arkham Asylum getting 7, Modern Warfare 2, and Left 4 Dead both getting 6.
5898000	5904000	Let's go through some of the nominations, shall we, and see what we've got here to start with, of course.
5904000	5906000	Game of the Year!
5906000	5909000	And the nominations are...
5909000	5918000	Assassin's Greed 2, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and Uncharted 2.
5918000	5923000	Interesting enough, all but one coming out within the last month or so.
5923000	5926000	No President Cat. I am most disappointed.
5926000	5932000	Exactly. No write-in nominations either. That's kinda sad.
5932000	5938000	Studio of the Year. They have Infinity Ward. That's funny.
5938000	5945000	Naughty Dog, Rocksteady, which did Batman Arkham Asylum, and Valve. Of course, Valve is probably gonna win that.
5949000	5953000	What awesome celebrities are we gonna see at the VGAs?
5953000	5955000	I have no idea, nor do I care.
5955000	5961000	I've never watched the VGAs. Can I just kinda throw that out there? Never, ever. Report on it on this show, but never bothered to watch it.
5961000	5971000	Best independent game. They have Splosion Man, Flower, Osmose, and Trials HD. Those are all actually pretty good.
5971000	5976000	Yeah, those are all actually pretty good. Those are some good picks. Out of curiosity, what do you think is gonna land Game of the Year?
5976000	5977000	Modern Warfare 2.
5977000	5978000	You think?
5978000	5979000	Yeah.
5979000	5981000	You don't think they'll go a little more avant-garde?
5981000	5982000	No. Modern Warfare 2.
5982000	5983000	Uncharted 2?
5983000	5985000	Is Uncharted 2 getting the highest scores?
5985000	5987000	It's by user vote. Modern Warfare 2.
5987000	5989000	Oh, Modern Warfare 2. Yeah, okay.
5989000	5999000	Best downloadable game. Battlefield 1943, Fat Princess, Plants vs. Zombies, and Shadow Complex. I'm thinking Plants vs. Zombies is gonna win that.
5999000	6008000	Yeah, it's kinda crack. Ricky Gomack in our chat says, Jenny McCarthy, as far as celebrities go. I said celebrities.
6008000	6012000	Since when has Jenny McCarthy been relevant? Oh wait, she has a game to promote, huh?
6012000	6017000	I guess she's been a guest on Oprah, so that makes her relevant. I don't know.
6017000	6027000	Best soundtrack. Brutal Legend, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, and the Beatles Rock Band. I hope DJ Hero wins, but I have a feeling the Beatles Rock Band is gonna win.
6027000	6035000	That's, you know what, I gotta say this though. As much mad respect as I have for the Beatles Rock Band, that's kinda cheating. Come on. That music's like 40 years old.
6035000	6040000	And granted, it's timeless music, but come on.
6040000	6049000	It's not really a soundtrack so much as it's just your entire music album, their whole catalog.
6049000	6058000	I would say though, DJ Hero by far has the best soundtrack. I mean, if you throw out the Beatles, cause that's cheating.
6058000	6064000	And of course, best music game, you have DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, Lego Rock Band, and the Beatles Rock Band.
6064000	6070000	No surprises there. Have there been other music games out this year that have been as notable? No.
6070000	6076000	Yeah. No Poppy Music? No Poppy Music. No Karaoke Revolution. Sorry.
6076000	6085000	Let's decide Curiosity. Best RPG. Borderlands, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age Origins, and Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.
6085000	6091000	Congratulations, Dragon Age Origins, for winning that category, cause it will. Although, need to see Demon's Souls.
6091000	6099000	I don't know. Borderlands is pretty fucking awesome. But it's kind of like, huh? In the RPG category, it's a little weird.
6099000	6104000	It's more of a shooter, I think. One more category, then I wanna move on with other stories.
6104000	6112000	We'll do best performance. Oh, let's see here. Best game based on movie slash TV show. Best graphics.
6112000	6122000	Let's do one of the weirder ones here. How about, oh god, most anticipated game? Really? That's an award?
6122000	6130000	Interesting. And I'm anticipating it loading. And the nominees are, for games that no one's played yet, but are wanting to play,
6130000	6136000	Bioshock 2, God of War 3, Mass Effect 2, and Starcraft 2.
6136000	6142000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I have an idea. I have an idea. You know what I'm gonna say, right? Oh, wait, wait. Guess what? Yes?
6142000	6146000	Write in your own choice. You know what I'm gonna ask, right? You know what I want, right?
6146000	6153000	Star Trek? Nope. Suki Bonshoa Renawee. You need to go onto, this is what I want the OLR me to do.
6153000	6159000	Suki Bonshoa Renawee. This is what I want the OLR fans to do. I'm gonna tell the people there.
6159000	6162000	Although, oh, doesn't it say something about it has to be an already announced game?
6162000	6168000	An already announced as it's coming out. Well, hold on. That's just that category. What about best Wii game?
6168000	6169000	Front them anyway.
6169000	6176000	Maybe, um, you can't write in that. But you can write in the most anticipated game, so if we do that, I guess.
6176000	6181000	Why not? Why not? We'll do it anyway. So I want folks to go and write in-
6181000	6182000	President Cat?
6182000	6189000	To write it in and then put in parentheses President Cat. And if enough of us do it, here's the idea behind it, guys. Here's the idea.
6189000	6197000	If enough of us do it, they'll show it in a clip compilation. So our goal here, guys, here's the goal.
6197000	6204000	To get President Cat to show up for half a second on the VGAs. That is the ultimate goal. Okay?
6204000	6208000	So in order to do that, we need like 500 of you to submit that as your vote.
6208000	6223000	Yeah, so you can go to Spike.com slash event slash VGA 2009, and I'll be on there. I will post the link in chat where you can actually submit your vote for the write-ins.
6223000	6233000	Chatters? Damn it, no. You don't write in boys love scramble. You write in President Cat. Damn it. Have I taught you nothing?
6233000	6242000	Yeah, make sure you put in- I'll put it in the chatroom. Sukeban, Shacho, Renna, Wee, parentheses President Cat.
6242000	6246000	And I'll post this to the Facebook and the Twitter, too, before the night is over.
6246000	6248000	So it'll never happen.
6248000	6254000	It will never- no, this is all we want. Maybe they'll go- who hosts this? Samuel L. Jackson or whatever?
6254000	6257000	The fuck is President Cat?
6257000	6272000	No, is that he'll have to get up there and show you, you know, well, Bioshock 2 is the most anticipated game of the year, but let's take a look at some of the stuff that you want to see in the write-ins, and they'll show like a little compilation of all these other things.
6272000	6277000	And then all we want, President Cat, half a second of airtime. It's all we want. All we want.
6277000	6279000	But if it won the award, that'd be even better.
6279000	6280000	Mine's it. It's in there.
6280000	6282000	Alright, I'm gonna submit, too.
6282000	6283000	Just done.
6283000	6288000	And can I say, OLR listeners, I love you. I really do.
6288000	6292000	Now to do it through Internet Explorer.
6292000	6298000	Alright, moving on, while you guys are furiously submitting your votes for the VGAs, and I'll put that on Twitter and all that fun stuff later.
6298000	6309000	Phoenix Wright, now this is also an awesome series, is coming to WiiWare. It's a courtroom battle game coming to the WiiWare, and this was revealed in Famitsu Magazine.
6309000	6316000	Apparently it's gonna be like an episodic thing, because they're gonna start in January in the US, and they're gonna come out every other month for ten bucks apiece.
6316000	6326000	Rise of the Ashes, which was the extra case that was added to DS Ace Attorney, will be coming out in May, I guess, for just a buck. Go figure.
6326000	6332000	So these games are gonna come out, and I guess you actually get to swing the Wii Remote to present evidence or something.
6332000	6337000	I don't know if this is a mock-up somebody did, or the real deal, but I can totally see this being the real deal.
6337000	6338000	That's the real deal.
6338000	6345000	Oh wow, that's awesome. So you'll actually get to throw out the Wii Remote, well not literally throw it, but like you're objecting.
6345000	6349000	So this is gonna be pretty epic, especially for those that maybe didn't get into the DS ones.
6349000	6355000	By the way, the very first game is just a port of the original Game Boy Advance title, but enhanced for the Wii, of course.
6355000	6364000	Lots and lots of screenshots already being leaked, so I guess this is the real deal. Awesome. Ten dollars? That's not bad at all.
6364000	6371000	Now sadly the games are not being ported to widescreen or anything like that. They'll be bordered like a lot of those classic video games are.
6371000	6379000	But hey, ten bucks for a video game that is almost like cult status, if you wanna say. Not bad at all, right?
6379000	6381000	No, not at all. There you go.
6381000	6383000	Dark Sakura, moving on.
6383000	6391000	Well, for people who are fans of LittleBigPlanet, there's something pretty cool for those people.
6391000	6397000	As soon as I close down my 50,000 submissions of President Cat.
6397000	6408000	Yeah, there are going to be Sonic the Hedgehog themed outfits for LittleBigPlanet.
6408000	6423000	You have, looks like Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, I guess that's supposed to be Shadow, and Eggman. Or Robotnik, sorry.
6423000	6429000	Do they need to have a Mecha Sonic one? That would be cool.
6429000	6431000	That's pretty neat. They look cute.
6431000	6432000	Kind of interesting.
6432000	6434000	They look like, the Knuckles looks like a monkey.
6434000	6443000	I think this is the first time besides, and I could be wrong, besides the God of War characters, that you're seeing other characters coming into LittleBigPlanet.
6443000	6451000	You know, and especially the fact that it's coming from a third party this time. It's not one of Sony's properties directly. It's actually Sega's giving their blessing. That's kind of a big deal.
6451000	6455000	The Knuckles looks like, they all look like monkeys except for Eggman.
6455000	6458000	Well, you know, they still have to retain that LittleBigPlanet Sackboy look.
6458000	6459000	They look like big monkeys.
6459000	6464000	It's just going to be hilarious for all those people that make knockoff levels from Sonic.
6464000	6476000	I want, okay, listeners, I challenge you. Make a really kick-ass casino night. And then show us.
6476000	6490000	They do have some levels that are in LittleBigPlanet that are basically mockups of Sonic the Hedgehog already. Too bad they don't have super speed with those costumes. That would be kind of cool.
6490000	6498000	It would be cool if, yeah, kind of like how they implemented in the Metal Gear. You have the gun, like maybe implement super speed. We'll see.
6498000	6512000	Well, something not quite that cool and actually quite disturbing. Apparently, there's a guy who's really into his dating sims, including the dating sim Love Plus.
6512000	6523000	So much so that he decided to get married to it. Yes, that's right. You heard me right. A guy got married to his DS game.
6523000	6537000	And you can only do this in one place, apparently. Guam. The guy was pronounced man and wife with his copy of Dating Sim Love Plus.
6537000	6553000	And apparently, he married one of the characters in the game, Nene Onigasaki, one of the three virtual girlfriends in the game.
6553000	6560000	And apparently, he's having a reception and everything. He's invited the media. It's just ridiculous.
6560000	6574000	Come on. Are you that much of a loser that you married a video game? And Guam, what is your problem? You're actually performing a ceremony for somebody that wants to marry a video game?
6574000	6596000	I just don't get it. Like, really? He married his video game? How does that even work? Is this just a stunt for publicity or something someone made up to see if it would get coverage on blogs?
6596000	6608000	I don't even understand how legally that works. I don't know, but apparently... So you're telling me gays can't get married yet, which are two living, breathing people that pay taxes, yet you can marry your video game?
6608000	6622000	This is in Guam. Well, still... Is there gay marriage in Guam? I don't know. But it's just, the whole thing's just, like, what? I think the guy did it for attention.
6622000	6636000	Attention, whore. Yeah, apparently, I don't know, they're... I'm not sure if this is the same guy, although I find it a little odd if there's someone else in Guam that's also, you know, walking around with his DS.
6636000	6656000	But apparently some guy, I'm thinking the same guy, also went and visited the Love Bell, which apparently brings good luck to couples, and you're supposed to pull the rope together with the couple, or both of you are supposed to pull the rope together, and of course he had his DS in his hand and pulled the rope with the DS in his hand.
6656000	6666000	Loser! Tigerclaw in chat. Here's the thing. What if they come up with a sequel to that video game? Will he divorce the previous one and marry the new one?
6666000	6676000	Will he have to... What if you leave your estate to a video game? How does that even work? Does that mean that the video game developers would get the money?
6676000	6692000	Yeah, I'm kind of inclined to agree with Bond. Leave the story alone, let's walk away from this now, step away from the show, get away from the news article, but seriously? Seriously? You married your game?
6692000	6700000	And also, I mean, come on, the chick in it, she's underage looking, man. I mean, that's gotta be illegal.
6700000	6726000	Alright, well, things are just gonna go from bad to worse here in a minute here. You might remember there was this attention whore out there, Eric Estavillo, who was banned from the PlayStation Network, and he ended up, because he made some hateful comments in the Resistance community, he actually sued Sony twice, and it got shot down by Judge Ronald White, because Sony is not part of the government, you know, the free speech First Amendment doesn't apply.
6726000	6746000	So what does he do? He decides that in order to find fairness and right in this world, he sues Microsoft and Nintendo. That's right, he's suing $75,000 to Microsoft for the undue stress and sadness caused by the Red Rings of Death.
6746000	6768000	Quote, Microsoft should have to bear the burden that is now put on the shoulders of this disabled plaintiff. Nintendo is being sued for interfering with the, quote, pursuit of happiness by deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel and Ocarina applications via a system update.
6768000	6793000	You know what I have to say? You, out of the gene pool, right now. Like, really? I mean, talk about attention whore. These are the very definition of frivolous lawsuit. First off, neither of these systems owe you anything. I mean, the Red Ring of Death thing we've seen before, I mean, get a new cause.
6793000	6814000	The one that really jumps out at me is that Nintendo deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel, so protecting their rights to people modifying the console means you should get to sue them. Does not compute, syntax error ready. I mean, really?
6814000	6843000	I hope, I seriously hope that they make you pay for all legal fees, seriously. The legend of Zaku says he needs to have his lawyer employ the Chewbacca defense. Dark Tetsuya says, where are the FUs of the week when we need them? Funny you should mention.
6843000	6850000	In the course we dedicate our FUs of the week tonight to said person in previous story. Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
6850000	6867000	FU to people that don't know how to turn on their headlights in the dark. Yes, I see people driving around in their cars, it's pitch black outside, no headlights on. Or, even better, they have their parking lights on. I'm sorry, parking lights are not headlights.
6867000	6868000	They need to be eaten by a grue.
6868000	6872000	Learn to drive safely.
6872000	6884000	Um, my FU of the week just goes to the fact that the weekend has been very, very short and that, you know, I have to go back to work before I'm ready. I'm just not ready, the weekend's already over. Poor baby. Poor me.
6884000	6903000	Well, FU number one, me going back to work full time now that I'm officially off of my leave now that my hand works. And, um, also to getting this stuff all over my hands. Uh, acrylic medium for textiles. Gross.
6903000	6923000	Uh, by the way, the chatters think that, um, this is how the judge should react in that case when the guy walks into the courtroom and, uh, suing Nintendo and Microsoft, that this should be the judge's response. Check it out. Let's see if, um, you guys would agree with, uh, the judge's stance if this were it.
6923000	6938000	It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal. You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You bumped into the ceiling, which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.
6938000	6941000	God, I hope that's exactly how it goes.
6941000	6956000	Let's get to the mailbag, something a little more pleasant. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we pick some of our favorites and read them here on the air, or, uh, we pick some of our not-so-favorites and read them on the air anyway to make fun of them.
6956000	6960000	Snark Socko, why don't you dive in the mailbag head first, pull out some emails, and, uh, read them.
6960000	6969000	Well, one's from Spazinator, and actually I'd like to go ahead and say that the, because I've been following up on Twitter, um, the situation was resolved. We followed our advice.
6969000	6982000	I remember this whole thing from last week, and hopefully the listeners do, too. I know the podcast hasn't hit the feed yet, but in a nutshell, um, Spazinator lost the rights to his video content. I think it had something to do with when he backed them up to his drive or something.
6982000	6985000	Uh, he had to ref- I don't remember the details, sorry guys.
6985000	6991000	He had to reformat because of an install error that caused his game to- it, like, glitched or something.
6991000	7002000	And Sony basically told him, you get nothing, you lose, good day, sir, and we said you need to call back and speak to a supervisor, escalate it, figure out what part of the policy this falls under, and so the situation was resolved.
7002000	7010000	Well, he says, hi, I'm writing this literally as 11-16-09's show is ending. I tried to call in, but couldn't get there. We actually did talk to him, didn't we?
7010000	7012000	Not on the phone, only email last week.
7012000	7023000	Um, I just thought I'd give you some additional info regarding my last email and answer some of the questions and whatnot. Firstly, I think either XLink or AKRipper asked why I didn't back up the stuff.
7023000	7032000	I- I did, on two Western Digital Passport external HDDs. I don't own a PC yet, by the way. I do the same for my game saves and music.
7032000	7041000	VideoStore works a bit differently from the GameStore. While the GameStore maintains a list of everything you download, the VideoStore doesn't, aside from trailers and other free content.
7041000	7057000	Once you download a paid video, it disappears from the list, so you can't re-download it. Also, Sony used the excuse on Friday of their EULA for why they won't let me re-download the videos, but he did get it resolved, did escalate it, and did get all of the stuff, his content returned.
7057000	7058000	And that happened after this email, right?
7058000	7059000	Yeah.
7059000	7067000	Okay. And I'm sure, you know, he likes to call us a lot, so I'm sure he'll be on the phone later on to tell us more about it, so let's just go ahead and go to the next call. Hopefully he gets through.
7067000	7075000	Okay. The next one up is from someone who didn't name themselves, so I'm just gonna say Brandon, because that's the first name.
7075000	7098000	Anyway. Dear OLR and gamer crew, I have some monster reviews for DS and PSP slash PSN games plus news, Hannah Montana the movie DS. Okay. Um, I know, I know, I know what the living hell is. Seventeen year old boy playing a game for little tween girls that's only the audience. The sound is MP3 quality, it gets a 3. Okay.
7098000	7111000	Dude. Grammar. Next, DJ Hero. Okay, Is does not have a Z. It's IS, not IZ. Gosh.
7111000	7125000	Alright. This is the ultimate DJ Sim. The genre's range- okay, he uses genre, but doesn't know how- anyway. Ranged from rap to Motown, easy learning curve, and great. Great does not have an E at the end. For music and gaming fans alike, I give it a 10.
7125000	7139000	Peace out, oh, DS Lover. No wonder. This is sponsored by BeatMania, the Losers- Losers is not spelled L-U-Z-E-R-S. I'm not reading anything else from you.
7139000	7148000	Let's go to the grammar judges on that email.
7148000	7155000	Sorry. Okay, this last one comes from, um, someone.
7155000	7165000	Hi. This is my first email, so let me start off saying I love the show, it's pretty much the closest I get to a video game discussion. Most of my friends play Wii Sports and minigame collections.
7165000	7180000	Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys a question. What was your first midnight release game you stood in line for? And what was the longest you waited for? My first was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which was interesting because I was only 14, and they didn't ask for ID back then.
7180000	7186000	It was okay, though, because my mom and dad watched me play Vice City and said they would answer any questions I had.
7186000	7199000	The longest wait was when the Wii was launching. Three friends and I waited 33 hours in 20 degree weathers to buy it. The only reason we had to wait outside was two days earlier people were waiting in the store for PS3 and were opening toys and trashing the store.
7199000	7206000	I mean, why would you do that? I'll say people should not be jackasses and smoke in line. Amen.
7206000	7217000	I was in line for Modern Warfare 2 and these people were smoking joints. I'm not against weed, but seriously, do that in privacy, not in public. They did have a sober driver, at least.
7217000	7225000	Well, I look forward to your answers. I hope the podcast feed is updated soon because my computer has been fried for a month and I'm using the PSP to listen to you guys.
7225000	7227000	Two episodes went up today. Go get them now.
7227000	7233000	By the way, this email is brought to you by Lil' Catz, where you can house cheeseburger and invisible items.
7233000	7245000	I have to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the midnight releases. It's usually freaking cold out. The last one I can honestly remember going to, actually I think the first one I went to was when the Wii was released.
7245000	7247000	My first was the Dreamcast.
7247000	7257000	And even then, I didn't wait in line all night. We went out to go take, remember we did this whole cute little promotion thing where we took cookies and orange soda to people in line?
7257000	7259000	Chris and I were taking donuts and coffee.
7259000	7266000	It was a cheap promotion for our show, basically. But people seemed to genuinely appreciate it. At first, people were kind of weirded out by it, like, whoa, people are bringing us stuff.
7266000	7274000	We're like, no, we're just trying to promote our show. And people were pretty cool with it. In fact, remember that? Some dude at Target was listening to our show on his iPod.
7274000	7279000	That was such a trip. He knew who we were. So that was awesome.
7279000	7288000	So yeah, that was cool. And you guys ended up staying at Target and got your Wii. And then I sent my roommate, Christopher, to go so I could sleep in my nice warm bed and I didn't have to wait all night for a Wii.
7288000	7300000	Well, my first midnight launch that I think I went to was when the Dreamcast came out. September 9, 1999. We'd already had a Dreamcast by then, for the record.
7300000	7308000	Because we had an import Dreamcast. But Dan and I waited in line, and we were really only there for about maybe three, four hours.
7308000	7315000	My friend Mel, not Mel as in Mel and Melody, but Mel that manages the GameStop.
7315000	7316000	Yes, I know Mel.
7316000	7325000	She and I actually sat in line and we actually walked over to Barnes and Noble, bought cheap books, and just sat in line reading cheap books off the clear shelf.
7325000	7335000	You know, I usually don't go to midnight releases. I'm patient enough to wait until the next day. With my job, I can't stay up all night playing a video game. I have to go to work the next day.
7335000	7358000	Well, the launch for the Wii, though, that was over a weekend. Because I remember Marissa was in town, and we went to see Marissa, our buxom friend Marissa, at some music convention for indie artists or something.
7358000	7364000	It was a pretty cool thing. And then you called us to let us know what you and...
7364000	7371000	Because literally it was a last minute idea. Like, we were like, let's go out and take cookies to the people in line and then say it's from Orange Line Radio.
7371000	7385000	Chris and I bought our place in line. Seriously, we're like, dude, we're gonna go out and get donuts and coffee. And we will give you some if you let us get in line. Okay. So we got in line.
7385000	7386000	So they held your place, basically.
7386000	7387000	They held us the place in line.
7387000	7392000	And from what I remember at Target, anyone that was in line before like 5, 6 a.m. ended up getting one anyway.
7392000	7401000	Well, this one woman walked up, just as they had given out all the numbers, and everyone who was there got a number. Except her.
7401000	7409000	She comes prancing her little butt up at 7 in the morning, going, so where's my number? Um, you missed out, ma'am.
7409000	7428000	And this was, of course, when the Wii was still hard to get, so it was... I think that we were smart. We took the Ferengi rules of acquisition to heart and swallowed, I think, was it...
7428000	7431000	Dignity and an empty sack is worth a sack.
7431000	7433000	Can you believe that was three years ago?
7433000	7433000	Yeah.
7433000	7435000	And that all went down?
7435000	7436000	Alright.
7436000	7437000	So yeah.
7437000	7443000	Now, uh, I guess, uh, any other emails tonight?
7443000	7444000	No!
7444000	7450000	Lowkey, did you ever do a midnight launch? They're not really my thing. You don't have to, because of your industry. You get them early anyway.
7450000	7451000	Not always.
7451000	7452000	Not always.
7452000	7453000	A lot of times I do.
7453000	7455000	Now I get Dan to reserve stuff.
7455000	7459000	I think I did with Grand Theft Auto IV. I think I went and picked it up at midnight.
7459000	7463000	I went to a Final Fantasy XII midnight launch. There was hardly anybody there.
7463000	7468000	I used to for all the other Grand Theft Auto games. I used to go there and pick it up at midnight.
7468000	7469000	That's cool.
7469000	7476000	Alright, we got a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
7476000	7482000	Just a tip, folks. If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please, please, pretty please call the Echo Test Service first.
7482000	7484000	That's Echo123 is the username.
7484000	7489000	And make sure you can hear yourself and the nice little British lady that does the little voice check with you.
7489000	7495000	It will help save the pain of us having a failed call.
7495000	7497000	Yes.
7497000	7499000	So this is kind of cool.
7499000	7503000	Of course, we were talking about modders doing stuff to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 earlier.
7503000	7510000	Well, of course, the other game that came out very close to that, of course, Left 4 Dead 2.
7510000	7514000	They also have some modders doing stuff for that as well.
7514000	7519000	Including the modders over at Left4DeadMods.com, or L4DMods.com.
7519000	7525000	They have found a way to implement the original maps from Left 4 Dead 1 into Left 4 Dead 2.
7525000	7537000	And although Valve hasn't released the software development kit yet for Left 4 Dead 2, they had to, I guess, do some workarounds in order to get it to work.
7537000	7544000	So basically, it just requires you to change some files in the original game.
7544000	7547000	And of course, you have to own both games before it's work.
7547000	7553000	And then you can go ahead and play those maps in your new game.
7553000	7555000	That's kind of neat.
7555000	7558000	Well, we kind of knew the hackers would do this.
7558000	7560000	This is just inevitable.
7560000	7566000	By the way, speaking of editing levels, and I suppose this was inevitable as well.
7566000	7574000	Whenever there's a way to edit worlds in a side-scrolling game, it's inevitable that someone is going to make World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
7574000	7577000	But has it been done in a Super Mario Bros. game before?
7577000	7580000	I don't know, but it's been done with Super Mario Bros. Wii.
7580000	7585000	Within 48 hours of the game release, there were level editors already out for it.
7585000	7589000	And sure enough, somebody made World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
7589000	7592000	Now we're looking at a video here in studio of this actually running.
7592000	7595000	But the thing to keep in mind, this is actually running on an emulator.
7595000	7599000	So it's kind of slow. You can see that there's frame rate issues.
7599000	7602000	And I don't know if it's because the dude's trying to record it to YouTube.
7602000	7609000	But, I mean, it's a pretty faithful recreation of World 1-1, except the fact that it runs slow.
7609000	7613000	But I'm sure in just a matter of time, they'll have this up to full speed.
7613000	7615000	I just couldn't believe there's already emulators for Wii games.
7615000	7617000	I guess I seem to remember reporting on it on the show before.
7617000	7620000	It faced off the GameCube hardware, so they should use the GameCube emulator.
7620000	7623000	The important thing is if it's got the invisible...
7623000	7627000	Oh, it does. It has the invisible 1-up cube.
7627000	7631000	I didn't see dude go down the pipe, though. Maybe he doesn't want to show that off. I don't know.
7631000	7635000	When there's a will, there's a way. Somebody figured out how to do it.
7635000	7639000	Now my question is, I guess you can't really actually play this on a Wii yet.
7639000	7642000	Because there'd be no way to burn the disc and it would run, right?
7642000	7644000	You have to use an emulator for this.
7644000	7647000	Yeah, because this stuff is signed.
7647000	7649000	There may be a way. Because you can do...
7649000	7656000	Well, that might have been with... Because I know you can create hacked Smash Bros. games.
7656000	7659000	So maybe you could do that with New Super Mario Bros.
7659000	7661000	I don't know. I think a lot of this stuff needs to be trunk...
7661000	7664000	What was it? Trunk-a-shine?
7664000	7667000	What was it? Trunk... I don't remember how they pronounce it.
7667000	7669000	It's some sort of signing that they have.
7669000	7674000	Some user created a program to re-sign everything in there.
7674000	7676000	Because everything's encoded, of course.
7676000	7678000	It's just a matter of time before the hackers figure it out.
7678000	7680000	It's time for you to give us a call.
7680000	7683000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7683000	7687000	If there's a particular news topic that we didn't talk about tonight that you think we should give a little time to,
7687000	7689000	now's the perfect time to get through.
7689000	7691000	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7691000	7693000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7693000	7696000	Keep in mind our number is toll free in the US and Canada,
7696000	7699000	but if you're in another country besides that, you want to play it safe and use Skype.
7699000	7701000	While we're waiting for some phone calls...
7701000	7704000	Oops, I think we might still be in do not disturb mode.
7704000	7706000	Oh, we're getting a call. I guess we're not.
7706000	7707000	Talk about tonight.
7707000	7709000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
7709000	7711000	Hi, this is HackDeaf.
7711000	7713000	Hi, HackDeaf. What's on your mind?
7713000	7719000	Nothing much, but I want to talk about the PS2 launching in Brazil.
7719000	7723000	Please do, because I know you have probably a unique perspective on this,
7723000	7727000	because you live in Mexico, which is closer than we are to Brazil.
7727000	7735000	But all joking aside, you live in a country that isn't always supported by the game companies, correct?
7735000	7737000	True.
7737000	7741000	So what's your thoughts on the game launch in Brazil of PS2?
7741000	7753000	Basically, just government, just doing the wrong things when importing electronic stuff and new technologies.
7753000	7756000	Here in Mexico, we have the problem of...
7756000	7763000	It's not very big as Brazil since we already have PS3s, 360s, and Wiis here.
7763000	7778000	But there in Brazil, they charge like 200% over what the electronic device costs.
7778000	7779000	Good lord.
7779000	7785000	They charge you $400 for a PS2 in Brazil.
7785000	7790000	And that's a tax? That's just money that is collected as a tax for whatever purpose?
7790000	7792000	Yes.
7792000	7794000	That's crazy.
7794000	7799000	Here in Mexico, we have that tax too, though it's not that high.
7799000	7807000	We get charged like double of what a game costs in the US.
7807000	7814000	Like for example, the Beatles Rock Band, it costs $60 in the US.
7814000	7823000	It costs Mexico like 1,000 pesos, which is around $70 for a game.
7823000	7835000	Though we have the consoles, we cost here 4,000 pesos, which is around $350 US dollars.
7835000	7839000	But to be fair, a lot of this happens when you import from country to country too.
7839000	7844000	For instance, if we were to buy stuff from Japan, we'd be looking at very similar overheads.
7844000	7851000	But at the same time, and help me clarify this, when we import stuff from Japan,
7851000	7855000	it's because we're paying a fee from whoever is grabbing it from Japan.
7855000	7859000	But are you talking about that even when the companies release things directly in Mexico,
7859000	7861000	that there's still this overhead?
7861000	7866000	Or are you paying an overhead because your Beatles Rock Band copies are coming from the US?
7866000	7871000	Yeah, we basically pay the import fees because it comes from the US.
7871000	7879000	They sell it in official retailers here, and it's official software and merchandise.
7879000	7886000	Though because it doesn't get made here exactly, it gets imported from the US,
7886000	7888000	we get charged that much.
7888000	7897000	The only company that does distribute officially here in Mexico and makes their games in Mexico is Microsoft.
7897000	7904000	For example, Halo 3, Years of War, Forza 3, all cost around 600 pesos,
7904000	7909000	which is maybe even less than it costs in the US.
7909000	7911000	Interesting.
7911000	7915000	Describe briefly for our listeners, before we have to go to another call,
7915000	7918000	how big the gaming scene is in Mexico.
7918000	7923000	Is it something that's only for rich people can get into?
7923000	7926000	Or is it something that it seems like it's pretty commonplace?
7926000	7932000	Or does Mexico seem kind of behind where maybe everyone owns a Super Nintendo
7932000	7935000	because those are easier to get now?
7935000	7940000	They're not that behind on hardware.
7940000	7946000	Like I said, people have here PlayStation 3, 360s, Wii.
7946000	7956000	So maybe the people that don't have that kind of money to purchase a console from this generation have a PS2,
7956000	7966000	which also costs a lot, but it's cheaper considering Wii costs over 1000 pesos more than a PS2.
7966000	7971000	I got to say, that's not too dissimilar from what happens here because even though I'm sure listening to the show,
7971000	7974000	it sounds like we all have PS3s because the hosts of the show do.
7974000	7979000	I know a lot of people that haven't taken that plunge to the 360, to the PS3, in a lot of cases even the Wii,
7979000	7983000	because they just can't afford it, starving students or what have you in this day and age economy,
7983000	7988000	that PS2 is a lot more lucrative when it's only 99 bucks.
7988000	7991000	Yeah, it's not that different from the US.
7991000	8001000	Like I said, in Brazil, the official release this year and after the official release,
8001000	8010000	and pretty much everyone else is just crazy.
8010000	8018000	That's why Mega Drive or Genesis Systems is pretty big over there because it's cheap.
8018000	8025000	Though, it's cheap and also it's affordable for everyone there.
8025000	8030000	And you know, if it's cheaper to pirate it and if it's cheaper to import it,
8030000	8034000	or if it's cheaper to get it not the official way, that's what people are going to do, sadly.
8034000	8036000	Well Act Def, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls,
8036000	8040000	but thank you as always for the worldly perspective, we appreciate it.
8040000	8041000	Thank you, you too.
8041000	8044000	Alright, take care buddy.
8044000	8048000	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8048000	8051000	Loki, any quick last minute stories before we get to another call?
8051000	8056000	Yeah, we'll talk real quick about the Sonic Classic Collections coming to DS.
8056000	8058000	And that's like all the old school Sonic games?
8058000	8059000	Yeah, just like the one on 360.
8059000	8062000	So that they've re-released like 50,000 times?
8062000	8063000	Yeah, but not on the DS.
8063000	8065000	Alright, hi, we got another call.
8065000	8066000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8066000	8068000	Hey everyone, it's Ronma.
8068000	8069000	Hi Ronma, how are you doing?
8069000	8071000	I'm good, how are you guys doing tonight?
8071000	8075000	Good, hey, real quick, this is why they don't give us Virtual Console on the DS.
8075000	8078000	Because if they gave us Virtual Console on the DS, they couldn't be making the Sonic Collection.
8078000	8079000	Just saying.
8079000	8080000	Very true.
8080000	8081000	Just saying.
8081000	8082000	Hi, Ronma, sorry about that, just had to get that thought out there.
8082000	8083000	No problem.
8083000	8084000	What is on your mind, my friend?
8084000	8085000	We haven't heard from you in a few weeks.
8085000	8087000	I have to say, I've missed you a little bit.
8087000	8089000	Oh, I've missed you guys too.
8089000	8090000	Aww, big hug.
8090000	8091000	But our aim's improving.
8091000	8093000	Aww, what's on your mind?
8093000	8097000	Yes, I know, I told a bullet go by about a few seconds ago.
8097000	8104000	Besides the fact that I just got back from another convention last week, I was at a Nintendo
8104000	8106000	World for another special event.
8106000	8108000	And what was that?
8108000	8111000	The release of New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii.
8111000	8113000	Of course, of course, how did that go?
8113000	8117000	It was fun, despite all the rain and the wetness.
8117000	8121000	You didn't have to compete with the tree lighting, did you?
8121000	8125000	Nope, but the tree was already there, but mostly everyone was there to check out New
8125000	8126000	Super Mario Brothers Wii, believe it or not.
8126000	8127000	Wow, okay.
8127000	8132000	Even though this makes for great radio, I am posting a link in the chat room where they
8132000	8133000	can check out pictures.
8133000	8135000	May I plug my website?
8135000	8136000	Of course you may.
8136000	8142000	Just go over to DJRonS.net, click on the scrapbook, and go to events, and you'll see the pictures
8142000	8144000	from that Saturday.
8144000	8146000	Did you dress up as Black Luigi?
8146000	8149000	No, I decided not to.
8149000	8154000	Well, now I see a Princess Peach, I see a Mario, but no Black Luigi.
8154000	8159000	I just decided to wear just the hat, and when I got there, there were people dressed up
8159000	8161000	as Propeller Mario and Propeller Luigi.
8161000	8163000	I'm like, well, next time.
8163000	8164000	Cute.
8164000	8165000	Oh, there's a little kid dressed up as Mario.
8165000	8166000	That's precious.
8166000	8167000	I like that.
8167000	8168000	Yeah.
8168000	8171000	By the way, I don't know if this is me or if we're all hammering this now, but some
8171000	8174000	of your links are coming up broken, so just double check your gallery.
8174000	8178000	Yeah, there's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on all the broken links,
8178000	8180000	there are actual images there from the event.
8180000	8181000	Okay, I believe you.
8181000	8184000	By the way, now that we have the whole Facebook group, go ahead and feel free to post the
8184000	8185000	link there, too.
8185000	8187000	Oh, that I will do.
8187000	8188000	Yeah, see?
8188000	8189000	It has a practical purpose.
8189000	8190000	We should have had this a year ago.
8190000	8191000	That's all right.
8191000	8194000	Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the event.
8194000	8196000	You were at a convention this weekend, right?
8196000	8197000	Yes.
8197000	8198000	Okay, tell us about it.
8198000	8199000	Or is it worth talking about?
8199000	8201000	Well, it's called Anime USA.
8201000	8204000	It's not a small anime convention.
8204000	8206000	They've been around for about several years.
8206000	8208000	It was in the same location as Capcom this year.
8208000	8211000	I went as a dealer and as press, and it was fun.
8211000	8216000	In a way, it reminded me of anime because everything was practically open all night,
8216000	8221000	including the fact that we had a five- and six-hour rave going on.
8221000	8225000	Wow.
8225000	8226000	That was fun.
8226000	8230000	Leaving, and half the fun was leaving trying to find water, and we couldn't find water
8230000	8232000	trying to find cups for water.
8232000	8236000	Now, I always ask this about conventions because I know a lot of you go for the anime,
8236000	8238000	but we talk about the games here.
8238000	8240000	So what kind of gaming room setup did they have?
8240000	8242000	Or any tournaments or anything?
8242000	8247000	I didn't get you to check out the tournaments, but the gaming rooms were slightly different.
8247000	8253000	I remember I had mentioned how one convention I went to, they had a dark room just for Rockman.
8253000	8257000	They pretty much had that for both gaming rooms.
8257000	8263000	And they had two main setups, one for Tekken 6 and one for Street Fighter IV.
8263000	8272000	Attached to, I believe, a 40-plus-inch television, which was also connected to a massive projector as well.
8272000	8274000	Wow.
8274000	8279000	Everybody likes to see things bigger and better, so projectors are always welcome, I'm sure.
8279000	8281000	Oh, definitely.
8281000	8285000	Well, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go to get more calls tonight?
8285000	8289000	Not thus per se, but I wanted to know, did you guys try New Super Mario Brothers Wii?
8289000	8291000	Because I wasn't able to listen to the show last week.
8291000	8294000	You know what? Sadly, I haven't been able to pick it up yet.
8294000	8301000	I played some other games this week instead, and it just seems like nobody here has just really had the incentive to run out and get it.
8301000	8302000	That's right.
8302000	8304000	The economy's taken the toll on us all, DJ Rama.
8304000	8306000	We have to pick and choose our games carefully.
8306000	8312000	We can't run out and buy things, and game companies don't send us stuff for free because we're just some shoddy little independent podcast.
8312000	8314000	I hear you completely.
8314000	8320000	I still did play it at E3, and I would like to play it, you know, because it's so different.
8320000	8322000	Playing things at E3 is not the same as playing them in your living room.
8322000	8324000	I know, I know.
8324000	8331000	My biggest concern about the whole thing, though, is that I hear multiplayer is the superior aspect of it, and I don't really have anybody to play with.
8331000	8338000	I mean, I bet my roommate would play, you know, once or twice with me, and then, you know, my friend Victoria, who's over all the time, might play a couple times with me.
8338000	8342000	But I don't have anybody that really would want to, like, sit there from beginning to finish to play with me, you know what I mean?
8342000	8344000	True, true.
8344000	8348000	But I will say this much about Super Mario Brothers Wii, and I'll be on my way.
8348000	8356000	If you liked Super Mario Brothers 3 and the elements of Super Mario World, you're definitely going to like New Super Mario Brothers Wii. Simple as that.
8356000	8359000	Well, those are two very, very big Mario games near and dear to my heart.
8359000	8367000	You know, I am hearing, I have heard glowing reviews from, and this is important to say, not just you and the folks who listen to this show.
8367000	8377000	But the day the game came out, my Facebook page was littered with people that I sometimes forget play video games because they don't really talk about it very much that were excited about this release.
8377000	8384000	For instance, Rama, you know, because you met her when I went to New York, you know my friend that I go to visit in Brooklyn, who I knew since college, right?
8384000	8385000	Right.
8385000	8388000	Who thought it was a little silly that we were all getting together to go to that video game store, right?
8388000	8396000	She's one of those people that posted that was all excited about the release of New Super Mario Brothers Wii, because she loves the old school one.
8396000	8402000	And didn't we all go to that game store just to get her a copy of the Guardian Legend, or was it just for yourself?
8402000	8413000	That was for me to buy for her, because she recently hooked up her 8-bit Nintendo, and I said, if you're going to hook up your 8-bit Nintendo, you need a copy of the greatest game ever made.
8413000	8421000	By the way, on a completely unrelated tangent, I went to the local flea market here, which I'm finding can be an awesome place to find video games.
8421000	8429000	Although I didn't pick it up, and I really am kicking myself now, I should have, I saw a copy of Guardian Legend for two bucks, and I was like, oh, kind of want.
8429000	8432000	You don't need to have...
8432000	8434000	I know, I know, but I just don't have...
8434000	8435000	Two dollars, Ron!
8435000	8444000	I know, I should have just bought the damn thing, but I didn't. Final Fantasy cartridge, 20 bucks, but it was still there. I held it in my hand. It was godly.
8444000	8451000	Anyway, Ron, we've got to let you guys get some more calls, but thanks for the conversation as always, and have fun with your convention going.
8451000	8453000	Fanime 2010, maybe?
8453000	8463000	I already have event plans that weekend, but I do believe there's talks of OLRG cons, like that round, Fourth of Joy weekend, something like that.
8463000	8475000	I'm all for that. You know what, we need to set up some type of mini-con. We just need to make it happen. I don't know how to do it, but I have a friend who's into event planning, so I might have to seek some outside help, and we have to have ourselves an OR mini-con.
8475000	8481000	I don't know how many people will come to Sacramento for it, but hey, if we can get like 30 people to show up, I'd call it a success.
8481000	8489000	Hey, if Jamie can get me to travel 3,000 miles and twist my arm to make it out there, it won't be hard to get everybody else to do so.
8489000	8492000	We'll try our best. All right, take care, Ron. Have a good one.
8492000	8493000	All right, laters.
8493000	8500000	Later. 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio. Other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8500000	8514000	Yeah, they're actually doing a dedicated store for EA Sports Active. There's actually one that they opened up in Boston and San Francisco, which seems kind of odd. I don't know how you could have a whole store for EA Sports Active.
8514000	8523000	Well, I mean, you know, if Wii Fit is doing as well as it is with its storefront set up and so forth, I'm kind of not surprised.
8523000	8525000	Yeah, but it's a dedicated store, though.
8525000	8528000	Yeah, that's weird. Okay, hold on, we got another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?
8528000	8530000	This is Deathwishing.
8530000	8533000	Hi, Deathwishing. Another caller we haven't heard from in a while. What's on your mind?
8533000	8541000	Well, I haven't heard from you. I've been on a concert binge, but it's all about just Modern Warfare 2 lately with me.
8541000	8547000	Good, because, you know, I don't know if you heard last week's show, which you probably haven't because the podcast, you know, has taken a while to get up, and I admit that's my bad.
8547000	8548000	I'll go to the concert.
8548000	8550000	What concert, Sad Curiosity?
8550000	8553000	My concert. It's from my choir.
8553000	8555000	Oh, okay. Oh, you're in Glee Club.
8555000	8560000	No, it's, I love, I just do it because I like to sing.
8560000	8564000	Oh, well, I just, I love Glee. That's alright. Anyway, what was I going to say?
8564000	8572000	Well, if you want me, I can show you a couple of things, because I went to the minute I released the one of things, so if I can, if you guys can see the video feed on Skype.
8572000	8575000	Um, no, we don't have video. Sorry.
8575000	8583000	I'll take a full picture. I have a poster and a big cardboard cutout that I won from a GameStop.
8583000	8587000	Usually the video feed, like, kills our Skypes. That's why we don't usually have it.
8587000	8593000	Yeah, so I have a, I'll take a picture of it. I have a big, you know, I have a big, huge cardboard advertisement that you can get, and then I have a poster.
8593000	8601000	On the other hand, I heard a couple of things, like, I heard there were going to be aliens and zombies, but they got cut out.
8601000	8603000	Of Modern Warfare?
8603000	8608000	Just from, what's it, the Inside Gaming Twitter. I heard something about that.
8608000	8610000	Interesting. I hadn't heard anything about that.
8610000	8614000	A Call of Duty MMO being made, and possibly a movie.
8614000	8620000	Now, here's the thing. This came up on last week's show, and we didn't get a whole lot of feedback on this, but this is what I want to ask.
8620000	8627000	You know, obviously, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, this isn't usually the type of game we get into, and it's not to knock on the game.
8627000	8631000	It's just that I suck at first-person shooters, so I don't really get into these games usually.
8631000	8636000	What is it about Modern Warfare 2, as opposed to all these other types of shooter games that are out there?
8636000	8641000	Halos of the world and everything else. What is it about Modern Warfare 2 that is making it the must-have game of the year?
8641000	8651000	Because it's borrowing aspects from just all these other games. Like, it's borrowed aspects from, what's it, I want to say Halo, because it has, like, medals and stuff now you earn.
8651000	8659000	It actually, funny, see, here's the thing. It borrowed stuff from Street Fighter, with the titles and emblem system, and it's exactly like Street Fighter for titles and emblems.
8659000	8666000	And, like, when they interviewed them about the emblem system, I guess the Infinity Ward guys, they played a crapload of Street Fighter.
8666000	8673000	They kind of put the third person, they're trying to take the rap at Gears of War.
8673000	8683000	So, it's really, if you kind of want to look at it, it's really, you could say it's just another copy and paste, but the thing is, they do it more well.
8683000	8689000	It's, like, a lot of underlying stuff you have to do with, like, the way guns handle. It's really balanced.
8689000	8697000	Like, if there's a guy that's really good, you can still find a way to take him out. It's not like on Halo where you have to be skill-based, you know?
8697000	8702000	Or, like, if you don't play Halo at all and you go online, you just, like, can't do anything.
8702000	8709000	You do, you get raped in the face. That happens to me all the time. When I try to sign up and play Halo, it's like, bam, you're dead, bam, you're dead, bam, you're dead.
8709000	8715000	Yeah, my friend, he doesn't play at all. He can maybe at least, on a good night, pull at least four or five kills in a match.
8715000	8719000	Wow, and Halo, he was finally getting one, and the rest was just respawning.
8719000	8727000	Wow. They need to make, like, I really wish Microsoft would make, like, Halo Remedial Edition for people like me.
8727000	8735000	No, what they should make, really, was, like, what they said they would do in the first place was have skill matching so you play with people your skill level, which I never saw implanted.
8735000	8738000	That true skill thing that was complete bullcrap.
8738000	8744000	Because a lot of people reset their skills or create new profiles, and then, you know, you get all these really skilled people that are starting from ground level one.
8744000	8748000	Is there a way to make that console attached, you know? They kind of just made it for the console.
8748000	8752000	I wish, but sadly, that feature doesn't seem to work too well.
8752000	8759000	And, funny thing you should say, remember how you were talking about the global thermonuclear warfare thing?
8759000	8760000	Yeah.
8760000	8766000	That's also a call sign in the game, so that kind of was a little weird.
8766000	8768000	Do you want to play a game?
8768000	8775000	Uh, okay, okay, okay, uh, dude from Sol, I forgot his name.
8775000	8779000	No, it's, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.
8779000	8781000	Do you want to play a game?
8781000	8782000	It's a war game.
8782000	8783000	It's a war game.
8783000	8785000	I know, the kid wasn't even born yet, probably.
8785000	8789000	Alright, Death Wishing, do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
8789000	8793000	Um, are there any good fighting games coming out?
8793000	8798000	Super Street Fighter IV, and, you know, if you don't really want to take the plunge on that,
8798000	8804000	Street Fighter IV has gotten a big price reduction in a lot of retailers, so if you haven't picked that up yet, you haven't?
8804000	8806000	Tekken 6.
8806000	8807000	Tekken 6?
8807000	8810000	I've heard, I'm going to tell you, I've heard mixed things on Tekken 6.
8810000	8812000	It's Tekken!
8812000	8813000	So, I don't know.
8813000	8815000	It's Tekken, therefore it's worthy.
8815000	8818000	You might want to run it first.
8818000	8824000	I don't know of any other big, big fighting games that people are very excited about right now. I think Tekken 6 was kind of the anchor for the year.
8824000	8830000	Um, I would bet there's a new Soul Calibur announced pretty soon, and some other games we'll be looking at next year.
8830000	8837000	But, um, nothing outside of Super Street Fighter II that I, or, sorry, Super Street Fighter IV that I know of, unless somebody in chat happens to know. Don't know.
8837000	8838000	So, we'll see.
8838000	8843000	Alright, well, Death Wishing, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you so much for the call, as always.
8843000	8844000	Call of Duty now.
8844000	8846000	Later!
8846000	8848000	Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8848000	8849000	We'll take one more call.
8849000	8850000	What the hell?
8850000	8851000	1877 Game O.L.R.
8851000	8853000	No last minute stories.
8853000	8854000	That's it?
8854000	8856000	Well, there's not much I want to talk about.
8856000	8857000	Holy crap!
8857000	8859000	Alright.
8859000	8863000	Somebody in chat is saying, did you notice your Skype hit 250 contacts?
8863000	8866000	No, I don't think we have 250 contacts. Do we really?
8866000	8871000	Maybe. I've never bothered to check or count them all up.
8871000	8874000	Alright, we'll see if we get any more calls here.
8874000	8878000	And then we're going to call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8878000	8882000	Of course, we still have the afterbirth for the live listeners, for the podcast listeners.
8882000	8884000	Tune in live sometime.
8884000	8889000	Chatters, by the way, BlazBlue in chat, I'm sorry, ActDeft in chat says BlazBlue for the PSP.
8889000	8891000	Aren't you going to introduce me first?
8891000	8892000	Hello?
8892000	8893000	This is Legend of Zaku.
8893000	8895000	Hi, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
8895000	8906000	Nothing much, just killing another Sunday evening with my MacBook trying to do the ritualistic whittling of code and listening to your show.
8906000	8908000	Um, yes.
8908000	8918000	So I kind of realized that certain companies in particular are starting to hate on certain platforms.
8918000	8920000	Case in point, Gameloft.
8920000	8926000	You may have heard of them from such mobile games as...
8926000	8930000	I'm trying to think of a good Gameloft game.
8930000	8933000	What the hell, are you typing onto your Skype headset?
8933000	8935000	All I hear is clack, clack, clack, clack.
8935000	8938000	It's as bad as Jamie when she puts the mic down next to her keyboard.
8938000	8940000	Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
8940000	8948000	Long story short is that they're giving up on Android, even before it's even hitting its peak.
8948000	8966000	The reason I'm bringing this up is because this proves that the sheer number of, you know, the fact that iPhone is so prevalent and people are basically using it as a massive baseline, like some unreachable bar for other platforms to jump over.
8966000	8983000	In this case, they're just saying because we can make 400 times as much on the iPhone, on the Apple Store with Apple's bullshit in terms of going through the approval process, they could easily just kill funding for Android.
8983000	8990000	You know, a lot of people have been getting pissed off at iPhone's little approval process, and one of them, it seems like, is Google.
8990000	9006000	I like how Google tried to throw down the gauntlet saying, hey, we've got this free turn-by-turn navigation app that is going to make TomTom shit their pants that we're willing to release on the store, you know, whenever Apple decides they want to let us release apps on the store.
9006000	9022000	I mean, I can understand the rationale. Money comes first to them. I mean, in that sense, they have every right to make as much money as they please, but, you know, they kind of gave up on it. They're acting a bit premature by just trying to, like, not give it a chance.
9022000	9034000	I guess it's because of the fact that an Android, you could actually get a refund and, you know, and all the try before you buy. So that's really scaring them off.
9034000	9045000	You know, there's a comment in chat, fuck Apple in the ass from ToaKak. You know, there's a lot of people that are of that mindset, but the problem is Apple has a lock on this shit right now. Like, seriously.
9045000	9049000	People, lots of people have iPhones.
9049000	9064000	Well, one could argue that the way they, you know, the way they set up their store, you know, their platforms, you know, the fact that it's almost video game-like where you need, like, to pay licensing just to get it up is kind of more streamlined.
9064000	9070000	Granted, you do have its growing pains with the approval process.
9070000	9079000	Well, I'm not going to disagree with you. I think Apple's approval process stinks, but at the same time, I don't think there's a lot we can do about it, especially when they're largely in charge.
9079000	9091000	If another phone steps up and actually gives them competition, but as of right now, there isn't anybody even close, except maybe Crack Berries, the Crack Berries storm, but even then...
9091000	9101000	I mean, I worked on Black Berries, and even then, you know, you could easily distribute your apps on your own. I mean, it's just now that Rin managed to get a Blackberry app store.
9101000	9108000	But aside, let's divert our attention. I think we're straying, we're deviating a bit too from the actual nature of this show.
9108000	9109000	Sure.
9109000	9125000	Basically, I'm trying to bring up a little story that I saw on Kotaku about how Team Fortress 2 managed to get a lot more updates than any other Valve game to date. At least almost 97 updates, to be exact, ever since its release.
9125000	9135000	True. It does seem like we've been reporting a lot on Team Fortress 2 on the show. Like, there'll always be a new class or a new mode in the game. They've done a lot of changes to that game.
9135000	9140000	I want to play as the sandwich.
9140000	9153000	I guess people have thrown the argument that maybe it's because they actually care about their platform. I actually saw a little tidbit from what they actually quoted, that every time that Valve releases an update for Team Fortress 2, their sales go up 20%.
9153000	9168000	Whereas, when you have Modern Warfare 2, where Activision is planning to sell you DLC that's already in game, and it may not be worth the money you're actually paying for it.
9168000	9175000	You know what, Zaku, that's a very good statistic that I think a lot of people sometimes don't take to heart, is that when a lot of these games do these massive updates, they continue to sell.
9175000	9191000	Let me give you another example. Burnout Paradise was cranking out a lot of very big updates to it that would change the game significantly. It was a way to keep the game relevant and newsworthy and continue to get it on all the blogs and create awareness for the game.
9191000	9206000	But the fact of the matter is that Valve basically put those Team Fortress 2 updates for free. You're talking about class updates, new game modes, literally for free.
9206000	9221000	You see where Activision, and Microsoft's also guilty of this as well, for trying to nickel and dime people.
9221000	9231000	Well, money talks, my friend, and if people say that they're not going to get nickeled and dimed by the Modern Warfare 2 DLC, and they switch to hacking, as a lot of people are doing, then somebody's going to get the message, loud and clear.
9231000	9244000	For the $60 you're paying for the PC version, it's kind of like you're getting ripped off of the fact that even in Call of Duty 4, you got the maps for free, and console players had to shell out money for it.
9244000	9268000	I don't know. I guess it keeps in line where Activision's starting to come up with these crazy methods of trying to maximize profit on just about every game they release, but that's them. I guess that's their rationale for trying to be EA's for the early, middle of this decade.
9268000	9276000	Alright. Saku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call and getting us to talk about topics that we might not otherwise talk about.
9276000	9277000	Alright.
9277000	9278000	Have a good one, buddy.
9278000	9284000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Apologies to those that didn't get through. It was a pretty busy night on the phones tonight.
9284000	9312000	You can always send us, of course, an email mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com, or you can send us a message on Twitter, or now we have Facebook and the official Orange Launch Radio fan page on Facebook, which I'm going to give one more link to in our chat room and hope that maybe we can get 100 fans by tomorrow, so that way we can grow our Facebook page into the next evolution of Facebook pages where we get our short URL and not an ugly-ass number there.
9312000	9318000	Anyhow, if there's no other last-minute stories, DarkSakura, Loki, nothing, I don't think I have anything either.
9318000	9320000	In other news, I like fire.
9320000	9321000	Well, that's not news.
9321000	9329000	They have a Neo Geo two-slot system over here, full-size arcade, some guy's moving, he's already sold his house, $300.
9329000	9330000	Wow.
9330000	9331000	Nice.
9331000	9332000	If you need one for your garage.
9332000	9342000	I'm tempted, but there might be some changes going on in Rob's life that I can't get into right now, but maybe later.
9342000	9343000	Anyhow, I'm going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.
9343000	9346000	Thanks, everybody, as always, for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.
9346000	9357000	Independent podcasts rely on word of mouth, and so we really appreciate it when you guys do tell your friends about the show, such as the dude who told all 650 of his Facebook friends, but just keep in mind again, don't spam it.
9357000	9359000	What are we at now?
9359000	9360000	78.
9360000	9361000	We're almost there.
9361000	9370000	So especially considering we set it up today, I'm very impressed, and much love to the O.L. Army for all their help, because he wasn't the only one that posted on Twitter.
9370000	9374000	I saw like four retweets, and all of that is very much appreciated.
9374000	9377000	Thank you guys so, so much.
9377000	9378000	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9378000	9380000	Dark Sakura.
9380000	9382000	I want dinner.
9382000	9384000	Loki, your final thought.
9384000	9387000	I guess we'll sign up for the fan page.
9387000	9388000	Haven't done it yet.
9388000	9389000	You haven't done it yet?
9389000	9391000	I'm going to go do that, Matt.
9391000	9396000	I know you might not be a fan of the show, but you should probably go do that at some point.
9396000	9402000	And my final thought is I don't want to have to grade the big stack of papers that's sitting at home waiting for me.
9402000	9404000	So anyway, that's going to do it.
9404000	9406000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us.
9406000	9409000	Even though it is a holiday weekend, we will still be back here next Sunday, right?
9409000	9410000	Nobody's got anything planned.
9410000	9414000	So we will be back here next Sunday for more of Orange Launch Radio to do it all over again.
9414000	9418000	So until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.
