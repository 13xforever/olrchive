13865	23387	Tonight, November 22, 2009, both Sony consoles get some new firmware, will Microsoft face a lawsuit over their recent bannings, or will you soon get to simulate Sonic the Hedgehog
31380	35982	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36022	42006	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42026	49930	We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
50350	51311	My name is Rob Roberts.
51391	55973	Joining me every week, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
56253	56593	Yo.
56774	57314	How are you doing?
58250	59071	My hands are sore.
59511	59952	From what?
60552	61453	From crocheting.
61733	62534	Crocheting?
62954	63214	Yes.
63675	64756	Is that what they're calling it now?
64856	69399	Oh no, I see you actually have yarn there that you are crocheting something.
69439	69900	What is that?
71181	72061	I'm making a potholder.
72182	73342	Are they kitten mittens?
73823	74083	No.
74523	74804	Oh, okay.
74984	80228	Actually, this is just my practice sheet because I'm probably going to put it over there with my dolls or something.
80688	80848	My mom...
83110	83871	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
104349	108871	Well, now, though, I found tutorials on how to do, like, hats and stuff.
109712	113354	So, I think I'm going to make hats for everyone for the holidays.
114234	114574	Oh, fun.
114934	116075	So everyone gets a hat.
116555	117436	Everyone gets a hat!
118516	118936	I'm poor.
118996	119777	Everyone gets a hat.
120885	125669	I wish I could say that OLR was started out of spite, but OLR was started because we were really bored.
127250	129972	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
130232	130492	Hello.
130732	131253	How are you, Loki?
131533	131993	I'm good.
132293	133694	Any knitting going on in your neck of the woods?
133734	134155	Crocheting?
134235	134835	Sorry, excuse me.
135336	135416	No.
136038	146066	By the way, though, I know you catch that Kitten Mittens reference, and I watched that episode last night, finally, because they have that on the... It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on On Demand.
146406	147047	I was watching it.
147947	148288	LOL.
148388	149368	That's all I have to say.
149769	150890	LOL is all I have to say.
150910	151510	They're selling them.
151650	152511	Is that a real website?
152591	153452	Yeah, it's a real website.
153892	154733	You can buy dick towels.
154993	155193	Love it.
156261	159342	Do your cat make too much noise?
159362	160042	Modern Family
182586	183046	I love.
183166	184207	That show is hilarious.
185127	186588	Glee is great.
187308	188528	It tickles my gay fancy.
188548	191450	There's just been a lot of great shows this year.
191530	193230	V has been pretty cool.
194071	197952	I hear it's sacrilege to the original, but since I didn't watch the original, I'm not as attached.
198332	201574	I don't know how DarkSakura feels about the new V, but I'm loving it.
202294	202974	I like it okay.
203114	205195	If I had never seen the original, then yeah.
205575	209917	But I actually watched the original, all of them, when they aired.
210933	214415	I hope Sci-Fi Network airs them or something so I can go back and watch it.
214755	215795	I've actually got DVDs.
216575	217976	So if you ever want to have a V-party.
218176	219616	That would actually rock.
219956	221677	My roommate is really interested in watching the old one too.
221717	223258	One of the aliens was played by Robert England.
223838	224518	Nice.
224738	225939	The funny, silly one, Willy.
226099	226659	I heard about that.
227139	227299	Yeah.
227379	227739	I heard about that.
228039	229580	His first thing he says, can you help me?
229720	230360	I am just.
230720	234782	There's a clip on YouTube of the hamster scene.
237375	239916	Diana opening her mouth up and swallowing the guinea pig.
239996	240257	Yes.
240957	241397	Amazing.
242278	244119	I hope they reference that in the new one.
244179	244659	Anyway, sorry.
245060	245720	OMG spoilers!
246921	247381	Not really, though.
247581	248862	Because we don't know what's going to happen in the new one.
248882	250643	The new one's taking a lot of liberties with the old one.
251504	256327	But if I'm right, it's the same guy doing some of the writing.
256713	265656	Yeah, and the other half of the creative minds behind the new V is the folks that did the 4400, which was a pretty good sci-fi show on USA, if you ever saw that.
265816	267337	And one of the lead actors is from it, too.
267637	268877	But I'll tell you what, though.
268957	277020	If I sit you down through the original series, then you have to read the book that I got, the guy who wrote the original series.
277060	283222	And you can tell he's obviously a screenplay writer, but he wrote a book finishing it the way he wanted to finish it instead of how the final battle was.
283482	288185	This would be the perfect post-Thanksgiving plan if I didn't already have plans.
289346	290747	Well, I have plans on Friday night anyway.
290947	291147	Don't.
291728	292168	Yeah, me too.
292188	292548	Saturday.
292989	293249	I can't.
293269	294370	I'm going to be gone for the weekend.
294550	295490	Well, you're no fun.
295591	295931	I know.
296051	296291	I know.
296371	296651	Monday.
296811	297672	But I'll be back Sunday.
298192	298813	But we have the show.
299213	299633	Sunday morning.
299693	300314	We'll figure something out.
300634	304197	Sunday morning, bagels and V. We'll figure something out.
304237	304477	Maybe.
304497	305237	If I'm back in time.
305377	305698	We'll see.
306218	309420	We'll get jelly donuts and pretend that they're hamsters.
309881	310181	Okay.
310822	312724	and watch our lizard people.
312944	313745	I would say this, though.
313926	315628	V would make a pretty kick-ass video game.
315668	315828	Spoiler!
315968	316830	They're lizards!
318512	320775	V would make a pretty kick-ass video game.
320815	321416	I think there was one.
322097	322898	Was there really?
322918	326202	I think that there was one on... I bet there was one on the Apple IIe or some shit.
326543	327264	That's what I want to say.
327304	328025	Let me find out.
328442	329883	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
354625	356866	Well, I actually did not play any well.
357246	359506	Because, again, I have to remind myself that I still have the game.
360687	361627	Actually, no, I take that back.
361767	362667	I did pull it up.
362907	365228	And then I had to go somewhere.
365408	366768	I played some Sims.
369129	373030	I've watched Dan play through some Modern Warfare 2 and ODST.
373430	375470	And he got these awesome headphones.
375670	376150	I love them.
376170	378371	They're the best present he ever got himself for me.
379271	382372	Because I can't hear a damn thing that's going on on the TV when I'm trying to sleep.
383701	400442	No subwoofer going BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM Whenever I'm trying to go to bed Especially now since I have to go back to being at work at 6am But I've been playing a lot of Peggle I've actually really gotten back into playing a lot of Solitaire
401311	408557	I'm trying to learn how to play the Baker's Game on Solitaire and Spider Solitaire, which I kind of don't like.
409058	410118	And now I'm crocheting.
410659	412961	Isn't Spider Solitaire included with Windows XP?
413281	414202	Yeah, but whatever.
416544	418165	They only have themselves to blame.
418245	419506	They should have called it Solitaire 2.
420396	426264	I also... Now this is something I'm going to try to do because it is kind of gaming related since I miss playing Breakout on my Linux box.
427165	429268	Because you can play Break... You can just download it.
430530	434395	I sent my laptop back to be fixed and I swear if they put that Windows shit back on it...
435516	442240	I am going to start off that laptop booting Linux, installing Linux, and then asking them for a refund of my Windows license.
442340	443281	I found out you can do that.
443741	463613	If you never boot up Windows, when you order anything from Dell and put in a different OS on it, you can put in, as long as you've got proof and everything, you can put in for a refund of your Windows license so that you do not have to, if you're not paying for Windows, if you're not using Windows, why should you have to pay for it?
464194	464594	Interesting.
465811	468232	I just always assumed because it was part of what you were buying.
469072	471613	Sometimes you buy maybe a bundle of movies.
472313	478615	For instance, recently I bought the Star Trek Next Generation bundle of Blu-rays because I wanted all the movies on Blu-ray.
479355	483857	I didn't really need Nemesis, but it just comes with it, so I might as well take it, right?
484597	492740	That's kind of a different thing because you pay, I think, $150 for a Windows license when you get Vista.
494160	495781	and Vista XP.
495901	496901	XP came on my laptop.
497381	497961	I didn't use it.
498962	500302	I actually, I never used it.
500842	501702	Quick side question.
501922	503243	What do you think of Google OS?
503263	504723	Because there was a lot of news about that this week.
504803	505703	I'm not using that shit.
505743	506624	Kind of based on Linux.
506664	506904	Really?
507564	508744	It looked interesting.
509225	514046	I think what they're going for with the whole netbook thing, I could not see myself using it on a desktop.
515330	519493	I might give it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I am as happy as I could humanly be with Linux Mint on my laptop.
534264	534604	DarkSakura.com
556781	558121	I remember that was funny.
558261	563403	But no, in this case, it's like you could have multiple monitors hooked up or you could just go slide.
564043	568905	Hold it down and slide it over and it's like, gives you a little arrow, pick your desktop.
568965	570305	You can have it show up in a cube.
570965	572986	So you can rotate your cube and pick the screen that you want.
573527	575088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
602267	602367	Doom
620641	632351	Doom and Doom 2 they opened the source code so they actually have them on Linux and so I was thinking about going back into Hurt Me Plenty mode just because I love the name of Hurt Me Plenty and Ultraviolence
633291	633571	All right.
633992	634692	Comments from chat.
634752	637054	Got to start reading some comments from chat because there's some good stuff here.
653206	654466	They built this into the app now.
654506	658627	If you click on the schedule button, connect to chat, there's a new function.
658647	660548	Now, allgames.com has their own chat room.
660588	662668	And for whatever reason, I can't even explain this.
663368	664908	It's a historical thing.
664928	665188	I don't know.
665208	667049	We have our separate chat room from Orange Lounge Radio.
667289	668849	But they actually built it into their chat room.
668869	671850	So if you type slash OLR, you join our chat room.
672330	672790	Isn't that neat?
673370	674790	I thought that was very cool and they didn't have to do that.
674850	677911	So whatever you want to do to connect to the chat room, do it.
678371	682152	I think I might have to just randomly hop into the chat room while I'm at work.
682392	685993	I got Linux Mint because of Jamie and so did my best friend and it's a great alternate OS even for us PC gamers
699358	701600	So there you go, a little endorsement there.
701660	717255	Another thing too that I really like, since we're kind of on the subject of games and Linux Mint, is that a lot of PC and Mac environment stuff, they actually do have clients that you can run within Mint to sort of emulate Windows.
718036	718516	Basically,
719577	748107	I'm trying to remember what exactly it's called I want to say the wine environment and there's a few others but like I've seen screenshots of people playing you know Sims on Linux and so there's all kinds of ways around it so you can actually I think with Linux you can have the best of all the worlds but the best thing about it is that you really don't run into having to worry about spyware or all this other crap because people are like well fuck it's Linux who uses that
748928	753311	And I got to say this, Linux Mint, it's a nice little friendly sounding name too.
753351	758115	It's much more friendly than say like Linux Anchovies or Linux Meatloaf or Turkey Surprise.
758155	768843	Another good thing about it is that it is made understanding that you're going to have users coming from Windows or Mac backgrounds and that it's very easy.
768903	772906	In fact, when you have to do a kernel update, I've done two kernel updates and it's
773466	774066	Freaking easy.
774786	779948	And if you have a problem with one, you have the option when you boot up of picking an earlier kernel so you can go back and modify it.
780828	787430	So if you get something that may say, oh, well, we'll optimize your memory better, then you can download that one and run it.
787890	791571	Or we'll optimize your graphics better, then you can download that one and run it.
791631	792691	It depends on what you want to do.
792771	794692	It's like super customizable.
795652	795992	I love it.
796539	797760	Alright, other comments from our chatroom.
797920	806665	TigerClaw was unable to find anything on a V video game, so I'm convinced it doesn't exist, because TigerClaw has the best Google Foo skills of, I think, any of our listeners.
807385	810287	However, uh-oh, Jamie's ready to throw down.
810647	823714	But, TigerClaw does say, I saw a Q&A from the VentureBeat site about video game creator Jace Hall, and it does mention about a potential video game based on V. And he links to an article over there in our chatroom.
824014	824975	So, there you go.
825515	826657	All right, more gaming weeks.
826757	828900	Loki, how was your gaming week?
829001	829702	Still very slow.
830203	834990	Just playing Grand Theft Auto still.
838186	840447	Actually, haven't really played a lot of other stuff.
840767	848288	Still trying to get a chance to play Borderlands, but I keep getting distracted by working on the arcade cabinet, which is coming along quite well.
848348	854010	It's actually... I got all the ROMs on there, all the themes I could find for Hyper Spin on there.
854470	863532	Now, I was actually this morning going through and taking out some of the themes that are for clones and stuff like that, because I'm...
864312	871547	I'm going to try once I get everything on there because I just kind of downloaded all the ROMs for MAME all at once because I didn't know really what I wanted.
872008	873732	So I'm just like, okay, I'll just get everything.
873872	874533	Makes it simple.
876767	877327	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
902723	916486	That's why I started today and just had to compile a new version of MAME that actually gets rid of the NAG screen and that kind of stuff.
917207	918707	But I got to test a few things out.
918767	921568	I tested a little bit of Street Fighter this weekend.
921688	928669	I tried a little bit of King of Fighters because I'm trying to do a different setup for my Neo Geo stuff.
930130	930310	And...
931949	934890	I don't know, it all seems to play very nice, so that'll be cool.
936050	943332	Just really kind of working on that for now, I guess, until I, I don't know, move on to something else.
944513	947194	Hold on, Jamie wants to butt in here, because Jamie, what'd you find?
947314	948554	You found something on the internets?
948908	950548	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
977933	980115	And then... Funny.
980956	984519	And then there was this one, also in the ZX Spectrum 48k.
985880	989062	But the one in 1986 was the better of them.
991804	993406	I will link this other link in the chatroom.
993986	994266	Alright.
994307	997049	Because it has the picture of the lizard person face.
997418	999620	Better luck next time to our dear pal, Tigerclaw.
999820	1000080	Alright.
1000560	1001081	Sorry, Loki.
1001121	1002141	Anything else for your gaming week?
1002342	1003502	No, that's pretty much it.
1003642	1003803	Yeah.
1004103	1004363	Alright.
1004923	1006965	My gaming week was more of the same.
1007005	1010487	I've still been playing WoW and all that other crap I play week in and week out.
1010547	1017372	But I did spend some quality time with a new game that I decided to check out this week based on some happy, positive things I was reading around the internet.
1017392	1024177	And that game is Torchlight, which is a game that is by some of the team that worked on Diablo and Diablo 2 back in the day.
1025698	1026178	Diablo Xenoblade
1047864	1049144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1070526	1071727	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1097007	1112977	and then you can step it up to basically you know hurt me plenty and so forth like there is in Doom although of course they're called other things in this game you know again I honestly I couldn't even really pay attention to what the plot was in the game because I just kept thinking this is this is so much like Diablo but it feels like you know kind of like a new
1114221	1114862	Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 5
1129221	1135182	I think it's worth just trying the demo, because the demo will entertain you for like two hours at least, and it's free.
1135582	1137423	So go grab it on Steam and see if you like it.
1137463	1138323	You've got no reason not to.
1138983	1148785	Again, I really want to encourage, even though the game does have its drawbacks, that there's no multiplayer, and that was what made Diablo 2 such a huge thing, for $20, the value is awesome.
1148805	1151206	Because Diablo 2, they still charge...
1152128	1153149	Thanks for watching!
1172543	1174424	I'm going to co-host a radio show about video games.
1174464	1175965	I probably need to make sure I play a lot of games.
1176446	1184971	But it can be an expensive habit because remember, video games, unlike your favorite websites out there, video game companies do not send copies of games to us for free.
1185111	1185792	Very rarely.
1185832	1187373	It's happened before, but very rarely.
1188173	1196039	So usually that type of game playing is coming out of our own pockets and the economy is taking its toll on us here at OLR just like it has anyone else.
1196499	1198300	So we'll try our best though.
1198741	1201542	We certainly will try to play as many demos and all that fun stuff as we can.
1202483	1202654	Thanks for watching!
1203786	1204287	Let's see.
1204947	1211251	Questions from the chat room at chat.orangezonsradio.com Ricky GoMac asks, does WoW work on a Mac?
1211812	1212772	Yes, it works on a Mac.
1212792	1213913	World of Warcraft works on a Mac.
1213933	1220117	In fact, Blizzard is one of those companies that's always been very good about getting their games to work on PC and Mac.
1220157	1222379	I want to say, I don't know so much about Diablo.
1222399	1228583	I can't state for sure that one, but I think like Warcraft 3 plays on both and all the future WoW expansions play on both.
1228883	1229444	So there you go.
1230424	1232906	Deekman in chat says, loving Torchlight.
1233506	1236008	It's the first Diablo-like game I've ever liked.
1237309	1248037	Before we get into gaming news tonight, and speaking of Deekman, I do want to take a minute to acknowledge and further thank the masterminds behind our website, and that's Deekman and VXJasonXV.
1248097	1250258	They both do kind of separate stuff for our website.
1250559	1255983	VXJasonXV kind of does the server admin stuff, whereas Deekman's kind of like in charge of the actual website itself.
1256483	1257344	And both of them...
1258024	1258344	DarkSakura
1278373	1278733	Album Art for Us
1298274	1319989	that's great because I was just thinking earlier this evening and to segue into this we now have a Facebook fan page an official Facebook fan page is out there now although we've always had a Facebook group um Facebook about a year ago we really should have jumped on this when it first started made it a lot easier to make like a fan page where we can deliver updates to your feed and we promise we're not going to spam like crazy you know we'll do it tastefully uh
1320089	1327330	and just kind of have a central hub that I think will work a little more better functionality-wise to have like an OLR fan page.
1327350	1335872	So we've added that on Facebook and we're trying to get up to 100 fans because once we get 100 fans, that's when our little like, that's when we move into the next stage of having a fan page.
1335892	1338192	We can have like a short URL and all the statistics.
1338532	1340933	It's kind of like in Spore, how you have different levels.
1341053	1344793	You know, your little cell becomes a living creature.
1345093	1346354	See, we're in the cell game right now.
1346434	1347194	Once we get up to 100 fans,
1348174	1349776	fans will actually get to build a creature.
1349916	1350977	That's basically what we're waiting for.
1351258	1352219	So check that out on Facebook.
1352680	1353320	It's awful.
1353380	1354542	It's awful, awful, awful.
1354642	1361270	I was such a big Dragon Ball Z fan back in the day that when you said Cell Game, I instantly started thinking of that.
1362331	1363232	No, not Cell Shaded.
1363513	1364694	But you know the game that's like Flow?
1364754	1365435	No, Cell Game.
1365535	1367017	There was a whole arc called the Cell Game.
1367117	1367437	Oh, okay.
1367457	1367698	Gotcha.
1368464	1370085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1398704	1403127	Yeah, I'm considering ripping off one of my favorite bands.
1404807	1409010	TigerClaw in chat says, it won't be long until someone makes an official OLR iPhone app.
1409030	1411831	You know, I don't have the first idea how to do something like that.
1411991	1418615	But hey, if you're interested in that sort of thing, you're into development, we can give it our blessing.
1418675	1422097	Just show us what your ideas are and we'll help promote the crap out of it.
1423077	1426319	All we ask is that it's a free app because, you know, the show's free.
1426599	1431341	So we'll have to figure out other ways to pay you, such as love and adoration.
1431361	1431661	I don't know.
1432282	1432822	Anyhow.
1433422	1433622	Porn.
1433642	1434483	We will pay you in porn.
1434523	1435343	We'll pay you in porn.
1436183	1437124	Tribble porn.
1439185	1440225	What the hell is wrong with you?
1440345	1441626	Tribble porn is just watching them eat.
1442646	1444528	I think that's all the housekeeping I wanted to get into tonight.
1444568	1447751	Facebook fan page, which I'll link in chat shortly if someone else hasn't already done it.
1448331	1449432	And all that fun stuff.
1450153	1451614	And Twitter, of course, we're on there.
1451714	1453616	OLR and all that great stuff.
1453916	1454857	Let's get on.
1455437	1456318	Did you drop your yarn?
1457486	1458767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1478446	1481388	Well, we had some updates from Sony Online.
1481408	1488491	They were covering the PlayStation Network in a big ol' presentation, which of course they put out on the internet as well.
1491226	1498952	There's some interesting changes that they're talking about making and some other ways they're planning on expanding the Sony online brand.
1499893	1505378	One of the things that they're planning on doing, of course, is expanding the PlayStation Network infrastructure to non-gaming devices.
1505858	1519549	And what that means is you may see connectivity with, say, Sony-branded TVs, perhaps, Sony VAIO computers, who knows, mobile devices, possibly Sony phones.
1520845	1524348	So, you know, it's interesting, I guess.
1525309	1527931	And they're going to try to kind of connect everything together that way.
1528571	1536558	I'm always wondering if they should just change the name of the PlayStation Network since, you know, like maybe Sony Online Network or something like that.
1537439	1537719	I don't know.
1538960	1548428	One of the other things that's also going on is they're trying to also kind of create a brand with this, you know, online network as well.
1549388	1549569	And...
1551141	1562889	They're saying that one of the major selling points of the PlayStation Network is also all the features like downloading games, music, and movies and whatnot.
1563490	1571815	And they're thinking that expanding that to all their devices would be a good value for the customers.
1571895	1578920	Kind of a little bit like how iTunes works and stuff where you can download stuff to your... What is it?
1578960	1579040	The...
1580509	1585232	I think your media center for iPhone... Apple TV, is that what they call it?
1585272	1586233	Yeah.
1586313	1587474	You can download stuff to that.
1587834	1589696	I don't know.
1590649	1591349	It's interesting.
1592629	1596991	Well, I mean, this is Sony's whole thing this year is this whole it only does everything.
1597271	1602472	Well, that whole thing, it only does everything, you know, is that they're trying to sell this machine based on only game.
1602492	1604052	It will not make me waffles.
1604812	1605353	I've tried.
1605673	1607733	It looks like a Foreman grill and it doesn't make me waffles.
1607753	1610474	It does look like a Foreman grill, so it'll at least look like a grill.
1610494	1611494	But not so much now, though.
1611554	1612554	It's slightly slimmer.
1612594	1614635	It's like a Foreman slim, you know.
1615655	1622197	But this is their whole marketing thing this year, which, you know, to be fair, we've given Sony its fair share of shit on this show.
1622657	1631219	And, you know, like I always say, and like we always say, we will razz a gaming company when they deserve to get razzed, but we'll give them praise when they deserve to get praised.
1631520	1633860	And I think Sony is finally getting it this year.
1633980	1642123	You know, they've done a lot of smart things this year, and one of them is this whole It Only Does Everything campaign, because I think that's really the PlayStation 3 strength.
1642163	1643403	I think it really does do everything.
1644745	1645807	I want it to play good games.
1648532	1649393	Which it doesn't really do.
1649754	1651156	No, there's a lot of good games on PlayStation 3.
1651537	1651898	I don't know.
1652218	1654081	It doesn't do everything, but it does do a lot.
1654222	1654442	So...
1655259	1656599	I want it to do things well.
1657100	1662981	I still say Blu-ray is worth more weight than I think a lot of people gives it credit for.
1663021	1664362	I'm not trying to be a Sony fanboy.
1665422	1668063	All I use my PS3 for is the Blu-ray.
1668663	1673504	It doesn't have any games on it that are really good that we can't already get on Xbox 360.
1673564	1678646	LittleBigPlanet, Demon's Souls, some of the PlayStation Network games like Fat Princess, PixelJunk.
1680151	1680431	Oh my god.
1680451	1682673	That was my favorite game that came out last year.
1699011	1702413	But then now, a few years later, like, hey, wait a second, I just bought a bunch of DVDs.
1702573	1703874	Why am I going to go buy Blu-rays?
1704255	1705976	So they haven't really adopted it as much.
1706176	1715122	It does help sell the system, but it's also not really something that kind of, I don't know, it's not a huge driving force for it.
1715765	1722669	Well, on top of that, you can also, for people who want a Blu-ray player, you can get better Blu-ray players for cheaper than a PS3 costs.
1722950	1731855	But, that being said though, it's a lot easier to update your Blu-ray player or even with the PlayStation 3 firmwares and stuff.
1732436	1739300	I hear a lot of complaints from people, oh yeah, I bought this Blu-ray disc and I went and popped it into my player and I need a new firmware update.
1740046	1740666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1760579	1763841	and I'm thinking, well, that's cool for people that want to get into Blu-ray.
1764161	1769505	You know, certainly that's much cheaper than a PlayStation 3, but I'm thinking in the back of my mind, does this thing connect to the internet?
1769905	1771126	Is it going to have Blu-ray Live?
1771666	1775228	And you know, granted, how many people really use that Blu-ray Live stuff?
1775288	1776149	Probably a minority.
1776249	1785495	So, you know, the average family will probably be able to do just fine with this player without it, but you make a good point about the firmware, is that unlike DVDs,
1786215	1786656	Thanks for watching!
1802336	1802877	and DarkSakura.com.
1826075	1835497	I don't think they're going to just all of a sudden change the whole service to being paid, but there may be certain aspects, optional aspects that you may have to pay for later on down the road.
1836038	1840379	But of course, they haven't announced anything officially yet, but it's something that's probably going to come.
1840879	1849081	And then finally, Sony's expecting the PlayStation Network to pull in 50 billion yen in their 2009 financial year.
1849921	1861989	and of course they're saying that right now they've got 33 million registered accounts on the PlayStation Network which is a lot more than they have actual systems out there so of course people have multiple accounts because you can make as many as you want.
1862349	1862870	I have four.
1865672	1877580	They have a high ratio of active users about 5.4 million daily unique user sign-ins and 1.4 million daily PlayStation Store visits.
1878575	1882542	And of course, downloading volume has been increasing.
1883583	1885186	25 petabyte downloads a month.
1886148	1887390	That's a lot of downloads.
1888492	1892058	And of course, their digital sales is really growing.
1894520	1895841	Go into some comments from our chatroom.
1895881	1897961	DJ Ranma S is actually correcting me.
1898082	1902303	The Black Friday Magnavox player that's at Walmart, $78, not $98.
1903304	1904884	It's a good price.
1905365	1906785	It's not bad at all for a Blu-ray player.
1906805	1910127	You have to make sure it's a good...
1911483	1913464	And, you know, it's going to be bottom of the barrel if it's $78.
1913624	1914324	Let's face it.
1914424	1914745	Come on.
1914805	1915645	I mean, get what you pay for.
1916205	1919247	GameGuru says in chat, this firmware junk is going to kill Blu-ray.
1919587	1921748	It just makes Blu-ray more complicated than DVD.
1922248	1923709	You know, I got to be honest.
1924029	1929551	I don't know if I see it that same way because I don't, you know, that whole firmware thing is not very well advertised.
1929611	1930652	I think a lot of people don't know.
1931092	1933313	You know, I put it in the same vein as HDTV.
1933333	1936074	That's even worse, though, if they don't know because then they're going to pop in.
1936134	1938295	Say they go rent a movie and they pop it in.
1938335	1939176	They're like, what the fuck?
1939216	1939916	I can't play it.
1940877	1941898	and then they're pissed off.
1942459	1944161	Yeah, but they've already bought the Blu-ray player.
1944942	1945563	It doesn't matter.
1945603	1949928	They're still pissed off, though, and now they're just like, fuck it, I'm just going to buy my movies on DVD.
1951090	1952712	Well, okay, my other thought, though, is that...
1954881	1955861	The HDTVs.
1956521	1960082	You know, a lot of these, this is going to be a huge thing this holiday season too, is HDTVs.
1960102	1963983	And you see this in a lot of Black Friday ads, is that HDTVs are coming as low as like $200, $300.
1965483	1971785	But what a lot of people don't realize about those very cheap HDTVs is that a lot of them are 720p.
1972385	1977026	Those TVs are only capable of 720p, which is considered high def.
1977646	1981507	And to most people, they're probably never going to notice the difference.
1981547	1982107	Like, Grandma...
1983127	1986750	is going to notice the difference from her old TV, but she's not going to know that she's missing 1080.
1988531	1990152	She's not going to notice that that's missing.
1990512	1997617	Like, for instance, even the HDTV I own, because I adopted kind of early and still try to keep it cheap, my HDTV won't do 1080p.
1997977	2000119	It'll do 1080i, but it won't do 1080p.
2000579	2004762	And I'm kind of at that point where I'm like, dang, I wish I'd gotten a TV that did 1080p.
2004922	2009665	Honestly, you're not going to be able to tell unless your TV is like 60 inches and, I mean... Which it's not.
2009785	2012467	And so that's why I haven't replaced it, but, you know.
2014249	2027977	But the reason why I bring that up, I think a lot of people that go out and buy these deals and buy these TVs don't know that what they're getting is not the, I guess you could say, quote, quote, real high def or the high, high def or whatever you want to call it.
2028897	2031518	And, you know, folks in chat are saying, do you really need 1080p?
2032099	2032479	I don't know.
2032979	2033940	Maybe I'm just weird.
2034040	2036401	I can tell the difference, but just barely, but I can tell.
2037643	2038944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2060683	2061083	PSP, PSP, PSP, PSP
2088516	2089037	and so forth.
2089077	2090198	Japan will get their manga service very soon.
2103433	2104294	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2119773	2123994	PS3, I would say, got a significantly bigger update, unless, of course, you're a big comics book fan.
2124775	2138940	PlayStation 3 got firmware 3.10, and some of the big changes they made in this is that now you can pick a color for your little friends card, or whatever they call it, and that's also what shows up in the bar as you scroll through your friends list, and you can elect your own color.
2139820	2144662	This took me a little while to find how to do this, so just a tip from me to you.
2145362	2149083	Go in and view your own card on your own friends list.
2149563	2152303	And then you'll notice on the side is a little color swatch thing.
2152623	2155744	And you can pick that, and you can pick between 20 different colors.
2157484	2162505	I picked green, of course, because my PlayStation 3 name is Green Sky, so it would make sense to pick green.
2163425	2165226	And then some other folks picked other colors.
2165586	2167226	I see my friends list filling up with colors.
2167566	2171227	And of course, the other big, big change is that they now have Facebook integration.
2171987	2172107	And
2173147	2179410	This is where now you can't really view Facebook on your PlayStation 3 unless it's through the web browser.
2179430	2183272	And they do say they made changes or updates to the web browser to make Facebook more friendly.
2183612	2187134	But don't expect to see it streamlined in your cross-media bar or anything.
2187554	2191596	No, I would say your PlayStation 3 will now serve as Bejeweled Blitz.
2192096	2193777	Farmville, Mafia Wars.
2194198	2195979	It will now publish to your profile.
2196340	2200964	The nice thing is, though, there are different settings, so you can set it, and you can turn them on or off, whatever it's going to do.
2201344	2204647	So you can set it to publish trophies to your profile.
2204687	2206008	I think that's the one I have turned on.
2206769	2212233	You can set it to publish whenever you download things from the store to your profile, and that would include demos.
2212273	2214535	I turned that one off because that's kind of private.
2214555	2215096	I don't want anybody...
2215316	2215396	Porn!
2215416	2215536	Yeah.
2243194	2244235	More stuff for me to block.
2245135	2246376	And that's what a lot of people are saying.
2246416	2247397	More stuff for me to hide.
2248938	2253842	I went ahead and turned on the trophies because I said, okay, this isn't much different from the Bejeweled Blitz trophies.
2253882	2256484	And if people are going to publish those, then I can publish my trophies.
2256564	2258005	But the rest of it I turned off for now.
2259583	2267688	By the way, also, one other non-advertised update in firmware 3.10, now you can actually report your errors directly to Sony.
2268228	2275933	Kind of like when your Windows system crashes in a program, you can click a button to submit information to Microsoft, that whole type of thing is built into your PS3.
2276553	2285439	It's been hard for a lot of the gaming blogs to test, because you can't really force your PlayStation 3 to crash very easy, but Sony assures that that functionality is in there.
2285839	2286900	So maybe you'll hear more about that later.
2287320	2292623	Also not widely talked about, there is a new photo application that you can download into your media bar.
2293304	2297867	I haven't played a whole lot with this, but it basically kicks your photo viewing up to the next level.
2298247	2300208	It does some different things with the gallery and the viewing.
2301609	2308954	And one feature of your PlayStation 3, maybe you've never thought of before, you could have it cycle through photographs while you're at a party or something and be a virtual picture frame.
2309594	2310195	If you're into that.
2310295	2310575	I don't know.
2310635	2314878	Not everybody wants to show off their pictures like that, but just an idea.
2315518	2316219	of how you could use that.
2317099	2319681	So lots of updates to the various Sony platforms this week.
2320402	2324965	Well, in Virtual Console there's been some updates that I'm pretty sure are making people happy.
2325973	2332177	Coming on the 23rd, we get to see the SNES Mario Kart for 800 points.
2332397	2333538	That's pretty cool.
2335499	2337981	I guess they're trying to give us more things to be thankful for.
2338621	2347647	Also coming out, even though there's not a date for it, is the SNES version of Pilotwings and the N64 Smash Bros.
2348868	2351489	Prices and dates are pending.
2354712	2355252	That's pretty cool.
2355902	2358584	Do you guys notice a trend here with Nintendo like in the past month?
2358644	2364388	I don't know if anyone else has picked up on this, but they've been really trying to do a lot of this fan service in the past month.
2364428	2368230	And I'm not sure if this has any correlation to the holidays or what's going on.
2368631	2370091	Loki, I'd be curious your thought on this.
2370512	2371052	I mean, look at this.
2371072	2374154	You have all these fan games they're promising to deliver now.
2374214	2376976	All the games we've been wanting since Virtual Console first launched.
2377316	2379698	Pilotwings, Mario Kart, Smash Bros., etc.
2380578	2382900	And, you know, we just got Final Fantasy last month and so forth.
2383160	2385402	We're getting a lot of these big, big games on Virtual Console.
2386342	2394626	and we're finally seeing awesome updates to 8-bit games like we wish they'd done a long time ago with Excitebike.
2395486	2398508	And finally, demos for WiiWare games.
2399608	2402109	All this happening in the past two months.
2402730	2403190	What gives?
2404352	2416417	Well, I think it's just about time that they put them on there and also just some stuff for Christmas that kind of people, you know, get people interested, especially people that just buy new systems, you know, they get them interested in what's coming out.
2417037	2422199	So maybe to kind of entice these people that are jumping ship to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this Christmas.
2422219	2425261	I think it's just a matter of time that they've released this stuff.
2425481	2425821	I don't know.
2427845	2432969	Comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com Actdeft says, yeah, Super Mario Kart, Pilotwings sucks though.
2433630	2435131	Bite your tongue, I love Pilotwings.
2435191	2437252	Now, didn't they have Pilotwings 64 on there?
2438353	2439894	I don't know if that's on Virtual Console.
2439914	2441856	I have yet to check that out, if it's there.
2441956	2443477	I never played Pilotwings 64.
2443877	2445078	I just remember the old school one.
2445098	2447700	That was a launch title on Super Nintendo, if I remember right.
2447720	2449681	They should do some new, like, Mario Kart games.
2449701	2454385	Like, do a new Mario Kart game done the Super NES way or something like that with, like, you know.
2455185	2455866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2473795	2474795	I love Pilotwings.
2474935	2482538	Even though there was only maybe five or six different sports you could do in there, the game went on for a while, and it was a very, very hard game.
2484098	2484959	I loved Pilotwings.
2485199	2486879	That was one of the best Super Nintendo games.
2487019	2489460	I think that's one I don't have, actually.
2489500	2493821	The launch games on Super Nintendo all held up really freaking well.
2494281	2500102	Like, amongst almost any console I can think of, I think the Super Nintendo has had some of the best launch titles.
2500142	2500682	I mean, think about it.
2500742	2505523	Mario World, F- No, actually, I don't think Mario World technically launched for the console.
2505843	2507684	If I remember right, that came out a couple weeks later.
2507944	2508764	It was a holiday bundle.
2508984	2512605	I think the only games that launched with the system were F-Zero and Pilotwings.
2513365	2514525	I could be wrong on that.
2515245	2516626	It's been many, many years.
2516646	2519847	It's been a good 15-some-odd years since that console launched.
2520307	2524589	But I seem to recall that F-Zero and Pilotwings were the launch titles.
2525429	2527430	And they were both awesome, awesome games.
2529370	2531511	Loki, let's move on with some more news.
2532011	2533852	Yes, and it's kind of funny, though.
2533872	2534292	No, we...
2536872	2537672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2553579	2562923	And of course, you know, as you would expect, because it is a PC title, hackers have already gotten their hands on it and have pretty much fixed the problems, actually.
2563783	2576729	They have actually enabled their own dedicated servers and also some other cheats or whatnot or fun stuff to play around with on the dedicated servers as well, including like super jumps, you know.
2577769	2581431	Infinite Ammo, Rapid Fire Grenades, all sorts of crazy stuff.
2581711	2586373	But it's actually pretty awesome, at least now that you can actually play your own dedicated servers.
2587213	2589794	And that should make a lot of fans happy as well.
2590095	2595137	In fact, I remember seeing they were showing the sales for the PC version of Modern Warfare 2.
2595277	2600959	And actually, it didn't seem like the sales were affected too much by any sort of boycott.
2600979	2601760	And that's kind of also...
2602833	2604135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2620094	2633979	and one of the other things that they've found out as well kind of with all the hacking and stuff is that there's some new game modes that haven't quite been unveiled yet possibly stuff that they're going to patch in later on including
2635735	2639477	New mode, VIP, which apparently is very similar to Counter-Strike.
2639877	2643638	Capture the flag with, I guess, a single flag between two teams.
2643738	2651542	And Global Thermonuclear War, which one side has to capture the nuke and hold it for a certain amount of time in order to win.
2652422	2655823	And, of course, this stuff you can enable using the...
2657384	2686714	Hacked In, Debug Console which is in there which is kind of cool and the thought is that this is going to come out later on as possible download content perhaps maybe even on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions as well so it makes sense that they would add value to it later on but it's kind of neat though that this stuff is already there I guess, I don't know, people don't like pay to unlock content too much but if this is going to be a free patch later on that might be kind of cool
2687179	2688639	But if we gotta pay for it, that kinda sucks.
2689600	2689900	I don't know.
2690180	2696421	Didn't we already kinda suspect that this was where the game was going, is that we're gonna have to pay for all this extra stuff, which is why they locked it out in the first place?
2696661	2697621	Yeah.
2698802	2704603	And I kinda think it's funny, it only took them like a week or two to actually unlock all this stuff that's on there.
2704643	2715026	I mean, it just goes to show you, you piss people off enough, especially in the PC versions, you know, there's hackers out there that will find a way around it to get the game to do what they want.
2715326	2716586	And, you know, that kind of
2717369	2718830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2741289	2757391	and it's just one of those things with the technology the way it is now it's just not possible it is not possible to keep this stuff hidden from hackers especially you know and a lot of this sometimes comes to you know I hate to revisit a topic that's years old but I think it's partially relevant
2758112	2759152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2782942	2787245	and lo and behold, if you left the data on the disk, it was going to be discovered.
2787445	2789307	All a hacker had to do was put that pointer back in.
2789467	2790307	And go into Rockstar.
2790327	2795191	I mean, all their stuff's kind of lazy coding anyways because everything is in text files.
2795711	2797032	They're easily editable.
2798313	2798773	I should know.
2799274	2804077	If you want something taken out of your game, you have to take it out of the game.
2804457	2805138	It's crazy.
2807336	2809477	Toa Gak and Chad ask a question.
2809978	2813579	Wasn't there like porno hidden on a disc for some console and the author got sued?
2813940	2814540	I don't remember.
2815320	2827687	There was one, I think it was like Bloody Roar 2 on the PlayStation 1 had some sort of like erotic pictures or something like that of the actual characters or something like that in there.
2828507	2830388	I want to say that was the game that had that.
2830408	2835051	And then of course there was, you know, SimCopter with all the, you know, gay sex or whatever.
2835071	2835191	Yeah.
2835931	2836751	Oh yeah, I remember.
2836791	2838312	No, SimTower, wasn't it?
2838352	2838992	No, SimCopter.
2839012	2839492	Was it Copter?
2839953	2840233	Yeah.
2840893	2841153	Funny.
2842414	2844674	Well, anyhow, moving on to something not so funny.
2845315	2849016	Lawsuits, and what some might actually consider a frivolous lawsuit.
2849096	2849476	I don't know.
2849536	2850297	You be the judge.
2851117	2854918	Apparently, there is a law firm out there, Abington IP.
2855378	2858580	They're investigating what they call a convenient...
2859500	2861121	Waves of Xbox Live Bannings
2879734	2889338	and well after Halo 3 ODST came out this was to make Microsoft as much money as possible because clearly that was the motivation behind this whole thing.
2905643	2916285	Now, this is weird because they're trying to do this class action lawsuit here that apparently they're going to try and get a refund for the pro-rated what was left on your Xbox Live subscription.
2916445	2918886	But it's weird because they didn't really ban the accounts, did they?
2919166	2921026	No, and that's the thing is they didn't understand it.
2921066	2933449	What they thought was their thinking behind it is that people expecting to play these games online or whatever bought more of a subscription for their accounts in preparation for these new games coming out.
2933849	2958676	And because of that, then Microsoft went ahead and decided to ban consoles Well, they're totally ignoring the fact that, one, these people modded their consoles in the first place So, you know, they're responsible for it You know, they need to know what's going on and, you know I mean, come on, if you mod your console, you know at one point or another Especially if you're playing it online, that you're going to get banned eventually
2959537	2965242	By the way, Microsoft responded this week, or just actually today, I should say, made a response to this whole thing.
2966083	2972609	Basically, to sum it all up, they say that they have every legal recourse to do what they did.
2972649	2974070	They were well within their legal rights.
2974110	2974551	That's a quote.
2974631	2976032	Well within their legal rights.
2976252	2976793	Of course they were.
2976853	2981937	And that's why this whole thing is really retarded because, once again, they aren't banning their live accounts.
2981957	2984700	They're just banning the console from connecting on live.
2985400	2997545	And at the same time, kind of removing a little bit of the features of the console, but nothing major, like you can't install your games to the hard drive anymore, which, whatever, that's fine.
2998306	3009250	And also that, obviously the console can't connect to the live anymore, and you can't take your profile from the console or whatever to earn achievements offline and then move them and connect them online, whatever, because it's corrupt.
3009730	3010931	Although there is a workaround for that.
3011691	3028037	but isn't this all in the agreements that you accept when you play games that you're not going to fuck around if you have your console modded you're playing burned games whether it be a backup of your game whether it be a modded copy of the game or a pirated version of the game you're playing burned games and that's unfortunately you know
3028757	3030077	They're just assuming that you're a pirate.
3030678	3033919	And I mean, probably 99% of the people out there are pirating games.
3034239	3035439	Especially if their console's modded.
3035859	3041501	Now what sucks is the people that say didn't know their console's modded, bought it, used, and then they get banned.
3041721	3042441	That kind of sucks.
3042841	3049303	But then again, once it, you know... But that would be a reason to sue where you bought it from, not a reason to sue Microsoft.
3049343	3049664	Exactly.
3049684	3050284	Buyer beware.
3050564	3057006	Buyer beware, and then... Although I'm sure, yeah, and I'm sure a lot of these used places probably have clauses in their contracts too that protect them.
3057762	3063526	Yeah, and people also trying to return these consoles, you know, to stores or whatever, trying to exchange them out for a good one.
3064087	3069751	Of course, you know, if that security seal is tampered with that, you know, you can't return it.
3070271	3075115	Of course, you can always buy a new security seal to throw on top of it and then return it, but hey, that's another story.
3075155	3075695	Dirty, dirty.
3077932	3080914	But yeah, there's a lot of things out there that you can do.
3081034	3084637	But really, it comes down to it's the user's fault.
3084717	3086078	They knew what they were getting into.
3086438	3087459	And you know what?
3087899	3091362	If you really want to go legit and buy another console, you can do that.
3091502	3095865	And then you can take your account, restore your account to the new console, and you're good to go.
3096645	3099567	I had two consoles banned this week.
3100248	3102990	We used to play modded Grand Theft Auto games.
3103730	3105572	So all four of our consoles are modded.
3106272	3108294	So far though, only two of them have been banned.
3108534	3109094	And that's fine.
3109254	3113918	I mean, because I knew that was going to happen and we have preparations for that.
3114438	3121243	But the thing is, I went and bought a new console, restored my account, took like a few minutes, and I was good to go.
3121583	3123885	I mean, there's no real issues.
3123925	3127007	I mean, later on I have to actually go through there and change the...
3129443	3133227	So that all my download content works on my new console without being logged in live.
3133827	3136210	I'll eventually do that, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
3136730	3138732	This almost sounds like a game to you.
3139233	3141955	This whole getting around it and everything.
3142015	3143597	You're definitely not pissed off about this.
3143657	3144998	You knew the risks going into this.
3145319	3146620	I knew it was eventually going to happen.
3146780	3151765	We were playing a modified game, so basically all the stealth crap...
3152225	3163072	And to be clear, this is the number one reason why you're doing this in the first place, is not to pirate the games like crazy, but because you are modding the Grand Theft Auto games for lols.
3163352	3167454	And it's not something you typically take online, although it sounds like you did, and that's what got you in trouble.
3167474	3170856	Well, yeah, because we had to play, you know, we played against each other.
3170876	3172157	And you can only play that online.
3172177	3177060	If it was a System Link game, like say if I could do that with Saints Row, we would have never taken it online.
3177100	3178841	We would have just been playing, you know, via LANs.
3179281	3182662	and I wish I knew how to mod Saints Row 2 because I'd do that.
3183022	3184642	But we can't.
3186182	3190923	And that's also funny too because when our consoles got banned we played Saints Row 2 because we didn't have to connect to live.
3191183	3192524	We've got a backup game for everything.
3194784	3200205	So it's an inconvenience but I know what I'm getting into and whatever.
3200805	3202786	Luckily my first console got banned.
3202806	3204386	My sister has a modded console.
3204406	3206507	She doesn't play online because she doesn't have internet.
3207087	3207467	So I...
3209457	3223044	I get her games and I gave her a modded copy of Grand Theft Auto and she plays that, but hers is red-ringed and I haven't got a chance to fix it yet, so I just gave her my band console and it works just fine for her because she doesn't give a crap.
3223244	3226046	She doesn't know anything about connecting to live and whatnot.
3226366	3230088	She just wants to play a game where you fly around in a police car.
3230128	3234670	Quick question from Togak in our chatroom, chat.orange.com and I don't even know if he can answer this, Loki.
3235070	3236451	How do they know if your console is modded?
3236771	3238232	Has it been revealed how they're catching it?
3239074	3250839	Um, they, they can tell, basically, it doesn't matter how, if you're playing a burn game or not, because, you know, we, honestly, we haven't played Grand Theft Auto, the modded game, since...
3252111	3254233	August, I mean, whenever they patched it last.
3254913	3263699	They can tell because the modded firmwares or whatever, they don't return the same values for some of the security checks or whatever.
3263779	3274067	They aren't sure what exactly is going wrong, but there is something in there that is not returning the exact value or something when they're doing a check of the disk.
3274427	3276469	So they can tell what firmware you have on the drive.
3276509	3278410	They can't actually read the firmware on the drive,
3279256	3283559	They know, because they're fucking Microsoft
3301564	3303906	I got a quick question for you though, because you work in retail and all this stuff.
3304226	3308408	Have you had people try to return Xbox 360 consoles that have been banned to you?
3308809	3308869	No.
3308929	3310050	Do you have a way to catch them?
3310670	3313972	They know that I would pimp slap them.
3314272	3319095	You're well known in your retail company's business for pimp slapping people that try to do that.
3319135	3320737	For slapping the hoes.
3320837	3330483	Honestly enough, if somebody brought me a console that was banned, and I tested it, and it worked, since we don't connect the consoles to live as part of the test...
3331189	3339837	we wouldn't know but just take them to GameStop they can't fucking tell they're too stupid to be allowed to live
3341793	3346977	The views and opinions expressed by Dan do not necessarily reflect those of the staff at Warren's On Radio.
3346997	3347478	Yes, they do.
3348378	3353202	You can tell because what they do is they can connect to Xbox's website.
3353583	3360868	There's the whole repair thing that you can connect to, and you can actually put in your serial number and you'll see if your console's banned or not.
3361249	3366473	Because when you try to enter your console's serial number in there, it'll say, sorry, your console's banned, fuck you, and that type of stuff.
3367876	3369397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3394303	3404249	Steam actually now has approximately 70% of the overall digital distribution of PC games.
3405150	3407511	And that's actually quite a bit.
3408312	3418279	And they're actually saying that the other ones like Impulse is 10% and others combined are 20%.
3418879	3421381	So that's in terms of actual revenue.
3422668	3423548	It's pretty crazy stuff.
3444133	3447415	Half-Life, you know, all these huge PC games.
3447475	3450217	I mean, that's clearly got to be part of the contribution.
3450477	3455741	Whereas I think all these other companies don't quite have the same tie-in like Valve and Steam do.
3455941	3469109	Well, the other thing too is that they're also saying that a lot of the games integrate the Steamworks tools into their games early on so that they can lock them out from other distribution platforms.
3469589	3473312	And also, it's because of how successful their DRM solution is.
3473712	3475254	So, it's pretty big.
3475534	3483462	Yeah, because Steam's whole thing, and I haven't played a whole lot with this, but apparently it's very easy to take what you've kind of downloaded and go to another computer and install the software.
3483923	3488668	I don't think you could do it unlimited, but it gives you somewhat some freedom onto how many computers you can do this with.
3488688	3490029	Because it's set by your account.
3490109	3490750	Yeah, exactly.
3491491	3492191	My only thing is that...
3493052	3497476	My only complaint about Steam, being a long-time user of it, I'm not a big fan of the interface.
3498317	3502281	I kind of wish that demos were easier to find.
3503042	3507686	I don't know, the layout of the store is not exactly eye-catching or appealing to me.
3507786	3515153	I don't know, it's hard for me to put my finger on, but it's just not the most user-friendly front-end, the store anyway, to me.
3515894	3517635	I think it could be a little flashier.
3520012	3522974	I don't know if what I said makes any sense at all, but that's just kind of my thoughts on Steam.
3523015	3526278	It's kind of sometimes hard to find things.
3526758	3529401	Sometimes, yeah.
3530722	3536788	I think it tries to be cut and dried, but in some cases it does overcomplicate a few things just with the demo mixed in and everything.
3537489	3540272	You know, how they have everything just mixed in and you have to really filter it.
3541125	3543866	Bond in chat says they make you jump through hoops to get the demo.
3543906	3545827	And I think it's related to this.
3545907	3547727	Oh, talking about like audio surf specifically.
3548628	3550948	You know, I didn't have a hard time with the Torchlight demo at all.
3550988	3552449	There's a little button there on the side.
3552729	3555270	But I think it would be neat if they just kind of like just had a screen.
3555550	3557130	You know, new demos to check out.
3557751	3558391	You know, and I don't know.
3558451	3559251	Like, I don't know.
3559951	3561232	I would just lay it out a little differently.
3561272	3561612	That's all.
3562412	3585775	but otherwise I love the idea that they took that whole what was that other gaming platform that you could bring X game or something what was that called X something there was something that you could bring up inside other video games and chat with people yeah I remember the X-Fire X-Fire thank you that's what's called X-Fire they kind of molded that with a video game store and that I think was a smart idea so
3586883	3590006	Anyhow, those are my thoughts on Steam from being a user as long as I have.
3590306	3597853	By the way, there is an unofficial, well, no, it's really official, I guess, you know, because I'm on it and, you know, I don't think there's any other OLR groups.
3598253	3601296	And if you want the link to that, just go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3601316	3606440	There's a whole little box on the side where you'll see the Steam logo among other big websites like Facebook and Twitter.
3606760	3612345	And you can click that and join our Steam community.
3612365	3612806	It's pretty cool.
3613996	3615477	Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates
3644431	3649433	Hello Kitty Party, Fighting Fantasy on the DS as well.
3650253	3658455	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii with very little fanfare, Karaoke Revolution.
3659756	3660296	Hurrah.
3661356	3664897	Your Shape featuring Jenny McCarthy and it comes with a camera.
3664917	3667838	Wait, wasn't that supposed to be last week?
3667858	3669979	Because I seem to remember making fun of this game previously.
3671044	3674888	I think I may have talked about it last week, but yeah, it's being delayed.
3675708	3678291	Seeing it's Sparkle Vampire Edition coming out on the Wii.
3679812	3685797	Tekken 6 coming out on PSP and on PC Twin Sector.
3687599	3694545	And Rogue Trooper is being released on the Wii, kind of a port of the PlayStation 2 game.
3695926	3696407	And that's it.
3698001	3698522	Mushi Hi Messi...
3715157	3720842	Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari
3744401	3748244	So it looks like you only have this game in original mode and some upgrades to that as well.
3748264	3754748	This is a big release over there because there's a specific fighting stick coming out for it and all this stuff.
3754768	3757390	Sorry, shooter stick or whatever they call it coming out for this as well.
3757410	3757790	Arcade stick.
3758351	3760672	On the PlayStation 3, just some price reductions.
3760793	3764635	Fallout 3, Mercenaries 2, and Mirror's Edge get some price reductions this week.
3765016	3768078	Again, all of these games coming out on the 26th.
3769098	3772000	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii...
3773561	3778103	Uh, Naruto, Shippuden, Ryu Jinki comes out this week.
3778203	3781184	As well as, DarkSakura, Puyo Puyo Version 7.
3781424	3782165	Puyo Puyo!
3782305	3783545	I know you're a big fan of Puyo Puyo.
3783845	3786507	Sim Animals Africa also makes its way to Japan this week.
3786787	3788887	Um, sadly though, not a lot of big releases there.
3789708	3793789	.hack, the GU, uh, series is getting a big price reduction.
3793809	3797331	So if you haven't checked that out in Japan, now's your time to do that.
3797711	3820736	and that's on the PlayStation 2 on the DS, Cooking Mama 3 comes out in Japan this week yes, there's a third Cooking Mama game and it comes out this week in Japan as well as a game called Roller Angels go figure, and then lastly on the PSP this week Gakuen Heaven Boys Love Scramble Gakuen means high school
3821553	3828269	So that's what it's called Boys Love Scramble I'm not sure what type of game this is It's an adventure game
3829570	3830971	I do love scrambled eggs.
3831371	3832712	It's a Yowie game.
3832952	3834573	I was thinking, does boys love me?
3835474	3836475	And then the picture came up.
3836915	3839377	Oh yes, it is that kind of boy love.
3839797	3843959	So if you want a Yowie game, here's the week to get it on PSP.
3844280	3846001	Come on, Loki, look at that screenshot right there.
3846081	3847342	Tell me you're not interested in that game.
3847462	3848222	That's on the PSP.
3848282	3849823	I'm not interested in that game.
3850103	3852845	It's a dude nibbling on another dude's ear and he's all blushing.
3852865	3854206	Oh, well sign me up then.
3855547	3856027	No thanks.
3856267	3857248	I'll link that in chat.
3858601	3859582	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3882799	3887882	27th Just Dance, Karaoke Revolution, Lego Rock Band, Muramasa, The Demon Blade, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja 5, Resident Evil, The Dark Side Chronicles The End
3910492	3913918	Alright, back to more gaming news and then the Classic Game of the Week coming up in just a few minutes.
3914880	3916283	Yes, lots of fun stuff.
3918157	3918838	So it's interesting.
3919018	3927065	You may remember with the DS, Disney, they're doing something very similar to this called, I think, D-Gamer.
3927525	3934171	Well, Ubisoft, not to be outdone by them or I guess even EA, have a new service called Uplay.
3934731	3939255	And this is going to be something that's going to be coming out starting with Assassin's Creed 2.
3939795	3944019	And it's going to tie in with all the other games that are available now.
3944219	3945201	and DarkSakura.com
3956906	3957647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3979685	3994070	Right now, Win is currently in beta and Ubisoft is saying that Uplay Win is enabling players to collect units based on their actions in games and exchange them for rewards such as exclusive in-game content or other digital items.
3995030	4000752	The first of which is an Altair outfit and access to the Auditor family crypt.
4002793	4009135	So that's kind of cool that you can earn stuff in games and unlock rewards in your games as well.
4009406	4010287	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4032202	4039562	With this, you would get a unique code that would be, I guess, in your manual or something like that to prove that you own this game.
4039662	4040765	Or buying them used.
4041400	4043841	or buying them used.
4044402	4051006	Console piracy doesn't strike me as big a problem as it is on PC or other platforms.
4052166	4056289	It's a lot harder to do, and so I don't think it's as impactful.
4056309	4059150	I'm not trying to belittle it, but it doesn't seem like it's as impactful.
4059470	4063293	But certainly the used game market, if you have a code in the manual, well, there you go.
4063393	4065174	That's what they're really going after is the used game market.
4065194	4065634	I'm not sure.
4065674	4066675	I haven't gotten...
4067755	4086888	a copy of Assassin's Creed 2 though I'm expecting one to be coming soon Ubisoft usually hooks me up but I guess we'll find out when I play that I do like how you can have a rabbit as your icon because rabbits are awesome I still gotta play Rabbids Go Home man that looks funny
4088533	4103041	Well, in other video game news, especially in time for the holidays, something that's being popular this year with the economy, kind of in the state it's in, and people making less money and all that unfortunate stuff, is that layaway is becoming a little more popular.
4103061	4108284	I was actually seeing a news story on this not that long ago about how layaway is kind of making a comeback.
4108724	4111986	And layaway, in a nutshell, for those that don't know, is a way for you to kind of
4112506	4113507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4133524	4134024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4153180	4153681	Toys R Us Toys R Us
4170339	4192673	Apparently if you deposit 20% of the console's purchase, including tax, and what they call a $10 service charge, because they are going to hold the item for you in the back, so think of it as a storage fee I suppose, you can do this cash check, credit card, whatever, and then as long as you make payment in full before December 6th, then you can guarantee that you're going to have a copy of this.
4192953	4195935	And you know with Black Friday coming up, this is a good way to...
4197165	4199327	Check out what other retailers are doing though because I know Kmart
4208911	4211013	Toys R Us is also expanding their video game trade-in program.
4230587	4234730	Now it will be including video game hardware, and it just began on Friday.
4235070	4241754	You go to the guest service desk, and then they're going to scan your items, and they'll make an offer, and if approved, you get a little gift card for the value.
4242254	4249499	So lots of folks wanting to get in on that used game market, and now it's used consoles as well, although I highly doubt you could put a used console on layaway.
4251080	4251520	So there you go.
4253566	4262217	Going into some comments from chat, Alpha Cananogram says, Layaway equals an ancient Walmart version of pre-ordering.
4262677	4266582	Frisbee says, Layaway is also a good place to hide gifts from people.
4267042	4267723	That's a good thought.
4267803	4269485	I never thought of it that way, but that's really cool.
4271027	4275568	Actdeft, you might want to double check because I hear it's making a comeback at a lot of stores.
4275608	4276868	I don't know if Walmart's one of them.
4276888	4280189	I know Kmart was the one that I saw on the news this week, but I wouldn't be surprised.
4295692	4297534	If Walmart does it to some extent.
4297574	4300016	And it might depend also on your store, Actdeft.
4300056	4303078	I know you're in Mexico and things might also be a little different down there.
4303158	4305840	But I want to say I've still seen the layaway department at stores here.
4307642	4312065	Also, there's actually a lot of doll sites, actually.
4312386	4313907	Like one of the ones I go through, Junkie Spot.
4314908	4317610	If you're into the ball jointed dolls, they've had a layaway program forever.
4319852	4322074	Specialty stores will also do layaway.
4322114	4327157	Hey, if they can make a sale one way or another, even if they have to hold on to the merchandise a little longer, they're willing to do it.
4327838	4333662	You're also dealing with vinyl resin dolls that cost upwards of $700 sometimes.
4334323	4334563	Wow.
4335103	4335924	Expensive hobby to have.
4336164	4336824	See that big one there?
4336844	4337525	Yeah.
4338001	4338662	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4365029	4368771	DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
4368791	4369611	I pulled out a sticky one.
4369651	4370211	I pulled out Ergeis.
4370291	4370411	Ergeis.
4370431	4371812	Or as it came out in America, God Bless the Ring.
4371872	4372092	Ergeis.
4372112	4374193	Let's take a listen to some of the music from Ergeis real quick.
4400259	4404104	Sorry, that's extremely loud, I apologize.
4404124	4406527	That actually sounds like you're doing this while looking at the cloud.
4408208	4414152	Okay, so Air Guys, um... The big thing about Air Guys when it came out... Now, keep in mind, I actually did play this in the arcade.
4415113	4421337	Um... But the big thing about this one is that, um... For the home version, you could play as a bunch of Final Fantasy VII characters.
4421797	4426060	You could play as Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Yuffie, Vincent, and Zack.
4426220	4429683	Well, the arcade still had, um... Cloud and I think... Tifa.
4429883	4430463	Tifa, yeah.
4430783	4431044	Yeah.
4431384	4432905	I played that in here.
4433445	4433926	But, um, yeah.
4434326	4436727	But the home version had the, uh... Other unlockables.
4437208	4437288	Um...
4438755	4447438	This is actually now a fairly rare game, because it didn't get a Greatest Hits release, and it's not being re-released.
4448078	4456920	So this is one of those ones, like Einhander, that you're just not going to be able to find, I'm sorry.
4458681	4465083	But anyway, the game actually has the same fighting system as the Tobal series.
4466003	4470427	Um, so it, it kind of plays a bit more like a, like a grappling type of game.
4471127	4476192	Um, you have your fixed view from one place, you can actually get behind characters and stuff, it's pretty neat.
4477012	4487981	Um, but it, it actually, because it was, uh, done by, uh, Dream Factory, it was developed by Dream Factory, which is the same group that did the Toe Ball series.
4488682	4488742	Um...
4490416	4501485	It was put out by Namco in the arcades and then published by Square in the US for the console release.
4501625	4504427	And actually it is on the PlayStation Network, I forgot to say.
4505408	4506849	But yeah, it's a big fighting game.
4507230	4508791	Is it really on the PlayStation Network?
4509091	4509311	Yeah.
4509932	4510632	In America?
4511093	4511833	It came out last year.
4511853	4514415	Oh crap, I didn't know that.
4514455	4514836	That's cool.
4515683	4519225	I don't know if it's in America, but it says it was.
4519605	4520486	Maybe one of the chatter zones.
4521166	4527210	The other cool thing about this, though, is that you actually have a quest mode in it.
4527710	4530492	And the quest mode is actually really in-depth.
4531252	4533114	Like, you go through and...
4535259	4548266	It's like a hack and slash kind of action RPG sort of thing where you can go and smack things around in a randomly generated dungeon and then go to town and sell stuff and do things.
4548627	4550928	It's the full-on action RPG mode.
4552149	4561538	And then you can do your character development by one of those little five-point charts that raises attack, magic, dexterity, defense, and speed.
4563260	4566924	Which you can actually raise by consuming protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, or lipids.
4567845	4568986	So I would build those.
4570968	4571568	I don't really get it.
4571668	4571889	Anyway.
4573485	4577369	So you can adjust your skills that way by what you consume.
4577969	4584737	And then you get recipe books and you can trade wine for recipes and buy stuff that way.
4584757	4592766	You get kind of like a stock market sort of monetary system going on here.
4593959	4594579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4618078	4620660	and thinking it was awesome, although I have to admit I never bought it.
4620720	4622301	I think I rented it or something.
4623062	4625643	But I'm just surprised it wasn't a huge freaking deal.
4626164	4629186	What do you think made this game kind of slip under the radar?
4629226	4631948	Is it because maybe the rest of the characters weren't as recognizable, or what?
4631968	4633369	I think that might have been part of it, too.
4633809	4638412	Now keep in mind, the place that I used to go play this in the arcade was at Crestview Lanes.
4639413	4641855	If you remember back in the days when they had a cool arcade.
4642595	4647816	It's the same place we used to go play Blazing Star and all those.
4648597	4651878	And Dan and I used to just go and play this all the time.
4652018	4652998	It was really cool.
4653438	4655739	So we got it because we already knew the series.
4656499	4665681	And I think that the people that did get this game got it for the Final Fantasy VII characters, but I don't really think that it was promoted the way that it needed to be promoted.
4665761	4668342	And on top of that, it really, as a fighting game, is not...
4669531	4672333	I would say spectacular, nothing outstanding.
4673333	4681918	It's interesting, though, because now we have Dissida out on the PSP, which is basically a Final Fantasy fighting game, and from what I understand, that game's doing much better.
4682798	4684639	Dissidia plays a lot different, though.
4684919	4687361	It's a big battle game, is what it is.
4687801	4691243	And it's also, keep in mind, it's on PSP, so the expectations are a little different.
4691523	4697026	PSP hasn't penetrated the marketplace quite the way the PlayStation 1 did, which was epically bad.
4697686	4700167	Anything else to say about your classic game of the week?
4719671	4723233	Well, her name is, let me go through the names.
4724153	4725574	Yoko Kishi Bojin.
4726494	4730156	You've also got Ken Mishima, which always makes me think of Tekken.
4731596	4733177	Although he looks like Ryan Fury in Tekken.
4734509	4751643	Han Daehan, who's a Taekwondo guy, Prince Doza, who I always just laughed at his name, Lee Shuen, Sasuke, who's the ninja, because I mean, his name's Sasuke, Dasha Inoba, and Wolfgirl Joe, who was raised by wolves.
4752623	4762451	Oh, and you also have Koji Masuda, Clara Andrews, who I guess is the token, I guess, gaijin of the game, and Diango, who
4764444	4766526	who's a sub-boss.
4766767	4768969	So yeah, it's pretty cool.
4768989	4770730	It has a cool soundtrack to it too, I think.
4771591	4782862	And Air Guys actually did get a re-release in Japan in 2000 that had a digital clock and a character diorama and it came out with the Square Millennium Collection.
4785965	4786585	And this is...
4790276	4792657	It was also one of the joint ventures that spurred it.
4792697	4794138	One of the only ones, I can think of.
4794158	4798000	Alright, well there it is, your classic video game of the week, Ergeis.
4819858	4820919	Available on the PlayStation 1.
4822019	4826861	And certainly for a lot of Final Fantasy fans, this game holds a place near and dear to people's hearts.
4827262	4828562	Weren't you a big fan of this one, Loki?
4828742	4830163	I seem to remember you talking about this one.
4830523	4831184	Yeah, it was awesome.
4831244	4835226	In fact, I have it on my cabinet, so I just have to see if it actually plays in MAME.
4835466	4835846	Very nice.
4836827	4841991	Alright, well, now that we've covered our classic game of the week, it's time for us to bring Part A to a close.
4842051	4845173	But don't worry, we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4845453	4848695	Part B is coming right up, and in tonight's Part B, we'll take your Twitter topics.
4849035	4853398	So if you have anything you want to fire at us, quick, get to the Twitter and send us a message at OLR.
4853778	4861704	And then, of course, our rapid-fire news tonight, and we're going to talk about the Video Game Awards, the nominees were released, and some Phoenix Wright coming to WiiWare.
4861764	4862544	Sounds pretty exciting.
4862864	4866507	So we will be right back in just a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4866647	4866852	Thanks for watching!
4872349	4877831	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 22nd of 2009.
4878271	4884013	A happy early Thanksgiving, of course, to those in America that have the Thanksgiving holiday coming up.
4884913	4889955	And good luck on Black Friday, you guys, if anybody's actually going to brave it out there at these stores.
4890295	4892156	Be safe, for heaven's sakes.
4892356	4894256	Don't step on anybody and kill them.
4894296	4896877	Although it sounds like a lot of stores are taking a lot of precautions with all that this year.
4896997	4900819	Also, people in retail, I'm sorry.
4902239	4906581	I'll help you reach at least 100 fans if you mention me on the next show.
4930211	4931032	You're welcome, lol.
4931052	4931492	So there you go.
4931992	4932353	I did it.
4932453	4940678	So now, hopefully, I don't know what magical, mystical powers he has over Facebook, but we'll take a chance there by giving a shout out.
4940738	4942700	Rob, you have now made us whores.
4943795	4947780	Although he does post a follow-up, I just sent out over 650 fan suggestions.
4948321	4948762	Awesome.
4949102	4951665	But, careful guys, just make sure you're not spamming.
4952266	4954269	As long as folks you think would be truly interested in it.
4954289	4957353	But just, I don't even really know what the fan suggestions thing is.
4957593	4959495	So just, you know, just want to check.
4959736	4960277	Just making sure.
4961304	4965246	Anyhow, we're going to get back into tonight's show with some Twitter topics.
4965286	4968127	Heading on over to the Twitter, looking at our messages at OLR.
4968647	4972908	Just a couple of them tonight because stupid me forgot to ask for them until just before tonight's show.
4973749	4975669	But let's see.
4975749	4976190	Lots of...
4978226	4979627	comments, random things.
4980088	4982570	Actdeft made some sandwiches to eat while listening to OLR.
4982830	4985413	Ironically enough, Loki had some sandwiches before the show tonight, didn't he?
4985913	4987274	So, delicious.
4987414	4987935	Yes, delicious.
4988536	4993820	GamerGirl wants to know, what's better, Super Mario DS or Super Mario Wii?
4994141	4999145	This is hard for me to answer because I haven't really played the Wii one yet, and I don't know if any of us really have.
4999566	5000827	I did play it a little bit at E3.
5000847	5000887	Um...
5003372	5004273	I think they're just different.
5004673	5005974	And I hear that Super Mario Bros.
5006054	5011899	Wii is a great multiplayer game, but it's okay as a single player game.
5011919	5016902	Whereas I think Super Mario DS is a great single player game, and I have played that one, and it's a lot of fun.
5018163	5022347	Maybe that's the distinction you want to make, is that if you're into a single player game, get DS.
5022447	5024228	But if you want to get a multiplayer game, get Wii.
5024528	5025309	Although at the same time,
5026977	5032741	Keep in mind, the other big difference is that the DS one can go with you anywhere, and it's probably a little bit cheaper, too.
5033261	5033861	So, I don't know.
5033901	5048150	For those reasons, the DS one might have a slight advantage if you haven't either one of them yet, but if you have some brothers and sisters or other family members, people that live with you, whatever, significant others that would play this game with you, then maybe Super Mario Wii would be awesome for you.
5048910	5059679	And the last question tonight from Scoop20906 on Twitter says, Microsoft's new Zune Marketplace on Xbox 360 looks pretty cool and makes me consider getting a Zune HD.
5060279	5063202	Loki, have you checked this out on the Xbox 360 at all?
5063682	5064863	I know it was in the latest update.
5064903	5066865	Mine is still borked, so I haven't got a chance to look at it.
5067345	5067545	No?
5068285	5075688	I have not played with anything except for that one time that I tweeted on my 360, and that was the end of the update.
5075748	5085211	Which, by the way, I don't think I have seen a single tweet from the Xbox 360 from anyone outside of, Hi from my Xbox 360, or LOL tweeting on 360.
5085571	5091013	I don't think I've seen anybody post an update from their 360 that wasn't about the fact that they're posting from a 360.
5091053	5092774	Because it's a pain in the ass.
5093817	5095057	Actually, there is something cool.
5095097	5104920	Speaking of tweeting on something other than your computer or your phone, they created a way to use brain impulse to tweet.
5105620	5105880	What?
5106460	5111062	It's on Times 50 Inventions of the Year.
5112102	5119084	Now, it takes a full, I want to say, 15 minutes to do an eight-character tweet.
5120530	5130896	But they're working on technology so that quadriplegics or amputees can use the internet.
5133678	5133998	Wow.
5134979	5136640	That's crazy stuff.
5136980	5140342	But it's not the type of thing where it's like reading your brain and...
5140974	5146298	It works on the type of impulse that you get when imagining something.
5147158	5151801	Well, wouldn't you be nervous about a tweet going out like, I just pictured this chick naked?
5151982	5154123	You picture it by letter, by character.
5155044	5156265	That's still creepy.
5156625	5158926	Yeah, it's on Time's webpage.
5159086	5160127	That's kind of creepy.
5160367	5167132	I don't want my thoughts tweeted, even letters that I think about, because what if I'm having a dream about Sesame Street?
5169454	5169974	Nevermind.
5170555	5170855	Alright.
5172516	5172896	I'm sorry.
5173196	5174377	It's just a little creepy for me.
5174477	5191968	Like, you know, if we're reading people's thoughts about letters, I mean, although I appreciate that they're trying to think of ways to get, you know, handicapped folks that have severe handicaps to be able to do that stuff, that's just a little creepy to me doing it through the brain because it's just a matter of time before the government installs a chip in the back of your brain and they know everything you're thinking.
5191988	5192589	Ah!
5192609	5195711	What, a matter of time before Johnny Mnemonic becomes real?
5195911	5196091	Yes.
5197592	5197792	Whoa.
5197812	5197892	Whoa.
5199793	5200253	Dude.
5203155	5204236	Reading some comments from chat.
5204916	5208919	Alpha Cananogram says, as long as it doesn't bring thought police any time in my lifetime, I'm okay with it.
5209179	5211200	Wasn't that like the plot of Minority Report or something?
5211680	5212080	I don't remember.
5213882	5214302	Or 1984, thank you.
5214642	5216743	AJ Mix in chatroom says, wait, I'll guess.
5216843	5217584	I can read your brain.
5217664	5218424	Oh my, is that true?
5218464	5219725	Did you fall in love with some pretty girl?
5220906	5224588	DarkTituya says, OLR is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
5224708	5227670	I see what you did there.
5229025	5231767	All right, anyhow, let's get into some fast news tonight.
5231807	5236230	We call it rapid fire news because they're just little things we want to talk about before we get back into some discussion.
5236270	5237350	Loki's going to kick it off tonight.
5237811	5239452	Monopoly is coming to the iPhone.
5239972	5242474	It's actually the regular version of Monopoly.
5242514	5245376	I didn't know there was another version of Monopoly, but apparently it is.
5245976	5253181	A version called, or I guess the version Monopoly here and now, the world, which was the one that came out originally.
5253901	5254461	This is not.
5254621	5257984	So the original Monopoly, $5 in the App Store, and...
5259332	5261993	Yeah, so if you want to play Monopoly on the go, there you go.
5264454	5268336	3D.GameHeroes is coming to the US, which is awesome.
5268496	5274179	Atlus is bringing it over, and it will be coming out over here on May 11th.
5275199	5277661	So no need to import it, although I know some people will.
5278921	5280902	Although I don't know if I'm one of those people that will do that.
5281422	5285804	Keep in mind the PS3 kind of encourages it by being region free, that's all I'm saying.
5286525	5286705	True.
5287896	5291117	American Girl, Even the Losers, Here Comes My Girl, Mary Jane's Last Dance, and Refugee.
5310645	5312547	Aw, who doesn't know The Last Dance of Mary Jane?
5312587	5313367	That song was awesome.
5313547	5315789	Isn't that the one where he's dancing around with the dead body in the video?
5316529	5317350	That's Kim Basinger.
5317530	5319831	That's what Rock Band needs, music videos.
5319871	5327356	Like, don't get me wrong, I like the epicness of the, you know, but remember how like Amplitude and stuff would play music videos in the background while you were playing some of the songs?
5327456	5328897	Like, Rock Band needs that a little bit, I think.
5329698	5330378	That'd be kind of neat.
5331019	5335382	And those are available, of course, for $2 each or the equivalent on your...
5336863	5342846	System, of course, you can get them in a pack, save yourself two bucks, and it's for 800 Microsoft points or $10.
5343646	5352931	And then individual songs coming out this week as well, the Go-Go's with Our Lips Are Sealed, Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent,
5353351	5355633	Why are they releasing that song and not Since You've Been Gone?
5355693	5358295	Like, talk about an epic karaoke song.
5358755	5362978	I haven't been to karaoke in a little while, but I'll tell you, you know, I used to go to gay karaoke all the time.
5363018	5364819	You know, a little gay bar did karaoke all the time.
5364839	5372405	And I'll tell you what, some diva, male or female, would always be up on that stage singing, Since you've been gone, I can't breathe.
5373005	5373545	I can't believe this.
5373586	5374666	That diva was you, of course, right?
5374686	5374926	Usually.
5375126	5383310	But I can't believe, when I wasn't too busy doing ABBA, when I can't believe that that epic karaoke song is not making its way into Rock Band yet.
5384251	5385472	Maybe it's coming to Lego Rock Band.
5385492	5385772	I don't know.
5386312	5386632	Maybe.
5386912	5388613	And then also Pink Who Knew.
5389554	5394316	All of those are available for 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $2.
5397975	5398275	All right.
5398676	5401618	Well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news tonight.
5401658	5410325	Talking about Dragon Age Origins, which has been getting quite a lot of press lately, there is some download content called Return to Ostagar.
5410625	5413648	It's coming to the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
5413728	5417891	It's only going to cost you $5, and they're saying it's coming out during the holiday season.
5418352	5426478	This will allow your character to revisit Ostagar, the site of the Grey Warden's darkest hour, to reclaim the honor and learn the secrets of Ferelden's fallen king.
5426619	5426799	So...
5427539	5454781	Nice to see that there's expansion From what I hear, the game itself is like epically long So if you're already bored with Dragon Age Maybe you gotta go outside, I don't know, I'm just saying Alright, hey, Cooking Mama is coming to arcades That's right, Cooking Mama is making its way to arcades And it's using a touch screen That kind of reminds me a little bit I don't know, when I'm kind of looking at it It looks like, um, um
5455541	5456702	Oh god, the name escapes me.
5456782	5467793	The big PSP game that made its way to... The PSP beat-matching game that's like 2DX that made its way to arcades.
5468153	5468794	DJ Max?
5468814	5470215	Thank you, DJ Max, right?
5471345	5472506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5495760	5504669	Hey, this week, by the way, was a big holiday for fans of Bomani, Konami's series of music video games, which, of course, this show started all about.
5505049	5507051	One of the big ones, Dance Dance Revolution.
5507392	5512257	Well, it's still alive and kicking, and 20 November was the perfect opportunity for Konami to announce...
5512657	5537425	Dance Dance Revolution X2 and the location tests that are happening in Japan it looks like the first one scheduled for November 25th through December 3rd is when the first location test is happening there in Japan for more information you can head over to Konami's Japanese website konami.jp although if the last few iterations of DDR are any indication these games will make their way over to North America eventually but they will be subpar oh I went there
5539705	5540325	He did.
5540426	5540926	I sure did.
5540966	5544828	How about more rapid-fire news, DarkSakura?
5546489	5547770	Sorry, my needle was stuck.
5549431	5551452	Well, Brazil, guess what?
5552252	5553433	You got a PS2 now.
5554673	5558075	The PS2 has finally launched in Brazil.
5558376	5558716	PS2.
5559096	5560257	The PS2.
5560617	5561497	Okay.
5562358	5562698	Yeah.
5564982	5575690	and it's actually out for $7.99 I'm not quite sure what BRL stands for I know it's their monetary system but the equivalent is $461
5581873	5584434	Super Monkey Ball 2 is coming to the iPhone.
5584994	5595359	It will have 115 new levels, local multiplayer, enhanced controls, improved graphics, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, and Monkey Target.
5596840	5608068	and, um, actually the former three are going to be free updates in 2010, but it will be, um, actually, um, out for, uh, two, uh, two pounds, 39 pence.
5608188	5609869	So over in UK.
5610069	5621777	So, um, and Star Trek, um, online, the open beta is, uh, going to be starting on, um, uh,
5623007	5629651	It looks like from the 12th to the 26th of January next year, keys will be first come, first served.
5629671	5631913	You can get them on StarTrekOnline.com.
5633994	5643200	And you can actually still apply for a closed beta spot, but the closed beta is, of course, I don't think going to be lasting much longer.
5646282	5648343	The actual game, though, comes out on February 2nd.
5650119	5655364	Sorry, February 2nd in North America, the 5th in Europe.
5656205	5657986	Pardon me, can I fanboy for a minute?
5660148	5663972	I'm looking for... I am so excited for Star Trek Online, you don't even know.
5664252	5665934	That's how big of a colossal nerd I am.
5666054	5671639	Oh, I'm going to be on this, waking up early in the morning to get my...
5673917	5675158	I'm so excited.
5675918	5677919	The more I watch Star Trek, the more I love it.
5678099	5689025	I watched the new movie again over this weekend, and it was a bunch of us gay nerds getting together to watch the Star Trek movie, and we were basically mystery science theatering it, making fun of it and stuff.
5689105	5689925	I just had so much fun.
5690005	5693147	And I love Star Trek, and especially the new one.
5693187	5697109	And hearing that this is going to tie into the new one a little bit is very exciting.
5697269	5698890	So I'm very excited for Star Trek Online.
5698910	5700931	I think it's the one thing that will finally tear me away from WoW.
5702042	5702503	For good?
5702803	5703103	I don't know.
5719425	5744651	and you know we've had listeners call in from some foreign countries that aren't often well represented in video gaming you know kind of talk about this that this is you know a problem and why piracy runs so rampant in their countries is that unfortunately there's not a lot of official support in their countries for this but you know a lot of the reason for that is again gaming is expensive and often there aren't enough people to maybe support the launch of these systems so it's
5745291	5755679	Even though we kind of sit here and lull at the PS2 just now being launched in Brazil, I guess maybe it's just because economically and, you know, the demand-wise, it makes sense.
5755919	5764345	Although, it is weird to hear, and I was seeing some comparisons, that to buy an official PlayStation 2 costs more money than it is to just, like, import one from the U.S.
5764766	5766407	So, WTF is the point.
5767107	5767468	I don't know.
5767988	5771090	But, regardless, one way or the other, it's out.
5772291	5773732	I guess they can play games in Portuguese?
5773752	5774753	I don't know.
5775060	5778441	I am officially making the OLRE in race though That's awesome, but I think I just want to play a Vulcan
5804642	5816656	I wanna be a sassy Vulcan Yo, logic is shit Anyhow That's just wrong So wrong What the hell you thinking, bitch?
5817797	5821882	Anyhow And Actdeft says The USS Ferret
5823666	5842942	DarkTetsuya says the OLR prize I'm so excited about Star Trek Online you don't even know this is going to turn into the Star Trek podcast Loki is going to have to be the one that keeps us grounded when this game comes out I signed up for the beta but I'm probably not going to play it give me your key I signed you up too I signed you up first
5843803	5848387	Brad from PodCulture says, Sassy Vulcan, isn't that just a Romulan with PMS?
5848727	5850228	You know, I should just be a Klingon.
5850509	5854232	Honestly, if I'm going to be sassy, then I need to just be a Klingon.
5854732	5856714	Just go around calling everyone a patah!
5859016	5860757	I totally want to swear at people in Klingon.
5860777	5861378	That's amazing.
5862020	5865702	I just know that's a... I used to know how to say your mother has a smooth forehead.
5866022	5869524	For your sake, I hope you are initiating a mating ritual.
5870865	5871625	Anyhow, sorry.
5872106	5875407	I watched all the Star Trek movies when I was sick with swine flu, okay?
5875467	5876128	Leave me alone.
5878652	5879433	I'm going to try to find it.
5879493	5880874	Everyday Klingon Phrases.
5881154	5882455	Loki News, quick!
5882655	5883135	Save us!
5883876	5887338	The Spike Video Game Awards are going to be coming soon.
5887718	5889940	And, of course, the nominations are out.
5890901	5897345	With Uncharted 2 getting 8 nominations, Batman Arkham Asylum getting 7, Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead both getting 6.
5899026	5901348	Let's go through some of the nominations, shall we?
5901388	5903670	And see what we've got here to start with, of course.
5904690	5905591	Game of the Year.
5907214	5917858	and the nominations are Assassin's Creed 2, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and Uncharted 2.
5918698	5923099	Interesting enough, all but one coming out within the last month or so.
5923339	5924440	No President Cat.
5924880	5925880	I am most disappointed.
5927140	5927801	Exactly.
5929481	5931022	No write-in nominations either.
5931062	5932962	That's kind of sad.
5933082	5934343	Studio of the Year.
5935573	5942456	Infinity Ward Naughty Dog Rocksteady and Valve Best Independent Game
5965035	5969820	Explosion Man, Flower, Osmos, and Trials HD.
5970801	5971662	Those are all actually pretty good.
5971702	5972783	Yeah, those are all actually pretty good.
5972823	5973924	Those are some good picks.
5974205	5976387	Out of curiosity, what do you think is going to land Game of the Year?
5976887	5977388	Modern Warfare 2.
5977948	5978229	You think?
5978429	5978549	Yeah.
5979275	5982117	You don't think they'll go a little more avant-garde?
5982177	5982837	Uncharted 2?
5983217	5984638	Is Uncharted 2 getting the highest scores?
5984658	5986119	It's by user vote.
5987340	5989201	Modern Warfare 2.
5989541	5996105	Best downloadable game, Battlefield 1943, Fat Princess, Plants vs. Zombies, and Shadow Complex.
5996325	5998406	I'm thinking Plants vs. Zombies is going to win that.
5999187	6000187	Yeah, it's kind of crack.
6000848	6004810	Ricky Go Mac in our chat says, Jenny McCarthy, as far as celebrities go.
6005090	6005971	I said celebrities.
6008496	6010200	Since when has Jenny McCarthy been relevant?
6010481	6011825	Oh wait, she has a game to promote, huh?
6013809	6016971	I guess she's been a guest on Oprah, so that makes her relevant, I don't know.
6017011	6023456	Best soundtrack, Brutal Legend, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, and the Beatles Rock Band.
6023796	6027118	I hope DJ Hero wins, but I have a feeling the Beatles Rock Band's gonna win.
6027258	6032782	That's, you know what, I gotta say this though, as much mad respect as I have for the Beatles Rock Band, that's kinda cheating.
6033083	6035344	Come on, that music's like 40 years old.
6035645	6037506	And granted it's timeless music, but...
6039227	6039908	Come on!
6039948	6044972	And it's not really a soundtrack so much as it's just their entire music album.
6045532	6046673	Their whole catalog.
6049175	6054260	I would say, though, DJ Hero by far has the best soundtrack.
6054300	6057582	I mean, if you throw out the Beatles, because that's cheating.
6058323	6062747	And of course, best music game, they have DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, Lego Rock Band, and the Beatles Rock Band.
6064068	6064828	No surprises there.
6064908	6067951	Have there been other music games out this year that have been as notable?
6069417	6073721	Borderlands, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age Origins, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story
6085745	6089228	Congratulations, Dragon Age Origins, for winning that category, because it will.
6089748	6093571	Although, neat to see Demon's Souls... Borderlands, I don't know, Borderlands is pretty fucking awesome.
6093771	6096473	But it's kind of like, huh?
6096573	6099155	In the RPG category, it's a little weird.
6099415	6101097	It's more of a shooter, I think.
6101617	6104719	One more category, then I want to move on with other stories.
6104739	6107261	We'll do Best Performance... Oh, let's see here.
6107541	6110023	Best Game Based on Movie Slash TV Show.
6111064	6111965	Best Graphics.
6113585	6115907	Let's do one of the weirder ones here.
6115987	6118808	How about... Oh, God.
6118928	6120309	Most Anticipated Game.
6120749	6121049	Really?
6121210	6121930	That's an award?
6123736	6124296	Interesting.
6124817	6126177	And I'm anticipating it loading.
6126617	6136002	And the nominees are, for games that no one's played yet but are wanting to play, Bioshock 2, God of War 3, Mass Effect 2, and StarCraft 2.
6136082	6138002	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
6138122	6138663	I have an idea.
6138683	6139263	I have an idea.
6139363	6140303	You know what I'm going to say, right?
6140423	6140784	Oh, wait, wait.
6141184	6141644	Guess what?
6141704	6141904	Yes.
6142344	6143405	Write in your own choice.
6143445	6144625	You know what I'm going to ask, right?
6144885	6145846	You know what I want, right?
6146698	6147578	Star Trek?
6147638	6147878	Nope.
6148159	6149919	Sukibanshoa Renawi.
6150299	6153441	You need to go on to... This is what I want the OLR me to do.
6153461	6155322	Sukibanshoa Renawi.
6155362	6157562	This is what I want the OLR fans to do.
6157582	6158483	I'm going to tell the people there.
6158923	6161844	Although... Oh, doesn't it say something about it has to be an already announced game?
6162204	6163905	An already announced as it's coming out.
6164045	6164485	Well, hold on.
6164705	6166586	That's just that category.
6166606	6167747	What about best Wii game?
6167767	6168767	Flutum, anyway.
6169167	6172208	Maybe... You can't write in that.
6172449	6174349	But you can write in the most anticipated game.
6174369	6175610	So if we do that, I guess...
6176338	6176719	Why not?
6177459	6177820	Why not?
6178580	6179301	We'll do it anyway.
6179501	6184325	So I want folks to go and write in, to write it in and then put in parentheses President Cat.
6184666	6188089	And if enough of us do it, here's the idea behind it, guys.
6188109	6188589	Here's the idea.
6189210	6193253	If enough of us do it, they'll show it in a clip compilation.
6194542	6196983	So our goal here, guys, here's the goal.
6197464	6200866	To get President Cat to show up for half a second on the VGAs.
6201046	6202166	That is the ultimate goal.
6202827	6203127	Okay?
6204188	6208210	So in order to do that, we need like 500 of you to submit that as your vote.
6208590	6213613	Yeah, so you can go to Spike.com slash event slash VGA 2009.
6214574	6215834	And I'll be on there.
6216335	6221658	I will post the link in chat where you can actually submit your vote for...
6223037	6226078	Chatters, damn it, no, you don't write in Boys Love Scramble.
6226138	6228439	You write in President Cat.
6229559	6229979	Damn it.
6230659	6231700	Have I taught you nothing?
6234060	6241763	Make sure you put in, I'll put it in the chat room, Sukibanshacho Rena Wee, parentheses, President Cat.
6241843	6245644	And I'll post this to the Facebook and the Twitter, too, before the night is over.
6247379	6248239	It'll never happen.
6248339	6248819	It will never.
6249239	6250360	No, this is all we want.
6251160	6252380	Maybe they'll go, like, who hosts this?
6252420	6253620	Samuel L. Jackson or whatever?
6254500	6256401	The fuck is President Cat?
6258401	6274684	No, is that he'll have to get up there and show, you know, well, Bioshock 2 is the game, most anticipated game of the year, but let's take a look at some of the stuff that you want to see in the write-ins, and they'll show, like, a little compilation of all these other things, and then all we want, President Cat, half a second of airtime.
6274724	6275304	That's all we want.
6276184	6276584	All we want.
6278168	6278348	Finds it.
6278388	6278869	It's in there.
6278889	6279390	Just done.
6279410	6280972	Now to do it through Internet Explorer.
6293342	6294002	All right, moving on.
6294022	6304266	While you guys are furiously submitting your votes for the VGAs, and I'll put that on Twitter and all that fun stuff later, Phoenix Wright, now this is also an awesome series, is coming to WiiWare.
6304786	6308948	It's a courtroom battle game coming to the WiiWare, and this was revealed in Famitsu Magazine.
6309548	6316591	Apparently it's going to be like an episodic thing because they're going to start in January in the U.S., and they're going to come out every other month for $10 apiece.
6317011	6322053	Rise of the Ashes, which was the extra case that was added to DS Ace Attorney...
6322413	6325658	will be coming out in May, I guess, for just a buck.
6325879	6326339	Go figure.
6326860	6332669	So these games are going to come out, and I guess you actually get to swing the Wii Remote to present evidence or something.
6332709	6337035	I don't know if this is a mock-up somebody did or the real deal, but I could totally see this being the real deal.
6337195	6337997	That's the real deal.
6338517	6339398	Oh wow, that's awesome.
6339698	6342561	So you'll actually get to throw out the Wii Remote.
6342581	6345003	Well, not literally throw it, but like you're objecting.
6345063	6348807	So this is going to be pretty epic, especially for those that maybe didn't get into the DS ones.
6349247	6355233	By the way, the very first game is just a port of the original Game Boy Advance title, but enhanced for the Wii, of course.
6356013	6360618	Lots and lots of screenshots already being leaked, so I guess this is the real deal.
6360758	6361038	Awesome. $10? !
6362878	6363979	DarkSakura, moving on
6384548	6391031	Well, for people who are fans of LittleBigPlanet, there's something pretty cool for those people.
6392291	6398094	As soon as I close down my 50,000 submissions of President Cat.
6399014	6401435	Yeah, there are going to be...
6403696	6408157	Sonic the Hedgehog themed outfits for LittleBigPlanet.
6408197	6422460	You have looks like Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, I guess that's supposed to be Shadow, and Eggman, or Robotnik, sorry.
6423560	6425241	Dude, they need to have a Mecha Sonic one.
6426021	6426561	That would be cool.
6429278	6429899	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6455540	6458661	Well, you know, they still have to retain that little big planet sack boy look.
6458701	6459882	They look like big monkeys.
6459982	6465104	It's just going to be hilarious for all those people that make knockoff levels from Sonic.
6465304	6467285	Okay, listeners, I challenge you.
6467765	6470666	Make a really kick-ass casino night.
6472447	6472887	And then show us.
6476853	6484055	They do have some levels that are in LittleBigPlanet that are basically mock-ups of Sonic the Hedgehog already.
6484235	6487897	Too bad they don't have Super Speed with those costumes.
6487917	6488737	That'd be kind of cool.
6490798	6495519	It would be cool, yeah, kind of like how they implemented in the Metal Gear you had the gun, like maybe implement Super Speed.
6496099	6496459	We'll see.
6498180	6502501	Well, something not quite that cool and actually quite disturbing.
6503782	6504162	Apparently...
6505336	6516379	There's a guy who's really into his dating sims, including the dating sim Love Plus, so much so that he decided to get married to it.
6517239	6518059	Yes, that's right.
6518619	6519459	You heard me right.
6520279	6522620	A guy got married to his DS game.
6523220	6525841	And you can only do this in one place, apparently.
6525941	6526241	Guam.
6528683	6552499	The guy was pronounced man and wife with his copy of Dating Sim Love Plus, and apparently he married one of the characters in the game, Nene Anegasaki, and one of the three virtual girlfriends in the game.
6553180	6557423	And apparently he's having a reception and everything, he's invited the media...
6558584	6559464	It's just ridiculous.
6560904	6561345	Come on.
6561945	6564685	Are you that much of a loser that you married a video game?
6564985	6566886	And Guam, what is your problem?
6567386	6571406	You're actually performing a ceremony for somebody that wants to marry a video game?
6571426	6576287	I don't know.
6576987	6578128	I just don't get it.
6578588	6581628	Like, really?
6581808	6583489	He married his video game?
6583589	6585209	How does that even work?
6586983	6588264	I need to see what the honeymoon night's like.
6588284	6588825	This is in Guam.
6588885	6590086	Is there gay marriage in Guam?
6590866	6591246	I don't know.
6617617	6620083	But it's just the whole thing's just like, what?
6620664	6621907	I think the guy did it for attention.
6621927	6624051	Attention whore.
6624352	6627318	Yeah, apparently, I don't know, they're...
6629079	6635643	I'm not sure if this is the same guy, although I find it a little odd if there's someone else in Guam that's also walking around with his DS.
6636063	6645228	But apparently some guy, I'm thinking the same guy, also went and visited the Love Bell, which apparently brings good luck to couples.
6645668	6650471	And you're supposed to pull the rope together with the couple, or both of you are supposed to pull the rope together.
6650491	6655153	And of course he had his DS in his hand and pulled the rope with the DS in his hand.
6656803	6657224	Loser!
6687469	6688491	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6700615	6703477	Alright, well, things are just going to go from bad to worse here in a minute here.
6703958	6716828	You might remember there was this attention whore out there, Eric Estavillo, who was banned from the PlayStation Network and he ended up, because he made some hateful comments in the resistance community, he actually sued Sony twice.
6717428	6725955	And it got shot down by Judge Ronald White because Sony is not part of the government, you know, the free speech First Amendment doesn't apply.
6726315	6727095	So what does he do?
6727836	6735401	He decides that in order to find fairness and right in this world, he sues Microsoft and Nintendo.
6736301	6736802	That's right.
6737382	6746127	He's suing $75,000 to Microsoft for the undue stress and sadness caused by the Red Rings of Death.
6747008	6751711	Quote, Microsoft should have to bear the burden that is now put on the shoulders of this disabled plaintiff.
6753664	6767836	Nintendo is being sued for interfering with the, quote, pursuit of happiness by deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the Homebrew channel and Ocarina applications via a system update.
6768677	6769498	You know what I have to say?
6770639	6770899	You!
6771259	6772140	Out of the gene pool!
6772460	6773001	Right now!
6776544	6777485	Like, really?
6777505	6777625	Really?
6779420	6782161	I mean, talk about attention whore.
6782761	6785282	These are the very definition of frivolous lawsuit.
6785322	6789123	First off, neither of these systems owe you anything.
6789183	6791524	I mean, the Red Ring of Death thing we've seen before.
6791604	6792584	I mean, get a new cause.
6792924	6799426	But the one that really jumps out at me is that Nintendo deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel.
6799466	6805528	So protecting their rights to people modifying the console means you should get to sue them.
6807113	6810395	DarkTetsuya says, where are the FUs of the week when we need them?
6810435	6815118	Funny you should mention.
6843032	6869860	and of course we dedicate our FUs of the week tonight to said person and previous story Loki, why don't you start us off tonight FU to people that don't know how to turn on their headlights in the dark yes, I see people driving around in their cars it's pitch black outside, no headlights on or even better, they have their parking lights on I'm sorry, parking lights are not headlights they need to be eaten by a grue learn to drive safely
6873197	6879619	My FU of the week just goes to the fact that the weekend has been very, very short and that I have to go back to work before I'm ready.
6880279	6881019	I'm just not ready.
6881119	6882219	The weekend's already over.
6882379	6883059	Poor baby.
6883280	6883880	Poor me.
6884960	6891281	Well, FU to number one, me going back to work full time now that I am officially off of my leave now that my hand works.
6892362	6896903	And also to getting this stuff all over my hands.
6899003	6901164	Acrylic medium for textiles.
6901704	6902044	Gross.
6905901	6917050	By the way, the chatters think that this is how the judge should react in that case when the guy walks into the courtroom and suing Nintendo and Microsoft, that this should be the judge's response.
6917130	6918131	Check it out.
6918311	6923255	Let's see if you guys would agree with the judge's stance if this were it.
6923800	6925902	God, I hope that's exactly how it goes.
6944094	6946157	Let's get to the mailbag, something a little more pleasant.
6946398	6955852	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some of our favorites or read them here on the air or we pick some of our not-so-favorites and read them on the air anyway to make fun of them.
6956593	6960074	DarkSakura, why don't you dive in the mailbag headfirst, pull out some emails, and read them.
6960554	6961495	One's from Spazinator.
6961855	6968097	And actually, I'd like to go ahead and say that because I've been following up on Twitter, the situation was resolved.
6968377	6969198	We followed our advice.
6969438	6972399	I remember this whole thing from last week, and hopefully the listeners do too.
6972439	6978841	I know the podcast hasn't hit the feed yet, but in a nutshell, Spazinator lost the rights to his video content.
6978901	6982222	I think it had something to do with when he backed them up to his drive or something.
6983343	6983903	He had to ref...
6984823	6991666	He had to reformat because of an install error that caused his game to glitch or something.
6991826	6994487	And Sony basically told him, you get nothing, you lose.
6994507	6994948	Good day, sir.
6994968	6999870	And we said, you need to call back and speak to a supervisor, escalate it, figure out what part of the policy this falls under.
7000410	7001931	And so the situation was resolved.
7002471	7006753	Well, he says, hi, I'm writing this early as 11-16-09's show is ending.
7007173	7008833	I tried to call in but couldn't get through.
7008853	7009954	We actually did talk to him, didn't we?
7011152	7012653	Not on the phone, only email last week.
7013234	7018117	I just thought I'd give you some additional info regarding my last email and answer some of the questions and whatnot.
7018517	7023441	Firstly, I think either Xlink or Akiripper asked why I didn't back up the stuff.
7024301	7027644	I did on two Western Digital Passport external HDDs.
7028084	7029645	I don't own a PC yet, by the way.
7029945	7032027	I do the same for my game saves and music.
7032527	7034769	Video store works a bit differently from the game store.
7035089	7035769	Thanks for watching!
7056677	7058738	And that happened after this email, right?
7058878	7059038	Yeah.
7059158	7059378	Okay.
7059618	7064601	And I'm sure he likes to call us a lot, so I'm sure he'll be on the phone later on to tell us more about it.
7064661	7066001	So let's just go ahead and go to the next call.
7066061	7066802	Hopefully he gets through.
7066862	7067082	Okay.
7067802	7073224	The next one up is from someone who didn't name themselves, so I'm just going to say Brandon.
7073905	7075145	Because that's the first name.
7075265	7075465	Anyway.
7075485	7075826	Okay.
7086398	7089501	I know, I know, I know what the living hell is.
7089521	7094366	17-year-old boy playing a game for little tween girls that's only the audience.
7094726	7096288	The sound is mp3 quality.
7096368	7096688	It gets a 3.
7097829	7098190	Okay.
7099511	7099831	Dude.
7101053	7101453	Grammar.
7102394	7103695	Next, DJ Hero.
7104416	7109481	Okay, is does not have a Z. It's I-S, not I-Z.
7109881	7110422	Gosh.
7111969	7114050	Alright, this is the ultimate DJ sim.
7114070	7122172	The genres range from rap to Motown, easy learning curve, and great, great does not have an E at the end.
7122512	7124952	For music and gaming fans alike, I give it a 10.
7125513	7126973	Peace out, oh, DS Lover.
7128613	7128974	No wonder.
7129714	7132995	This is sponsored by Beatmania, the Losers DJ.
7133595	7136536	Losers is not spelled L-U-Z-E-R-S.
7136876	7138056	I'm not reading anything else from you.
7138897	7141678	Let's go to the grammar judges on that email.
7141698	7143659	Sorry.
7155097	7158822	Hi, this is my first email, so let me start off saying I love the show.
7158922	7162166	It's pretty much the closest I get to a video game discussion.
7162226	7165270	Most of my friends play Wii Sports and minigame collections.
7165671	7167713	Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys a question.
7167834	7171338	What was your first midnight release game you stood in line for?
7172339	7173860	What was the longest you waited for?
7174020	7179562	My first was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which was interesting because I was only 14 and they didn't ask for ID back then.
7180322	7185684	It was okay, though, because my mom and dad watched me play Vice City and said they would answer any questions I had.
7186305	7188365	The longest wait was when the Wii was launching.
7188425	7192127	Three friends and I waited 33 hours in 20 degree weathers to buy it.
7192587	7196689	The only reason we had to wait outside was two days earlier people were waiting in the store for PS3.
7197529	7199410	and we're opening toys and trashing the store.
7199850	7201071	I mean, why would you do that?
7201211	7205133	I'll say people should not be jackasses and smoke in line.
7205333	7205854	Amen.
7206394	7209696	I was in line for Modern Warfare 2 and these people were smoking joints.
7210016	7210976	I'm not against weed.
7211276	7211557	Wow.
7211577	7214298	But seriously, do that in privacy, not in public.
7215078	7217100	They did have a sober driver at least.
7217200	7219181	Well, I look forward to your answers.
7219301	7225224	I hope the podcast feed is updated soon because my computer has been fried for a month and I'm using the PSP to listen to you guys.
7225444	7226604	Two episodes went up today.
7226664	7227205	Go get them now.
7228025	7232766	By the way, this email is brought to you by Lil' Cats, where you can hash cheeseburger and invisible items.
7234027	7236268	I have to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the midnight releases.
7236308	7237848	It's usually freaking cold out.
7238128	7244410	The last one I can honestly remember going to, actually, I think the first one I went to was when the Wii was released.
7245131	7246131	My first was the Dreamcast.
7247495	7251097	and even then, I didn't wait in line all night.
7251377	7257219	We went out to go take, remember we did this whole cute little promotion thing where we took cookies and orange soda to people in line.
7257519	7258940	Chris and I were taking donuts and coffee.
7258960	7260861	Yeah, it was like a cheap promotion for our show, basically.
7261121	7262822	But people seemed to genuinely appreciate it.
7262842	7264963	At first, people were kind of weirded out by it.
7265003	7266463	Like, whoa, people are bringing us stuff.
7266483	7268144	We're like, no, we're just trying to promote our show.
7268544	7269425	And people were pretty cool with it.
7269445	7271205	In fact, remember that?
7271266	7274207	Some dude at Target was listening to our show on his iPod.
7274527	7274647	Yeah.
7274967	7276148	That was such a trip.
7276208	7276968	He knew who we were.
7277489	7278389	So that was awesome.
7280030	7280951	So yeah, that was cool.
7280971	7282932	And you guys ended up staying at Target and got your Wii.
7282952	7288715	And then I sent my roommate, Christopher, to go so I could sleep in my nice warm bed and I didn't have to wait all night for a Wii.
7289055	7295559	Well, my first midnight lunch that I think I went to was when the Dreamcast came out.
7296219	7297080	September 9th, 1999.
7298440	7300281	We had already had a Dreamcast by then, for the record.
7300682	7302743	Because we had an import Dreamcast.
7303616	7308719	But Dan and I waited in line, and we were really only there for about maybe three, four hours.
7309480	7315383	My friend Mel, not Mel as in Mel and Melody, but Mel that manages the GameStop.
7315624	7316284	Yes, I know Mel.
7317425	7325370	She and I actually sat in line, and we actually walked over to Barnes & Noble, bought cheap books, and just sat in line reading cheap books off the clearance shelf.
7326654	7329395	I usually don't go to midnight releases.
7330256	7331857	I'm patient enough to wait until the next day.
7332197	7334458	With my job, I can't stay up all night playing a video game.
7334498	7335518	I have to go to work the next day.
7338582	7343644	The launch for the Wii, though, that was over a weekend.
7344025	7346426	Because I remember Marissa was in town.
7346666	7346926	Yes.
7347326	7357911	And we went to see Marissa for our buxom friend Marissa at some music convention, like for indie artists or something.
7357931	7359012	And it was a pretty cool thing.
7359532	7362874	And then you called us to let us know what you and...
7364687	7365428	We'll see you next time.
7380836	7381936	If you let us get in line.
7383017	7383357	Okay.
7384377	7385477	So we got in line.
7385497	7386337	So they held your place, basically.
7386357	7387178	They held us a place in line.
7387258	7390778	And from what I remember at Target, anyone that was in line before like 5, 6 a.m.
7391519	7392479	ended up getting one anyway.
7392779	7397560	Well, this one woman walked up just as they had given out all the numbers.
7397720	7399460	And everyone who was there got a number.
7400081	7400601	Except her.
7401341	7405422	She comes prancing her little butt up at 7 in the morning going...
7406832	7407653	So where's my number?
7408033	7409154	Um, you missed out, ma'am.
7410095	7410215	Ah!
7410975	7415719	And this was, of course, when the Wii was still hard to get, so it was... I think that we were smart.
7416019	7420423	We, we, we, we took the, uh, Ferengi rules of acquisition to heart.
7421464	7430711	And, uh, swallowed, uh, I think, was it, uh, uh, dignity and an empty sack is worth a sack?
7431371	7432632	Can you believe that was three years ago?
7432993	7433233	Yeah.
7433253	7433913	And then I went down.
7434134	7434334	Whew.
7435314	7435555	All right.
7436836	7441079	Anyhow, I guess any other emails tonight?
7443021	7443621	No!
7443922	7446184	Loki, did you ever do a midnight launch?
7447044	7448986	You don't have to because of your industry.
7449266	7450367	You get them early anyway.
7450567	7451028	Not always.
7451408	7451768	Not always?
7452889	7453530	A lot of times I do.
7453970	7455011	Now I get to end reserve stuff.
7455732	7457313	I think I did with Grand Theft Auto 4.
7457553	7458895	I think I went and picked it up at midnight.
7459375	7461016	I went to a Final Fantasy XII midnight launch.
7461137	7462077	There was hardly anybody there.
7464180	7467907	I used to, for all the other Grand Theft Auto games, used to go there and pick it up at midnight.
7469383	7476008	Alright, we've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7476268	7482313	Just a tip, folks, if you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please, please, pretty please, call the Echo Test Service first.
7482353	7489158	That's Echo123 is the username, and make sure you can hear yourself and the nice little British lady that does the little voice check with you.
7489218	7493942	It will help save the pain of us having a failed call.
7495223	7495403	Yes.
7496601	7497582	Left4Dead1 into Left4Dead2
7526003	7537030	and although Valve hasn't released a software development kit yet for Left 4 Dead 2 they had to do some workarounds in order to get it to work.
7538931	7552480	So basically it just requires you to change some files in the original game and of course you have to own both games for it to work and then you can go ahead and play those maps in your new game.
7554121	7554621	That's kind of neat.
7555694	7556679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7562048	7573816	By the way, speaking of editing levels, and I suppose this was inevitable as well, whenever there's a way to edit worlds in a side-scrolling game, it's inevitable that someone is going to make World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
7574296	7576557	But has it been done in a Super Mario Bros.
7576597	7577178	game before?
7577278	7579239	I don't know, but it's been done with Super Mario Bros.
7579319	7579579	Wii.
7580099	7588965	Within 48 hours of the game release, there were level editors already out for it, and sure enough, somebody made World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
7588985	7590626	Now, we're looking at a video here in studio.
7591266	7591786	Thank you for watching!
7611872	7613053	They'll have this up to full speed
7631854	7632895	When there's a will, there's a way.
7633596	7634697	Somebody figured out how to do it.
7635598	7641864	Now, my question is, I guess you can't really actually play this on a Wii yet, because there'd be no way to burn the disc and it would run, right?
7641924	7643225	You have to use an emulator for this.
7643966	7645767	Yeah, because this stuff is signed.
7647409	7653295	There may be a way, because you can do... Well, that might have been with... So now you can create hacked...
7655006	7655546	Smash Bros.
7655586	7659349	games, so maybe you could do that with New Super Mario Bros.
7659509	7659809	I don't know.
7659850	7664133	I think a lot of this stuff needs to be trunk-shined.
7664573	7667415	I don't remember how they pronounce it.
7667475	7668836	It's some sort of signing that they have.
7669356	7675821	Some user created a program to re-sign everything in there because everything's encoded, of course.
7676241	7678403	It's just a matter of time before the hackers figure it out.
7678968	7680149	It's time for you to give us a call.
7680169	7683551	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7683571	7689356	If there's a particular news topic that we didn't talk about tonight that you think we should give a little time to, now's the perfect time to get through.
7689396	7691337	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7691717	7693499	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7693779	7695520	Keep in mind our number is toll free in the U.S.
7695580	7699543	and Canada, but if you're in another country besides that, you want to play it safe and use Skype.
7700484	7704046	While we're waiting for some phone calls, oops, I think we might still be in do not disturb mode.
7704687	7705387	Oh, we're getting a call.
7705608	7706048	I guess we're not.
7707865	7708805	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7708825	7709225	Who's this?
7710426	7711326	Hi, this is Actdeft.
7711486	7712026	Hi, Actdeft.
7712046	7712526	What's on your mind?
7715007	7719628	Nothing much, but I want to talk about the PS2 launching in Brazil.
7719928	7727511	Please do, because I know you have probably a unique perspective on this because you live in Mexico, which is closer than we are to Brazil.
7727891	7734853	But all joking aside, you live in a country that isn't always supported by the game companies, correct?
7736093	7736313	True.
7737219	7739366	So what's your thoughts on the game launch in Brazil of PS2?
7741734	7752802	Basically, just government just doing the wrong things when importing electronic stuff and new technologies.
7753923	7755724	Here in Mexico, we have the problem.
7756344	7763249	It's not very big as Brazil since we already have PS3s, 360s, and Wiis here.
7763930	7766271	But there in Brazil, they charge...
7767832	7770153	And that's a tax?
7770173	7776935	That's just money that is collected as a tax for whatever purpose?
7791542	7791802	Yes.
7791982	7792923	That's crazy.
7810356	7813479	The Beatles Rock Band, it cost $60 in the U.S.
7814279	7822126	It cost Mexico like 1,000 pesos, which is around $70 for a game.
7823447	7829032	Though we have the consoles, we cost here 4,000 pesos, which is around $350 U.S.
7829072	7829293	dollars.
7829313	7829393	Wow.
7835287	7839430	But to be fair, a lot of this happens when you import from country to country too.
7839470	7843933	For instance, if we were to buy stuff from Japan, we'd be looking at very similar overheads.
7844593	7854820	But at the same time, and help me clarify this, when we import stuff from Japan, it's because we're paying a fee from whoever is grabbing it from Japan.
7855100	7860623	But are you talking about that even when the companies release things directly in Mexico, that there's still this overhead?
7860703	7864586	Or are you paying an overhead because your Beatles rock band copies are coming from the U.S. ?
7866431	7871494	Yeah, we basically pay the import fees because it comes from the U.S.
7871574	7878679	They sell it in official retailers here, and it's official software and merchandise.
7879900	7885924	Because it doesn't get made here exactly, it gets imported from the U.S.
7886644	7888025	We get charged that much.
7889786	7891768	The only company that does...
7892532	7896896	Distribute officially here in Mexico and mix their games in Mexico's Microsoft.
7897597	7908567	Like, for example, Halo 3, Gears of War, Forza 3, all cost around 600 pesos, 700 pesos, which is maybe even less than it costs in the US.
7909608	7910109	Interesting.
7911849	7918833	Describe briefly for our listeners before we have to go to another call how big the gaming scene is in Mexico.
7918873	7933403	Is it something that's only for the rich people can get into or is it something that it seems like it's pretty commonplace or does Mexico seem kind of behind where maybe everyone owns a Super Nintendo because those are easier to get now?
7936577	7940118	You're not that behind on hardware.
7940558	7945720	Like I said, people have here PlayStation 3, 360s, Wiis.
7947400	7955182	Maybe the people that don't have that kind of money to purchase a console from this generation have a PS2.
7956357	7982046	Which also costs a lot, but it's cheaper considering we cost over 1,000 pesos more than a PS2 I gotta say, that's not too dissimilar from what happens here Because even though I'm sure, you know, listening to the show, it sounds like we all have PS3s Because, you know, the host of the show, too You know, I know a lot of people that haven't taken that plunge to the 360, to the PS3 In a lot of cases, even the Wii, because they just can't afford it Starving students or what have you
7982486	7986810	in this day and age economy that PS2 is a lot more lucrative when it's only 99 bucks.
7988791	7990693	Yeah, it's not that different from the US.
7991794	8003884	Like I said, in Brazil, the official release this year after the official release and pretty much everyone else is just crazy.
8003924	8004144	Like,
8010689	8018510	That's why the Mega Drive or Genesis systems is pretty big over there because it's cheap.
8021431	8024471	It's cheap and also it's affordable for everyone there.
8025352	8033913	And you know, if it's cheaper to pirate it, or import it, or if it's cheaper to get it not the official way, that's what people are going to do, sadly.
8034353	8038754	Well, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you as always for the worldly perspective.
8038794	8039354	We appreciate it.
8040848	8041328	Thank you, you too.
8069651	8069911	I'm good.
8069931	8070892	How are you guys doing tonight?
8070912	8071112	Good.
8071152	8071812	Hey, real quick.
8072192	8074413	This is why they don't give us virtual console on the DS.
8074813	8077874	Because if they gave us virtual console on the DS, they couldn't be making the Sonic Collection.
8078595	8078995	Just saying.
8079015	8079375	Very true.
8079575	8079955	Just saying.
8080075	8080795	Hi, Rama.
8080835	8081336	Sorry about that.
8081396	8082536	Just had to get that thought out there.
8082856	8083977	What is on your mind, my friend?
8083997	8085237	We haven't heard from you in a few weeks.
8085777	8087058	I have to say I've missed you a little bit.
8087834	8090477	I just got back from another convention.
8090497	8093481	Last week, I was at Nintendo World for another special event.
8093581	8094362	And what was that?
8108329	8110190	The release of New Super Mario Bros.
8110230	8113032	for the Wii Of course, of course, how did that go?
8113833	8119657	It was fun, despite all the rain and the wetness You didn't have to compete with the tree lighting, did you?
8121178	8125501	Nope, but the tree was already there, but mostly everybody was there to check out New Super Mario Bros.
8125541	8134987	Wii, believe it or not Wow, okay Even though this makes for great radio, I am posting a link in the chatroom where they can check out pictures May I plug my website?
8135127	8135708	Of course you may
8136766	8137006	DJ Ranma S
8155083	8155763	Thanks for watching!
8174744	8180287	Yeah, there's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on all the broken links, there are actual images there from the event.
8180467	8181147	Okay, I believe you.
8181427	8185489	By the way, now that we have the whole Facebook group, go ahead and feel free to post the link there, too.
8185949	8186830	Oh, that I will do.
8187050	8187650	Yeah, see?
8187870	8188811	It has a practical purpose.
8188831	8189791	We should have had this a year ago.
8189851	8190231	That's all right.
8191392	8193713	Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the event.
8193973	8195474	You were at a convention this weekend, right?
8196074	8196314	Yes.
8196594	8197475	Okay, tell us about it.
8198340	8199321	or is it worth talking about?
8225475	8226175	That was fun.
8226235	8232056	Leaving, and half the fun was leaving, trying to find water, and if we couldn't find water, trying to find cups for water.
8232897	8240218	Now, I always ask this about conventions, because I know a lot of you go for the anime, but, you know, we talk about the games here, so what kind of, like, gaming room setup did they have?
8240718	8241658	Or any tournaments or anything?
8242438	8246279	I didn't get you to check out the tournaments, but the gaming rooms were slightly different.
8247359	8252801	I remember I had mentioned how one convention I went to, they had a dark room just for Rockman.
8253001	8254581	They pretty much had that for all the
8255239	8255839	and DarkSakura.
8285376	8289340	Not thoughts per se, but I wanted to know, did you guys try New Super Mario Bros.
8289380	8289461	Wii?
8289481	8291423	Because I wasn't able to listen to the show last week.
8291723	8292043	You know what?
8292083	8293845	Sadly, I haven't been able to pick it up yet.
8294166	8296869	I played some other games this week instead.
8297990	8301033	It seems like nobody here has the incentive to run out and get it.
8301894	8303975	The economy's taking the toll on us all, DJ Ranma.
8303995	8305575	We have to pick and choose our games carefully.
8305615	8311397	We can't run out and buy things and game companies don't send us stuff for free because we're just some shoddy little independent podcast.
8312238	8312698	I hear you.
8312738	8313598	I hear you completely.
8313758	8319720	I still did play it at E3 and I would like to play it because it's so different.
8319940	8322181	Playing things at E3 is not the same as playing them in your living room.
8322361	8322681	True, true.
8322861	8325783	But I will say this much about Super Mario Bros.
8325803	8326583	Wii and I'll be on my way.
8348231	8349672	If you liked Super Mario Bros.
8349692	8354333	3 and the elements of Super Mario World, you're definitely going to like New Super Mario Bros.
8354393	8354613	Wii.
8355073	8355714	Simple as that.
8356134	8359135	Well, those are two very, very big Mario games near and dear to my heart.
8359175	8376581	You know, I am hearing, I have heard glowing reviews from, and this is important to say, not just you and the folks who listen to this show, but the day the game came out, my Facebook page was littered with people that I sometimes forget play video games because they don't really talk about it very much that were excited about this release.
8377381	8380863	For instance, Ranma, you met her when I went to New York.
8380883	8383905	You know my friend that I go to visit in Brooklyn who I knew since college, right?
8384625	8384885	Right.
8385005	8387947	Who thought it was a little silly that we were all getting together to go to that video game store, right?
8388787	8393850	She's one of those people that posted that was all excited about the release of New Super Mario Bros.
8393890	8395471	Wii because she loves the old school one.
8397654	8402521	And didn't we all go to that game show just to get her a copy of The Guardian Legend or was it just for yourself?
8402561	8413276	That was for me to buy for her because she had recently hooked up her 8-bit Nintendo and I said, if you're going to hook up your 8-bit Nintendo, you need a copy of The Greatest Game Ever Made.
8413837	8414578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8431277	8431978	Fanime 2010?
8452572	8452772	Maybe?
8452792	8453913	Possibly.
8454093	8463020	I already have plans that weekend, but I do believe there's talks of OLRGCon, something like that, around 4th of July weekend, something like that.
8463280	8464101	I'm all for that.
8464161	8464601	You know what?
8464662	8466263	We need to set up some type of mini-con.
8466283	8467264	We just need to make it happen.
8467384	8475030	I don't know how to do it, but I have a friend who's into event planning, so I might have to seek some outside help, and we have to have ourselves an OLR mini-con.
8475110	8480354	I don't know how many people will come to Sacramento for it, but hey, if we can get like 30 people to show up, I'd call it a success.
8481892	8489324	Hey, if Jamie can get me to travel 3,000 miles and twist my arm to make it out there, it won't be hard to get everybody else to do so.
8489604	8490366	We'll try our best.
8490446	8491227	All right, take care, Rama.
8491247	8491668	Have a good one.
8492228	8492890	All right, later.
8492930	8493210	Later.
8494652	8498476	1877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8499037	8500398	Other last minute stories tonight, Loki.
8500819	8504542	Yeah, they're actually doing a dedicated store for EA Sports Active.
8504582	8510388	There's actually one that they opened up in Boston and San Francisco, which seems kind of odd.
8510428	8514112	I don't know how you could have a whole store for EA Sports Active.
8516021	8523208	Well, I mean, you know, if Wii Fit is doing as well as it is with its storefront setup and so forth, I'm kind of not surprised.
8523228	8524649	Yeah, but it's a dedicated store, though.
8525450	8525850	It's weird.
8525870	8526330	Okay, hold on.
8526370	8526891	We got another call.
8526931	8527792	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8527812	8528112	Who's this?
8528833	8529814	This is Deathwishing.
8529994	8530835	Hi, Deathwishing.
8530875	8532276	Another caller we haven't heard from in a while.
8532296	8532836	What's on your mind?
8533737	8537821	Well, I heard from you on a concert venue, but it's all about...
8539135	8539716	Modern Warfare 2
8555891	8559532	No, it's, I love, I just do it because I like to sing.
8560453	8561833	Well, I just, I love Glee, that's alright.
8562753	8563614	Anyway, what was I going to say?
8563874	8571716	Well, if you want me, I can show you a couple things, because I went to them in that release and won a thing, so if I can, if you guys can see the video feed on Skype.
8572577	8575878	Um, no, we don't have video, sorry.
8575898	8581740	I have a poster and a big cardboard cutout that I won from a GameStop.
8583544	8584065	Modern Warfare
8604943	8605384	Call of Duty MMO
8614505	8615465	Now, here's the thing.
8615945	8620487	This came up on last week's show, and we didn't get a whole lot of feedback on this, but this is what I want to ask.
8620907	8625828	You know, obviously we here at Orange Lounge Radio, this isn't usually the type of game we get into.
8625888	8630730	And it's not to knock on the game, it's just that I suck at first-person shooters, so I don't really get into these games usually.
8631270	8641053	What is it about Modern Warfare 2, as opposed to all these other types of shooter games that are out there, the Halos of the World and everything else, what is it about Modern Warfare 2 that is making it the must-have game of the year?
8641803	8669445	because it's borrowing aspects from just all these other games like it's borrowed aspects from what's it I want to say Halo because it has like medals and stuff now you earn it actually funny see here's the thing it borrowed stuff from Street Fighter with the titles and emblem system and it's exactly like Street Fighter for titles and emblems and like when they interviewed them about the emblem system I guess the Infinity Ward guys they played a crapload of Street Fighter they kind of
8670080	8682905	It's really, if you kind of want to look at it, it's really, you could say it's just another copy and paste, but the thing is they do it more well.
8683886	8688888	It's like a lot of underlying stuff you have to do with like the different, the way guns handle, it's really balanced.
8689708	8692669	Like if there's a guy that's really good, you can still find a way to take him out.
8692689	8696851	It's not like, it's not like on Halo where you have to be skill based, you know?
8697421	8701322	I really wish Microsoft would make Halo Remedial Edition for people like me.
8727403	8735047	What they shouldn't make really was like what they said they'd do in the first place was have skill matching so you play with people your skill level, which I never saw on Plenty.
8735067	8737629	That true skill thing, that was complete bullcrap.
8737809	8746333	Because a lot of people reset their skills or create new profiles and then you get all these really skilled people that are starting from ground level one.
8746373	8748134	They couldn't just made it for the console.
8748894	8752156	I wish, but sadly that feature doesn't seem to work too well.
8753277	8753417	And
8754855	8759218	The funny thing you should say, you remember how you were talking about that global thermonuclear warfare thing?
8759418	8760599	Yeah.
8760619	8766242	That's also a call sign in the game, so that kind of was a little weird.
8766763	8767883	Do you want to play a game?
8771486	8775709	Okay, dude from Sol, I forgot his name.
8775869	8779131	No, it's let's play global thermonuclear war.
8780424	8782187	Do you want to play a game?
8784009	8785612	I know, the kid wasn't even born yet, probably.
8785932	8789658	Alright, DeathWishing, do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
8791478	8793219	Are there any good fighting games coming out?
8794159	8795420	Super Street Fighter 4.
8796640	8802662	If you don't really want to take the plunge on that, Street Fighter 4 has gotten a big price reduction at a lot of retailers.
8802783	8803603	I've heard mixed things on Tekken 6.
8803643	8804703	I've never played a Street Fighter before.
8804723	8806444	It's Tekken, therefore it's worthy.
8806464	8808165	You might want to rent it first.
8819164	8822187	I don't know of any other big, big fighting games that people are very excited about right now.
8822227	8824229	I think Tekken 6 was kind of the anchor for the year.
8825069	8829794	I would bet there's a new Soul Calibur announced pretty soon, and some other games we'll be looking at next year.
8830114	8836560	But nothing outside of Super Street Fighter 2 that I, or sorry, Super Street Fighter 4 that I know of, unless somebody in chat happens to know.
8836840	8837100	Don't know.
8837761	8838141	So we'll see.
8839042	8841364	Alright, well, Deathwishing, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls.
8841484	8842605	Thank you so much for the call, as always.
8843086	8843286	Later!
8846926	8848387	Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8848407	8849268	We'll take one more call.
8849308	8849688	What the hell?
8849709	8852771	1-877-GAME-OLR No last minute stories.
8852871	8853252	That's it?
8854032	8855634	Well, there's not much I want to talk about.
8855654	8856334	Holy crap.
8857876	8858196	Alright.
8859918	8863441	Somebody in chat is saying, did you notice your Skype hit 250 contacts?
8863561	8865062	No, I don't think we have 250 contacts.
8865082	8865583	Do we really?
8866784	8867004	Maybe.
8867024	8869206	I've never bothered to check or
8869878	8870478	Count them all up.
8871039	8873940	We'll see if we get any more calls here.
8874681	8876962	And then we're going to call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8876982	8880403	Of course, we still have the afterbirth for the live listeners.
8881084	8882044	For the podcast listeners.
8882184	8882945	Tune in live sometime.
8884145	8888648	Chatters, by the way, Actdeft in chat says Blast Blue for the PSP.
8888968	8890269	Aren't you going to introduce me first?
8890929	8891449	Hello?
8891469	8893370	This is Legend of Zaku.
8893390	8894191	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
8894211	8894691	What's on your mind?
8895906	8906168	Nothing much, just killing another Sunday evening with my MacBook trying to, you know, do the ritualistic whittling of code and listening to your show.
8907009	8907789	Um, yes.
8909309	8917411	So, I kind of realized that, um, that, you know, that certain companies in particular kind of starting to hate on certain platforms.
8918191	8919692	Case in point, Gameloft.
8919912	8924973	You may have heard of them from such, uh, from such mobile games as, um,
8925862	8927363	I'm trying to think of a good game, love game.
8929664	8933847	What the hell are you typing onto your Skype headset?
8935188	8937829	It's as bad as Jamie when she puts the mic down next to her keyboard.
8938009	8947155	Long story short is that they're giving up on Android even before it's even hitting its peak.
8947675	8955300	The reason I'm bringing this up is because this proves that the sheer number of the fact that iPhone is so prevalent and
8956394	8964859	People are basically using it as a massive baseline, like some unreachable bar for other platforms to jump over.
8965800	8982450	In this case, they're just saying because we can make 400 times as much on the iPhone store with Apple's bullshit, in terms of going through the approval process, they could easily just kill funding for Android.
8983072	8984313	I mean, I can understand the rationale.
8984373	8985334	Money comes first to them.
9011041	9017484	I mean, in that sense, they have every right to make as much money as they please, but, you know, they kind of gave up.
9017944	9021826	They're acting a bit premature by just trying to, like, not give it a chance.
9021866	9031370	I guess it's because of the fact that in Android, you could actually get a refund and, you know, and all the try before you buy.
9032250	9033671	So that's really scaring them off.
9034892	9038196	You know, there's a comment in chat, fuck Apple in the ass, from Togacac.
9038496	9044483	You know, there's a lot of people that are of that mindset, but the problem is, Apple has a lock on this shit right now.
9044543	9045384	Like, seriously.
9046225	9048768	People, lots and lots of people have iPhones.
9049629	9051531	Well, one could argue that the way they...
9053335	9067727	you know the way they set up their their store you know their platform is you know the fact there's almost video game like where you need like a to pay licensing just to get it up it's kind of more streamlined granted you do have its growing pains with the approval process
9070458	9072659	Well, I'm not going to disagree with you.
9072679	9079424	I think Apple's approval process stinks, but at the same time, I don't think there's a lot we can do about it, especially when they're larger in charge.
9079504	9086368	If another phone steps up and actually gives them competition, but as of right now, there isn't anybody even close.
9086748	9097175	Except maybe Crackberries, the Crackberry Storm, but even then... I mean, I worked on Blackberries, and even then, you could easily distribute your apps on your own.
9097655	9100978	I mean, it's just now that Rin managed to get a BlackBerry app store.
9101358	9103820	But let's divert our attention.
9103860	9108203	I think we're deviating a bit too from the actual nature of this show.
9110124	9119451	Basically, I'm trying to bring up a little story that I saw on Kotaku about how Team Fortress 2 managed to get a lot more updates than any other Valve game to date.
9120171	9120831	I want to play as the sandwich.
9120851	9122352	I guess people, you know, have thrown the argument that
9140799	9143680	Maybe it's because they actually care about their platform.
9143740	9152483	I actually saw a little tidbit from what they actually quoted is that every time that Valve releases an update for Team Fortress 2, their sales go up 20%.
9153683	9164267	Whereas when you have Modern Warfare 2 where Activision is planning to sell you DLC that's already in-game and it may not be worth the
9165771	9166371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9184562	9191506	It was a way to keep the game relevant and newsworthy and continue to get it on all the blogs and create awareness for the game.
9191546	9193827	And I'm sure it's a similar story.
9193847	9199170	But the fact of the matter is that Valve basically put those T4 just to updates for free.
9199190	9205634	And I mean, you're talking about class updates, new game modes, literally for free.
9207106	9216915	and you see, you know, you see where Activision's, you know, and Microsoft's also guilty of this as well for just, you know, trying to build up, trying to like nickel and dime people.
9218457	9230027	Well, money talks, my friend, and if people say that they're not going to get nickeled and dimed by the Modern Warfare 2 DLC and they switch to hacking, as a lot of people are doing, then somebody's going to get the message loud and clear.
9230408	9230528	Yeah.
9231164	9239815	Yeah, I mean, for the $60 you're paying for the PC version, it's kind of like you're getting ripped off for the fact that even in Call of Duty 4, you got the maps for free.
9240276	9243180	And console players had to shell out money for it.
9243901	9245002	I don't know, I guess...
9246215	9257367	I guess it keeps in line where Activision is starting to come up with these crazy methods of trying to maximize profit on just about every game they release.
9258087	9258728	But that's them.
9258788	9267497	I guess that's their rationale for trying to be like EA in the middle of this decade.
9267657	9268138	Gold EA.
9269468	9276009	Saku, I've got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call and getting us to talk about topics that we might not otherwise talk about.
9277129	9277669	Have a good one, buddy.
9279070	9281090	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9281170	9282690	Apologies to those that didn't get through.
9282710	9284531	It was a pretty busy night on the phones tonight.
9285631	9298113	You can always send us, of course, an email mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or you can send us a message on Twitter or now we have Facebook and the official Orange Launch Radio fan page on Facebook which I'm going to give one more link to in our chat room
9298753	9301434	and hope that maybe we can get 100 listeners by tomorrow.
9301514	9312296	I'm sorry, 100 fans by tomorrow so that way we can grow our Facebook page into the next evolution of Facebook pages where we get our short URL and not an ugly-ass number there.
9312876	9318518	Anyhow, if there's no other last-minute stories, DarkSakura, Loki, nothing, I don't think I have anything either.
9318638	9319758	And nothing is I like fire.
9320178	9321538	Well, that's not news.
9321959	9325959	They have a Neo Geo two-slot system over here, full-size arcade.
9325999	9326840	Some guy is moving.
9326880	9327960	He's already sold his house.
9328281	9328442	Wow.
9328463	9328523	Wow.
9330731	9330951	Nice.
9331071	9332192	If you need one for your garage.
9332953	9338937	I'm tempted, but there might be some changes going on in Rob's life that I can't get into right now, but maybe later.
9339358	9339618	All right.
9339918	9343401	Anyhow, I'm going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.
9343521	9346303	Thanks, everybody, as always, for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9346964	9355430	Independent podcasts rely on word of mouth, and so we really appreciate it when you guys do tell your friends about the show, such as the dude who told all 650 of his Facebook friends.
9355750	9357972	But just keep in mind, again, don't spam it.
9358032	9358633	What are we at now?
9359261	9359481	DarkSakura
9382891	9383633	Loki, your final thought.
9384213	9386437	I guess we'll sign up for the fan page.
9387839	9388620	You haven't done it yet?
9388640	9390063	I'm not going to go do that, Matt.
9391405	9395431	I know you might not be a fan of the show, but you should probably go do that at some point.
9395832	9396893	And my final thought is...
9398709	9401610	I don't want to have to grade the big stack of papers that's sitting at home waiting for me.
9402290	9403551	So anyway, that's going to do it.
9403671	9405291	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us.
9405671	9408773	Even though it is a holiday weekend, we will still be back here next Sunday, right?
9408813	9409673	Nobody's got anything planned.
9409933	9413734	So we will be back here next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio to do it all over again.
9413794	9417295	So until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.
9417796	9420637	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9421097	9424258	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
