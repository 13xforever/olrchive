Tonight, November 1, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth

00:19.820 --> 00:24.220
version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video

00:24.220 --> 00:25.220
game?

00:25.220 --> 00:35.440
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
Radio.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.320
We are that video game show dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:41.320 --> 00:43.520
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me for the next few hours with my lovely co-host, Dark

00:48.240 --> 00:49.640
Sakura Jamie Summers.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
Hi.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.640
How are you Jamie?

00:51.640 --> 00:53.320
I'm the voiceless wonder.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.680
Yes, for those not aware from last week, because the podcast is a little bit behind right now,

00:58.680 --> 01:02.360
Dark Sakura is a little bit sickly with sinus infection, right?

01:02.360 --> 01:08.680
I'm getting over sinus infection and also, what the hell?

01:08.680 --> 01:11.360
I know, I hear video gaming noises coming out of the front row.

01:11.360 --> 01:18.080
Oh, yeah, it's Dan's playing GTA, whatever, and I also sprained my ankle last night.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
Dope.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.280
It has not been a lucky day.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.240
Well, I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.280
Yeah, it was cookies.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.840
Yay, cookies.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
And now you're here.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.080
So hopefully, remember, the last time you were feeling like shit was the night the President

01:30.080 --> 01:32.040
Cat thing happened, huge.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.040
So you never know.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.560
It might be a good night.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.320
Yeah, that was, oh, you were in a bad mood before that show started.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.840
No, I was, I was, I had a bad headache.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.160
Yeah, but see, President Cat made it all better.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
Yeah.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
All right.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.960
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.

01:45.960 --> 01:46.960
Hello.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.960
How you doing, Loki?

01:47.960 --> 01:48.960
Doing good.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.960
Good to hear it.

01:49.960 --> 01:50.960
How was your Halloween?

01:50.960 --> 01:56.280
Yeah, I was going home and passed out candy to children coming to our door, mostly older

01:56.280 --> 01:58.320
kids that really shouldn't be trick or treating.

01:58.320 --> 02:06.000
I mean, like, people that look like they were 16 to 19, you know, it's like, dude, seriously?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.120
And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.320
It's like, where's this country coming to?

02:11.320 --> 02:17.240
I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.

02:17.240 --> 02:26.160
This is, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
Nice.

02:27.160 --> 02:32.640
Well, it sounds like, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.680
Like I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and

02:35.680 --> 02:38.440
live journals and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.440
You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick or treating anymore.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.780
And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know, like, I even know when I was growing

02:45.780 --> 02:49.200
up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.880
And before we were allowed to eat it, we had to sift through it to make sure there were

02:52.880 --> 02:53.880
no needles in it.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.040
Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but nevermind.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.800
I think that I want to make chocolate molds that look like razor blades.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
You're sick.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.800
But funny.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
I know.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
I am very...

03:07.800 --> 03:10.240
Because, really, who puts razor blades in chocolate anyway?

03:10.240 --> 03:14.040
I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill Haunted House, which I know we

03:14.040 --> 03:16.000
were talking about at length on the show previously.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.560
You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to...

03:18.560 --> 03:22.160
Well, I mean, I'm just saying that the Haunted House is probably crap.

03:22.160 --> 03:27.080
Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've

03:27.080 --> 03:31.160
talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.760
They went to the Haunted House, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay, if

03:35.760 --> 03:37.120
this thing is back...

03:37.120 --> 03:40.800
I would play the voicemail on air if I could, if I could figure out how to wire up my iPhone,

03:40.800 --> 03:42.080
but she wouldn't care.

03:42.080 --> 03:47.320
But she basically said, okay, Rob, if this thing comes back next year, I will pay for

03:47.320 --> 03:52.120
you to go and go through this Haunted House just to see your reaction.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.600
Because if Mel almost crapped himself, I can't wait to see what your reaction is.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.060
I'm kind of abridging what she said there, but that's essentially what she said.

04:00.060 --> 04:02.640
So apparently, it was pretty scary.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
So and...

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
YouTube.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.280
I bet there are clips on YouTube.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.080
You should check that out, Dark Soccer, see if you can find some clips of the Haunted

04:09.080 --> 04:10.560
House on YouTube.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.760
And maybe if the YouTube makes me scream like a little girl, I can only imagine what the

04:13.760 --> 04:15.320
real Haunted House would do.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.320
So...

04:16.320 --> 04:20.500
Anyhow, we also are always joined by our chat room, chat.orangelaundrator.com.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.960
If you're listening live for the first time or what have you, please join our chat room.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.240
And we have a comment from Tiger Claw.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
I was a kid.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.800
I used to be into Halloween, but as I got older, I started questioning the legitimacy

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
of the holiday.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.800
And I try...

04:32.800 --> 04:37.060
You know, personally, I try not to look into Halloween too much as to like, I realize it

04:37.060 --> 04:41.880
has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in, but I'm just like,

04:41.880 --> 04:42.880
it's just kind of a...

04:42.880 --> 04:45.200
Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.760
Like, I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.680
But you know, it's just a day to be silly and have fun.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.720
You know, wear a costume, have fun.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.840
What are they letting these like pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.

04:57.840 --> 05:03.480
It's like, whoa, hey, what, did you decide to go with slut?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.280
I mean, it's just...

05:05.280 --> 05:06.280
It's ridiculous.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.080
Well, also, I don't know.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.720
I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think like it's a way that you

05:11.720 --> 05:16.560
can actually do cosplay like legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.240
Like that's kind of what Halloween is, right?

05:20.240 --> 05:27.000
My last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.960
Awesome.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.000
Last night I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show because of course that is like the holy

05:32.000 --> 05:33.480
holiday for Rocky Horror.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.600
I wore a Snuggie as my costume and it was actually very well received.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.560
So that's all I wore, was a Snuggie.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.480
I wore a Snuggie and no pants and I got cheers from ladies in the front couple rows.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.480
It was great.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.480
Awesome.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
Yeah, I had a good time.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
Anyhow.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.140
Oh, did you find some YouTubes?

05:50.140 --> 05:53.280
That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called

05:53.280 --> 05:55.200
a fag as well.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.200
This is true.

05:56.200 --> 06:02.880
In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually like came home from Target and I actually

06:02.880 --> 06:03.880
showed my roommate.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.200
And by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the

06:07.200 --> 06:10.120
Snuggie to my roommate and I'm like, look, look what I got, look what I got.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
He's like, you fag.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.760
No, he didn't really say that, but that was like his reaction pretty much.

06:14.760 --> 06:21.400
So anyhow, also we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube it looks like.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.240
So you find the good stuff.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.160
I can't, I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.160
You should find the camera's too shaky.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.240
See if there's a motion sick, see if there's a scary pyramid head or something.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.960
If you manage to make it that far in.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
All right.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.080
Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with How Was Your Gaming Week?

06:38.080 --> 06:41.320
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

06:41.320 --> 06:45.720
And Dark Sakura, I know you're trying to watch the movie there, but real quickly, did you

06:45.720 --> 06:48.360
play anything this week you want to share?

06:48.360 --> 06:54.080
I played Loom and then I remembered how long it was and I stopped playing and I downloaded

06:54.080 --> 06:57.640
Team Fortress 2 for three bucks.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.800
I guess a lot of people got in on that sale.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.560
Too bad I was out of town.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.120
I was mad.

07:04.120 --> 07:12.720
And I actually didn't play any Sims and I watched Dan play some of the Palette of Gay

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Tony.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.480
It was interesting.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.360
I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto IV sitting at home.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
How depressing is that?

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
You dork.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.960
I know.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.600
Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years and I just kind of like,

07:26.600 --> 07:27.760
eh, I'm too busy playing WoW.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.760
Oh, oh, oh.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.760
Yes?

07:29.760 --> 07:33.840
Um, I actually played some Rock Band last night.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.120
Good times.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.120
I miss Rock Band.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.960
It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end

07:38.960 --> 07:39.960
of the year.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Promise.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.440
Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.440
So.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.440
Uh, Loki.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
I can bring over my Rock Band.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.440
No, don't encourage me because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need

07:48.440 --> 07:49.440
to get mine fixed.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
Loki will bring Rock Band.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
He's an enabler.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.440
All right, yes, you're an enabler.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.440
Well, Loki, the enabler.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
How was your gaming week?

07:54.440 --> 07:59.520
Speaking of which, I was actually, um, well, it looks neat.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.060
I mean, cause it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted

08:03.060 --> 08:05.800
set or something.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.000
Oh, they're getting scared.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.200
I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.720
That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
What is that?

08:14.720 --> 08:17.360
Oh, it's, I think it's a fan.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.960
This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.240
I think he fell.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.240
Oh, whatever.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.240
Yeah, this is crap.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.320
If, if Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.960
Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?

08:28.960 --> 08:34.040
All right, so I picked up Lego Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock

08:34.040 --> 08:36.000
Band 2.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.520
The track list is pretty cool on it.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.160
I like a lot of stuff that's in there, so it's gonna be fun to actually be able to put

08:42.160 --> 08:43.920
it all into Rock Band 2.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.960
And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you

08:48.960 --> 08:52.760
know, Lego stuff running around and the story modes kind of need to have little cut scenes

08:52.760 --> 08:56.280
and stuff that you expect from like another Lego Telltale game.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.080
I don't know, it's just pretty much what you expect.

09:01.080 --> 09:06.640
But the track list is awesome, so I'd say pick it up for that reason only.

09:06.640 --> 09:13.840
Then, of course, you know, because this week we had the Ballad of the Gay Tony come out,

09:13.840 --> 09:18.600
of course I picked up Episodes of Delivery City.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.880
And the game's pretty sweet.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.720
I like a lot of the stuff they added in there that's really over the top.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.360
The new weapons are pretty nice.

09:28.360 --> 09:34.480
But Rockstar has this thing that they like to do where they take something that was working

09:34.480 --> 09:38.120
absolutely perfectly and then they go and fuck it up.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.800
They did this with, you know, Lost and Dan where they took out the helicopters in free

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
mode.

09:43.800 --> 09:48.280
Well, they decided, hey, you know what, multiplayer's kind of fun, let's go ahead and fuck with

09:48.280 --> 09:49.440
that some more.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
So what did they do?

09:50.440 --> 09:55.320
They went ahead and they took all the multiplayer maps, which used to be pretty wide open.

09:55.320 --> 10:00.480
I mean, you'd get to pick different parts of the island, you can drive around, I mean,

10:00.480 --> 10:01.480
it's really overworld.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.120
It's kind of what, you know, Grand Theft Auto's known for.

10:05.120 --> 10:09.760
And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it

10:09.760 --> 10:15.120
where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know,

10:15.120 --> 10:21.040
big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections

10:21.040 --> 10:23.700
of the map that weapons will spawn now.

10:23.700 --> 10:28.480
So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your death

10:28.480 --> 10:29.480
matches in.

10:29.480 --> 10:34.360
Which, it's great if they wanted to add that in if you were looking for, you know, some

10:34.360 --> 10:36.560
tighter places to play at.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.980
But give the option to the buyer, to the consumer, instead of just replacing all the perfectly

10:41.980 --> 10:44.720
good spots with these really small areas.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.440
Now we've gotten, like, one area that we're kind of used to now that's at the bottom of

10:48.440 --> 10:54.360
the map and, like, construction area, but it still pisses me off, though, because that

10:54.360 --> 10:57.400
was one of the things we were really looking forward to is driving around, you know, in

10:57.400 --> 11:02.760
the new APC, you know, possibly using new helicopters in Deathmatch, you know, parachutes,

11:02.760 --> 11:03.920
all that fun stuff.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.900
But you can't because you're stuck in these really small little confined areas instead.

11:08.900 --> 11:14.280
And that's really the only downside I see to the whole Lost in Dam- or not Lost in Dam,

11:14.280 --> 11:19.920
the Ballad of Gay Tony, is that they really fucked up, you know, Deathmatch for that stuff.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.020
But hey, if you like more confined area and you don't really want to use vehicles because

11:24.020 --> 11:29.000
you sure as hell can't in these sections of the map, it'd be really hard to get a vehicle

11:29.000 --> 11:32.360
in there, then that's going to be something that you'll look forward to.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.680
But you know, personally for me, I like more of the open world stuff, I like driving around,

11:36.680 --> 11:40.320
shooting people from cars, and that kind of stuff, but you can't really do that with this

11:40.320 --> 11:41.540
new expansion.

11:41.540 --> 11:45.680
So if you are looking for better multiplayer experience, go Lost in Dam, they're the original

11:45.680 --> 11:46.680
game.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.680
Other than that though, it's pretty sweet, all the new weapons are awesome, they even

11:50.680 --> 11:56.460
add some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super

11:56.460 --> 12:00.080
punch which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.080
Falcon Punch?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.580
Something like that.

12:02.580 --> 12:05.060
But it's great with the super punch that you can kick people in the nuts and they kind

12:05.060 --> 12:10.380
of fly into the air, so that's pretty sweet.

12:10.380 --> 12:16.020
And then yes, people have already started modding the game and stuff, and hopefully

12:16.020 --> 12:21.760
if I know, or if I figure it out, I will fix multiplayer so that I can actually, you know,

12:21.760 --> 12:23.760
spawn where I want to and whatnot.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.880
But it's a lot of work, and right now we're just kind of making do.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.520
But seriously, why do they have to go and fuck that shit over?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
They always do this.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.120
They don't fix the stuff that needs to be fixed, and then they fix stuff that doesn't

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
need to be fixed.

12:34.120 --> 12:39.920
So that's it, that's, oh and DJ Hero, I played a little DJ Hero this week.

12:39.920 --> 12:44.400
Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene though,

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
lol.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.800
Is that, and that's from chat.orangetonstrator.com if you're just joining us tonight.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.260
Join us in our chat room.

12:51.260 --> 12:54.720
Is there controversial something something going on in the new expansion, or are we just

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
all desensitized to it now?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.880
No, I think, I don't think it's anything new.

12:57.880 --> 13:02.920
I mean, it's a way I think he's talking about, there's, you can, if you dance well enough

13:02.920 --> 13:06.360
I guess in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
in the bathroom.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.400
It doesn't show anything.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.300
Just like real life, amazing.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.300
Just like real life, yes.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.300
Only if you're a politician.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.300
It doesn't really show anything.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.980
It's just as censored as, say, the original game.

13:16.980 --> 13:22.960
It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all, but it's just something funny.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.860
And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.

13:24.860 --> 13:29.500
You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.

13:29.500 --> 13:35.740
That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex, but I think

13:35.740 --> 13:40.120
if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.560
Just saying.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.760
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.640
Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.400
Yeah, I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
No, I'm just kidding.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.440
They're all like 30 years old.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.360
How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?

13:57.360 --> 13:58.360
I don't know.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.360
All right.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.360
I'm not going to go buy them.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
I mean, come on.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.000
Although you were trying to tell me to buy a cabinet earlier this week.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
It's burger time.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, I know.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.800
It's a burger time cabinet, but I don't like it when there's no price on it.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
It makes it very...

14:10.800 --> 14:11.800
I guess I could always go check it out.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.240
Well, you just ask them to see how much you want for it, or you offer them like, okay,

14:15.240 --> 14:17.960
I'll give you two hundred for it, and they can just say...

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
And they laugh at my face.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.960
Well, then whatever.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
It's the internet.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.080
They're not really going to laugh at your face.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.080
It's just the internet.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.400
I'll use a fake email.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.600
My gaming week, pretty much, I was out of town most of the weekend, so I didn't get

14:29.600 --> 14:34.600
a lot of time to play a whole lot of new stuff, although my Paladin did hit level 60 in World

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
of Warcraft.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Thank you very much.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
This is the character I rolled the first week of September.

14:38.600 --> 14:43.660
So I got to 60 in two months, so thank you to the Quest Helper add-on, which really made

14:43.660 --> 14:46.640
me blaze through the quest very quickly, and so forth.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.120
One new game I did play this week, though, outside of World of Warcraft, DJ Hero.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.600
I finally got my hands on this game.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.200
Obviously, Loki's brought it to the show the past couple of times.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.600
You've gotten to hear the game through his experience.

14:56.600 --> 15:00.760
I did not put my hands on this game, really, until this week when I bought the game.

15:00.760 --> 15:04.280
I chose to pick up the PlayStation 3 version of the game.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.520
So I bought the game, and I love it.

15:08.520 --> 15:13.120
The number one thing I can say about it is that it truly feels refreshing.

15:13.120 --> 15:18.440
I think the problem I'm starting to have with a lot of these rock band and guitar hero and

15:18.440 --> 15:22.800
the knock-offs, like Rock Revolution and so forth, is that the whole guitar drum thing

15:22.800 --> 15:24.920
is starting to feel a little stale.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.960
Granted, there are some bright lights within that whole genre.

15:27.960 --> 15:33.520
For instance, the Beatles rock band was something truly special to that particular genre, I

15:33.520 --> 15:38.200
guess if you want to just call the Beatles a genre, which they kind of are.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.720
And some of these other little highlights.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.320
But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.280
And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.

15:46.280 --> 15:53.520
I mean, really, to take the idea of mash-ups and making a game out of it is really cool.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.800
Because every time I play a song, I feel like, wow, this really isn't something I've heard

15:57.800 --> 15:59.040
before.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.280
And that's a feeling I haven't had since the days I was really hardcore into the Japanese

16:03.280 --> 16:06.020
music games, like Beatmania 2DX.

16:06.020 --> 16:10.960
Speaking of Beatmania, this game has zero in common with Beatmania.

16:10.960 --> 16:15.240
So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the

16:15.240 --> 16:19.720
eye and you tell them, you're a fucking fool, or a sheep or something.

16:19.720 --> 16:26.420
Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.440
The games both have falling notes.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.520
But it's like comparing apples to oranges.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.320
Sure, they're both fruit.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.320
But you know what?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.160
They're completely different tastes.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.800
And for that reason, there's going to be some people that don't care for DJ Hero who might

16:39.800 --> 16:43.440
be really into Beatmania 2DX and vice versa.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.800
And if you're into 2DX, then that's when you go and buy Scratch, or whenever the hell that

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
comes out.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.040
Well, even then, though, that's a completely different genre of music.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.600
And as we were kind of talking about a little bit with Bobby on the tease call tonight,

16:53.600 --> 16:57.720
because Bobby is right before us here on the lovely All Games Radio, where we do our show

16:57.720 --> 17:01.480
every week, he was kind of talking about, you know, I'm not so interested in DJ Hero

17:01.480 --> 17:03.800
because I didn't really care for the song list.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.800
There's not a lot of...

17:04.800 --> 17:06.980
I'm not really feeling the mashup thing.

17:06.980 --> 17:07.980
You know what?

17:07.980 --> 17:10.680
The song list is a really important part of a music game.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.680
If you're not going to...

17:11.680 --> 17:15.640
Like, for instance, I don't think I would ever be interested in buying Karaoke Revolution

17:15.640 --> 17:19.920
Country unless the song list was suddenly all Dolly Parton songs, okay?

17:19.920 --> 17:24.960
It's just not a genre of music that I'm particularly interested in, you know, spending that kind

17:24.960 --> 17:25.960
of money.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.960
You know, obviously, the music taste is the number one thing.

17:28.960 --> 17:33.800
So for that reason, although I think Scratch and Beatmania are going to play a lot more

17:33.800 --> 17:38.400
closely similar than Beatmania and DJ Hero do, I don't think they're going to attract

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900
the same audience at all.

17:39.900 --> 17:45.080
The funny thing is, I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there

17:45.080 --> 17:47.720
is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
But you know what?

17:48.720 --> 17:51.840
I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.320
I don't really care for Jay-Z.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.840
I can't stand Eminem.

17:55.840 --> 18:02.240
I think he's the biggest, like, overexposed artist I can think of in the past, like, 50

18:02.240 --> 18:03.240
years.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
Cool.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.240
I just...

18:05.240 --> 18:06.240
I don't like him.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.240
I don't like his personality.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.240
I don't like his songs.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
I hate him.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.120
But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed

18:13.120 --> 18:15.440
the songs together are actually kind of cool.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
Yeah, some of them are not bad.

18:16.440 --> 18:20.480
Like, that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny, like,

18:20.480 --> 18:21.520
and I dug it.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.880
And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.480
It felt like this whole new, different song I never really heard before.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.480
And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.

18:29.480 --> 18:36.360
Like, the whole, like, the Jacksons and Semi-Charm Life by Third Eye Blind, I frickin' love that

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
song.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.040
And I gotta say, I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show,

18:41.040 --> 18:44.960
but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is, like, my favorite song in

18:44.960 --> 18:45.960
the game right now.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.920
And it gets stuck in my head during the day, like, the little back and forth.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.600
So, you know, I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long

18:53.600 --> 18:54.600
time.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.880
And I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.160
You have the three buttons.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.440
You have the scratching.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.520
You have certain direction scratching.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.800
You have cross-fading.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.220
You have the euphoria button.

19:06.220 --> 19:09.400
You have the sampling that you change with the little knob.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.960
You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.280
Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.360
Of course, granted, I jumped right in and started playing in hard mode after, you know,

19:17.360 --> 19:20.560
acing the tutorial, but dammit, I'm having fun.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.560
Now, is the game perfect?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
No.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.920
The core game itself is a heck of a lot of fun.

19:26.920 --> 19:31.720
But the shell around that core game is, like, not even there.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.180
Like the icing on the cake, not there.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.640
This is like an angel food cake.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.640
It's good.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.640
It's yummy.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.160
But it's not, it doesn't have, like, that frosting that makes it extra awesome.

19:41.160 --> 19:46.200
And what I mean is, there's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool and even

19:46.200 --> 19:49.420
Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up

19:49.420 --> 19:53.840
to 11, or like in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that

19:53.840 --> 19:55.600
all the stages were set around.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.440
And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the

19:59.440 --> 20:01.640
game, something to tie everything together.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.420
DJ Hero doesn't really have that.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.720
It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.700
And the game never really walks you through the menus.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.740
You don't really know, like, am I supposed to play these custom set lists, or can I just

20:15.740 --> 20:17.200
do my own thing?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.080
And I can't really do my own thing anyway.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.480
I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.520
It's a little weird.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.240
It doesn't ruin the game by any means.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.800
It's just a little odd.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.760
The interface is strange.

20:30.760 --> 20:34.800
I don't like that the leaderboards are in, like, the menu.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.240
I have to be honest, I feel like the game was rushed in that regard.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.280
Like, they probably took a long time building the shell of the game, you know, the main

20:43.280 --> 20:48.140
game itself, and the song list, and making that all perfect, and they did a kickass job.

20:48.140 --> 20:51.960
But the rest of it feels just kind of, like, tacked on, like everything that kind of streams

20:51.960 --> 20:52.960
it all together.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.120
So, for that reason, I can't say it's a perfect game.

20:56.120 --> 21:00.380
Oh, and online is just kind of there.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.100
You know, there's really nothing to it.

21:02.100 --> 21:05.680
You and somebody else play the song at the same time, whichever one of you gets the high

21:05.680 --> 21:06.680
score wins.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.680
Whoopee!

21:07.680 --> 21:12.520
You know, there's no real, like, special modifiers, or you can't even use rewind in online mode,

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
which makes sense.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.680
There's a lot of stuff that just kind of could be there that's not.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.320
But is this a real kickass first entry in a future franchise?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.040
Yes, yes, yes.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.040
It's a great first game.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.660
You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that, too, where there wasn't really

21:28.660 --> 21:30.640
a lot of glue holding it together.

21:30.640 --> 21:34.160
I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.080
But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.320
And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.600
It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.880
Tigerclaw says, so there's no battle of the DJs mode?

21:47.880 --> 21:48.880
Not really.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.120
I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy I guess

21:52.120 --> 21:57.760
you say, frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.

21:57.760 --> 22:03.120
I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.540
In fact, it's kind of funny.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.880
I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3,

22:08.880 --> 22:13.240
or I really am better than I give myself credit for, because I'm in like the top 100 on a

22:13.240 --> 22:14.480
bunch of songs right now.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.160
Of course the game just came out last week, I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick

22:18.160 --> 22:20.640
out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.

22:20.640 --> 22:26.680
I'm trying to look at some more chat comments, chat.orangelaunchmedia.com.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.560
Vanice Luxe, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when

22:31.560 --> 22:34.560
they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.

22:34.560 --> 22:42.840
And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment, it's a $120 investment.

22:42.840 --> 22:50.360
So, you know, try this out at the store, try this out at a friend's house, don't drop $120

22:50.360 --> 22:55.880
on a game just because I said to, check it out first, because the game's not for everyone.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.480
You know, the scratching and all that stuff kind of puts some people off.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.960
I have a lot of fun with it, I think Loki feels very similar to how I reviewed the game,

23:01.960 --> 23:05.000
I don't know if Jamie's really played it or how she feels, I know she likes the songs

23:05.000 --> 23:11.280
at least, from what she said on a previous show, but, you know, again, it's $120 is a

23:11.280 --> 23:15.240
big investment, until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it

23:15.240 --> 23:21.080
will, but, not, yeah, I mean, as the chatter said there, not for about a year.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
So.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.320
Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.320
I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.680
No, I think that's about it.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.520
Tigercolonchat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music

23:35.520 --> 23:38.680
for DJ Hero, imagine if they released a trance pack.

23:38.680 --> 23:43.120
You know what's funny, one of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind

23:43.120 --> 23:48.600
of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but it wouldn't,

23:48.600 --> 23:53.160
there, there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.160
I like the, um, Yo-Yo Girl.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.240
I mean, there's tons and tons of different types of songs, and the mashups is a whole

23:59.240 --> 24:00.680
new genre altogether.

24:00.680 --> 24:07.760
You know, you have everything from Queen, to Gwen Stefani, to Third Eye Blind, to Jay-Z,

24:07.760 --> 24:13.800
to Paula Abdul, but the interesting thing about it is that they do use a lot of songs

24:13.800 --> 24:18.280
a lot, and that is one place the song list could improve, is that did I really need four

24:18.280 --> 24:23.120
different mixes of Hollaback Girl, but when you have like 93 songs to choose from, it's,

24:23.120 --> 24:27.600
you know, it doesn't really bother me at all.

24:27.600 --> 24:34.480
And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the Gamestop code, and

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
they're both great.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.000
So, but we'll talk more about that later in the show.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.360
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.460
Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.

24:48.460 --> 24:52.320
This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, AlphaKananagram, and it's running

24:52.320 --> 24:57.680
on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country, but

24:57.680 --> 25:05.160
I had to say this because the article is called, We's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.

25:05.160 --> 25:08.800
The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the

25:08.800 --> 25:14.880
worst selling Wii title ever, Sukiban Satchourena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership

25:14.880 --> 25:17.180
of a talking female cat, Rina.

25:17.180 --> 25:21.300
It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies, then they linked

25:21.300 --> 25:22.800
to a couple of YouTubes.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.720
Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on

25:26.720 --> 25:33.240
Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity,

25:33.240 --> 25:37.880
creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.480
Fuck you.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.220
Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup,

25:44.220 --> 25:51.040
and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debuggles, some might wonder if perhaps

25:51.040 --> 25:55.280
some kind of quality seal system might be useful.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.960
Now obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got

25:58.960 --> 26:03.840
so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even

26:03.840 --> 26:06.080
cite what source they're using.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.080
You know what's funny?

26:07.080 --> 26:10.880
I bet it's 100 copies imported to the US.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.680
It's probably more like it.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.040
Yeah, 1% of their sales.

26:15.040 --> 26:20.600
I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter

26:20.600 --> 26:22.920
has 200 some odd followers alone.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.800
I mean, really?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.000
Like give me a source of some sort, please.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.600
I think they also published something that says it has sold more.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.880
Yeah, so I don't know how I feel about that, but that was linked by a chatter, and if in

26:34.880 --> 26:40.140
case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from

26:40.140 --> 26:45.040
foreign countries such as that one, you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangeorangereader.com.

26:45.040 --> 26:50.040
I just wanted to let you know, please source or GTFO.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.120
So there you go.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.520
And Loki, you're going on to VG charts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?

26:55.520 --> 26:56.520
Of course.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Of course you are.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.120
I don't know if they'll actually have, you know, it just came out.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.400
I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.960
Well, they're pretty quick.

27:04.960 --> 27:13.200
Of course, this is loading very slowly, and I don't even know if this is on here.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.200
I don't know.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.960
Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only

27:16.960 --> 27:18.260
sold 100 copies.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.260
Please deny.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.880
Okay, well, let me put it this way.

27:21.880 --> 27:25.440
It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.

27:25.440 --> 27:30.760
Easy, easy, easy.

27:30.760 --> 27:31.760
I know.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.760
I know.

27:32.760 --> 27:33.760
It's just, I don't know.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.520
There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to, just wants to kick

27:36.520 --> 27:38.320
President Cat while they're down.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.480
This site is like the Glenn Best of gaming.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.480
I'll ask them on Twitter.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.480
What?

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
I'll ask them on Twitter.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.480
Yeah, ask them on Twitter.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.480
All right.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.480
I know.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.480
I agree with Gamer Girl in chat.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.080
How can you not like Pres Cat?

27:52.080 --> 27:56.160
Game Guru says, quality seal, dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game

27:56.160 --> 27:57.600
worked on the system.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
True enough.

27:58.600 --> 28:03.480
Game Guru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.

28:03.480 --> 28:08.160
And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played

28:08.160 --> 28:12.280
the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the

28:12.280 --> 28:15.120
game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.

28:15.120 --> 28:21.840
They don't have any sort of anything.

28:21.840 --> 28:26.320
There's no sales figures yet.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.200
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room, chat.orangeonstrader.com says, it was former

28:30.200 --> 28:32.560
President Dog spreading the rumors.

28:32.560 --> 28:33.560
I bet.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.360
I'm President Dog.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.360
Prime Minister Dog.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.800
All right.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.520
Let's move on.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.040
Let's move on, actually get to some real gaming stories.

28:43.040 --> 28:47.920
I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean and

28:47.920 --> 28:48.920
you're a douche.

28:48.920 --> 28:49.920
No, I'm just kidding.

28:49.920 --> 28:50.920
I understand.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.360
You can also follow us on Facebook.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.560
We have a club there, the OL Army and all that fun stuff.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.560
Awesome.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.560
Yes, DarkSakura.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.280
I just finished the most amazing French toast.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
Congratulations.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.600
Where was your French toast from?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.700
It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.320
Will it give you a magic voice back?

29:07.320 --> 29:08.600
Will it give you your voice back?

29:08.600 --> 29:13.960
Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi because

29:13.960 --> 29:18.040
remember I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.880
Would you like one?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.320
Actually, I would love that.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.600
I'm a little hot in here.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.240
I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because you're diseased, but...

29:26.240 --> 29:27.240
My disease.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.240
Thank you.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.240
No.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.240
Your affliction.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.240
No.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.680
As I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm and actually I wear

29:34.680 --> 29:42.040
a scarf to work is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start

29:42.040 --> 29:44.840
coughing.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.120
The warm is keeping the mucus flowing.

29:47.120 --> 29:51.440
Well, certainly a lot of our listeners in chat are noticing the coughing and sending

29:51.440 --> 29:52.840
well wishes your way tonight.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.600
Also, for the record though, it makes it a lot easier for me to do this.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.480
Oh, stop it.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
All right.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.360
Anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.160
Loki, start us off if you would tonight.

30:06.160 --> 30:14.240
Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service

30:14.240 --> 30:15.240
to the PS3.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.840
Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox

30:18.840 --> 30:23.720
360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from

30:23.720 --> 30:31.920
Netflix and basically using this disc, it'll launch a program that'll allow you to stream

30:31.920 --> 30:38.360
content much like you would through the Xbox Live Marketplace.

30:38.360 --> 30:44.700
They said that they are working on a new integrated version of it, however, for whatever reason,

30:44.700 --> 30:51.840
the solution's not expected to arrive until late 2010, whether that may be because they're

30:51.840 --> 30:59.760
under contract with, say, the Xbox 360, Microsoft and whatnot, probably has something to do

30:59.760 --> 31:02.600
with that.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.120
That's kind of neat though that they're finally allowing people to do that.

31:05.120 --> 31:12.680
I know it's something that they've been remembering for a while now with a lot of the surveys,

31:12.680 --> 31:13.680
stuff like that.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.960
It's possible to come into the Wii at some point.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.800
It's neat.

31:18.800 --> 31:24.240
Would you use this now since your 360's out of commission?

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
Definitely.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.760
I was kind of excited to hear this news.

31:26.760 --> 31:33.520
My 360 will be replaced slash fixed by the time this thing comes out, but I'm going to

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
be honest.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.680
I've just been super lazy in getting my 360 fixed.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.640
My gaming need has been satiated by World of Warcraft and the stuff I've been playing

31:41.640 --> 31:45.000
on my PS3, so I haven't felt that urgency to get my 360 fixed.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.480
This certainly doesn't get me in any rush, but what I find fascinating about this is

31:49.480 --> 31:53.040
that just last week on the show, I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke

31:53.040 --> 31:54.400
while we were live last week.

31:54.400 --> 32:00.220
We just didn't catch it, but I was just talking about, like, hey, if Microsoft wants to compete

32:00.220 --> 32:02.400
with Sony, because what's Sony's big thing right now?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.480
It does everything.

32:04.480 --> 32:09.560
To be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP, and to some extent,

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
the PS3.

32:10.560 --> 32:16.080
It does a lot of stuff very well, but Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system, which

32:16.080 --> 32:22.120
includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix, and streaming Netflix could kind of compete

32:22.120 --> 32:23.680
with Blu-ray in a way.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.680
Oops.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.160
Now the PS3 has Netflix too.

32:26.160 --> 32:32.280
Yeah, but you have to order it, and mainly they were saying, like I said before, one

32:32.280 --> 32:37.440
of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around

32:37.440 --> 32:44.480
a clause that they had for their contract with Microsoft, saying that basically this

32:44.480 --> 32:49.520
cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
like that.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.520
So it's not appearing on a dashboard.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.520
It's actually a program now that someone else is running.

32:54.520 --> 33:00.360
So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
I don't know.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.120
What do you think this means for the whole console wars?

33:03.120 --> 33:05.960
Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground, or is it just...

33:05.960 --> 33:07.600
No, I don't think it means anything.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.920
Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.680
It's just it's good for Netflix.

33:13.680 --> 33:20.920
That's basically it, because I think it's not going to sell any systems.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.880
I don't really think it's a really big point.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.560
It'd be hard for them to kind of advertise it, I guess, as a feature of the system, seeing

33:27.560 --> 33:32.680
as you have to order it, that'd be like, this system plays Uncharted 2 or something like

33:32.680 --> 33:33.680
that.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.400
I can't really advertise that, but I don't know.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.400
It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works, if it works as well as it does

33:41.400 --> 33:47.440
on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.880
It's just a Blu-ray disc.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
So it'll be interesting.

33:51.880 --> 33:56.000
Well, the Microsoft interface is very bare bones, so I'm wondering if it won't be a little

33:56.000 --> 34:00.520
more... I can't imagine the look is going to be the same, because on Netflix 360, the

34:00.520 --> 34:03.560
look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.

34:03.560 --> 34:08.160
So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all, so I'm kind of curious

34:08.160 --> 34:10.920
if it's going to be maybe better.

34:10.920 --> 34:11.920
I don't know.

34:11.920 --> 34:12.920
Maybe.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.920
It could be worse, too.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
It could go either way.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.400
It could be interesting if it uses a crossbar style interface, where all your genres maybe

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
are in the crossbar.

34:19.400 --> 34:25.960
It'll probably be their video marketplace, or even just the normal marketplace where

34:25.960 --> 34:28.680
you've got rows of stuff on there.

34:28.680 --> 34:29.680
I don't know.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.520
Good question from Derek H in chat, who hosts another show here on the network, Dead Pixel

34:33.520 --> 34:34.800
Live, on weekdays.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.620
If it uses BD Live, like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray

34:38.620 --> 34:40.480
player that is BD Live capable?

34:40.480 --> 34:44.000
Well, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.560
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this smart Blu-ray Live thing,

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
and the Wii sometime as well.

34:50.560 --> 34:55.680
This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.

34:55.680 --> 34:58.360
This is about Netflix getting what they want.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.880
So I don't know about this particular update.

35:00.880 --> 35:07.000
I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that I would just have a

35:07.000 --> 35:13.540
hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player, because they don't really have strong

35:13.540 --> 35:15.840
processors in them.

35:15.840 --> 35:20.360
I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would

35:20.360 --> 35:23.560
be difficult, I would think, to stream...

35:23.560 --> 35:30.900
Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video and having

35:30.900 --> 35:34.840
it look good, it does require some processing power.

35:34.840 --> 35:40.120
I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's BD Live capable would be capable of

35:40.120 --> 35:41.120
that.

35:41.120 --> 35:47.000
I could be wrong, but I would think it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does

35:47.000 --> 35:49.360
streaming video.

35:49.360 --> 35:54.720
Ionotropic in our chat room wants to remind us, too, the disk-based Netflix for PS3 is

35:54.720 --> 35:56.680
supposed to be a temporary solution.

35:56.680 --> 36:00.900
They said the disk won't always be required, and you were talking about the contractual

36:00.900 --> 36:04.160
stuff maybe until 2010, so it makes sense.

36:04.160 --> 36:08.560
But I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.

36:08.560 --> 36:13.600
Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value, and it's a win for Netflix, and

36:13.600 --> 36:15.960
it's a small win for Sony.

36:15.960 --> 36:20.320
But also, Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room, isn't it a little late to put this into

36:20.320 --> 36:22.600
the console wars concept?

36:22.600 --> 36:26.780
Most everyone that will ever get this gen's systems already have one.

36:26.780 --> 36:28.480
I'm not so inclined to agree.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.760
I don't think Blu-rays really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.

36:32.760 --> 36:37.180
I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right, but remember,

36:37.180 --> 36:42.040
we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which Wii is kicking butt at right

36:42.040 --> 36:43.040
now.

36:43.040 --> 36:50.600
The problem is, the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step

36:50.600 --> 36:51.600
now.

36:51.600 --> 36:58.960
DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick, and people are kind of hesitant like, well, if I convert

36:58.960 --> 37:05.500
my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray, how soon is the next thing going to be that

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
comes along?

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
I don't want to do that.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.840
I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and save some money that way

37:10.840 --> 37:15.240
because it's not really that big a difference, or hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case

37:15.240 --> 37:17.340
there is no difference.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.340
I don't know.

37:18.340 --> 37:25.280
It's just not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.

37:25.280 --> 37:31.120
Fifth Dream in the chat, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current gen

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
stuff.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.660
Certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.

37:33.660 --> 37:37.600
If Fifth Dream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.240
They don't own a current gen system yet.

37:40.240 --> 37:47.640
Let's not forget, current gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.

37:47.640 --> 37:52.400
Whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for a college kid trying

37:52.400 --> 37:58.920
to pay for books and work at a part-time job, $200 is still an assload of money.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.620
That's like ramen for a year.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.820
Not everybody's jumped on board with this yet.

38:04.820 --> 38:10.280
It's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.160
The PS2 got down to $99 finally, right?

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
Yeah, that was back in March.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.160
There you go.

38:15.160 --> 38:19.080
All right, we're going to get into the next story here, but first I'm actually going to

38:19.080 --> 38:23.200
take a little detour from the show role we had.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.080
I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in

38:26.080 --> 38:31.740
the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting

38:31.740 --> 38:35.000
someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
ago.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.080
So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.080
Hello.

38:41.080 --> 38:50.560
Hey, is this Mel B?

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
The one and only.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.560
How are you doing, Mel?

38:52.560 --> 38:55.120
Long time, no talks since we've had you on the show.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.000
Oh gosh, yeah.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.600
It's been quite a while since we've actually... I mean, I've been in the chat a few times

39:01.600 --> 39:06.000
here and there, but yeah, actually being a caller in, it's... Oh yeah, it's been a good

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
while.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
You know, it's up to you.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
Hey, it's Dr. Sakura and Loki.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.240
Well, we're always happy to have you here on the show, and of course, just for folks

39:16.240 --> 39:21.760
who are just now listening for the first time, Mel B goes kind of way back on this show because

39:21.760 --> 39:25.560
he used to be very big in the freestyle scene with Dance Dance Revolution, so when our show

39:25.560 --> 39:30.680
was kind of exclusively about that whole scene, obviously Mel was a friend of the show through

39:30.680 --> 39:34.840
that, and we've kept touch over the years, and Mel's a good friend of mine, and Jamie

39:34.840 --> 39:37.400
and Matt's as well, so we've kept in touch.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.600
Now, I got to tell you what's going on tonight, Mel.

39:40.600 --> 39:44.080
We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House because I don't

39:44.080 --> 39:47.840
even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how... Well,

39:47.840 --> 39:53.380
eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago,

39:53.380 --> 39:58.800
and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have

39:58.800 --> 40:00.320
got to come down here.

40:00.320 --> 40:03.040
I will even pay for your ticket to go.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.200
It was that good, so I was like, okay... Because we were talking about the Silent Hill Haunted

40:07.200 --> 40:08.200
House on the show.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.400
I'm like, I got to call them and hear about what this was all about, so Mel, I know you're

40:12.400 --> 40:13.880
a fan of Silent Hill.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.680
Tell us about the Haunted House and what it was like.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.760
Walk us through it a little bit.

40:16.760 --> 40:17.760
Oh, wow.

40:17.760 --> 40:23.760
I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around

40:23.760 --> 40:27.960
at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing

40:27.960 --> 40:34.400
a maze over in prayer, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.

40:34.400 --> 40:40.040
And they were doing essentially the equivalent to a human maze, or that was based on Silent

40:40.040 --> 40:41.040
Hill.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.960
And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into

40:43.960 --> 40:46.160
the game of Warthog and stuff and all that.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.400
Well, like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?

40:49.400 --> 40:54.240
So we got to do it on a Halloween night, but that was just last night.

40:54.240 --> 40:59.200
And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like, essentially, the maze was created

40:59.200 --> 41:04.840
inside what would have been a banded movie theater or something like that, because there's

41:04.840 --> 41:10.280
actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human

41:10.280 --> 41:15.400
maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and have

41:15.400 --> 41:16.400
all those types of things.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
You're more scared of scary stuff.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.400
Yeah.

41:19.400 --> 41:24.320
And you get in for, you know, like, say, take a picture, just sort of like for those souvenir-type

41:24.320 --> 41:25.320
things.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.880
Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust of hair right

41:28.880 --> 41:32.480
behind you, like, to get your shocked reaction, obviously.

41:32.480 --> 41:36.840
So you can tell these people are about to get you pre-fertile pretty bad.

41:36.840 --> 41:41.440
And once you're going in, once you're actually under the maze, it's like indoors, it's really

41:41.440 --> 41:47.440
not dimly lit with, like, a lot of crimson lighting and, like, just real darkened stuff.

41:47.440 --> 41:52.320
And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people

41:52.320 --> 41:53.320
top.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
So you're pretty narrow.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.560
You have a very claustrophobic feel.

41:56.560 --> 42:01.440
So already, it's just, you know, kind of creeping yourself out that you can play the game.

42:01.440 --> 42:05.640
You know, a lot of it's just, it's not so much, you see, it's creeping things everywhere.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.920
You know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know, something's going to happen.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.520
You don't know when it will.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.720
And that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can take, like, you know, one turn

42:13.720 --> 42:14.720
to the second turn.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.680
You didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
of the flight.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.480
The first monster, you know, just jumped out at you and, you know, scared you, like, stopped

42:22.480 --> 42:24.280
and like, ah!

42:24.280 --> 42:30.960
And for me, because I get pretty jumpy just on about anything, it was like, well, you

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
know, you jump.

42:31.960 --> 42:35.440
But you could tell the monster, you know, coming after you, but the good thing, the

42:35.440 --> 42:39.640
way they said it about this, you don't, you know, like, you can't touch them, they can't

42:39.640 --> 42:40.640
touch you.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.160
It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.840
It's like a strip club.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
Strip club rules.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
It's like what?

42:46.840 --> 42:47.840
It's like strip club rules.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.840
Yeah, strip club.

42:48.840 --> 42:49.840
For lack of a better term.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.560
Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll

42:53.560 --> 42:57.560
sort of just sort of bang on the door, walls, and start kind of following you.

42:57.560 --> 43:01.520
That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know,

43:01.520 --> 43:03.200
corridor or whatever.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.360
And when I first heard that, I was amazed, you know, like, one of the things they mentioned

43:07.360 --> 43:10.200
on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?

43:10.200 --> 43:15.560
They said it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed, but, um, cool

43:15.560 --> 43:18.360
thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.320
There is sort of, like, a message while they're bad.

43:20.320 --> 43:23.520
If they're, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.

43:23.520 --> 43:29.000
Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like,

43:29.000 --> 43:34.520
Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites

43:34.520 --> 43:38.160
were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you

43:38.160 --> 43:40.560
know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.040
And then occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll feel, like, those faces, like,

43:44.040 --> 43:48.400
when the evil spirits start coming out, they'll just come out through the wall and start chasing

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
you.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.400
Oh, weird.

43:50.400 --> 43:54.880
You'll see, like, um, there's those, um, evil dogs that you normally see, I think they're,

43:54.880 --> 44:00.240
like, in Part 4 and, um, Homecoming, like, the one where you fall on the porch, you see,

44:00.240 --> 44:03.960
like, occasionally, a dog, you know, in a cage, trying to come after you.

44:03.960 --> 44:08.200
Um, they do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3, like, there's this one setup that

44:08.200 --> 44:12.000
they have, like, on the slide room, it's, like, at the bottom, there's a television

44:12.000 --> 44:17.040
screen, and you can see, sort of, like, the rollercoaster, kind of, like, going through,

44:17.040 --> 44:20.120
sort of, like, the rollercoaster going on its path, and they decorate it, like, the

44:20.120 --> 44:25.480
abandoned, um, yeah, amusement park and such, and it's gonna take, like, the Silent Hill

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
music throughout.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.680
Like, yeah, just everything, like, every corner, you just don't know when things are going

44:30.680 --> 44:31.680
to happen.

44:31.680 --> 44:36.680
And, like, even sometimes, you'll just see things that are, like, you know, everything

44:36.680 --> 44:40.080
is standing still, and you're thinking, hmm, because one room I remember going through

44:40.080 --> 44:45.840
was, like, a hospital, and there were literally, like, six nurses that just, sort of, like,

44:45.840 --> 44:48.760
you know, when you're going, like, to a Soul Train line or something, you have to go right

44:48.760 --> 44:50.760
through them, and you know something's gonna happen.

44:50.760 --> 44:51.760
That's like the scene in the movie.

44:51.760 --> 44:54.160
Okay, I know something's gonna jump me, I don't know what, take, like, one cautious

44:54.160 --> 44:58.720
step forward, okay, two, three, and then you realize four of them were, like, mannequins,

44:58.720 --> 45:02.560
the two of them were live, so it's just, like, totally screwed with your head.

45:02.560 --> 45:03.560
Wow.

45:03.560 --> 45:07.080
Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear the pens just to get through the photo shoot.

45:07.080 --> 45:11.920
But our chat room is dying to know, how was their pyramid head, did they have a pyramid

45:11.920 --> 45:12.920
head?

45:12.920 --> 45:13.920
Oh, please say they had pyramid head.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.360
Oh, yeah, pyramid head was the payoff.

45:16.360 --> 45:19.880
I mean, anyone who, you know, the pyramid head always knows pyramid head is what you

45:19.880 --> 45:21.080
came here for.

45:21.080 --> 45:24.520
So that was, that was actually the last thing that you see.

45:24.520 --> 45:28.320
So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right

45:28.320 --> 45:34.600
after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming, they have that part, and it's funny, as you

45:34.600 --> 45:39.120
leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill, uh, Shattered

45:39.120 --> 45:40.120
Memories.

45:40.120 --> 45:42.520
So it's, like, kind of, you know, interesting.

45:42.520 --> 45:45.440
So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's, like, this, sort

45:45.440 --> 45:50.160
of, kind of, like, shrine over there, at the top you see a, uh, figurine, like, a, uh,

45:50.160 --> 45:53.120
big busted pyramid head, which is, like, really well done, it's, like, wow, that's kind of

45:53.120 --> 45:54.120
cool.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.800
And so you're still fixated on looking at that, just trying to internalize that, then

45:56.800 --> 46:01.440
out of a gate popped out, Pyramid Head, huge, you know, Pyramid Head has, like, the big

46:01.440 --> 46:06.120
sword, you know, that goes, supposed to be at least five feet long, so he starts coming

46:06.120 --> 46:09.320
after you, he starts, like, you know, pretending to stab, he'll push you to get back a little

46:09.320 --> 46:10.320
bit.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.320
I would have broke down and cried.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.040
I would have broke down and cried that you had to carry me out.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.640
Yeah, luckily, Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the

46:17.640 --> 46:18.640
building.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
I would have cried.

46:19.640 --> 46:26.600
Yeah, but yeah, I mean, for me, it was just, like, I mean, it's funny, because, uh, Melody

46:26.600 --> 46:30.040
would be, like, she'd go, I mean, after she'd gone through, she said, wow, that was, I wasn't

46:30.040 --> 46:31.040
really scared.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.720
And I was like, how could you not be, because then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled

46:34.720 --> 46:38.760
or doesn't invest herself in the game, because when she's going through, like, all the bathrooms

46:38.760 --> 46:43.560
and stuff, we see all the details of how they're busted, you see, like, the blood, blood, tears,

46:43.560 --> 46:48.600
and all that, it's almost like, I guess, I put myself in that situation, thinking, damn,

46:48.600 --> 46:52.800
you know, I don't have no access to spare, I ain't got no radio or nothing, like, I just

46:52.800 --> 46:53.800
gotta deal with this.

46:53.800 --> 46:59.760
So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
do a good job?

47:00.760 --> 47:05.880
I think, I thought they did a really, really good job.

47:05.880 --> 47:11.480
I like that they, they really got you inside, you know, they, they created the things, usually

47:11.480 --> 47:15.160
they did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who

47:15.160 --> 47:19.840
plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you, so, like,

47:19.840 --> 47:23.840
you always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner, or, you know, in some places

47:23.840 --> 47:27.200
when you're going to the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain, and so, you know,

47:27.200 --> 47:31.280
it's like the black curtain, you gotta, like, peek through it, you just don't know, so,

47:31.280 --> 47:35.840
you know, fear is in there, but it's, overall, tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you

47:35.840 --> 47:39.920
know, just experience, going to, like, you know, anything that's haunted, it was really

47:39.920 --> 47:41.440
well done.

47:41.440 --> 47:45.440
And just to clarify, some folks in the chat room wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape

47:45.440 --> 47:48.040
you?

47:48.040 --> 47:50.760
No bodies were defiled, uh, during the, uh, haunt.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.760
Oh, that's right, they can't touch it.

47:51.760 --> 47:55.280
But he had, like, his small little room, he had his, you know, gate on the side, and,

47:55.280 --> 47:59.360
you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but, for all we know,

47:59.360 --> 48:03.440
you know, they, they might be adding something, you know, they made it with something I didn't

48:03.440 --> 48:07.160
catch, maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.240
Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.

48:09.240 --> 48:13.920
All right, uh, Mel, thank you so much, I really appreciate you coming on the show, I know

48:13.920 --> 48:17.400
you guys are, like, driving home right now, you're calling us literally from the road,

48:17.400 --> 48:21.240
probably driving up I-5 or something, so, um, have a safe drive back, thank you guys

48:21.240 --> 48:24.880
so much for, um, coming on the show, and, uh, we'll hope to see you in studio in the

48:24.880 --> 48:27.880
near future, okay?

48:27.880 --> 48:32.880
Okay, take care, I think we might have just lost him at that point.

48:32.880 --> 48:39.960
I was, uh, the 10th draft jersey since Jefferson touched Bimani, which was October 30th, 99th

48:39.960 --> 48:44.640
and 8th, so, you know, 10 years, what a crazy ride, where we are, you know?

48:44.640 --> 48:46.240
Wow, I didn't even think of that.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.880
People that used, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
a little bit.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.320
October 30th, 99 was what?

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
The first time you played Bimani?

48:52.320 --> 48:53.320
First time I played DTR.

48:53.320 --> 49:01.160
10 years later, look, you know, how everything's gone, and still fans still doing it, and,

49:01.160 --> 49:02.480
you know, look what's taking us.

49:02.480 --> 49:05.000
Wow, yeah, it's pretty, pretty crazy looking back.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Boy, do I feel old.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Thanks for making me feel old, Mel, no, I'm kidding.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.200
You know, it's, like, it's, I could go on for an hour or so, but it looks like I'm breaking

49:12.200 --> 49:15.760
up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe, uh, maybe we'll talk about it more

49:15.760 --> 49:16.760
next week.

49:16.760 --> 49:17.760
Sounds good.

49:17.760 --> 49:18.760
Take care, Mel.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.760
Have a safe drive back.

49:19.760 --> 49:20.760
All right.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.760
Thanks, man.

49:21.760 --> 49:22.760
Y'all be good.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.760
Later.

49:23.760 --> 49:24.760
All right.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.820
Thank you, uh, very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message

49:27.820 --> 49:28.820
notice.

49:28.820 --> 49:29.820
I appreciate that.

49:29.820 --> 49:30.820
All right.

49:30.820 --> 49:31.820
That was fun.

49:31.820 --> 49:32.820
I don't know.

49:32.820 --> 49:33.820
It sounded pretty good.

49:33.820 --> 49:34.820
I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so, Jamie, if it comes back next year, I,

49:34.820 --> 49:38.240
I think we're gonna road trip, but make sure I bring diapers.

49:38.240 --> 49:45.120
All right, we'll be, we'll, um, bring you, uh, or make sure I at least void myself before

49:45.120 --> 49:46.720
we go into the haunted house.

49:46.720 --> 49:47.720
Yeah.

49:47.720 --> 49:48.720
Okay.

49:48.720 --> 49:53.680
We'll, we'll just get you a big pack, pack of, uh, oops, I crap my pants.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.680
Sounds good.

49:54.680 --> 49:55.680
All right.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.080
Hey, I'm moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.640
In fact, if the only thing that was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing, there's

50:01.640 --> 50:03.680
another DSI coming out.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.680
That's right.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.460
This would be the fourth version of the DSI coming out.

50:06.460 --> 50:07.720
It's coming out in Japan very soon.

50:07.720 --> 50:14.760
The DSIL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and yes, America as the DSIXL, uh,

50:14.760 --> 50:18.360
the DSIs, uh, LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.

50:18.360 --> 50:22.780
Uh, basically the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with four inch screens,

50:22.780 --> 50:27.760
so it's going to get a size increase because size matters.

50:27.760 --> 50:30.000
The DSI Leonardo Leonardo.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.620
No, it's, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.880
It's, it's, it's also the DSIXL over there.

50:35.880 --> 50:36.960
It's just in their language.

50:36.960 --> 50:37.960
It's LL.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.800
So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.

50:40.800 --> 50:44.880
Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.

50:44.880 --> 50:48.320
It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until

50:48.320 --> 50:49.320
next year.

50:49.320 --> 50:53.480
It has been confirmed for all the regions and I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay,

50:53.480 --> 50:59.080
well to be fair, I never bought the DSI, but if I did buy the DSI, I might feel a little

50:59.080 --> 51:03.240
bit irritated because like if I bought stuff on the DSI store, it's not like there's a

51:03.240 --> 51:05.720
cable that's going to connect my two things.

51:05.720 --> 51:10.200
It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP, there'd be no slot for

51:10.200 --> 51:12.280
me to put the discs in.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.880
At least I could still play the games, but yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people

51:15.880 --> 51:20.400
who didn't jump on board with the DSI the first time, like me.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.400
I don't know.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.200
Loki, how has the DSI been selling?

51:24.200 --> 51:25.460
Is there a need for this?

51:25.460 --> 51:26.600
What was your take on all this?

51:26.600 --> 51:34.780
Well, this is just for old people and basically they've said it's for so other people can

51:34.780 --> 51:36.480
watch you play the games.

51:36.480 --> 51:42.600
And so basically you're advertising for Nintendo now, sort of, and the screen, you know, it's

51:42.600 --> 51:46.160
a little bit bigger, but the system's also a little bit more expensive.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.440
So are they going to be putting this out with the DSI?

51:49.440 --> 51:54.680
I mean, it's kind of backwards as far as it becoming smaller and more compact.

51:54.680 --> 51:58.080
By the way, a lot of our chat room is making the joke that a four inches is actually a

51:58.080 --> 52:00.200
big improvement, but I'm bummed.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.200
Get it?

52:01.200 --> 52:04.520
And you know, if they're making the system so much bigger, why couldn't they throw the

52:04.520 --> 52:09.920
Game Boy Advance slot back in there, since, you know, now size isn't a matter and...

52:09.920 --> 52:12.440
Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?

52:12.440 --> 52:17.520
I understand that, but you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance slot

52:17.520 --> 52:19.000
and, you know, other games have...

52:19.000 --> 52:24.520
Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...

52:24.520 --> 52:26.720
Yes, that's true, but...

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
Ha, I win.

52:27.720 --> 52:32.720
I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down

52:32.720 --> 52:37.360
the system to make it smaller and, you know, it couldn't fit... they couldn't fit that

52:37.360 --> 52:38.360
in there.

52:38.360 --> 52:43.200
Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore, then...

52:43.200 --> 52:46.200
So in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.

52:46.200 --> 52:47.200
Yup.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
Hmm.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.320
I don't know how I feel about this.

52:50.320 --> 52:55.560
Well, and also too, I mean, you're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're

52:55.560 --> 52:59.760
making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.760
I mean, I don't know.

53:01.760 --> 53:05.120
Do I really need a four-inch screen, or at least two four-inch screens?

53:05.120 --> 53:06.560
I can see it just fine.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.920
I don't need, you know...

53:08.920 --> 53:12.780
I don't need glasses to, you know, read the text on that screen.

53:12.780 --> 53:15.760
If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me

53:15.760 --> 53:16.760
put it on my television.

53:16.760 --> 53:21.020
Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device

53:21.020 --> 53:23.760
that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.120
Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
TV Tuner.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
Something...

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
Yeah, something along those lines.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
Or like the dev kits.

53:30.120 --> 53:31.120
Yeah, bingo.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.120
Bingo.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.120
Thank you.

53:33.120 --> 53:34.120
So...

53:34.120 --> 53:35.120
Um...

53:35.120 --> 53:37.440
And then actdeftinchat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld, now, thanks.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.440
Yeah, that's right.

53:38.440 --> 53:42.080
We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn

53:42.080 --> 53:44.200
well it could play them if it wanted to.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.200
Yeah.

53:45.200 --> 53:49.320
Because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were

53:49.320 --> 53:54.520
all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.

53:54.520 --> 53:59.320
Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a

53:59.320 --> 54:02.200
free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
Remember that?

54:03.200 --> 54:04.200
Good times.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.600
And also remember how you could get, you know, free Nintendo games streamed to your Game

54:08.600 --> 54:11.200
Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?

54:11.200 --> 54:15.200
And there was like, you know, 30-some games in there?

54:15.200 --> 54:16.960
Oh, but you don't get that anymore.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.920
In fact, we're just gonna keep Animal Crossing the same.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.200
I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.400
I just want you to know that.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.440
I don't care what they do.

54:24.440 --> 54:27.560
I don't care if, you know, it's the greatest thing on Earth.

54:27.560 --> 54:29.400
I'm not buying it.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.400
I don't know.

54:30.400 --> 54:34.440
This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 as unnecessary handhelds.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.440
I don't know.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.400
I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
it.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.400
You know?

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
How's the PSP Go selling?

54:41.400 --> 54:42.440
That's what I want to know.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.440
That's a good question.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.080
I'd be curious about that.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.240
Well anyhow, there you go.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.480
There's the information on the new DS.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.480
Take it or leave it.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.860
I'm sure there's some folks that are gonna be excited about it.

54:50.860 --> 54:56.240
I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi, I think will be more into this.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.440
Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that'll be all over this no matter what.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.920
It's also more expensive, remember.

55:01.920 --> 55:05.640
Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.

55:05.640 --> 55:11.160
I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.

55:11.160 --> 55:16.120
Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS

55:16.120 --> 55:17.120
Lite.

55:17.120 --> 55:21.160
I never got on board with the DSi, but right now I'm not feeling it.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.160
That's where I'm at.

55:22.160 --> 55:25.720
If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.040
But for now, I'll pass.

55:28.040 --> 55:31.240
Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.760
For very similar reasons, oddly enough.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.760
There you go.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.120
PSP Go is just ridiculous.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.200
It's redonkulous, if you will.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.200
There you go.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.200
Fine.

55:41.200 --> 55:46.600
Something else that's redonkulous is apparently a PlayStation Network, or I should say ex-PlayStation

55:46.600 --> 55:57.640
Network member, who of course tried to sue Sony for $55,000 for banning him from the

55:57.640 --> 55:58.640
PlayStation Network.

55:58.640 --> 56:05.680
Apparently he was throwing a fit in the PlayStation forums, and I believe since your account is

56:05.680 --> 56:09.720
linked through that, if you get banned from the forums, you get banned off the network.

56:09.720 --> 56:15.280
Which most people might say, who cares, I can create another membership.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.760
Can I make a quick O-L-R-N joke that only like five people will get?

56:18.760 --> 56:19.760
Sure.

56:19.760 --> 56:23.120
Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.520
We ban you!

56:24.520 --> 56:25.520
Yes.

56:25.520 --> 56:35.760
So, anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?

56:35.760 --> 56:38.280
God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit.

56:38.280 --> 56:40.880
I'm going to sue you again.

56:40.880 --> 56:47.840
So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.

56:47.840 --> 56:59.400
And on top of all that, this is just awesome, he is also not going to have a lawyer.

56:59.400 --> 57:01.560
Once again, he's going to be representing himself.

57:01.560 --> 57:05.000
Because only a fool represents himself.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.520
Yes.

57:06.520 --> 57:09.440
He will once again opt out of using a lawyer.

57:09.440 --> 57:15.840
And the best part about it was, he said before that his first amendment rights were basically

57:15.840 --> 57:20.560
being trampled on, and that's why he should get $55,000.

57:20.560 --> 57:25.280
The judge says no and dismisses the case, and so now he's trying it again.

57:25.280 --> 57:29.520
But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.680
It doesn't cost anything.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.420
Free.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.960
It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.

57:35.960 --> 57:36.960
It's free.

57:36.960 --> 57:41.560
Okay, devil's advocate, what about all the purchases you made on your old account that

57:41.560 --> 57:45.280
are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?

57:45.280 --> 57:48.680
Well then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the terms of service.

57:48.680 --> 57:53.680
That's true, I think Sony's covered in their terms of service, hence why the constitution

57:53.680 --> 57:55.060
does not apply.

57:55.060 --> 57:59.520
You agree to be signing up for a club and exclusive network where the first amendment

57:59.520 --> 58:01.040
rules don't apply.

58:01.040 --> 58:06.480
If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you

58:06.480 --> 58:11.080
can't complain and say, wham wham wham, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.160
They have every right to do that.

58:12.160 --> 58:13.160
It's private.

58:13.160 --> 58:14.160
It's private.

58:14.160 --> 58:16.760
Same goes with any kind of web forum.

58:16.760 --> 58:21.520
So this guy's just kind of a douche.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.280
I like how we all said a different word in tandem there, that was great.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.280
No Ron.

58:27.280 --> 58:31.440
There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system

58:31.440 --> 58:32.840
just look stupid.

58:32.840 --> 58:39.400
I mean, I understand, in this case, cause they're going to have to throw it out again.

58:39.400 --> 58:44.600
I mean the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally at least setting a precedent

58:44.600 --> 58:47.600
is that this is stupid.

58:47.600 --> 58:54.440
Well and at least he's not wasting money on, well I guess he's being smart and not wasting

58:54.440 --> 58:56.320
money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.

58:56.320 --> 59:01.560
The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I

59:01.560 --> 59:05.600
could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.

59:05.600 --> 59:10.360
However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff, you knew what, you know, and if

59:10.360 --> 59:15.000
you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well, it's hard for me to

59:15.000 --> 59:16.460
feel a lot of pity for you.

59:16.460 --> 59:19.640
Cause what you said probably would have offended me.

59:19.640 --> 59:20.640
Just guessing.

59:20.640 --> 59:21.640
Probably would have.

59:21.640 --> 59:24.640
And I don't get offended very easily by the way.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.940
But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.

59:27.940 --> 59:30.960
One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the Playstation

59:30.960 --> 59:37.800
3 has lost them quite a bit of money, 4.7 billion dollars to be exact.

59:37.800 --> 59:38.800
That's coming from...

59:38.800 --> 59:39.800
Billion dollars.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.200
Billion dollars.

59:42.200 --> 59:46.720
Apparently this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that

59:46.720 --> 59:49.760
Sony came out with this week.

59:49.760 --> 59:53.980
The PS3 has lost Sony 4.695 billion dollars.

59:53.980 --> 59:58.640
Keep in mind, game companies really lose money, like every time they sell a system, you know,

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.960
they're losing money on parts and so forth.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.880
So you know, game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.840
with things like, let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-rays, so they get money back with every

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.120
Blu-rays that are sold.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.680
They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.360
You know, they make the money back in other ways.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.420
If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:27.000
So hold on a minute, before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.080
and say, Sony's losing money because they're stupid.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080
Well hold on.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080
Keep in mind, because guess what?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.820
When Microsoft released the original Xbox, they lost 4.2 billion over a four year period.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:44.160
That is a little less than 4.7, but also that was, you know, 10 years ago ish, you know,

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.040
eight, seven years ago, whatever.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:53.140
But you know, these game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.280
So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet, or anytime soon really.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.880
I think if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.040
I think this money could possibly turn around by, you know, next year or the year after.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.620
And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:18.620
officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce,

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:23.920
saying the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20%.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.000
Within the year, it could be in the single digits.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.320
We'll be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:37.440
It should also be noted that the PlayStation 3 has jumped 800,000 in sales from the year

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.320
to year figures ever since the slim launched.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.980
So definitely the price point was the sticking point for a heck of a lot of people.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.480
And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.760
cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.760
on.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.360
As we've been trying to tell them since the launch, $600, you crazy?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.800
Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.800
They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800
won.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.960
HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.960
So they won that gamble.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.440
So maybe this really truly was, you know, when they were talking about this 10 year

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.380
plan and all that, that's when this is probably going to end up really, really paying off

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.040
for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants Blu-rays and so

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
forth.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040
So we shall see.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.320
Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.400
We're already an hour into the show.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.760
We haven't even gotten to release dates.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:38.480
Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool and I would like to see more of

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:46.200
this going on is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:54.120
He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.840
He shouldn't have to take, take out any of the, you know, sex and anything that goes

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.840
on in it for the sake of any kind of, you know, quote decency because it's intended

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.840
for a mature audience.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:14.400
You know, it's not his fault if, if it, you know, ends up in a kid's hand.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.480
It's who's ever, you know, in charge of that kid's fault.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.200
In fact, he's quoted as saying, as a game creator, I have one very simple rule.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.280
Everything is allowed, no limits, as long as it makes sense in the story and is not

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.920
gratuitous.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.040
Why is he having to defend himself?

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040
Why?

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.120
Well, this is even more.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.360
He's saying that because it's an 18 plus title, it should exclude him from, and I quote, ridiculous

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
situation.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.120
So, I'm like, good, thank you for saying something.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.360
Why is this so loud?

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:56.760
It just seems loud because you're, anyway, I don't, I don't understand why the guy is

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.640
being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.120
Like it's, it's ridiculous.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.240
Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.560
Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things,

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:19.540
but like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now, why did you decide to

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.360
show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Did you really have to show her boobs?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.140
No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.720
Why is this guy having to defend his game or any creator having to defend their games

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.480
and the artistic choices they make?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.240
Oh, I see, because games aren't really art according to some people.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.280
Well, get over it.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:47.880
I hate this, and I'm sure you all do as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.320
with video games versus movies.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.440
It's all the same kind of thing.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.240
You know, well, a lot of us, you know, who were anime fans back in the day, you know,

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.120
got into the same thing.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.160
I'm going, oh, these cartoons, it doesn't matter to me.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:09.880
Well, like, no, it's just another way of, uh, of, uh, communication.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.640
It's another, just another medium, and video games are the same thing.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.400
I want my eight bucks back.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
I'm the plaintiff.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
I'm a plaintiff.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400
I'm a plaintiff.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.400
Damn, that was a great show.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400
That was.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400
Oh, man.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.600
He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.880
He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.880
Oh, really?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880
Sweet.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.880
That might be fun.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.880
It might actually be a good movie from him for, for once in the past, like, 10 years.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.600
Big American Party.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.880
I would like to dogma.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:52.240
All right, um, moving on, a few more stories in release dates, and of course, the classic

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.080
game of the week before too long.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:01.680
Yes, apparently, piracy on, um, handheld systems is not limited to the, uh, say, on the PSP.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:08.600
Apparently, also very, quite rampant on, uh, the iPhone, or at least the App Store.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:15.680
Um, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even, like, 95 percent.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:22.960
Uh, one, I love their developer's name too, one iPhone developer smells like donkey, says

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.960
about 80 percent of all downloads of Tap Fu were illegally downloaded, and they have a

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:37.880
way, I guess, of, um, telling that, and apparently, um, you know, the game, uh, was marked down

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:45.540
to 199 and still didn't, you know, affect the piracy rate, which is interesting.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.260
You know what this story, do you know, honestly, what my gut reaction was to this story when

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.040
I read it?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.080
I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.080
How?

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.460
Um, actually, I have a lot of them open, uh, cause I have a few friends who have jailbroken

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.460
iPhones.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.760
Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.400
Um, well, he says that he did, but there's other places that, um, I think they do have

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.560
to be jailbroken to-

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.640
Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear, huh?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.080
Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.320
I mean, I haven't, I've, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.800
I was never going to.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
Me neither.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:27.560
I have a first-gen iPhone, and, um, they're supposed to be, like, super easy on that one.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.560
Hmm.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.560
That'd be something to do with, like, an iPod touch, I would think.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.440
Is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures, though?

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.980
Because like, if the game didn't sell that much in the first place, and, you know, this

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.120
handful of people pirated your game, well, then you say a certain percentage has pirated

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.760
your game when not that many people bought it to begin with?

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.240
Because maybe the App Store is just too flooded with crap right now, and yours isn't sticking

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240
out?

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.960
Well, they claim, like, for example, this other, um, iPhone developer, Fish Labs, they

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:03.400
said their, uh, game Rally Master Pro 3D, um, received a 95% piracy rate on its first

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:09.960
day of release, and they said that that equates to about many, a few thousand copies.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.280
So.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.440
Hmm.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.120
Um.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.440
I could see that.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.280
You know, if we're only talking a couple thousand, I could see that there's a couple thousand

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:25.440
people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games, and a lot of pirates, especially with

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.080
something as little as an iPhone game, because it's not like any of those games are that

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.040
big, probably just download them to download them.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.320
Play them once and throw them away.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.480
I would bet you that's what most of those people do.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.480
Yeah, probably.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.720
That's, well, remember when the, um, uh, Dreamcast piracy was a big thing, that's really, a lot

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.280
of them was like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.080
Or, or here's a great example, um, something that came up earlier in the show.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.520
Maim ROMs.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.040
How many people pirate Maim ROMs?

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.560
Like, I think that's one of those things, kind of like, everybody does, but no one really

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560
talks about it.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.560
I do it!

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.840
Tons of people download the Maim stuff in the 80s.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840
There's a lot of stuff.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Those games aren't making money anymore!

01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Who cares?

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.160
And there's a lot of stuff too, I mean, it's like.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.120
I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent, it doesn't matter, I

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120
feel justified.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.400
There's some games in there, I don't even know what the hell they are, and I'm probably

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400
gonna try them.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.840
And you play them once, and you delete them.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.000
That's still piracy!

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.360
You're still pirating a game!

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.880
Well if you tell me where I can find a legit copy of Ms. Nude World 96.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.120
Exactly!

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.600
A lot of these games you get.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.980
And that game's not even legitimate anyways, I mean, come on, that's just a hacked piece

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:28.980
of crap.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.200
God damn, I missed Ms. Nude World 96.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200
I downloaded that just for you!

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.200
Did you really do have her in the cabinet?

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.600
I'm putting it in the cabinet.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.160
Oh man.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.360
Seriously?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.780
If you've never played this on Maim, it's the one Maim ROM everybody has to play.

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:45.800
Is Ms. Nude World 96.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.140
It's so bad.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140
It's awful.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.620
I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:58.280
Basically it's the game, like, kicks, but it's with naked ladies and then random pictures

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.060
of demon spawn in there.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:07.660
The front end I'm using is called Hyper Spin, and it has little flash and video previews

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.780
of each game.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.680
So I'm going to get that, you know, song to play over everything when you're selecting

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.800
the game, which will be pretty funny.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.960
Everybody, move your body!

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960
It's awesome.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.860
But yeah, there's a lot of hacked stuff out there, and it's not practical for people to

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:30.260
buy arcade cabinets and stuff, and even still, I mean, a lot of the stuff you're buying second

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:34.280
hand anyways, the developers already made their money off that stuff.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.380
I don't know.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:41.060
It's not like they're making new Ms. Nude World 96 boards out there.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.660
I don't know.

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:48.980
Vanus Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new,

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.780
there's nothing wrong with downloading it.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:57.060
Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.340
To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.060
I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.020
just pirate it, which yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.380
extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:15.620
I don't want to pay like $100 to import a game just because the company doesn't feel

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.860
like releasing it here.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.580
You know what I mean?

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:23.980
But that's not to say I really rarely pirate games, like if ever.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.180
I actually buy it.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.180
Even music anymore.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.140
I pretty much buy everything on iTunes.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.380
I'm pretty boring.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.220
I will say this, it's better to buy them on Amazon, because number one, they're usually

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.820
cheaper, and number two, they are DRM-free MP3s.

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.780
Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes, but I don't know, it's just what I use.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.780
Convenient.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:53.020
Well, yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:58.620
You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:04.060
Anyhow, let's move on to another story here, and then we'll get to release dates.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.100
Was that all to say about the piracy story?

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.100
Yeah.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.100
It's just crazy.

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.000
That's really what it is.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:19.900
Going into an article here about Rock Band, apparently there's kind of talk going around

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:25.300
that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.460
with Rock Band The Beatles.

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.820
Roger Daltrey, who of course is lead singer of The Who, was speaking to the Republican

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:36.400
recently saying, quote, the game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400
There's one planned.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.860
The idea is fabulous.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:42.180
Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:48.300
Now, of course, sometimes these old rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.920
He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.460
a similar mistake earlier this year.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.460
They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.060
I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.940
download pack before.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.900
And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack that there's

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.860
so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:12.860
I don't know.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.380
Do you think The Who would warrant a whole new game?

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:21.660
I got to admit, and I'm going to get hate mail over this, but hear me out.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:25.020
I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:30.980
I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980
I know.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980
Hate me if you want.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.980
But let's face it.

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.900
When was the last time they had a big song?

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.340
Okay, I know what you're going to say, but what about The Beatles' rock band, Rob?

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.340
Hold on.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.340
Beatles?

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.340
Whole other stratosphere.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.100
There is nothing like The Beatles, okay?

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.260
Back down to Earth.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.260
The Who.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.860
When was the last time they had a big hit?

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860
Oh, yeah.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.100
Before, most of our listeners and the people buying games today were born.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.700
Now, will there be an audience for this?

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.860
Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.940
Don't agree with me?

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.100
Then release the damn game.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.540
Prove me wrong.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.220
It's niche.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:10.380
There could be a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but you know

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:14.500
how they do those disc releases of, say, 20-some songs or whatever.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:20.740
I could see that happening, maybe, instead of the metal country track pack.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:26.700
I could see something like the ACDC game that came out a while ago, maybe a live thing that

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.780
comes out.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:33.320
I could see something like that, but not something like The Beatles' game.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.900
The work that was put into that game and everything that went into that, only The Beatles, and

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.740
only The Beatles, I think, can justify.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.020
I honestly can't think, and I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:52.420
bands in chat right now and all this, but I really don't think there's any band I can

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.840
think of that justifies that.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:00.420
Some of the Guitar Hero games, like Metallica, yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.340
Aerosmith, I can see where they're getting a game.

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:07.500
Van Halen, I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:13.860
anything after 1984, because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff, but

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.180
hey, that's just me.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.620
Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:24.420
Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.660
the last song in there was 25 years ago, when most of the people buying these games are

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.620
probably in their young 20s and teens.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.620
A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.140
Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.980
He's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.940
So there you go.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.860
But again, it's so interesting because every argument I'm saying here against this game,

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.980
you could say, well, what about the Beatles?

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.980
What about the Beatles?

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.180
But the Beatles are the Beatles.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.180
There is no comparison.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.060
Seriously, try it.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.060
There's no comparison.

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.060
No, I agree with you.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.980
So anyhow, that was my little rant.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.980
So I'm cool.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.700
Hey, you know, I realized, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.080
now, Rob, how dare you?

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.740
You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there.

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.740
And you know, especially like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:23.100
group who just has an appreciation for classic rock, you go, Pinball Wizard is an awesome

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.100
song.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.700
There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new 50, $60 game?

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:34.900
Oh, no, only for, you know, fans that I don't think are enough in numbers to justify it.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:42.140
But a track pack or a budget game or, you know, something like a re-skinning of, you

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.140
know, yeah, yeah.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.140
The Who justifies that.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:52.220
There is certainly a huge classic rock band, but just not relevant enough in 2009.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220
Hate me all you want.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.660
Just tell me how it is.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.660
How about some release dates?

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.660
Haters going to hate.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.060
Haters going to hate, exactly.

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.460
And I'm hating.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.380
All right.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.860
This guy in chat says, Lady Gaga rock band will be incredible, putting the Beatles to

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.860
shame.

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:13.260
I didn't see it, but I heard about this week's episode of South Park, where apparently they're

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.820
doing Poker Face and rock band.

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.820
Hilarious.

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:21.460
Did you see Christopher Walken?

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.460
Yes.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.460
Doing Poker Face.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.460
Good stuff.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.100
I actually think Lady Gaga should get some type of game.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.140
Like maybe not now, but maybe after her next album.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.820
But and again, you're probably going to, Rob, what the fuck?

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.660
You just say the Who shouldn't get a game, but Lady Gaga should.

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.260
But the Lady Gaga game would be like on the Wii.

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.160
Does that make sense where I'm going with that?

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.520
It would be on the Wii and in a pink box.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520
You know?

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520
It would be a different kind of game.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520
P.S., Rob.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520
What?

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.520
You're a dork.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520
I know.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.420
But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.940
People bought Britney's dance beat, damn it.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.700
Lady Gaga can have a game.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:55.700
All right.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.700
Anyhow, sorry.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.700
Release dates.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.700
Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?

01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.700
No.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.700
Not this week, I'm afraid.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700
All right.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.180
This week actually started- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.620
Tiger Claw chat.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.820
Just made me lol.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:10.320
It would be called Lady Gaga game.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.820
That's so stupid, yet so funny.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.820
Lady Gaga game.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.980
Or would that be Lady Gaga me?

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:21.160
Anyhow, sorry.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160
I promise.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.660
I'm putting the mic down, so I won't interrupt.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.660
All right.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:29.060
Starting today, Rabbids Go Home is available on DS and the Wii.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:34.420
Also later this week, Need for Speed Nitro will be out on the DS and the Wii.

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.860
Coming from Nintendo, Style Savvy.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:45.180
It's a style sim for the DS, which I'm sure is gonna sell millions of copies, except not.

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:48.020
Sushi Academy out on the DS.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:52.420
My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:59.380
This week, Lego Rock Band out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:04.460
Of course, the DS version is very similar to the PSP version of Rock Band.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:12.040
Band Hero also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, as well as

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.940
the full band bundle as well.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.560
If you feel like dropping $200 for that one, you can just get a world tour bundle for about

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.620
half the price.

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.580
Imagine Baby's fashion.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.860
Imagine me not carrying him at this game.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.060
That's available on the DS.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:34.020
Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squad out on PSP and DS this week.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:38.420
The re-release of Star Wars The Force Unleashed in the Ultimate Sith Edition, coming out on

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:42.980
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:53.700
The Jack and Dexter The Lost Frontier out on PSP and PlayStation 2 this week.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:58.940
Dragon Age Origins out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:02.580
Wii Cheer 2 on the Wii.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.500
Dream Salon also on the DS.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.500
Really?

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.500
Wii Cheer got a sequel?

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.500
Yes.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:12.460
I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the cat game, President Cat, is

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.980
the worst Wii game ever made, yet Wii Cheer gets a sequel.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:16.780
I'm just saying.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:22.420
Trust me, anything made by Destineer is the worst Wii game ever.

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.740
Not President Cat.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.740
President Cat's awesome.

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.680
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves is making its way out, game only, on the Wii.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.100
Of course it's been released before, but now they're kind of re-releasing it, because that's

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.940
what Konami does.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:40.900
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.740
The rest of the versions will have to come later.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:49.980
Christmas Carol tying in with the new Disney movie out on the DS.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.940
Cop the Recruit out on the DS.

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:57.500
This one's kind of like what the Grand Theft Auto on the DS should have been.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.980
It's like the PSP Grand Theft Autos.

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:06.460
And seriously, Konami, what are you doing?

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:11.700
Ultimate Party Challenge Bundle with, uh...

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:16.220
All right.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:33.380
Sorry, I was looking up preview information on Band Hero.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:37.140
Let's see here, a couple more.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:43.220
Academy of Champions Soccer out on the Wii this week, also featuring the Rabbids.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:47.820
And Hooked Again with the fishing rod, it's your fishing sim.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:55.940
And then also becoming not a Walmart exclusive anymore, Rock Band ACDC Track Pack available

01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:01.380
on all four systems for now the new low price of $20.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:09.220
And let me tell you this, Munchy probably could get it way cheaper than that.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.500
And let's see here, oh, some more random stuff.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.700
Team Elimination Games from the Wii, yet another generic party game.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.100
Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.100
a dozen.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.260
Or hey, how about this another deer hunting game?

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:30.340
Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer, Buck Futter.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:36.620
Oh, and then, how should we forget, but guess what?

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:41.460
We Wish You a Merry Christmas, yes, once again, another quality game from Destineer coming

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:49.260
out on the Wii, because hey, what Christmas, what would Christmas be without a Christmas

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.780
themed party game that you'll probably throw away after, you know.

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:57.340
We Wish You a Merry Buck Futter.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.820
That's the game I'd like to see, Buck Futter.

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.620
Did you ever see that Celebrity Jeopardy sketch?

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.140
Oh, forget it.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.980
And then lastly, a week from today, Shaun White, Snowboarding World stage of the week coming

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.980
out on the Wii.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.940
And that's it.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.140
Moving over to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.220
Now I want a game called Buck Futter, just to say I have it.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.420
Can we get that on like the indie games marketplace?

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.580
Xbox 360 in Japan, we get Fallout 3, gets a price reduction over there, Dirt 2 gets

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:28.420
its release in Japan, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out, I'm assuming that's very

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.780
similar to collection what we got over here before, NBA Live 10 comes out, and Taiyutama

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:37.340
Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:38.540
That sounds dirty.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.660
It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DD, like it's something that, you know, like kiss

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.660
my grits.

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:48.140
But no, I believe this is actually based on an anime, it's another adventure game based

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.620
on an anime.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:53.580
Taiyutama I think is an anime, so there you go.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.420
Also coming out, World Soccer winning 11 2010, of course soccer games are always huge releases

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:01.860
in every country but the US, and they sell decent here I'm sure too.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:06.740
And there's also an Xbox 360 Elite Bundle, if you are doubting how big this game is,

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:10.260
it's getting bundled over there in Japan, if you are curious about that.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.160
That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.900
On the Playstation 3, a game we're going to talk about a little bit later on, 3D Dot Game

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.900
Heroes comes out.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:21.780
I just want to point out, region free, if you want to import it, but we'll talk a little

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.740
more later about why you might not want to.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.900
Dirt 2 comes out as well on Playstation 3, Infamous gets its release in Japan this week

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.940
as well as NBA Live 10.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:35.180
And of course World Soccer winning 11 2010, also a Playstation 3 Bundle.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.580
Have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles?

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.580
That's kind of interesting.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:46.520
I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten, warranted the two different

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.020
systems being bundled with it.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.020
Interesting.

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.020
Lego Batman.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.020
Oh, good call.

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.020
That's Playstation 2 on the Xbox 360.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.900
Nintendo Wii gets a few releases in Japan as well.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.100
Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo, I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.180
But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario and Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.180
Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.780
And Mario and Sonic at the Olympics actually sold pretty well.

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:13.140
Like I know a lot of gamer enthusiasts kind of poo-poo those games, but they actually

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.620
sold pretty well, right?

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:19.660
So the sequel now, I guess you could say, the Vancouver Olympics is coming out just

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:24.100
in time for the Olympics over in Japan as well.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.860
Playstation 2 is really slowing down with their releases in Japan as well.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.940
They only have a price reduction to look forward to in Metal Gear Solid 3 this week on the

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.940
Playstation 2.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:35.340
Nintendo DS has a handful of releases, it's getting pretty busy over there in Japan.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:40.020
Wire Way comes out as well as Tamagotchi, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:45.100
No Nari-kiri Shaniru, I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:50.980
Lemon Knight X Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS, and Sakura Note, Imanitsu

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:55.580
Nagaru Mirai comes out from Marvelous Entertainment on the Nintendo DS.

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:58.500
Lastly, onto the PSP and the releases they have there.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:05.260
Dirt 2 gets a release on the PSP as well, as well as Suikoden 1 and 2 gets a price reduction.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:08.980
They released that in Japan, bundled and redone for the PSP, it's getting a price reduction

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:09.980
this week.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:15.620
Nintendo NBA Live 10, Naruto, another one of those games, moves into the price reduction.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:21.500
Also getting a price reduction, Valhalla Knights 2 gets a price reduction this week.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.580
Let's move over to Europe.

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.860
We have a number of releases.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:34.260
We have on the 4th, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the 6th, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins,

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:43.700
Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues, Need for Speed Nitro

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:51.420
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala Wii Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront League Squadron.

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.620
Very cool.

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.620
Yep.

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.620
Pretty interesting stuff I think.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.620
Yep.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:08.540
Alright, well many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.660
morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:18.700
Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning, mainly targeting

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.660
people that were downloading certain games.

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:27.300
If you may remember, I think we talked about it last week, they were cracking down on people

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:34.500
downloading Forza 3 and Borderlands early, of course it makes it a lot easier for them

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.860
to track that kind of stuff when the game's not out yet, and so because of that they've

01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:46.340
taken action against some people, and of course with each update that the console gets with

01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:52.300
each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles, so it's kind

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.860
of interesting though.

01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:59.020
You know, myself, I have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.020
Live, so.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.660
Yeah, but you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online, right?

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:06.060
We played modded Grand Theft Auto's online all the time.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.060
Really?

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.060
Yeah, no problem.

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:14.380
But see, here's my theory on that though, is that they have ways of individually checking

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:20.140
consoles to see if the game is modded, like the console's modded, but it doesn't, for

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:25.300
them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess would be impossible for

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.060
them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:35.180
So what they are doing is waiting for these high profile games like Call of Duty, Modern

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:40.620
Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:45.940
are playing it online, okay now we have a list of a hundred people to check on, versus

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:49.500
a list of two million.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.780
I was wondering how they could tell the difference between somebody who just happened to get

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.260
the game early at a store, and somebody who pirated it.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.580
So I get it now, so that's how customers are called.

01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:02.620
They probably have a way to check while you're playing online, because there's no way, I

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:07.580
don't think there's a way for them to check if you're playing offline, but it's harder,

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:11.340
that's why a lot of the, you know, if you're downloading stuff, they'll recommend that

01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:15.900
you play it offline until the game streets, and you know, I'm sure that there's going

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:21.060
to be a way that they're going to eventually figure out that hey, you know, if you've burned

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:26.400
something or you're playing a backup disc that they're going to find you, but once again

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.100
also they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives, they just release the

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:34.660
new firmware to support what they call the wave 4 discs, because basically each disc

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.220
that comes out they have the current update in there, there's also a video track that

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:43.260
if you're a dumb idiot that puts your 360 in a DVD player that says hey stupid, this

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:55.620
is a 360 game, not a video, so you know, and they check the sizes of those to make sure

01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:01.940
that it's consistent with a good burn of the disc, and also there's a security sector that's

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:09.140
on each disc that they verify based on a retail copy and whatnot, so that's how they have

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:16.940
all these backup plans to make sure that you have a legit burned copy or a copy that is

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:23.580
pretty much undetectable as far as the differences and whatnot, but yeah, basically each side,

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:31.620
you know, both Microsoft and the pirates, they keep updating their tactics, so it'll

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.620
never end.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:39.300
Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs, and honestly if

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.900
you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what,

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:47.620
you kind of deserve it, so there it is.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:53.700
By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, IkumaJP,

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.860
one of our listeners in Japan who has really been just a great listener for us because

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.580
he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.620
because we're so far away, he actually linked us to a news article talking about how only

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:09.940
30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go, and you know how sometimes like in Japan,

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:15.120
line, line, line, line, only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go, you never found those sales

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120
figures, huh?

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.020
Oh, I didn't even look, it probably gives you a good idea.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.300
Well, I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.300
That's alright.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:25.020
Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, it's

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.720
where DarkSakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:34.380
guys should really check out, it's called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:40.420
Oh DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.260
Apparently an incomplete link.

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.260
There we go.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:56.340
Um, the game that I picked was, um, Seaman, not to be confused with sperm, so, um, hello?

01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:03.580
So what month is your- Because, as I neglected to put on the little

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:09.580
thing, there's no background music in this game, so what I put up is an actual example

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:14.580
of conversation in the game that I found in Tesly Hilarious from some guy's YouTube.

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.260
Okay, so wait, shall I play this again then?

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.260
In a minute.

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.260
Okay, go ahead.

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:22.700
Well then you get the cutesy music this week.

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:32.540
Um, anyway, um, the game Seaman is actually for the US version, it was narrated by Leonard

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:39.020
Nimoy, which is pretty freaking cool, and it uses a microphone, it came out on the Dreamcast,

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:48.140
and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them, and they turn into these fish

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:53.260
with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something.

01:32:53.260 --> 01:33:01.700
And they talk to you, and, um, you can have conversations with them, and as they go you

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:06.940
have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff, as well

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:15.460
as prepare a terrarium, because, um, you're going to, um, eventually, uh, let them evolve

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.460
into a fog and then they're going to run away.

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.460
So...

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:20.460
Jesus Christ!

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.540
They're so needy and then they just dump ya?

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.540
Kinda.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.900
Kick those seamen to the curb.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:31.140
But you, but you can, um, uh, they breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.780
kinda weird.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:41.580
Um, but your first stage is a mushroomer, which is, um, what they, uh, originally look

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:47.740
like, and then you have Gillman, and there's the ones that go mar mar mar, that's all I

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:48.740
remember them saying.

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:57.180
Um, and you get Podfish, and then after they mate the male Podfish dies, and then you get

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:10.060
Tadman, and Frogman, and, um, it's a very weird little game, but very fun, um, I remember

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:17.300
watching Dan talk to his fish for, uh, a long time, and it also had, uh, Crispus Seaman

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:23.380
that came out in Japan, it also had a Red Translucent Greek Dreamcast with it, and then

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:31.860
there was a PS2, um, uh, version that got released later on, and, um, then there was

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:38.140
a sequel that came out, which is a lot more, uh, evolution involved, you know, so, it is

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.740
a fun little game.

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:43.740
Now even though you were making, like, fish and frogs, you never, like, ate them, so you

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:51.140
weren't, like, swallowing the Seaman, right?

01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:52.140
Just checking.

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:57.580
Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue, so you can hear some dude interact with his

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.580
...

01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.580
This is intensely hilarious.

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:00.580
Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his Seaman.

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.580
Your birthday in...

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:04.460
October.

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.340
You were born in October?

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.340
Ye-yes.

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.740
Let's try that again.

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:15.300
In what month were you born?

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.620
October.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:20.060
You were born in October?

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.340
Yes.

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:27.100
I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.500
Treat.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.300
Like the spice?

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:33.900
Yes.

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:37.540
Well, you can look, but don't touch.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.660
This makes no fucking sense.

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:40.660
I know, it's great.

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.140
Just keep going, because I like the part where you're so much the fuck off.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:46.860
I don't want to touch you.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.580
What do you want?

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:50.780
To touch you.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.580
I don't know that word.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.860
You just said it.

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:58.660
So, what day is your birthday on?

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.020
Second.

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.140
The second?

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.660
Yes, bitch.

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:08.900
Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.900
I hope you are as peaceful as he.

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:18.460
I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.460
By the way, this is from...

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.460
Fuck you.

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:28.780
Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.

01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:32.100
Besides, what would the neighbors think?

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:35.100
Fuck them.

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.460
I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:42.700
Ebola World is the name of the E-B-O-L-A World, okay, just before I play the rest of this.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:43.700
Fuck them.

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:48.420
Hey, why all the noise?

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420
Your mama.

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420
What?

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.420
Your mama.

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.420
Mama.

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.420
Nope.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420
I'm just fine.

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.420
Wait.

01:36:55.420 --> 01:37:04.940
Sorry, I'm busy.

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.780
You don't look busy.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:13.980
I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:17.900
I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:20.740
Just don't get any ideas about me.

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:26.740
Let's just be friends, for now.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.700
I'll friend your butt.

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.620
Are you coming on to me?

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.620
Yes.

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.620
Yes.

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:43.740
Put this tongue in that mouth, dream on.

01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:44.740
No food for you.

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:58.180
Now, go think about what I've said, and we'll talk again later.

01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:03.020
Rob is red in the case, this is fantastic.

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:04.660
We need to get this game immediately.

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.660
I haven't.

01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.660
Do you really?

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.660
Hold on.

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:11.340
Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.540
games we play for an hour.

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:17.220
That was awesome.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:23.220
Oh, there you go.

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:27.820
That's why this is a classic game.

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:32.500
Oh, she just brought out the game.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.500
See, man?

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500
There it is on the Dreamcast.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.960
They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.140
I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:45.060
Big thanks to the YouTube user Ebola World for the lulls there.

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:50.580
That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:55.460
Pictures going up on the site.

01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.100
Gameguru in chat says, C-Man 3 for the Wii.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:01.100
I agree.

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.340
Then they could call it Butt Friends.

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:04.660
I don't know what they're going to call it.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:09.660
All right, anyhow, clearly, we need to take a break here in studio.

01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:12.540
We'll be right back, though, with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.940
stories tonight, including some rapid-fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:22.100
the N-Gage, probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:27.860
All right, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.860
Stay tuned.

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:38.340
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.740
1st of 2009.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:42.540
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:50.780
For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:53.780
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:58.860
I hope nobody missed it tonight because of the whole Daylight Savings thing, but if you

01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:04.780
don't live in an area that celebrates or recognizes Daylight Savings Time, just know this is the

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.780
good month for Daylight Savings Time.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:12.380
This is what they call fall back, when we get to gain an hour of sleep at night.

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:16.220
The other one that happens in the spring when you spring forward, that one sucks because

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:22.700
you lose an hour of sleep, but everybody hopefully is well rested after a hopefully happy Halloween.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.740
So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.740
safe Halloween.

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:30.860
Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.620
the classic game of the week.

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:35.940
We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.740
get into Twitter topics after that.

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.940
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:47.220
Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this would be the classic Doom.

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:53.900
The original, well, not the original first person shooter, but second or third.

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:54.900
Pretty close.

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.540
Anyways, that'll be coming out quite soon, and actually, it's kind of funny, I read that

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:05.780
the guy that designed the logo and, I guess, title screen for Doom died.

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:12.780
So I guess that sort of ties in there.

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:18.660
Majesco is publishing a new DSi game, I guess it's a DSiWare game, actually.

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:24.560
It's going to be called Ghostwire, and it's what you would call an augmented reality game.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:33.020
You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts,

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:41.460
in which case, then you capture them, I guess, sort of like, I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.460
of.

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:46.140
You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame, I don't really know if that's capturing.

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.780
Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.380
Hopefully it's not too expensive.

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:58.220
And then, finally, Frogger is returning, because, God forbid, Frogger should leave.

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:05.180
Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the Playstation Network, and it's a brand

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:11.220
new game with the classic Frogger gameplay, and rats that are absolutely huge.

01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:16.540
In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.340
car, so we should be concerned.

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:23.340
Must be in New York.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.320
Interesting that Frogger is being done yet again, but I guess those games are popular,

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.820
that they aren't popular enough.

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:32.540
I remember when it came out on the Playstation a little while ago, well, I guess more than

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:36.220
a little while ago, when it came out on the very first Playstation, it was kind of cool,

01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:41.780
the reimagining of it, but then it got really repetitive.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.740
The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.740
12.

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:51.000
Alright, anyhow, I've got a bunch of music game-based news for you guys tonight, starting

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.580
off with ACDC Rock Band, as Loki kind of mentioned a little bit before, it is now not only available

01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:00.700
at Walmart, it is actually available everywhere now, including places like Gamestop and so

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700
forth.

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.860
It is available right now.

01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:10.260
It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.540
It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:15.100
And that's just when the game stops charging for it.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:19.300
Not necessarily what the price will have to be.

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:23.980
So maybe other retailers might be charging like $15 for it if you know where to look.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:25.340
Probably go as low as $9.

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.340
Wow.

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.340
That might be exciting.

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:31.140
Well, if ACDC doesn't interest you, maybe some of the other bands coming to Rock Band

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:32.140
will.

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.820
Of course, these are download songs that are coming out, and this is what's coming out

01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.820
next week.

01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.020
It's a Foo Fighters pack.

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.580
It's the third pack of Foo Fighters songs coming out with Best of You, The Pretender,

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:42.140
Wheels, and Word Forward.

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.580
Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out, including About a Girl, Blue,

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.340
and School, and a Joan Jett song coming out.

01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:53.660
Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.340
Of course, if you're playing on PSP, there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and

01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:02.580
System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged.

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:07.680
And lastly from me tonight, Guitar Hero is also getting some download content.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.140
They are getting a variety of things throughout November.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:16.540
Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:21.220
Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.140
this should be fun to jam to.

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.260
Those are going to be out on November 12th.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.140
November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from KISS, Modern Day Delilah, Lick

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.580
It Up, and I Was Made for Lovin' You.

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:36.020
Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.940
It's free, but it's bands that feature Neversoft employees, so definitely indie bands, and

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:45.140
these are songs that you probably have never heard of.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:48.740
But hey, sometimes playing songs by bands you've never heard of is how you find your

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.800
new favorite song, so that'll be free.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.220
You certainly don't have any excuse not to check that out.

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.680
DarkSakura?

01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:02.980
For anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content, there actually will be some stuff

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:12.580
out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live, or at least if you're in Europe, it'll be

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.380
497 pounds on PSN.

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:26.380
There is a 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga, which is pretty funny.

01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:36.300
There will be Gorillaz and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool, and then on the 24th

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:49.300
we get the David Guetta mix pack, which is one called When Love Takes Over, and Sexy

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:54.140
Chick, and On the Dance Floor, and a few other things.

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.220
Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge

01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.620
club song.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.140
It's a big, big dance song.

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:04.500
Like Energy 927, Before They Win Under, that was their number one song on the station,

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:09.700
so that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.300
And those songs that came out this last week, both very good.

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:18.180
The Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing.

01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.060
I like the other one better.

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.060
It's good too.

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.060
That's the Gorillaz and Dare.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:29.340
That was with Public Enemy.

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:33.160
I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillaz

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:38.180
in it, there's like four or five Gorillaz mashup things in it.

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:50.780
Keep in mind, their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:56.180
big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey Album, which got him in a lot

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.180
of trouble.

01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.180
Oh, I remember that.

01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.180
Okay.

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:04.340
So it makes me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.340
Never thought of it that way.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.340
All right.

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:08.340
Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.

01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:12.900
We don't have a whole lot making the cut tonight, but I do want to acknowledge a couple of tweets

01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.900
that we got here.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.740
And of course, part of that's my fault because I didn't put up the request for Twitter topics

01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:18.740
until like an hour ago.

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.100
But anyhow, Spazinator PSN on Twitter.

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:26.060
Again, you can always follow us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Spazinator PSN

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:32.060
wants to know, not so much a topic, but a debate, the pros and cons of both Sony's and

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:37.700
Microsoft's video marketplaces, i.e. compare and contrast, et cetera.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:38.700
Hmm.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:40.100
Well, I've used both.

01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:42.740
I've downloaded stuff on both of them.

01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:49.740
I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.

01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:53.700
Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:59.140
studio, so, you know, they get movies there, but I find that there's a better selection

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.140
on Microsoft.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.700
I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like there's more stuff available on Microsoft,

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:05.100
but honestly, neither one really has the stuff I really want.

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.540
I have to go to Netflix for all the good stuff.

01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.180
And I wish both of them had more HD.

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.180
I don't know.

01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:12.180
Loki, you ever played around with this stuff?

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:13.180
Nope.

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.180
You don't ever really use a video marketplace?

01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:15.180
Actually, I take that back.

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:22.700
One time we rented Dark City on the Xbox 360 video marketplace.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.700
And got what you paid for?

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.700
All that good stuff?

01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:25.700
Yep.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.700
It was Dark City.

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.980
I like that movie.

01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.260
I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.

01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:33.860
I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.

01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:39.340
So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:42.740
not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.

01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.620
Well now, though, with the new, what is it, when they're going to be converting it to

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:49.300
the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.740
it to your Zune HD or something like that.

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:52.740
That's true.

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.500
So Spassinator, you might want to ask that question again in like two weeks when that

01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.100
new little patch comes out, which obviously my 360 is broken, so I'm not in the preview

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.100
program.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.780
I'm really excited about the Last.fm support.

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:03.780
I think that's kind of cool.

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:05.620
I still haven't played with it.

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:09.660
I prefer Last.fm Pandora, personally, because it makes a lot of recommendations based off

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.940
your own plays.

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.620
Don't use either one, but whatever.

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:21.580
Anyhow, ActDept sent us a link that's called The 10 Biggest WTF Games of All Time.

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:26.220
This is from a site, bravenewgamer.com, so let me run down this list that ActDept sent

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:29.240
us from bravenewgamer.com.

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:31.020
Number 10, Jet Set Radio Future.

01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:32.340
Isn't that weird?

01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:36.160
For a game, it was really different.

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.180
Number 9, Space Giraffe, also known as Tempest on Acid.

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:41.780
That game was just a huge disappointment.

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:45.760
I didn't like Space Giraffe one bit, and I loved Tempest 2000.

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.500
Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:51.500
It's not a WTF game.

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.500
I don't think it's a WTF game, either.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.860
I think the writers put that there for shock value.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.860
Number 7, Shaq-Fu.

01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.740
Now, there's a good WTF game.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.740
That's a good one.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.740
But wasn't that kind of decent?

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.180
No, Shaq-Fu is ridiculous.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.540
But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.620
They had a fan sequel, too, that's even better.

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.620
Are you feeling okay?

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:11.620
Yeah.

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.500
Number 6, Big Rigs Over the Road Racing.

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.980
It's just a horribly bad...

01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:20.300
It's not even really deserving of attention.

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.700
I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.660
Actually, it's quite boring.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:28.620
Number 5 is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which...

01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:29.620
I don't know if...

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:30.620
That's like some tie-in.

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:31.620
I don't think that's really strange.

01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.820
That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:40.420
I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but...

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.700
It's Sega, and Sega loves Michael Jackson.

01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.580
And the game actually was pretty awesome.

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:47.620
I don't know if I can really consider that a WTF game.

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:54.660
It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:55.980
Number 4, Monster Party.

01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.860
I don't even remember this game.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.860
I don't even know what that is.

01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.860
It was on the NES.

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:02.320
I don't even know what the hell that game was.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.860
Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.

01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:06.660
Okay, I give credit.

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.260
That's a WTF game.

01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:10.580
Number 2, Custer's Revenge.

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:15.260
You can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:21.380
This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:25.740
Number 1, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:26.740
again, a lot of effing fun.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.740
You know what game is missing from that list?

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:28.740
That list sucked.

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:29.740
What's that?

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:30.740
You know what game is missing from that list?

01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:31.740
What game is missing from that list?

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:32.740
WTF.

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.740
That's right.

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.420
There was a game called WTF.

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:41.620
Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:43.260
is definitely a WTF game.

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.260
Choaniki is...

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.260
Yeah.

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260
And Noby Noby Boy.

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:49.260
I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.

01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:53.580
But thank you anyway to ACT-F for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion

01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:54.580
on that list.

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.580
That was a horrible list.

01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:56.580
Yeah, it wasn't that great.

01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:57.580
No, seriously.

01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:01.580
I mean, I can think of a couple already, I mean, Oonga Boonga.

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.660
Yeah, Oonga Boonga is definitely a WTF game.

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.380
There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.540
It's another arcade game that's really weird.

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:13.220
XLink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.

01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.660
There was the Spice Girls game.

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:15.980
That was kind of strange.

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.880
It was hilarious, though.

01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:22.020
There was another game where you played a UFO, or not a UFO, an alien or something.

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.140
It was a Sega game where you scared people.

01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:25.540
I don't remember what that was called.

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:26.540
Incredible Crisis.

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:31.060
I'm not, that's the game, I mean, that would be a good...

01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:33.380
That is a good WTF game.

01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:36.140
Irritating Stick.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.780
Somebody in chat, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible

01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:40.780
game?

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:44.900
I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:49.220
Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.

01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:53.860
Zombies versus, or was it, Ambulance versus Zombies.

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:58.380
Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.

01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:02.260
Or they had, I'm trying to think if there's some other weird ones.

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:06.380
There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.

01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.220
Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.

01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:12.740
That was a great entry too, good job.

01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.280
So there you go.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.580
We just already came up with 10 games, I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:21.860
Here's another weird one, Goo Goo Soundy.

01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:23.660
Which I think I have this somewhere.

01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.540
And who could forget, President Cat is a little bit WTF.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:34.820
No, no, apart from that, also, Vibribin, C-Man.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.420
C-Man's a little bit WTF.

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:41.020
That guy right there, he probably like, his editor or whatever said, listen, you gotta

01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:42.380
write an article for this guy.

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:46.760
Gotta get something that's gonna get on Dig, and Dig loves top 10 lists.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.980
So think of a top 10 list that you haven't seen on Dig yet, and just throw some games

01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:52.460
out there that'll get people talking.

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:57.580
Go even weirder, MojiBribin, which was even more bizarre than Vibribin.

01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:03.860
Anyhow, Act F wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since RenoE is kind of like

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:07.880
a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet

01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.820
President Cat, nowhere to be seen?

01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:10.820
Hmm.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.340
Who wants to be President Kitty?

01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:16.060
Perhaps, uh, they need to bring it over to my house.

01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:20.740
They need to give out copies of that game, you know, with like, purchases at say, PetSmart

01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:24.700
or something like that, you know, go the whole sneak king route.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:25.700
That's a good idea.

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.100
Alright, let's move on with some more long form news.

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:32.460
Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:40.020
Um, well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on, that would

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.340
be the Nokia N-Gage.

01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:49.740
Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage, um, honestly, to me this seems

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:55.720
like one of those situations where like you're, you know, the N-Gage is your like, grandparent

01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:01.260
or something that was, had died in their apartment months ago and they just now went to visit

01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.300
them and found them lying there rotting.

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.940
I mean, this is pretty much, you know, the N-Gage.

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:11.360
I think it was dead a long time ago, and we just now are kind of acknowledging the fact

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.380
that we haven't heard from the N-Gage in a while, maybe better check and see if they're

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:17.660
still alive.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.140
God bless them for trying.

01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:21.140
They were dedicated.

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.500
God bless them for not trying that hard, though.

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:28.380
That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled

01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:31.460
the sounds of decaying in her cats.

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:32.460
Which is a true story.

01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.460
Ew!

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:34.460
That's what I think of.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.460
Gross.

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:40.420
It's not a show if I don't gross out Rob at least once.

01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:43.700
Which goes to show you that cats are popular.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:48.500
Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying Game Boy is for kids,

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.740
and that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage, and I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:56.940
So um, Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.

01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:02.340
They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.860
the N-Gage didn't work.

01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:07.580
And this little thing called the iPhone came out, whoops!

01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:11.220
Just didn't know how to do it right, you just don't make your system look like a taco.

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:12.220
No side taco.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.220
Ooh, I want a taco.

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.220
You know what sounds good right now?

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.220
Jim Boys.

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.220
Mmm, taco.

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.860
Don't make that face start talking.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.980
No, Jim Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:21.980
Really?

01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:22.980
Yes.

01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:25.980
That's like, that's like me and Chipotle.

01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:28.300
Does it make you bleed out of your head?

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.300
Don't be disgusting.

01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:35.820
All right, moving into uh, if the show could distance itself from South Park.

01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.460
Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man, or Explosion Man of course is a game

01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:45.160
on the Xbox 360, it got an update this week.

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:49.500
Now there are some Avatar awards, you know, you can actually get clothes for your Avatar

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.500
now, and they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game, which is pretty

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:54.500
cool.

01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:59.580
Also, what's very interesting about this is that the um, developers Twisted Pixel has

01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:07.620
teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in, it wants mood, hundreds

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.600
of top quality steak fillets.

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:16.160
You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pic, and then if you play

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:23.380
some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak for playing Splosion Man.

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.540
Yeah, they keep trying to get me to buy their steaks because I bought steaks for like some

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:33.980
of our game publishers a while back, and they will not stop hounding me to buy more steaks,

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:40.100
and I'm like, listen, that was a one time thing man, I don't want to buy more steak

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:47.540
from you, it's expensive and your steak, well, it is steak, and you know, I'd rather go to

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:50.340
the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:55.060
I own a Tropic in chat, I knew somebody was going to say it, it says, I'm a vegetarian.

01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:57.020
So yeah, what do the vegetarians get?

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.020
Tofu.

01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.020
Nothing.

01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:00.580
I guess, can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?

01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:01.580
They have cake.

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:02.580
They sell cake.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.580
Do they?

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:04.580
Oh, the steak people sell cake?

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:05.580
Yeah.

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:09.420
And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.

01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:13.900
I guess that might work, if the place is giving you a gift certificate I guess you could do

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:14.900
that.

01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:15.900
Or baked potatoes.

01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:16.900
They have baked potatoes.

01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:17.900
You know a lot about this company.

01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:18.900
They've obviously given you a sales pitch.

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.580
I bought me steaks from there.

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:21.860
What did you buy steak for?

01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:26.700
I was buttering up some of my publishers.

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:27.700
And I also bought it for my...

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.140
Wait, so you bought the game publisher's steak?

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.140
Yeah, they're reps.

01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.620
Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?

01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.260
Maybe that's where they got the idea from.

01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:35.260
No.

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.260
Maybe they were like...

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:37.260
They're a developer, not a publisher.

01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.500
Oh yeah, duh, my bad.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:43.660
I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:49.060
No, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.

01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:52.020
I don't remember if it was last year or the year before last.

01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:54.620
That just seems weird though, because they would have to FedEx them to you or something?

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:55.620
Yeah, they FedEx them.

01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:56.620
It comes in a...

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.420
Actually, I had my dad send it to me.

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:06.300
It comes in a big old styrofoam cooler with dry ice in it, and they put steaks and burgers

01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:08.140
and whatnot.

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:15.260
You can get crab, lobster, it's just it's not worth it buying.

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.660
There's plenty of other places.

01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:21.860
And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me

01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:22.860
that's...

01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:24.460
I'll just go buy from there.

01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:28.900
All right, well, we're going to get into our mailbag segment.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:32.620
And every week you guys send in emails, and Dark Soccer likes to pick a few of her favorites

01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:35.020
and read them live on air for all of you to hear.

01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:37.480
I'm going to ask Dark Soccer though, are you okay to do this tonight, or do you want me

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:38.480
to do it?

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.480
With your voice and everything?

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.480
I can try.

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:42.020
All right, Dark Soccer is going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:45.900
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com and read some emails for you guys right now.

01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:49.220
I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had any to do.

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.220
There's just two.

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:51.220
All right, then let's read them.

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:55.220
So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery

01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:56.940
because I'm an impatient bastard.

01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:00.060
Anyway, the game is weird, but fun kind of.

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:03.420
I can't figure out half of the mini games because my Japanese isn't that good, and some

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.180
of the games may just be broken.

02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:09.980
But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.900
playing one of the exercise mini games from the game.

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:17.060
It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:20.460
If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.

02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:24.660
Cheers AZHP.

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.020
I can open that up right now.

02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.700
I'll go dig it in the mailbag.

02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.700
It's only 40 seconds?

02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:29.700
Yeah.

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:30.700
Oh, that's not that bad.

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:33.180
Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.

02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:34.740
I'll fringe your butt.

02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:37.220
I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:38.220
Go for it.

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:39.220
Hey guys.

02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.220
Happy hallows end.

02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:44.280
I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.060
a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a tingle costume handing out

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.140
candy.

02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.140
Just a thought.

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.140
And that's from cheeseburger.

02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:52.980
Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?

02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:54.980
Just a tingle.

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.020
Shut up.

02:00:57.020 --> 02:00:58.020
I don't know.

02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:01.580
It didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.

02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:04.660
Have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Lawn's radio?

02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.660
This will be a first.

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:06.660
I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:07.660
What's that?

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.660
I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:10.660
Let me double check.

02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:14.060
Wouldn't you think that would be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something?

02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.060
I would think.

02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.060
I guess it kind of depends on what's going on.

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:17.060
It is indeed on a Sunday.

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:18.060
I guess it depends.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.060
Well, it's a year away.

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:20.060
We'll see.

02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:22.980
Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?

02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:24.540
Remind us in a year.

02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:30.340
Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas, so.

02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:33.660
Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:34.660
Or with one of the C-Man.

02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.060
You can just sit here and do the show.

02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:38.060
I'll be your friend.

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.060
Anyhow.

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:41.060
I'll friend your butt.

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:45.460
I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.460
C-Man.

02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:49.980
Oh, so like when one of our serial callers calls in, like the people they get on every

02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:50.980
week.

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:51.980
Like the spasinator calls in.

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:52.980
I could wire that up.

02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:55.380
Have it be a segment talk to C-Man.

02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:57.100
You could wire that up.

02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.100
The word.

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:02.860
Yeah, but keep in mind you have to check them every day because it runs on the Dreamcast

02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:03.860
timer.

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:11.620
I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the C-Man fish.

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.780
But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:14.780
That's what we've done.

02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:16.580
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:18.580
Are you a Libra?

02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:25.020
Alright, here's the video that AZ- Besides, what would the neighbors think?

02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:28.660
Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary

02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:29.660
on.

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:34.700
Well, that's definitely spandex.

02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.100
This is the official channel.

02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.340
That's the cat-punch exercise.

02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.340
Is it?

02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:40.780
And his corgi's like, what the fuck.

02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:43.740
I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever because they have a bunch of people

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:44.740
doing that.

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:51.940
It is.

02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.620
He just looks like he's kind of dancing.

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:56.260
It looks like he could be holding the wiimote doing that.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.740
This dog seems entirely amused.

02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:02.900
I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.

02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:05.300
No, this isn't from the game.

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.900
This is a contest they have there on their website.

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.020
It's some dance or something that the cat does.

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.020
Gotcha.

02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:17.260
But seriously, if they have contests like this on their website, I don't believe that

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.420
it hasn't sold 100 copies.

02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:26.220
On top of that, they actually, yesterday they had an event in a cabaret to promote the game.

02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:32.940
I actually posted on Twitter if any of our Japanese listeners attended that I'd like

02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:37.580
to know how it went, but seriously, I think that they had to have sold more than 100.

02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:41.020
Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.

02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:45.380
But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before,

02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:54.020
I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil and I think it

02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.420
translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:03.740
Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan who listens to our show on Monday

02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:10.100
afternoon live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise, like company exercises in the morning.

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:11.260
That's what the dude's doing.

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:16.980
It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting

02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:18.580
the air like little kittens.

02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:21.700
That's what the cat does.

02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:23.020
That's what they really need to do here.

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:24.380
They need to implement that kind of thing here.

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:27.100
I could really use like a 10 a.m. stretch at work sometimes.

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:28.100
I know.

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:30.100
You know what I mean?

02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:31.100
All right.

02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:32.100
Anyhow.

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:34.900
Dear Congress, make it so.

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:38.140
I just want to point out, because some of our chat room is still hung up on the whole

02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:43.380
I'll fringe your butt comment, and in fact, we have some folks saying, let's see, togak

02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:46.380
in chat says, going to use that tomorrow at school.

02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:50.540
Okay, look, have fun, freedom of speech, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:54.460
You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you

02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:55.460
heard a comment like that.

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:56.460
Okay, just saying.

02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:57.460
You didn't hear it here.

02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:01.100
But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.

02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:03.340
Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?

02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:05.340
That's all you have to do.

02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.340
All right.

02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:07.340
Moving on.

02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:10.420
No one would believe you, because no one watches that garbage.

02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:13.740
Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.

02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:14.740
Yes.

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:20.700
So, I don't know, I didn't really play too much of the original game, a little bit on,

02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.100
actually I think I played some of it during the show one time.

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.500
What, sorry, togak says, got it, I learned it from Oprah.

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.780
Okay, there you go, excellent, that wins.

02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:40.220
I guess the Flash version of Line Rider has been tweaked a little bit.

02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:43.700
They've added some new support to the game.

02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:50.220
Now you can actually play as two different riders, or torture two different riders.

02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:55.540
It's a brand new dual rider mode, and they've added a new, you can select the starting point

02:05:55.540 --> 02:06:01.820
for the second rider, as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.580
decelerate the rider as well.

02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:09.740
I guess you could use this to do races, or some sort of synchronized run, or something

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:10.860
like that.

02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:17.460
And the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for, I guess the iPhone, they're

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:22.260
also going to do like a Line Racer game or something, so that's kind of neat.

02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.900
I don't know, a free update.

02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:26.900
I like free.

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:32.940
And the game is popular, and they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for

02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:33.940
it.

02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:38.400
Well, this next game isn't free, but it's certainly a popular game, in fact one that

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:43.460
seemed to disappear for quite some time, and then suddenly is now coming back.

02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:46.740
Excite Bike is getting a new version.

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:52.540
That's right, this is not Excite Truck, this is not Excite Bots, this is Excite Bike, the

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:54.360
original 8-bit game.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:59.140
It was announced this week on the show Nintendo Week, let me come back to that in a minute,

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:03.640
that Excite Bike World Rally is coming out on November 9th.

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.500
It's like a new souped up version of the 8-bit Excite Bike, like they have now, it's like

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:14.260
3D, I don't want to say 3D, but like that 2.5D, like Street Fighter 4 has 3D elements,

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:17.500
but it's still like a 2D game, but that's what they're doing with this Excite Bike.

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:19.380
It's a 3D game on a 2D plane.

02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:25.240
And an online multiplayer, and, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game

02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:28.100
had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?

02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:29.100
Track Editor?

02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:33.420
Track Editor, with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:38.260
America because that's how lazy the translation was, because it was originally a Famicom disc

02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.260
game overseas.

02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:43.180
You know what's awesome too that no one seemed to notice in any of the previews and stuff?

02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:48.500
It also has the icons like in Excite Truck, where you hit them and then the landscape

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:53.340
changes so ramps appear out of thin air.

02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.340
That sounds awesome.

02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:57.220
Yeah, you can kind of see that in the little video too that was there.

02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:02.460
So Track Editor, online multiplayer, Excite Bike World Rally is coming out November 9th,

02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:03.740
and I'm pretty excited.

02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.700
Like I wish Nintendo would do this with more of their old school franchises, but I do want

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:11.140
to say the show they chose to debut it on, Nintendo Week, I guess this is a little thing

02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.380
they do on the Nintendo channel.

02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:17.960
I watched it, and wow, have you ever watched that show?

02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:23.560
Like I think it must be written for a 7-year-old or something like that because it was really

02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:24.900
difficult to watch.

02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:29.580
Like it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo, and when I say

02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:35.180
really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.

02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:38.580
In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:42.260
I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excite Bike trailer.

02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:47.060
I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:49.860
It's that bad.

02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:55.700
Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's

02:08:55.700 --> 02:09:01.340
time for us to get into the FUs of the Week, but we have a little bit of a story to inspire

02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:04.020
the FUs of the Week.

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:09.380
Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.

02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:10.380
There we go.

02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:29.740
Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the Week tonight.

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:37.220
A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:43.500
Silent Hill is not often always seen as like the thing that the games made me do it.

02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:50.140
Somehow this game tends to escape that, but apparently there was a 35-year-old man that

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:56.260
said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.

02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:00.220
His name was Jan H. At least that's all they're calling him right now.

02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:03.940
Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.

02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:04.940
So what did he do?

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:09.500
He broke into Sophia Hospital in the Netherlands in April, I guess maybe now it's just going

02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:10.500
to trial.

02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:13.420
He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.

02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:18.260
People were trapped in elevators, doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:20.100
Thank God nobody died.

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:23.780
By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.

02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:24.780
Why?

02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:30.740
The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:36.700
I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head.

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:41.080
I don't know, but that story is just all kinds of strange.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.700
So F you to strange things.

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:43.700
That's ridiculous.

02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:47.380
You're always trying to restore power and never shut it off in Silent Hill.

02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:51.540
Dark Sakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?

02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:56.260
I want my voice back and I want my foot to stop hurting.

02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.260
That's about it.

02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.260
Loki?

02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:05.380
F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.

02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:10.500
Not one handful, one candy that we ran out because there wasn't that many people.

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.540
But seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this and you're too greedy.

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:17.620
F you to the Bay Bridge.

02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:22.080
Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:23.080
know what?

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:24.340
Let me put it this way.

02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:30.180
I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend

02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:33.540
Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.

02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:35.300
So I bought an audio book to keep me company.

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:37.420
I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.

02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:38.420
I highly recommend it.

02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:39.420
It wasn't funny.

02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:40.940
It was just good.

02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:43.020
It's six and a half hours.

02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.320
I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:53.100
That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge and terrible.

02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:56.860
So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causes the damn thing

02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.540
to break.

02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:01.420
And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.

02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:02.780
Oh, it's going to be open Friday.

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:03.780
Oh, you know what?

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:04.780
Fuck it.

02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:05.780
It'll be open Monday.

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:06.940
And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:11.660
And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.180
time, stop teasing me.

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:19.820
And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place

02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:24.020
for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.

02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:25.020
I don't know.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:28.220
You don't really pay us enough to do it.

02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:29.220
Fucking Bart.

02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:30.220
Fucking Bay Bridge.

02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:31.220
Lame.

02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:32.220
Fucking all.

02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:33.220
Exactly.

02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:37.500
Who decided to build a major city over there anyway?

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.500
Seriously.

02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:42.100
Like you have to go around a Bay to get there.

02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:46.460
I guess it made sense back in the days of more ship and all that stuff.

02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:47.460
Forget it.

02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:49.500
I'm done at being angsty.

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.500
More news.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:51.500
Then Skype.

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:54.220
Then the end of the show.

02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:56.980
Alright.

02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:02.120
So unfortunately this has nothing to do with the Bay Bridge.

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:10.220
But a game we were talking about for a while now, 3D Dot Game Heroes, which is kind of

02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:17.260
an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:19.700
Pretty much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:26.140
Well thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.

02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:33.020
It's not seeing who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from

02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:39.860
software because how they bring games over here sometimes, but at some point it is going

02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:44.580
to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter, no need to import 3D

02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:51.820
Game Heroes for PS3, it's definitely coming to an A. Spread the word, more to come.

02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:53.500
So awesome.

02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:56.260
And have you seen the loading screens for this game?

02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:58.620
I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.

02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:01.980
I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh that looks kind of neat, but I just

02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:05.300
don't really know, I haven't really done my research on that game I guess.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:10.900
The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games

02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:18.720
like Mega Man Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.860
things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.

02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.060
But they're just inspired, right?

02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:26.380
Because you couldn't rip those things off, or they didn't get busted.

02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:30.580
Well, they look very similar, they're just done in this art style or whatever.

02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:31.580
Interesting.

02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:39.340
It's similar enough, so you kind of get the homage, but the game looks awesome.

02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:44.420
Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation,

02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:48.900
or the PS3 I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things

02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.900
up like that.

02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:50.900
Like, I love it.

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:55.260
I wish all the consoles had been region-free, but whatever.

02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.260
Stupid laws.

02:14:56.260 --> 02:15:03.900
Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import, are Blu-rays region protected?

02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:10.580
Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays, we're the same region as Japan.

02:15:10.580 --> 02:15:11.580
Interesting.

02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:16.220
Well, maybe Japan might want to import this, or who knows, but there's a Blu-ray release

02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:20.700
of District 9 coming out, that was obviously a big movie over here in the US, and it's

02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:22.460
coming out on Blu-ray very soon.

02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460
Guess what it's coming with?

02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:25.420
It's coming with a video game demo.

02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:27.660
That game, God of War 3.

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:31.460
Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th, I guess it's going to

02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:35.900
cash in on the gift cards after the holidays, and that's, by the way, after the God of War

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:40.460
collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo, but some folks that already had

02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:44.100
the first two games may not want to re-buy them, I don't know.

02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:45.560
So this will be another option.

02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:50.700
If you get District 9, you'll actually get the God of War 3 demo with District 9.

02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:55.900
Also, what's kind of interesting, if you play through the demo, a making of featurette will

02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:58.540
be unlocked for the game.

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:02.660
Strange, because that really has nothing to do with District 9, except the fact that maybe

02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:06.380
it's the same target audience, and they're both from Sony.

02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:11.580
It's very similar that, I mean, very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like

02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:15.340
that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:20.500
Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of the games

02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:21.500
based on movies.

02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:26.280
They had one, and you're going to have to think way back here.

02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:31.900
There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where

02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:33.820
you can play as a stealth plane.

02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:35.200
Oh wow.

02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:37.460
I wouldn't have even thought of that.

02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:41.500
Also, just recently, the Watchmen, one of the animated movies came out with a game,

02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:45.320
like they did a combo thing there, but this is different, because really, what do God

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.940
of War and District 9 have in common?

02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:49.440
Not a damn thing, you know?

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:53.380
Except maybe it's the same target audience.

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:56.900
I never did see District 9, though.

02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:01.060
I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though, even though I was never really into

02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:02.060
the first two games.

02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:04.420
I think I'm going to pick up that collection, because everybody tells me, you gotta play

02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:05.420
God of War.

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:06.420
You gotta play God of War.

02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:10.060
So, I'm kind of glad I waited, now I can play him in high def.

02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:13.740
Anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype

02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:19.520
line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, as always, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one

02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.040
more story for you guys first.

02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:25.660
This is kind of interesting.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:32.100
Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.

02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:39.220
They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament

02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:45.700
decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.

02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:53.660
They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers, yes, using women

02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:58.340
that are topless and rubbing themselves all over the players.

02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:05.580
Thankfully, though, and this is, I guess, a testament of their dedication to the game,

02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:11.980
they were unable to drag those gamers away from Counter-Strike.

02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:20.180
A quote here from English Russia reported, it was impossible to put an intention of those

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.740
hopeless men off the game.

02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:30.100
It was drawing too close, and the ladies were sweating as much as they could, but the eyes

02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:33.300
of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:38.100
And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it, and man, they tried everything.

02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:46.340
Huh, it's just two things that you think would go together naturally, or what I like to call

02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:48.860
the coolest gaming tournament ever.

02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:54.660
Maybe they should do a gaming, do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that

02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:55.660
here in the US?

02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:00.380
Oh, everyone would complain, but it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever.

02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:01.940
What if a strip club did it?

02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:04.820
What if a place of sin did it anyway?

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:10.420
Can you imagine if Centerfolds did, you know what we need to do?

02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:13.180
I have a great idea.

02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:19.700
We need to approach Centerfolds about having an orange lounge radio gaming tournament at

02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:20.700
Centerfolds.

02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:21.820
Wouldn't that be amazing?

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:28.860
Or I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I

02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:30.500
drive by all the time.

02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.460
There's Showgirls and City Limits and a lot of these other clubs too.

02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:38.540
We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.180
Wouldn't that be fun?

02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:41.900
That would be funny.

02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.300
The wife would go?

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:46.260
That would be funny.

02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:57.940
I don't know if that would work, or be feasible, or even make money, but it's a funny idea.

02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:00.720
I think it's funnier though because they had no idea it was coming.

02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:06.980
If you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.

02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:12.940
But I'm just saying, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before, that just games

02:20:12.940 --> 02:20:14.780
and strippers together in one roof.

02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:15.780
It would have to be something that-

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:17.580
As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:22.140
Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:25.180
It's like, holy shit, nah.

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:28.940
Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.

02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:29.940
I don't know.

02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:30.940
That would be tough.

02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:31.940
I don't know.

02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:38.820
If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't

02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:39.820
you give us a call?

02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:43.980
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:46.340
The Skype line is now open for business.

02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.700
We've already got a call coming in.

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:48.700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:49.700
Who's this?

02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:50.700
Hello.

02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:51.700
It's Ray Iyanami.

02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:53.580
Well, hello, Ray Iyanami.

02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:54.580
How are you?

02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:55.580
What's on your mind tonight?

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:56.580
Okay.

02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:58.580
I just came back from YaoiCon.

02:20:58.580 --> 02:20:59.580
YaoiCon?

02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:00.580
Yeah.

02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:01.580
Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?

02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.580
San Mateo specifically.

02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:09.340
Oh, so I was a little ways away because I was thinking as I was driving through Japantown

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:13.300
because the theater I do Rocky Horror at is right near Japantown in San Francisco, and

02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:16.420
I was thinking like, I wonder if this is where YaoiCon is going on right now.

02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:19.900
I should like swing by and say hello even though I had no ticket.

02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:23.420
I was like, try to use my media poll or lack thereof.

02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:29.900
Well, I believe this is the third year during holding it in San Mateo.

02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:30.900
Apparently I missed the boat.

02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:31.900
Well, okay.

02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:34.400
So you went to YaoiCon.

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:35.520
That must have been interesting.

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:36.520
How was that?

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:37.520
It's all right.

02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:44.980
Like, the other thing is you couldn't tell it was a ton specifically for living in Yaoi.

02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:50.220
If you're like looking inside the hotel lobby, you have to go like the tiles or all the interesting

02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:56.340
activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.

02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:00.460
Now I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question

02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:05.820
and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?

02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:06.820
Mostly straight.

02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:07.820
So, okay.

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:08.820
So what were you doing going to YaoiCon?

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:11.820
Just because that's where all the horny women are?

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:12.820
On the television.

02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:13.820
Oh, okay.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:14.820
For fun.

02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:15.820
There you go.

02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:22.940
But I feel mostly straight, I feel like real life guys make me go, man.

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:29.900
It's mostly like anime and video game guys that make me say I'm only mostly straight.

02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:30.900
Interesting.

02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:31.900
Okay.

02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:33.820
Well, then Yaoi kind of taps into that whole thing, I guess.

02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:35.060
So hey, cool.

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:38.220
I'm just kind of curious because I actually know, like, it's interesting because like

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:41.420
I know a lot of straight guys that like to go to these types of things like YaoiCon.

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:44.580
Like it seems like a lot of the reports I read are from straight guys and I'm kind of

02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:48.340
like, okay, well, that kind of reminds me of like when all the straight people started

02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:49.380
coming into the gay bar.

02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:54.780
Like obviously, you know, there's, be who you want to be, just, you know, don't infringe

02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:55.780
on other people's rights.

02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:56.980
It doesn't really matter.

02:22:56.980 --> 02:23:01.700
But at the same time, when all the straight people started showing up at the gay bar,

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:05.620
wasn't really a gay bar anymore and everybody went somewhere else.

02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:06.620
But whatever.

02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.620
Love who you want to love.

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:16.740
I went to a few panels and stuff like the Bishon auction, where things start to really

02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:17.740
get interesting.

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:24.260
Like their bids are doing as high as like $500 and guys sitting at their clothes, like

02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:30.540
the guys on auction doing sitting at their clothes left and right among other things.

02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:34.300
I just realized some of our chatters don't know what Yaoi is and sometimes we take that

02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:37.380
kind of stuff for granted that we just assume everybody knows what it is, but of course

02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:38.700
not everybody knows what it is.

02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:39.700
Yeah.

02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:41.980
What do you, would you like to explain it?

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:42.980
Okay.

02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:43.980
Go for it.

02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:44.980
Okay.

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:51.460
Basically Yaoi is like male on male erotic anime or manga.

02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:54.140
But it's not, but, but this is important to also state.

02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:55.140
It's not porn.

02:23:55.140 --> 02:24:00.900
Like, it's just like, yeah, I have some, the focus.

02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:01.900
Anyways.

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:02.900
Yeah.

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:07.980
What I've noticed from what you guys have seen is mostly focused on the romance, like

02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:15.300
if I walk into a random room showing Yaoi, there's a very low chance I'll walk into a

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.300
sex scene.

02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:17.300
Interesting.

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:23.900
Like I'll just walk into them having a converse, a pretty deep conversation or whatever.

02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:24.900
All right.

02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:27.340
Now I started a whole little argument on whether it's porn or not.

02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:33.180
I think that it gets though to the, the disturbing point though, when it's Shota, which is little

02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:35.620
boys, that's disgusting.

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:36.620
That's not okay.

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:39.260
That's not okay.

02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:42.140
Do what you want to do as long as they're 18 or over.

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.140
Okay.

02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:44.140
That's the key thing.

02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:45.140
All right.

02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:46.140
Anyway, we are digressing completely.

02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:48.780
Did they have gaming or anything going on at Yaoi Con?

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:52.460
They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.

02:24:52.460 --> 02:24:58.340
Perfect product on an PS2 on an HDTV, which translates to, yay lag.

02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:05.060
And there's a lot of Rockland and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.

02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:06.060
This is a great description.

02:25:06.060 --> 02:25:07.060
I'm sorry.

02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:10.860
This is a great description from SSJ100 Matt in chat room saying it's Brokeback Mountain

02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:15.700
romantic type manga, but even Brokeback Mountain, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain

02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:16.700
had a sex scene.

02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:23.740
There was a scene where Heath Ledger friended James Villanelle's butt.

02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:27.540
What else about the gaming did you want to say?

02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:33.900
But yeah, I tried playing Para Para Paradise on their set up there, and it was on HDTV,

02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:42.100
and it was played on San Diego Girlfriend's 3DS machine between 2004 and no, 2003, 2007,

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:47.820
and knows how bad rhythm games are on an HDTV with no upscaling.

02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:53.900
Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where

02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:58.420
you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, it was, if your TV lags, then it sucks

02:25:58.420 --> 02:25:59.420
to be you.

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:04.620
Yeah, I normally don't feel it's also a Para Para Paradise, but I was feeling songs that

02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:10.540
in the arcade, I could clearly pass with no problem, just mainly rage quit.

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:11.540
Alright.

02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:13.620
Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.

02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:16.380
Do you think you're going to go back next year?

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:18.660
Hopefully.

02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:19.900
One of these years I'll go.

02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:23.020
I always say I'm going to go to YALIcon, but then it's just like, it's always just at a

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.100
bad time for me, but one of these years I'll get there, hopefully next year.

02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:27.980
I liked it the one time I went.

02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:29.900
Yeah, I at least want to make a cameo.

02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:33.460
Alright, well anyway, we're going to let you go, Ray, so we can get some more calls, but

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:36.220
thank you very much, and we'll talk to you again soon, okay?

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:38.140
Okay, I'll see you later.

02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:43.220
1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype, orange lounger radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:50.140
While we wait for some calls, although I saw the, oh, here, it's ringing again.

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:52.140
I hate, can I just say this?

02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:54.900
I hate the new Skype.

02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:57.060
I cannot stand it.

02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:01.580
Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing, it's like, if

02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:04.140
I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.

02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:05.140
I can't answer it.

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:08.220
It's just, I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.

02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:11.100
I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay, we got another one.

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:13.100
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.100
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:16.940
Hi, X-Link, how are you, buddy?

02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:17.940
What's on your mind?

02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:18.940
Hey, doing good.

02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:23.620
Just celebrated my birthday yesterday, had a lot of fun doing that, but...

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:24.620
Well, happy birthday.

02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:25.620
Wait, you were at Halloween?

02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:26.620
No, I was calling in.

02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:27.620
You were at Halloween, baby?

02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:28.620
Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.

02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:29.620
Alright.

02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:32.460
Yes, yes, unfortunately I was one of the two.

02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:34.820
You're probably sick of people commenting on that, so...

02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:38.660
I was calling in because...

02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:39.660
Go ahead, you're calling in because...

02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:40.660
I'm sorry.

02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:46.780
I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having

02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:52.460
a lot of fun with, was Press Your Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:58.060
and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon, and it was released on Tuesday.

02:27:58.060 --> 02:27:59.520
I didn't even realize this.

02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:03.140
What system is this for, the Wii?

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:04.140
It was for the Wii.

02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:10.860
I picked up the PC version because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then

02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:14.460
they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.

02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:17.180
Well, this is like game show heaven going on right now.

02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:21.300
Well, briefly describe for our listeners Press Your Luck and your impressions on it, if you

02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:22.300
would.

02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:25.260
Oh, I loved it.

02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:27.740
It was exactly like it would play on the game show.

02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:33.180
The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they'll give out a question,

02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:39.740
you have the buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally

02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:46.740
you would say on the game show, they'll give you four choices based on the selection.

02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:51.100
If you have the answer for the question right and you're the first one to buzz in, you would

02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:56.720
get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for

02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:58.220
having the right answer.

02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:01.020
They do four questions per round.

02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:05.540
Once you do the four questions, then they turn around and you face the board and then

02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:09.420
you would do the spinning for the money and prizes.

02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:13.900
Of course, the infamous no whammies, no whammies, stop.

02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:19.780
Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.

02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.900
If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.

02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:30.740
If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:35.700
That's how it's more strategic if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:40.100
oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player to have an extra spin.

02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:44.740
You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money

02:29:44.740 --> 02:29:47.460
to overpass you in the amount.

02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:49.020
Does the game have the cool whammy animations?

02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:51.020
I love it.

02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:53.020
Yes, it does.

02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:57.380
In the fact of loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy

02:29:57.380 --> 02:30:01.620
thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.620
It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.

02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:06.460
You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck and that sounds

02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:08.460
like it could be a lot of fun.

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:11.940
Yes, definitely.

02:30:11.940 --> 02:30:17.620
If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel

02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:22.100
spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii remote, so it's a lot better than it is on the PC.

02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:24.900
These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of

02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:26.380
fun.

02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:31.820
Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games, it's like shovelware.

02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:35.620
I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:36.900
that don't regularly play games.

02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:37.900
It is.

02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:38.900
Everybody knows Press Your Luck.

02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:44.020
Yes, it's a lot of fun and for 20 bucks, you can't really beat that price for some lenses

02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:45.020
too.

02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:46.020
It's very cheap.

02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:47.020
That's a really good price.

02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:48.940
Well, thank you very much for the ReviewX link.

02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:50.700
I might just have to pick that up.

02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:54.860
Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?

02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:59.580
No, I just can't believe that guy didn't get into trouble for the hospital bed.

02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:01.380
You would think for sure he would get into some kind of trouble.

02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:05.620
That would be like me going out, shooting somebody in cold blood and going, oh, well,

02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:10.100
I seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.100
somebody for real or GTA.

02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:14.860
Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:20.140
No, no, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.

02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:24.780
Still, though, it's a darn good thing no one died.

02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:29.020
All right, X-Link, we're going to let you go, but have a great week, okay?

02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:30.020
Yeah.

02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:31.020
Later.

02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:32.020
Definitely, you too.

02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:33.020
Thanks.

02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:35.260
All right, we're going to try to take some more calls here.

02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:38.180
I just want to stress, I really hate the new Skype.

02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:42.780
In fact, I want to find the old version and download that instead, if I can.

02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:44.780
We'll try to do at least one more call here tonight.

02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:47.260
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeOnsRadio.

02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:48.580
Hi, you're on OrangeOnsRadio.

02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:49.580
Who's this?

02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:51.580
Hi, this is Spaz here.

02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:52.580
Hi, Spaznator.

02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:54.860
What's on your mind?

02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:56.860
Yeah, a couple things.

02:31:56.860 --> 02:32:06.820
First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I get news about home.

02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:08.700
Yeah, what's that?

02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:09.700
What's...

02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:16.900
Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought it would be a match because

02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:22.660
of the little turn the show took earlier on.

02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:24.420
Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex in home?

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.420
Is that the update?

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:26.420
Well, not really.

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:37.400
I don't know if we checked the mall lately or not, but if you go to the furniture store

02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:49.940
on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there, quite literally, they got

02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:51.460
toilets in there now.

02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:54.300
Wait, like, you can buy poop?

02:32:54.300 --> 02:33:02.020
Well, I think you have to fly the poop yourself, but they got toilets in there now, and we're

02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:03.020
with two of them.

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:12.540
In fact, in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them, there's a golden toilet, and they're

02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:19.660
calling it the golden throne, and they're selling it for, damn it, I got the error for

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:20.660
price.

02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:27.560
It's kind of expensive, last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.

02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:32.060
So I can pay three bucks to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:33.060
That's amazing.

02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:38.180
Yeah, and they got a second one there, it looks like a porcelain toilet, and they're

02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:43.740
calling it take a load off the chair, and they're charging $0.99 for it.

02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:46.740
Maybe I should buy one of those.

02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:51.100
I need to buy one of those for the oil army clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.

02:33:51.100 --> 02:34:01.780
Yeah, and in fact, it's a perfect transition for the second topic, you know, they mentioned

02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:02.780
a tweet.

02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:06.900
Yeah, since you guys were plugging Twitter and Facebook and all that earlier, you guys

02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:14.020
just kind of forgot to mention the oil, the army club within Home.

02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:16.900
That's true, we do have the oil army club with Home, but the reason why we don't mention

02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:20.140
it is because we actually do things with the Twitter and stuff, but it's really hard to

02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:22.340
do things with the clubhouse.

02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:28.700
One reason we bought that is so that when Sony starts letting us use the TV for a purpose,

02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:34.040
or maybe we can stream clips of our show somehow, or just kind of let us put our own custom

02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:39.980
touch somehow and make it an Orange Lawns Radio experience, then we'll be right on it

02:34:39.980 --> 02:34:44.260
and ready to go and already have people in there to go see it, but right now, the way

02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:51.620
Home is, there's not a lot I can do with it, which is unfortunate.

02:34:51.620 --> 02:34:58.860
The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but other listeners out there, is

02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:06.660
that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club, you know,

02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:14.220
the least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation, you use club that

02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:16.940
you shell out the money for, you know?

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:22.540
It seems like John Dole one day ever shows up in there, and every time I show up there,

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:26.300
there's no one there, so I'm conveniently missing.

02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:30.780
Maybe one of these nights, we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something,

02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:34.620
we'll have like a Sony Home night at seven o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck

02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:38.160
dance party in the, because I don't know what else you do in Home, but dance, hopefully

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:44.620
somebody will show up in a hamster outfit, we'll do a dance party in Sony Home.

02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:49.220
What's great is that Jamie's, hold on, Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.

02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:51.220
Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.

02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:53.020
I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.

02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:55.020
Well, it wasn't the hamster thing, it was the whole Sony Home.

02:35:55.020 --> 02:35:57.020
Oh, the whole Sony Home thing, oh, I'm sorry.

02:35:57.020 --> 02:35:58.020
All right, sorry, Spaz in the air.

02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:00.020
Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?

02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:07.060
You know, I did have something, oh yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to,

02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:10.540
you know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.

02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.540
Yes.

02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:18.340
Yeah, and one thing in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio

02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:24.780
simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:31.100
doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call

02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:34.340
I have, you know, slight speech impediment.

02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:36.940
You know what, dude, it wouldn't just be you.

02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:44.100
Those programs always stink at recognizing speech, whether it be an accent or just impediment

02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:49.540
or just the way you talk, just depending on how you were raised, those games never accurately

02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:50.540
can gauge you.

02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:52.220
Like, look at a game like brain training.

02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:56.620
Like if you want brain training to recognize that you're saying blue, you have to literally

02:36:56.620 --> 02:37:02.100
sit there and say, brew, brew, and that's the only way you can get it to recognize it.

02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:07.340
And I'm not trying to sound, you know, rude or anything, but that's just the way the game

02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:08.340
works.

02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:09.340
It doesn't work otherwise.

02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:10.340
I can't even get right on his by that game.

02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:12.860
Anyways, Spaznator, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show, but

02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:17.740
thanks so much as always for your call and I can't promise the Seaman things never going

02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:18.740
to happen.

02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:19.740
So just so you know.

02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:20.740
All right.

02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:21.740
Later.

02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:22.740
All right.

02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:24.720
Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.

02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:27.620
We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with

02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:29.560
Skype tonight and it's not the callers.

02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:30.560
Not at all.

02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:31.560
Callers are great.

02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.560
The program itself.

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.020
I'm a little mad at, I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.

02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:37.020
I don't know.

02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:38.020
It's just, I don't know.

02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:39.020
We do have that extra.

02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:40.020
I didn't they send us.

02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:41.020
Yeah, we got that extra thing.

02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.180
What's, where's, where's that computer?

02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:43.180
We got it.

02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:45.060
It's still in my room.

02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:48.260
Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this

02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:49.260
beast into that thing.

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:50.900
Let's play jigsaw puzzle with the new computer.

02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:53.900
Because if not, then the new computer can be used for video because I know we were going

02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:56.100
to, we were saving that to use for a video and then it didn't happen.

02:37:56.100 --> 02:37:59.660
So listen, we got to get use out of that, but Skype is annoying the shit out of me on

02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:00.660
this thing.

02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:02.660
But this, this computer is getting old.

02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:08.580
So we definitely have to invest in extra box of oops, I crapped my pants because like,

02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:09.940
you know, they bought that months ago.

02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:10.940
We'd never used it.

02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:12.840
And it's, you know, not trying to be disrespectful.

02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:16.020
We had, we were going to use it for something they didn't take off.

02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:23.100
So we'll, we'll, we'll find another way to use it anyhow.

02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:25.780
I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.

02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:27.340
I have some final story.

02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:28.340
Oh my gosh.

02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.340
I'm so sorry.

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:30.340
I forgot we didn't do those yet.

02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:31.940
I did mine for the FU.

02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:32.940
I'm sorry.

02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:35.140
I thought you were going to talk about this movie.

02:38:35.140 --> 02:38:36.140
Yeah.

02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:40.620
Um, the silent Hill movie is, uh, going to start filming next year.

02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:41.620
Silent Hill 2.

02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:42.620
I didn't take your story.

02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:49.180
And a dude, uh, was in a, uh, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:50.180
What did?

02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:51.180
Oh, the rider?

02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:52.180
Yeah.

02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:53.180
Oh yeah.

02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:54.180
I heard about that one.

02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:55.180
What a mess.

02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:56.180
Don't drive drunk.

02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:57.180
Loki.

02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:58.180
Last minute stories.

02:38:58.180 --> 02:38:59.180
Yes.

02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:06.700
So Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3g internet, um, with its next gen DS system

02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:08.660
might be something that they're working on.

02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:15.100
Um, apparently a water is, um, quoted saying that, uh, I'm interested because it's a new

02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:19.960
business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications costs.

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:25.620
Only the people who can pay thousands of yen a month can be iPhone customers.

02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:30.940
That doesn't fit Nintendo's customers because we make amusement products.

02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:36.180
In reality, if we did this, it would, um, increase the cost of hardware and the consumers

02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:42.420
would complain about Nintendo putting prices up, but it's, uh, it is one option for the

02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:43.420
future.

02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:48.220
Um, that would be pretty awesome if you can get unlimited 3g internet through like a DS

02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:49.380
or something.

02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:56.980
But the problem is one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.

02:39:56.980 --> 02:40:03.740
They haven't embraced online yet, so, um, all the free online, you know, thrown into

02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:10.620
your next gen console doesn't mean shit to me since you haven't really embraced online.

02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:11.620
I mean, okay.

02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:16.300
Yeah, we wear in, you know, DSI wear, but your infrastructure infrastructure sucks and

02:40:16.300 --> 02:40:19.620
your friend's code sucks even more, so.

02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:20.620
Yeah.

02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:26.420
Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment and I know

02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:30.300
I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.

02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:38.180
It's a game called Baby and Me, but I was completely unaware of this brand new, um,

02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:39.180
bundle I guess they have.

02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:41.420
It's a special edition.

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:45.060
Um, this is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.

02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:52.620
Basically it has a remote holster for a baby doll, but, but that's not all.

02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:58.580
Apparently, um, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition and what

02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.140
does this special edition include?

02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:05.700
But a baby doll attachment for your Wii remote.

02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:07.160
Yes.

02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:12.780
Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii remote into that baby.

02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:21.520
But that's, wow, that's kind of crazy.

02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:30.900
And then, um, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.

02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:35.780
The Return of Alice, um, it's going to be the next, um, game that he's doing.

02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:41.380
He's got a nice little teaser trailer online and it looks creepy, so I'm sure that it's

02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:48.020
going to be coming to the PC later on, but, uh, Return of Alice coming from American McGee.

02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:51.220
Wasn't there supposed to be like a movie tie-in to this a long time ago?

02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:54.740
There was supposed to be an American McGee Alice movie, uh, it was like with Wino or

02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:59.140
Ryder at one time, so I don't know if that's still, I don't think that's happening anymore.

02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:02.860
Well, now there's the, um, Tim Burton one.

02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:06.100
Oh yeah, that's true and I think that's kind of it.

02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:09.700
Like I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the

02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:11.500
American McGee one because you'll get your dark.

02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:15.980
American McGee's going to be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like,

02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:20.980
you know, bubblegum dark, you know, he's like, he's like hot topic dark, okay.

02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:24.300
I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend, um, for Halloween.

02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:28.500
We, um, they're, they're my friends that I play Warcraft with now and, um, we watched

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:29.500
some, uh, movies.

02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:30.500
This was Halloween.

02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:33.300
We watched Showgirls because, you know, we have to watch something scary, but then we

02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:37.580
started, um, Starling, except I love Showgirls.

02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:38.580
Don't get me started.

02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:39.580
That's one of my favorite movies.

02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:40.580
It's so bad.

02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:41.580
It's good.

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:44.500
We need to watch that again, but the other thing about this, it's not coming back until

02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:45.500
2011.

02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:46.500
Oh, well yeah.

02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:47.500
Games take time to develop.

02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:51.620
But anyway, what I wanted to say also, we watched Sleepy Hollow, which is a Tim Burton

02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:52.620
movie.

02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:53.620
That movie's pretty dark.

02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:54.620
That's not bubblegum dark.

02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:56.180
That's, that's legitimately dark.

02:42:56.180 --> 02:42:57.580
Just saying.

02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:02.020
We watched on fast forward the original Wicker Man.

02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:04.020
Wow.

02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:08.980
We almost watched Sleepaway Camp two and three.

02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:09.980
None of them are good.

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:10.980
I know.

02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:11.980
We knew that.

02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:12.980
The original Sleepaway Camp.

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:16.140
We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was, you know, similar to the remake.

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:21.860
Which by the way, to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie,

02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:26.900
next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.

02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:29.980
It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.

02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:34.500
And if you've never seen it and you don't know anything about it, good.

02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:36.580
Keep it that way until you watch the movie.

02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:43.420
Because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever, ever.

02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.060
That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?

02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:47.360
And it's very, it's a very like little quotable movie too.

02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:49.820
It's so bad it's funny.

02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:50.820
So there you go.

02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:55.780
They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.

02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:56.780
Ridiculous.

02:43:56.780 --> 02:43:59.980
Tigerclaw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.

02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:02.780
And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.

02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:05.220
Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.

02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:06.220
What?

02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:10.380
That's supposed to center around hope, which was, do you remember like there was like kind

02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:14.420
of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and

02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:18.580
was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?

02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:22.500
Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her, but I got, I'll one up

02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:23.500
you with this.

02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:27.840
The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:34.220
because this movie was supposed to be huge, was supposed to take place in LA or Hollywood.

02:44:34.220 --> 02:44:38.220
That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away, OMG spoilers, they're

02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:42.500
going to LA because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have

02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:43.500
been awesome.

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.500
Why would they do that?

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:45.500
She's not doing anything.

02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:48.540
I mean, she hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:50.380
She doesn't do anything.

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:54.140
She's just, she's unemployed right now.

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:55.540
I mean, come on.

02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:56.540
I love it.

02:44:56.540 --> 02:44:57.680
We've already seen her breasts.

02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.900
It's not even that big a deal anymore.

02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:03.860
Salacious pop and chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote

02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:04.860
there.

02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:05.860
No one wants to fuck a penny.

02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:09.260
They want to fuck a heather or a hope.

02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:10.260
Forget it.

02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:15.260
And the estimated Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.

02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:22.500
It's like, just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR

02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:23.500
live event.

02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:27.180
Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.

02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:29.580
Go around and give everybody, I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?

02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:30.580
That was it.

02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:31.580
Okay.

02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:33.060
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:34.220
Um, Loki, I'll start with you.

02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:35.220
Your final thought.

02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:39.360
Final thought is I need the fine steering wheel for my main cabinet.

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.260
My final thought is I really want a taco from gym boys, even if Jamie hates it.

02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:49.540
Uh, Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:51.340
Did you watch the grudge for Halloween?

02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:52.340
No.

02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:53.340
Oh.

02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:57.100
Um, I remember when you were like really into the ring and those books and all that.

02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:58.740
I don't know if you, or ringoo and all that.

02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:01.860
This gal at my work dressed up as Samara and she did a really good job.

02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:03.860
This is such a really good costume.

02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:04.860
That's cool.

02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:05.860
Yeah.

02:46:05.860 --> 02:46:06.860
Just made me think of you.

02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:07.860
Cause I know you like used to really be into that whole series.

02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:08.860
It's still into it.

02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:09.860
Actually.

02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:17.340
I need to find my copy of a, um, uh, loop again so I can read it cause that was my favorite

02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:18.340
of those books.

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:19.340
All right.

02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:22.860
Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next

02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:23.860
week.

02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:24.860
Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.

02:46:24.860 --> 02:46:25.860
Oh, wait, wait.

02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:26.860
I've been challenged.

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:27.860
To what?

02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:30.460
Um, ionotropic says extended death rattle.

02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:31.860
What?

02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:35.260
Knock it off.

02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:36.980
No, stop.

02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:37.980
I'm gonna unplug.

02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:38.980
Where's she on the mixing board here.

02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:39.980
Stop it.

02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:40.980
I need to get my thing.

02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:41.980
Then you can death rattle us out.

02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:42.980
Oh my God.

02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:43.980
That's annoying.

02:46:43.980 --> 02:46:44.980
Shut up.

02:46:44.980 --> 02:46:45.980
All right.

02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:51.820
Um, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio after that.

02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:55.380
I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others

02:46:55.380 --> 02:47:00.440
about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game

02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:01.440
company behind us.

02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:05.060
We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.

02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:06.060
All right.

02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:07.060
Okay.

02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:08.060
Excellent.

02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:09.060
Set again again.

02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:10.060
Cause the things that come out of that are filthy.

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:11.060
So until then.

02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.060
And full of phlegm.

02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:13.060
Have a great week.

02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:14.060
We'll see you next time.

02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:15.060
Here on orange launch radio.

02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:16.060
Oh my God.

02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:17.060
Her noise made the dolls fall over.

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:18.060
Happy Halloween.

02:47:18.060 --> 02:47:19.060
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:20.060
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production.

02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:37.420
To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time, the views

02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:42.540
and opinions expressed on orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire

02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:48.540
staff of orange lounge radio or all games.com, but we're probably right anyway.

02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:50.140
See you next week.
