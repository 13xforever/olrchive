Final Fantasy XIII finally gets a release date in the U.S.
and U.K.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
Now with 75% less sickness.
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you for the next three hours with my awesome co-host, always here with me.
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hack, hack, cough, wheeze.
Not really.
Actually, you're feeling much better this week than those that heard the show a couple weeks ago, which we'll get into because the story is actually kind of funny.
Yeah, it's pretty funny.
But first, I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Techmaster Loki, who has to learn how to turn his mic off before we start the show.
I had the mic off earlier because...
I don't know why I just turned it off.
Travis had that whole setup in his house.
I don't know what Bobby has in his house, and he does, of course, the show before us, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf on all games.
I don't know if he has the whole thing.
We have wired mics that just plug into this mixing board very crudely that Shermie the cat has to walk through like she's Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment to get through the cords.
She seriously looks up at me and goes, meh.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
Gremlins Live in Those Little Boxes
Thanks for watching!
Dude, we've been doing this ghetto style for seven years, and it's one of those things where if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If it ain't fixed, don't break it.
Exactly.
Anyhow, so why we weren't here last week, which is funny because I had promised a couple weeks ago on the show that we weren't going to miss any more shows in 2009, which is also funny because you haven't heard the last month worth of podcasts, and it all ties into the same reason.
Well, also, it's because Rob had diphtheria and I had malaria.
No, but it's close.
It's close.
Here's the deal.
If you were here live a couple weeks ago, and you will hear this on the podcast eventually, we're going to have a big dump this week like we had last month where we'll get all the shows up.
But if you were here with us live a couple weeks ago, DarkSakura was very ill during the show.
And we kind of all chalked that up to, well, she has the plague again, which she always seems to get once a year, or a sinus infection.
My annual sinus infection.
And I kicked up all that dust earlier.
Yeah.
And so we figured, okay, Jamie is just the sick girl.
Everybody went to high school with one.
There was that girl who just seemed to get sick all the time, just no matter what.
My sinus infection is literally an annual thing, and it's always right in the start of November I start getting sick.
We love you, Jamie, but you're the sick girl.
You're the cootie girl.
All right.
Yeah, we'll hear some cooties.
Shove, shove.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And she says, oh, what's wrong?
And I'm like, I don't know.
I'm just really sick.
I want to just make sure I don't have H1N1 or something crazy like that.
She's all, oh, my dear, because she's an old Filipino lady, so she always says my dear and honey and all those things.
Oh, my dear, open your mouth.
Oh, you have a very red mouth.
Oh, I think you have laryngitis.
You do not have H1N1, my dear.
Do you want me to give you the test anyway, my dear?
And I said, yeah, just for peace of mind, give you the H1N1 test.
So they shoved the Q-tip up my nose and all that fun stuff.
And yeah, it still hurts, but no, it wasn't that bad.
So I did all that and I'm thinking, okay, whatever, I have laryngitis.
And she says, if I'm still sick on Thursday, call her and she'll give me an antibiotic.
I'm still sick on Thursday.
I've missed two days of work at this point.
So I get an antibiotic and Thursday night was really the worst of it.
That was the night where I lied down and I thought, oh my God, I...
Like literally, I saw the light.
Like when I closed my eyes and was lying there on the couch in my Snuggie with my Star Trek Next Generation movies playing on Blu-ray because that's what I did when I was sick is I watched every single Star Trek Next Generation movie on Blu-ray in my Snuggie.
I literally shut my eyes and I started to see the light.
And I'm just lying there going, this is awful, this is horrible, whatever I have.
But finally it started to go away and I'm thinking, oh, antibiotics got rid of what I had.
I must have had a strep throat.
That seems to be the most obvious thing that I have.
So finally Saturday goes, Sunday goes.
Monday I go to work because I'm thinking, I've missed four days of work.
That's a lot of work for somebody who's a trainer, for somebody with, I have a very high work ethic.
I don't like to miss work.
So I go to work Monday morning.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh my dear, you have H1N1.
Your test came back positive.
And I'm thinking, what?
Here I am back at work sick and I had H1N1 this whole time and I didn't even know it.
So it turns out that H1N1 test that she didn't even think I needed came back positive.
And I think part of, you know, and no disrespect to my doctor, I didn't have a fever when I went in there.
But apparently I had H1N1.
Prisby asks if your doctor is Ms.
Cleo.
Yes, actually, she apparently sounds a lot like Ms.
Cleo.
I don't know how old Filipino lady sounds like Ms.
Cleo, but just work with me on this.
Next up, Rob calls me.
Yeah, one of the first people I call is Jamie because I start to piece it together in my head.
I'm like, how the fuck did I get the swine flu?
Nobody else at Rocky is saying anything about it.
Nobody else seems to be saying it.
And I'm thinking, oh my god, Jamie has these signs.
Jamie gave me the swine flu.
And I knew it in my mind.
I'm like, Jamie's the one that gave me the swine flu.
And then I'm also thinking, oh my god, Matt has a swine flu too and he doesn't know it.
So the first people I contact... Yeah, I'm so swine flu-ed out right now.
I can't tell.
So, Matt, were you sick at all the past couple weeks?
My throat was kind of scratchy for about five days.
But kind of scratchy as in, hey, that kind of feels scratchy and I get distracted by something else and don't notice it.
That's really, though, how it starts.
It starts in the throat.
Yeah, it was the same with me.
So somehow Matt, with his Cylon genes or something, was able to avoid the swine flu.
I'm still saying it's because he eats enough meat that it gives him an immunity.
But...
I ate enough swine, see?
Well, I actually ended up calling my doctor, well, I talked to the advice nurse at Kaiser.
She's like, oh no, you're coming in, you're coming in.
So I finally actually talked to my doctor, and we go over all of the symptoms, because he had actually seen me a week before for my sprained ankle, which still, by the way, hurts like a bitch.
and we know he's like well you know you had all of these symptoms you know you're you had that with your throat you started off with a dry cough you know it's like that's not how your sinus infections tend to go you know he's and a lot of times now they know by the symptoms because they're pretty standard and I ran a fever for me I actually got up to a hundred but that's high for me
But I kept running a fever after the fact.
And the whole big thing for me, what my plague usually is, is if I don't treat a sinus infection or anything sinus related right away, I will always get bronchitis.
And the last time that it got really bad, I got pneumonia.
And I was sick for three months.
And it was a nightmare.
But now he put me on like a week of antibiotics to make sure that I don't get pneumonia again.
Well, the interesting thing is my doctor's approach was very different than yours.
I mean, they put me on Tamiflu, which a little late for that, right?
But whatever.
And I got pulled out of work for a week.
I was already over it.
So was I. Yeah, but I was already two weeks over it is the whole thing.
I don't know.
And I think a big part of it, too, because you kind of talk about that.
And we will get to talking about video games, but I think this story is hilarious.
I was hoping I'd get pulled out of work so I could go.
Dan was sick.
Stay home.
Two weeks before me, Dan was sick.
And I was like, you don't catch a sinus infection from somebody.
They're not contagious.
So maybe Dan started this whole thing.
I don't know.
But I got pulled out of work for a week and I was pissed when it happened because I'm thinking like, I'm going to miss nine days of work and I'm trying to teach a class, right?
And I'm like, what's the point?
I'm already over it.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I miss her dearly, I wish she was still here She didn't get to the doctor early enough, did she?
I don't think so, no.
She didn't have insurance.
Yeah, I think you mentioned that she eventually was pulled to the doctor to go.
But yeah, I mean, that's why my grandmom started having the same symptoms.
I talked to her on Wednesday, and I was like, you go to the doctor tomorrow.
You go.
Tomorrow.
And as far as I know, she's okay.
And let me read this from chat here.
DangerSkew in chat says, H1N1 is the most overrated disease ever.
And this is from chat.orangeonsradio.com.
Yes and no.
The number one killer of people with AIDS is pneumonia.
I actually described it.
I was trying to describe it to somebody.
I said it's kind of like having 24-hour aides.
You don't want to catch something secondary in that window, and I don't mean to speak so nonchalantly about something serious, but if I could explain how H1N1 is dangerous, that's why.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So to kind of wrap this all up, because we've been talking about this for a while here, and I know folks want us to get to the games.
Pneumonia is H1N1's mother-in-law.
You just don't want her to come visit.
I don't know.
No, but to wrap it all up, you know, again, the moral of the story, you know, I'm fine.
DarkSakura's fine.
If you get H1N1, you'll probably be fine, too.
You probably won't even know you had it.
But please see a doctor.
Go to urgent care.
or not necessarily the ER because ERs are really bombarded they're very expensive keep in mind there's a lot of urgent care clinics that can do the same thing a lot cheaper a lot of free clinics as well if you don't have insurance at all just see a doctor get treatment get on some type of medication that will build up your immunity so that way you don't catch something secondary so is it that bad no but should you take it seriously absolutely so that's kind of the moral of the story
Now that we've talked about our sickness and why we've been gone... And by the way, because again, this kept Jamie down for two weeks.
This kept me out for two weeks.
This is why things have fallen behind with the feed.
Yeah, I still have a cough too.
You might hear me cough.
Now it's, I think, officially three and a half weeks later.
I'm still having to...
The same type of, you know, that same cough that I had when I was developing that bronchitis back then, so I still have to be careful.
I'm living on Ricola.
A steady diet of Ricola.
And apparently Chinese food.
Good times.
Alright, anyhow.
enough about flu chat let's get into actually our gaming weeks as we usually like to start the show off with talking about the games we've been playing funny enough you think with nine days out of work I'd played a lot more video games but that's kind of not the case I don't know if that's true for you too DarkSakura but what kind of games you've been playing for the past couple weeks well I um excuse me I did something bad Rob what'd you do I've been a bad girl
Maran,
since I renewed my account, and then twice by myself.
I have hit a milestone.
I now have a character that is past level 10.
Congratulations!
I have level 15.
Draw 9 age.
Welcome to the world of talent points.
We hope you like it here.
See, that's how it starts.
First you do it with a friend, and then you start doing it by yourself.
Next thing you know, you just can't stop.
Next thing you know, you're playing EverQuest.
Are you talking about Warcraft?
Are you talking about... Never mind.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Dan's in the other room and I'm going I've got a wildebeest and he comes in and going so you do and then I was like taking screen captures of my uh of my griffin because I was doing oh we're going back and forth on a griffin and I'm paying for it
It was just... I was just being a goof.
An utter goof playing, but it was pretty fun.
I like playing by myself.
Why do we play games?
To have fun.
And whatever that is for you, and especially in a very broad game like World of Warcraft or any MMO, if that's taking screenshots, if that's slash dancing, if that's roleplaying, whatever it is, it might not be just grinding to 80 as fast as you can.
It might be a variety of other things that make it fun.
So, more power to you.
Alright, I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you about that, but maybe I'll think of it later.
So, if DarkSakura's done with her gaming week, then I'll move on to Loki.
How was your gaming week?
My gaming week was okay.
I didn't play a whole lot, though.
Actually, for the last two weeks, I haven't played a lot.
I've been just working on the main cabin and getting that working.
Mainly choosing a front end, because I was originally going to start with Hyper Spin, which is really flashy and looks awesome, but the problem is you have to make a theme for every single game.
And I downloaded every single game that's out there for MAME right now.
So that would take forever to get skins for everything or make skins from scratch.
It's just way too much damn work.
I may end up going back to that though because I think you can actually put different settings for each game you launch in Hyper Spin.
Plus it's a lot more flexible in what you can run in it.
but right now I currently have Maximus Arcade on my system and I've been kind of working with that a little bit their configuration that they had for launching games and using the menu right now is really jacked up compared to what the
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
Well, it's just, it's a lot, because I didn't know what games I wanted, so I said, okay, what the hell, I'm just going to download everything.
So I did, I downloaded everything, including clones of games, multiple ROM dumps for each game.
Miss World New 96?
Oh yeah, that's on there, of course.
All the porno games.
I'm coming over!
I'm telling you, every game that's out there is on there, including ones that are like 50,000 Mahjong games I need to get rid of.
So I just have to go and sort through everything, which is what really takes the time.
And then...
The other thing too is, because my cabinet has a dual sync monitor, so I can run games at the low resolution 15kHz, which is what most arcade games are, like all their old school ones, or medium resolution for some of the newer games.
The problem is, if you run it at the medium resolution, your newer games look nice, but your older games aren't quite as sharp because it's not running at the native resolution anymore.
So it's a debate whether I want to make it look nice for most of my games or just some of my games.
I'm pretty much just going to leave it alone right now because I get to the Switch to actually flip it to that medium resolution.
I have to take stuff apart and I don't want to do that.
So anyways, enough of the cabinet stuff.
Can I just say real quick on a related note, because I'm looking at our chat room, BlackWolf, of course our old buddy Bobby, who does the show before us on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, live on Sunday nights, says, You describe me.
I have a ton of consoles hooked up to my TV.
Do I often play them?
No, but I could if I wanted to.
That sounds very Jamie as well.
But mine aren't all hooked up.
But you could.
But we do have the pile of Sega hooked up in the vault.
and how often do you go in there and say, you know what, today I want to play, I don't know, I'm just feeling very Afterburner today.
I just, I want to play after, do you do that?
We do that shit.
Do you really?
We do, but sometimes we also break out the PC Engine and play some cue cards.
In the front room, we loaned our Wii to Dan's mom for some reason.
We have the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 hooked up out in the front.
The PlayStation 3, since it's a piece of shit, just collects dust.
We do nothing but play our Xbox 360.
Ironically, I'm in the complete opposite boat right now.
I still haven't replaced my Xbox 360.
Three months now.
Haven't needed to.
I've been doing everything on the PS3.
I'm like in the complete opposite boat you are, but okay.
That's what makes the show great.
Except, Rob, we have a choice.
Oh, snap.
You got me there.
What are we going to do?
Speaking of that... No, well, technically our PS3 is our Blu-ray player.
I have a choice, too.
I could play the Wii if I want to, like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I basically swapped her the banned console because she doesn't play online, so she doesn't give a shit.
She just wants a console that's modded, and it works just fine.
It just can't go on live anymore, so hey, problem solved there.
So I have her broken console.
I have another console that's starting to go, and I have a friend's console that they brought in.
I don't know if he's giving it to me or what, but it's kind of broken, so I have three consoles that need to be fixed.
which I'm planning on doing soon.
I have a console coming from New Zealand actually that's a Japanese region console that's also modded so I can actually play some of the Japanese region games.
And then I have the four consoles that work right now that we're playing on.
But the ironic part was the console that got banned is the console that we don't really play modded games on.
We've played like one modded game on that and that's the one that gets banned.
Mine, which is seeing all sorts of like it is...
Dirty.
Dirty, naughty machine.
It's a filthy, filthy Xbox.
You know, and the one that my boss plays on, which was my old modded console that died once and came back, and it's completely just seen all sorts of burns and you name it, whatever.
Those consoles are fine.
Nothing wrong with those.
But sure, the one that played it one time, it's gone.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Fuck me, one got banned.
Well, here's the thing.
I understand now they're banning consoles because they don't want you to play games.
I thought they were going to ban your live account or whatever.
Can I throw this question to you from chat real quick?
Does Loki think Microsoft is right by banning consoles?
Well, they have the right to do it.
I think as far as banning you off live, I don't understand why they would do that.
I guess I understand the cheating part and stuff like that, but if you think about it,
Thanks for watching!
What's to really motivate you from trying to get your... I mean, because now, there's no fear of you getting banned off live because you're already banned off live.
So burn whatever the fuck you want now and play it on the console without consequence.
That's really kind of the thing right now.
So I don't understand why they would do that.
I wish... There should have been another way they could penalize somebody, but whatever.
I mean, I guess if you want to play on live... It's not that bad.
They're not banning your account, I guess.
It could be worse.
Really, the only thing that happens when your console gets banned...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't know, it's just, it's an inconvenience, I guess.
But yeah, I understand why they're cracking it.
An inconvenient banning, the new movie by Al Gore.
Well, we're actually, to be honest, you know, we really modded the consoles, not necessarily to play pirated games, but we were really just playing, you know, modded copies of Grand Theft Auto.
Now, we're playing, you know, all have episodes of Liberty City Discs, all legit copies, and that's what we've been playing.
So that's why we're kind of surprised that, you know, the one console's banned, because we haven't played a burned game, well, actually, I take that back, we played
One new burned copy of Grand Theft Auto on that one because I found a new way to get around their mod patch or something like that.
So we tested it once and it didn't really work.
And so then we went back to just playing the normal disc.
And apparently that one time, though, they found out.
And so they decided to ban that console.
But it's just ironic because we've been playing normal copies of games on all these consoles for the longest time now.
I mean, if anything, they should be generous to me because I bought six copies of their damn game, you know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then they finally died.
Almost beat him too.
Sad.
Nice.
Cheater and usually they drop out and I talk so much trash doing that.
Good times.
It's awful.
Alright.
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
Um...
That's really it.
I'm still sitting on my copy of Borderlands.
I haven't even touched yet.
I'm just like, I need to play this tonight.
I need to play this tonight.
And I go home and I end up working on the arcade cabinet.
At some point, I'm going to play the damn game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And that's what it all comes back to.
My gaming week, you know, surprisingly enough, because I was so sick, I didn't get to play a lot.
I did a lot of like TV and movie watching, which funny enough, I did get my PlayStation 3 Netflix streaming disc.
So I got to play around with that a little bit.
And, you know, it's pretty much the same stuff you're going to see on the Xbox version without the party chat, which my Xbox was borked before I got to play with that feature anyway.
So I'm none the wiser.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also, as far as new games go, one of the new games I played, I was joking about the Wii earlier because DarkSakura was saying that she had choice.
And I'm like, well, I still have choice between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
And funny enough, I did turn on the Wii to check out the Excitebike World Tour.
Is that the name of it?
Excitebike World Rally.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
These games, these 8-bit games, we used to spend so much time with back in the day.
And some of them you can still spend a lot of time with today.
But now, thanks to the wide world of emulation, how many of you guys will just load up a cartridge on emulation, play it for like three minutes, and be all, I remember this game.
Alright, thrill's done.
Let's move on.
Play something else.
Pretty much, yeah.
That's...
What I felt playing this Excitebike World Rally Yes, I realized there was online mode Yes, the game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the day You know, I am totally aware of all these improvements they made to the game But yet, when the game itself hasn't really felt like it's changed that much I was just kind of like, eh, I'm over it And that's my honest feedback on Excitebike I can't really tell you if it's a good game or a bad game Because I was just kind of over it in ten minutes
and that was my experience with Excitebike.
You make my soul hurt, Rob.
Why?
Just because.
I mean, you know what's funny?
We used to play Excitebike for hours when I was like 10 or 11 years old.
We used to play this game.
I would spend hours making tracks.
Making the damn tracks.
and all this stuff and yet when I played this new one I was just kind of over it in 10 minutes and maybe to be fair maybe part of that was because the same day I played this was the same day I found out I had swine flu so I kind of had all of that on my mind at the same time so you know in the interest of full disclosure maybe I just didn't play this game in the right mood and you know I think a lot of people can admit
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But, full disclosure, I had all this other crap going on too So naturally I played a lot of World of Warcraft as well One other game I did check out was a game called 30 Second Hero I downloaded this onto the PSP when I was sick Because, you know, when the doctor tells you not to go outside and give people your germs You're like, okay, but I'm bored, I need something to do I'll go onto PlayStation Store and see if there's an arcade game I want to download And then I realized, oh yeah, they have all these PSP games you can download now What do I want to play?
Oh, I played the demo for Half Minute Hero a while ago and I really liked it
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The battles automatically play themselves, so you don't have to sit there and go, fight, fight, fight, item, potion, fight.
You don't do any of that.
You just have battles that happened, and you just kind of tear through them, and it's just a fast, fast game.
That's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is, is that you go and you run through the forest or do whatever you do to the cave where the bad guy is, but in each level, it's episodic.
The first level is very straightforward, but then later on,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because really the gist of the game is how do I get from point A to B to C to D as quick as possible making this whole thing work what's the solution without running out of time and that's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is and although I just overly simplified the game I think what's selling a lot of people on this is like kind of the nod to 8-bit cliches because seriously some of the dialogue in the game made me laugh out loud because the time goddess is like
I will reset time for money.
Why?
I don't know.
I just like money, hearts.
You know, like these very cliche, over-the-top things that just made me laugh.
So that's why I kind of liked Half Minute Hero.
Did it give you lulls?
It gave me a lot of lulls.
And that, you know, I think the people that at least localized the game, if not developed it, were kind of just in on the joke and knew what they were doing.
And I think it paid off.
And it's a cute game. $30...
P-R-P-G
It's a PRPG, yeah, a puzzle role-playing game.
I like that.
And then lots and lots and lots and lots of WoW.
I brought back from the dead my 80 Druid and brought it into another guild that a lot of my friends had transferred to.
And I also had my Paladin, my Helodin, I guess you could say, is level 72 now.
So, being sick, WoW, bad combination.
Although, honestly...
Project Runway
All right.
Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.
I think if that does it for everybody's gaming week, we can finally get into some gaming news here now that we've been on air for about 40 minutes.
No, Rob.
Food.
Food, Rob.
You want to talk more food?
No.
I do kind of want some yogurt or something.
I'm just fat.
All right.
Anyhow, I do want to say real quick in the housekeeping department, our podcast feed is disgustingly behind.
It's just sadly been a recurring theme this year.
Obviously, I blame the flu for that.
We will get all caught up this week.
We'll have a big dump of episodes just as we had, I think, back in October when we had some of the same thing going on.
So we will get that all caught up for you guys that rely on the podcast feed.
And we apologize for that, but do keep in mind the number one priority is pulling off this live show every Sunday night when we can.
We're done with sickness.
We're done with food.
We're done with all that stuff.
Let's talk games.
Loki, start us off.
Yes, well, as you may remember, earlier this week we had one of the biggest game launches this year, and, you know, probably for a while, but Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out, and of course, being that it is a major game, there are going to be those out there who decide to break street dates and release the game early to try to be competitive, usually against GameStop.
Well, apparently some local shops in New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some parts of Ohio, were responsible for this, and actually kind of from what I've seen all around the U.S.
But apparently in these areas in particular, what's interesting though is to combat this, GameStop on a corporate level has allowed their stores to break street date as well, and release the game early.
Um...
What gets even more interesting is this isn't the only title that's happened to.
Apparently, the same thing is happening now with the titles coming out next week, Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
Three game stops in the New Jersey area, Jersey City, have been putting out Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
Also saying that it was a call from their corporate office saying go ahead and put it out because there are mom and pop shops nearby that are also putting it out.
To simply summarize this, it's a big ol' clusterfuck right now.
It's a pain in the ass.
Pain in my ass is really what it is.
I'm really, really curious.
Okay, so the facts are, we know some GameStops are bending the street dates to compete with mom and pop stores, or at least that's the claim.
It's not happening at every GameStop.
It's happening, assumably, in areas where...
They're losing pre-orders to other stores who broke street date.
So first, let me ask you, because you work in retail and you said this is a giant pain in your ass.
What's your perspective on all this?
Okay, well here's what happened with Call of Duty.
First off, it was very clear what the street date was.
And Activision has graciously street dated all of their titles during the fourth quarter.
Which makes it very...
Nice for distribution because we can get it to our stores that we supply, get it to them early enough so that they have it day one to be on an even playing field with GameStop.
Because GameStop, they're so massive.
They get everything prior to street date because they're direct.
And we do get stuff a lot of times on street date, but then we have to ship it to our customers and whatnot.
So everybody was under... They understood when the street dates were.
The problem is, though, there's some of these small stores that are like, well, I don't know how I'm going to compete with GameStop.
They're just so massive, and I don't get all these perks and stuff that GameStop has.
They don't even try.
They're just plain, like, I don't know what to do to be competitive with them.
So they decide that they're going to go ahead and put product out early to get a competitive edge.
The problem is, though, they get caught.
And the other problem is...
GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
They would go buy a copy of the game or whatever, get a receipt, get some sort of evidence.
And then for Modern Warfare 2, they actually had a tip line and they would call in and report it.
And usually what happens then is they will collect all these stores that were in violation of street dates.
They then go to all the distributors out there and go, okay, are these your customers?
and if they are you need to um take care of this by and for you know Modern Warfare 2 here's the penalty one they would no longer be able to buy Modern Warfare 2 for the life of the title if they're out of it they're fucked it doesn't matter they're not gonna be able to buy any more copies of it um also any further Activision titles they will no longer be able to get before street day um
and also they're going to evaluate it whereas any sub-distributors out there, people that we basically sell to and then they turn and sell to other stores, they would also be blacklisted from selling a title if they were caught selling it early or whatnot or if these stores that they were servicing were selling early, they would also be blacklisted.
Interesting because I haven't heard this on any of the articles I'm reading so it's kind of fascinating to hear this.
Yeah, and this also goes, and especially with Modern Warfare 2, actually everybody's been kind of careful after Madden 10 this year because Madden 10, a whole bunch of stores broke street on it, and EA got...
pissed, they got really fucking pissed, like, first off we are looking, we're not gonna street date any more titles to distribution so fuck you guys, even though you know, we had no customers that were actually breaking street, but they just decided to blanket everybody and do that same thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum and Warner decided, you know what, we're just gonna do the same thing as EA, we're just gonna say fuck you guys and we're not gonna ship anything early anymore um, and then the other thing is then they decide, okay, well we're gonna
maybe allow you to do that but you're going to have to get written signed agreements from all your customers you know they're going to be street dated and we're going to have to ship it two separate shipments it's just a pain in the ass so Activision now you know they weren't too happy about this whole thing they obviously did not authorize GameStop to do this but you know GameStop being as big as they are they can pretty much do this and go what are you going to do about it and Activision is going to go well can't do anything because they're our largest customer we can't piss them off so
E.A.
and Ubisoft were watching the street dates closely for Left 4 Dead 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 because of this whole thing that happened with Modern Warfare 2 they wanted to make sure that no one was violating street dates on their titles
So anyways, to kind of go back around again.
So these stores think that they're going to get competitive advantage against everybody else, and not necessarily GameStop, but mom-pops, whomever.
I mean, and I hate to, like, blame just mom-pop shops for, you know, Violin Street, because they're not the only ones that do it.
I mean, you know, 7-Eleven does it.
There's...
All sorts of people that do it.
GameStop did it.
GameStop did it.
And the thing is, it's always just a few people that just don't give a shit, that ruin it for everybody.
And it's these same stores time and time again.
They're violating street date on everything.
Madden, for example, they know who... I mean, these people...
I could especially see that with 7-Eleven, because you know 7-Elevens are notorious for being independently owned by folks, and probably a lot of them don't even want to be selling games.
And so they probably are just kind of like, whatever, with this whole thing.
I could especially see it there.
Yeah, and there's like, you know...
Let me tell you this much.
If GameStop, corporate, has given these stores authorization to sell this game early, it's because they know who's selling it early around them, and they will get caught.
I was reading some TalkBack stuff on this Kotaku article, and there's one of the guys in there that was actually an owner of a mom-and-pop shop.
It's just like...
What a fucking douchebag the guy is.
He's like, you know, we knew what the street date was.
We decided we're going to go ahead and here he goes.
Here's my two cents.
I own a small mom-and-pop game store.
Modern Warfare 2 brought in ten times as much revenue as the store has ever done in a single game.
Why?
Because I sold the game one day early.
I could have had it last Thursday.
But did you think I sold anywhere near as many copies without having it early?
No.
No.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I'm sorry, that's a cop-out right there.
The only jump you have on GameStop is that you can't afford to pick up enough copies to supply your customers.
First off, I don't believe that you run out of copies for your customers in the first place.
And second off, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from GameStop.
And just using that as an excuse to put out a game early, well, first off, you probably can get blacklisted from all the distributors out there, especially if they find out that you're selling games early.
It's just a matter of time.
If your customers are that unloyal to you, where you don't have it out early, they're going to go elsewhere.
People, yeah, there are rabid fans of games that are going to go wherever they can get it early, but I'm sorry, that's not an excuse.
Is there an easy answer to this, though?
Because, you know, the bottom line is the consumer is just ultimately going to go wherever they can get it.
They'll go to the Ma and Pa store if it's out there.
They'll go to GameStop if Kotaku, Joystick, Destructoid, whoever runs a story that, hey, these GameStops in such and such New Jersey broke the street date.
You know there were people driving in from Pennsylvania and New York to these stores just to get the damn game because the series has that big level fans.
Well, here's the problem.
What they need to do is basically this.
They need to enforce the street date violators.
So if these people are breaking the street, they need to enforce it so that these people are reprimanded for doing that.
That includes GameStop.
These stores need to be all...
And if you give GameStop an exception because they decided to break the law because someone else was, well, I'm sorry, you know, if I decide to break the law because I see someone else breaking the law, like, for example, if I see someone speeding past me on the freeway and I decide, hey, you know what, I'm going to go 100 miles an hour, too, and I get pulled over for speeding, I can't blame them for speeding.
It was my own choice.
Well, devil's advocate, not that I don't agree with you, but devil's advocate, when you break street date, you're not breaking the law.
Thank you for watching!
Don't go into that agreement with your distributor or whomever, the publisher, if you're not going to abide by it.
How can the playing field be leveled between the Ma and Pa stores and the GameStops from your perspective?
Because I'm kind of surprised.
You're placing a lot more blame on the Ma and Pa stores than I kind of would have thought, considering those are the folks that you work with.
But a lot of what you say makes sense.
But the bottom line is that these places...
Claim they can't compete with GameStop
you know a lot of people also like the stupid little perks that you get from ordering with GameStop you know little trinkets and crap that if you actually look at it you know it's not that great in the first place you know some of the
Do you really need a keychain for a game?
Are you going to be fine without that?
Probably.
Are these mom-and-pop stores going to give you a better trade-in value on your game than GameStop?
Maybe.
It depends.
Is the customer service going to be better?
It all depends.
It's just like all this hatred for shopping at Walmart or something.
If you like shopping at Walmart and you find the prices to be fair, then why not shop there?
They just...
They just try to compete with them, and then they give up so easily because they're not as big.
And they're like, well, why can't they get all the advertising materials that GameStop has?
Well, they make a lot of it in-house, and they buy a lot of games, so they have the publisher backing for a lot of this stuff.
They have the pull to where they actually make the publishers pay them for shelf space.
I mean, you're never going to be as big as GameStop.
Get over it.
You've got to find a different way to compete.
And I have other stores out there that do just fine, and they abide by all the street dates.
So, it can be done.
Interesting little mini-debate in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
DangerSkew says, Easy solution.
Implement some type of server-side solution that does not allow the game to be played until street date, just like what PC games are starting to do.
But GameGuru and Frisbee pipe up and say, No, no online activation.
The games won't work offline.
and so forth.
You can't do that.
I mean, because there's people that aren't connected to online and if that's the case, if they're not connected online, there's no way to verify what date you have in your system.
I mean, you can switch a date around and it wouldn't matter.
So, I don't think that's a solution and really it's just going to come with enforcing street dates.
I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That'll get their attention.
But at the same time, GameStop can't fucking just go break Street Date because they feel that they need to be competitive against these stores.
I'm sorry, you're not going to lose sales to these stores.
I mean, you're fucking GameStop.
It's not going to matter if you sell two less copies.
You're GameStop.
You make $7 billion a year.
It does not fucking matter.
Do you think any action should be taken against GameStop for this?
I think it should.
I think what they should have done is taken... They would have had a lot more pull if they took the high road and didn't put out any of these games.
If they just said, hey, look, we play by the rules.
Because they actually have the pull where they can go, listen, you're not fucking street dating anymore titles because this is what happens when you're street dating them.
And they're a big proponent of not street dating titles.
You know why?
Because the mom-pop stores get it two days later and then they have the advantage.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
A huge thing they're talking about today is that some Italian website started selling the MP3s for the new Lady Gaga album.
So of course, one person went in and downloaded it, and what do you think happened?
Now everybody who browses that community has a copy of the new Lady Gaga album about 10 days before it was actually supposed to come out.
Actually, it happens all the time.
It doesn't matter if it's the new Lady Gaga album or whatever.
Promo copies go out to... And I might be talking about some musician that you personally don't care about, but keep in mind...
I'm throwing music, movies, games all in the same boat here with broken... You know, one person ruined... In this case, not even in America.
One person in Italy on the internet ruins it, the street date, and it has colossal repercussions.
Exactly.
Games leak online early all the time.
All the time.
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
promo copies are sent out there to get people to supply the album in their store movies, screeners get put out there or they're just dumping region 5 DVDs from Russia that come out early and you have DVD copies of all sorts of movies that are out in theaters now and stuff like that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
And to be fair, some of them do.
And at the end of the day, Lady Gaga's probably not going to hurt any from this happening.
But the point still stands is that there's a lot of people getting this stuff before they're supposed to be.
And it only delays the inevitable anyways.
If someone's waiting for a pirated copy, yeah, they may want to play it early.
But then again, that also has its repercussions, as with the console bannings.
So, I mean, everything has its downside to it, but I think, like, I know, for example, Grand Theft Auto 4.
Yes, I downloaded a copy early because I wanted to play it right away.
But when it came out, I bought six copies of it because I just wanted to play it really early because I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.
Needed to play it, like in the heroine or something.
but I still bought it.
I do have a problem with just downloading something early and not paying for it.
Not to say that I haven't done that before.
I probably have, but it's stuff that I wouldn't have bought anyways or stuff I try once for three minutes and throw it away.
Like a lot of the Wii games out there.
And again, chat, folks, look at the big picture.
I'm not specifically talking about Lady Gaga.
I'm using that as an example.
It's just one I happened to notice because I personally like her.
But I realize a lot of you don't.
Look at the bigger picture.
This has happened to every musician because that window between when the critics get it and all that is way too big.
And again, one –
especially with how quick and portable music files are one internet person leaks it and everybody on the internet has it insert your favorite band here, it's happened to them it's the swine flu of the internet I guess you could say that so, alright, anyhow
I guess we can move on to other stories, but it's just very interesting because in a way there's no easy answer.
It's stuff that's just going to be... This isn't going away, it's just been brought to the forefront for once, I guess.
Very interesting comment from Chad.
I want to state here, though, because I thought this also plays a part of it.
Jimmy Jack in chat says, GameStop has a limited business model anyway.
Once digital distribution is mainstream, they are screwed.
Right.
and DarkSakura.
That's a big thing.
And a lot of these stores, you know, they're selling copies that are sealed.
And if they don't have a copy that's not sealed, they're not selling it to their customer.
That's another thing that separates them.
Or, if you maybe just don't like going into GameStop because they have maybe a limited selection of PC titles, maybe they don't have the retro games you're looking for, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from all these other people out there.
If that were the case, then there wouldn't be any mom and pop shops because you just can't compete.
Also, you know, and in some places, again, I don't want to stereotype all, but a lot of times GameStop kind of has that...
or about it of like you get a lot of people that don't really care about their jobs.
You get a lot of college kids who just, you know, looking for something to do, right?
They don't want to work fast food.
You know, I, again, that's not all the employees, but I think it's certainly a stereotype they have to deal with.
On the other hand, you know, in a lot of Ma and Pa stores, Ma and Pa who are running that store obviously have a love of video games if they're running the place in the first place.
And a lot of times you're going to get people who really, really freaking care about what they're doing.
Again,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't really think that they liked video games all that much.
I knew them.
And no, they didn't really like video games all that much.
Interesting.
They just sold it because they knew that's where the money was at the time.
I think a lot of times passion leaves when the company gets that big.
It's all about money.
It's less about really if you like video games or not.
It's just that we're selling video games because it makes us a lot of money.
We're a capitalist society.
It's all based on the bottom line.
Money, money, money.
All right.
Let's move on, guys.
I want to move on to another story.
Oh, boy.
From one controversial topic to another.
Speaking of passionate people...
And Hypocritical
I'm not going to get into the political aspect of it.
I'm just not.
But regardless, PETA's there and sometimes they do these very big things for show.
PETA's are tasty with hummus.
You know, I once – and I think I've probably told this story before.
Once I was kind of talking to online on a dating website a guy who worked for PETA and it was very – I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff.
I also used to date a gay Republican, which to me was fascinating too.
I like diverse people even when sometimes that diversity doesn't agree with me.
So it's kind of –
I don't know, it's interesting.
But I know from talking to somebody who works directly with the organization, they're very passionate about what they do.
Whether you agree with them or not, they definitely have huge passion.
And they get very creative.
And one of the ways they get creative is that they do these little online games to get their message across.
There was a game that they put out a while ago, Super Chick Sisters, which was there to kind of protest KFC.
I remember we talked about it on the show a while back.
This was back in 2007.
Well, guess what?
There is a brand new...
New Super Chick Sisters So just in time for new Super Mario Bros.
Wii that came out today We also have new Super Chick Sisters But it has nothing to do with KFC this time No, it's all about McDonald's I don't know what the specifics is But obviously the McNuggets did not get there very easily So it probably has something to do with that whole thing
I have not played the game myself, but I imagine they are not happy about how the chicken turns into the McNugget, so they've built this whole game about awareness.
And I guess the whole idea behind it is how they tap into the market, is that they're not...
It's not a poster.
It's not a protest.
It's a flash video game which oftentimes tend to be very viral.
I mean look about it.
I'm talking about it here on the show.
But more the kind of creativity in their marketing.
But it's out there and to which I see Jamie and Loki rolling their eyes.
This next time you talk to someone from PETA, ask them how many animals they euthanize every year.
Ask them about how many of their higher-ups have type 2 diabetes and have to take insulin.
I don't know when the next time I'm going to be in Norfolk, Virginia is, which is where their office is.
And that's when I was talking to the dude.
But, you know, whatever.
Well, you know what?
I would have no problem with PETA if they weren't big hypocrites.
That's all.
Well, okay, stepping away from what PETA's all about and all this, because I don't know.
I just don't know enough about PETA because I've just never really cared.
What about this whole, this is how they market their message, is creating these viral flash video games.
Also, it's actually pretty defamatory, too.
Remember the Cooking Mama one?
I do remember that.
That was funny.
But in the end, though, I mean, it's like...
I don't think that they really care whose toes they step on because they think that they're invincible and honestly I would love to have a full scale investigation gone into the business practices of PETA
Very interesting, because I am looking at a screenshot here from the game, and it's not like they're trying to hide the fact that it's Mario.
I mean, there's a big red M on his cap.
He very much looks like Mario.
If I were Nintendo, I might think I could sue over protection of my character, although, I don't know, but then can't you get into parody and all this?
I don't know.
You still have to have enough remarkable difference that, you know...
I think that that actually is close enough to infringement right there.
Because, I mean, looking from where I am right here, it looks like Mario and Luigi.
And I've got my glasses on and everything.
It looks like Mario and Luigi.
But if you get super close up, you can see a little text on there that says, Princess Pamela Anderson kidnapped again.
And that's where I know this is not a Nintendo game.
You know what I mean?
That's where I go, okay, A... I'm sorry, that looks like Mario.
Pamela Anderson...
was maybe good looking like 20 years ago when she was on Baywatch but she's no princess now she's barbed wire she'd kick their ass again I was just talking about oh no they didn't earlier and funny enough I'm going to bring them up again once in a while they'll run these pictures of Pamela Anderson without makeup and oh my heavens she is not good looking anymore is she with Tommy Lee or Kid Rock at this point who fucking cares well I'll know
But obviously she's big on PETA.
She's one of their big supporters and stuff.
And that's why she gets named the princess.
That's because they're brainwashing people, especially people who have no brains.
Alright.
Let's just move on.
I just wanted to get it out there.
It's interesting marketing using video games.
It is showing you, I will say this, let me finish on this thought.
You, as a gamer, are being targeted.
for propaganda.
That's why I brought this up.
That's what I wanted to say.
Just serve me up a plate of fried sea kittens.
I'm sorry, it's going to be an argument between Guitar Hero 5 and Madden for KFC's side or Super Chick Sisters.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize Super Chick Sisters but Guitar Hero 5 and Madden tell me to go eat chicken.
I'm going to have to listen to them.
Because I don't want to piss off Chick-fil-A The cows say to eat more chicken They have signs Alright, this was the worst possible show to bring up this topic on Let's move on Well, especially since you're in, you know, PETA Hater Central Which would be me But I don't hate I don't hate You know what, I hate hypocrites I do, there are things I hate But I'm trying not to hate I do not hate people
Project Natal
There are details, including release dates, sort of.
We should be looking at it possibly around November 2010, and it should be costing around 50 bucks.
And they are speculating that 5 million units will be ready by that time.
So they're thinking big seller.
And they don't really just have a bunch of happy gamers all on them.
They have Time Magazine all on them.
Project Natal made it into the top 50 invention poll on the Time Magazine website.
How is that possible for a device that's not even out?
But it's been invented.
It's been invented on display.
And who's played it?
Jimmy Fallon.
Big deal.
But it's Jimmy Fallon.
He means a lot to everybody, right?
No?
Chirp chirp, cricket cricket.
They're quoted, they're saying that Project Natal, because it uses several cameras and the microphone and because it's so much more intuitive than anything that's been out to this date and is going to be put out on a mass consumer market, it's right up there with the bladeless fan.
Yeah.
Super Virtual Boy X2-5
Wait a minute.
Okay, you know what the iToy was good for?
The wash-in-windows game that played that song from the 1920s.
That was awesome.
Yes, when I'm wash-in-windows.
That was the greatest thing they ever did with the iToy, okay?
And that game actually worked pretty well.
But a lot of these other games they released for the iToy did not play like you think they would on the back of the box.
All I'm saying, again, I realize Natal is a much higher advanced technology than iToy, but when I see this little 12-year-old girl walking up and trying on her clothes by waving her hand, I'm kind of like, okay, well, that's what they want us to believe it really plays like.
Yeah, and we were making that joke is that when Natal was being previewed, like, wasn't this a scene in Clueless like 10 years ago?
But how is it really going to work that flawlessly?
Because part of me goes, you know, well, my DS is supposed to understand me saying blue, too.
But here I am going, brew!
Brew!
Brew!
Let me mention some of the other things that are on the list.
Okay.
For the list of stuff that's... And I actually can't really call this a list of inventions.
Because there are...
Not necessarily all real inventions.
Some are innovations in existing technology.
Some are books.
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is on the list.
Is the Snuggie on the list?
The Dog Snuggie is on... I approve of the list.
The Snuggie is the greatest invention of modern times.
Have you seen The Sleepy?
The Dog Snuggie, Rob.
The Dog Snuggie.
Have you seen the Sleepy?
No, what's the Sleepy?
It's like a sleeping bag made out of bed sheets that has no zipper.
And it has a pillow inside of it.
Amazing.
Well, here's some of the stuff that's on here.
And some of these are actually pretty worthy.
The $10 million lightbulb, I love it, is actually a lightbulb that runs on LEDs.
It's just as bright as any lightbulb and will never burn out.
They've actually teleported atoms.
They have a guy who lost his vision and when I figured out with these other guys how to have a camera implanted into his eyeball so that he can record stuff.
Robot Penguins Robot Penguins, Rob
Thanks for watching!
This is... I don't see... A team of Dutch scientists is closing in on culturing stem cells from pigs and growing muscle in a petri dish.
Okay.
In vitro meat.
Okay, so I understand.
Maybe now this list makes a little more sense because a lot of these are things we haven't actually gotten to do ourselves.
You know, I have never grown meat myself.
I've never grown my own meat to eat.
This sounds like much more of a math thing to do.
Here's the robo-penguin.
What?
Okay.
So Natal, I see, fits into this list because a lot of these things.
But then again, I also say, does Project Natal really deserve to be up there with meat that you grow?
That sounds...
The unicycle thing.
I watched that thing.
Project Natal, I would say... Because you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a unicycle.
Just like you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a Segway.
What was that thing on South Park called?
I don't remember.
Whenever I see these new riding devices, I always think of that thing on South Park.
That one episode.
I know some of you listeners know what I'm talking about.
A 3D camera.
The smart bullet is my favorite invention on the list.
It's a bullet that you can trigger to explode after you've already shot it into somebody.
You can choose when the bullet explodes.
It's the best thing ever.
You don't want to piss me off.
Why not?
Because I just shot you and if I hit this button, you're fucked.
They've also figured out how to levitate a mouse with magnets.
Thanks for watching!
And Rob, it was the Wild Wacky Action Bike.
Wild Wacky Action Bike.
YouTube Funk, what the fuck.
Well, something else from Microsoft coming soon, of course, would be the Fall Update.
And we can expect that on Tuesday, November 17th.
With that will be coming the Facebook and Twitter integration, as well as Last.fm and all sorts of other fun stuff.
and um honestly still haven't really played around the Facebook and Twitter stuff other than the one time I posted on Twitter saying hey I'm posting from an Xbox 360 which apparently everybody else did so now I feel like a loser um
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Integration with Facebook, a little shot of the cross-media bar there with a Facebook link there.
And also some thumbnails of photos in a grid layout.
So some other features coming possibly in a later expansion to the, I guess, the new cross-media bar.
Which is...
Good, I guess, because we need a lot more updates from consoles for different things.
I know with at least the Xbox 360 one, I know they're going to add some screenshots and stuff like that, which would be pretty awesome, because then when I kill people in Grand Theft Auto, I can share it with everybody.
Although that would be a lot of photos I'm sharing, because I kick a lot of ass in that game.
Okay, maybe not.
Um...
But yeah, it's interesting.
So what do you think, Jamie?
Something that you would probably use?
Although you don't play much on the PlayStation 3, do you?
No, I really don't.
I probably wouldn't use it.
But I actually...
I'll be honest, a lot of the little networking stuff through the consoles, I really have no interest in.
Because the only things that I use for my networking is my iPhone and my computer.
So it would actually more irritate me, I think, if I was being interrupted in a game for Facebook.
Well, I'm just hoping that they don't have automatic updates for trophies or achievements or something like that.
I know that they've kind of tried something a little bit with Twitter with Uncharted 2.
It was a big pain in the ass?
I haven't really seen anything from that because I don't think a lot of people use it because they realize how annoying that would be.
Well, the Raptor thing is what pisses me off.
Well, yeah, I've seen that too.
That's kind of annoying.
Especially with Twitter.
I mean, you can kind of block some of that stuff now.
and at least with Facebook in fact actually I've been going through on Facebook and kind of blocking all of the apps which actually makes it really nice because now I can actually see what my friends are updating without having to sort through all those apps on there I've been doing much the same still kind of going through everything and hopefully hopefully I can actually get down to where it's just my friends posting and stuff like that but there are a few though especially from Rob that I can't block because they're actually a screenshot that he has on there but um
Which one?
The sorority life?
Uh, no, it's not sorority life.
It's like a quiz or something that he's doing.
You can actually go in and block a lot of those quizzes, too.
I know, I've been doing that.
You can do hide app whenever you get a post up on your wall.
Hmm.
So I actually do that with a lot of stuff now, because honestly, I'm irritated by a lot of it.
And the only thing that I actually even play anymore on Facebook is the stupid little pet game that I like so much.
The Pet Society thing.
And that's it.
Yeah.
So you're going to be using a lot of the Facebook stuff and Twitter.
I know you're going to use some Last.fm stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey guys, I'm updating my Twitter from Xbox, and then I never see another tweet from the Xbox.
And the only thing I worry about, again, is just the TwitSpam that we're already seeing, not just from Xbox, but like Uncharted 2 and some of these other games.
Like, you know, I just beat Level 3 in Uncharted 2.
I don't care!
Just all the Raptor people need to shut up.
And the problem is, is that unlike Facebook, Twitter has no button where I can say, filter all posts with hashtag Uncharted 2 in it.
You know what I mean?
And I'm not knocking Uncharted 2.
I haven't played it myself, but I hear the game is fabulous and it looks like fun.
I want to play it myself.
But I'm just saying this whole tweet spam thing has got to go.
Same thing with Facebook.
It was basically just to say, hey, we did it first.
I guess.
Anyhow.
Alright, well, moving on to other topics and maybe a game that might be publishing status updates to your Facebook very soon.
Drum Hero is a game that has been trademarked by Activision.
Keep in mind, though, this doesn't mean that necessarily the game is being made or anything.
I thought they already did this.
It is just...
Well, you know, a lot of people were kind of having this whole little like, wait a minute, haven't we heard this before?
But here's the thing, and this is what makes this newsworthy.
Previously, Activision trademarked the titles Guitar Villain and Drum Villain, and this was way back in 2007 when they did that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
In an interview with MCVUK.com, CEO Dan Rosenwig of the Guitar Hero brand and works for Activision says that the publisher is apparently already working on new versions of Guitar Hero and Band Hero and that there will also be more DJ Hero, which I'm sure all of this makes you go, duh, duh, and more duh.
We all know more of these games is coming.
But one thing they are saying, fewer SKUs in 2010.
But keep in mind, SKU is a term...
That's been, well, let's say skewed over the past couple years.
This has kind of made its way from a retail-only world to the mainstream game blogs.
Everybody throws this term skew around.
And what does skew really mean?
Skew is essentially like a barcode, I guess you could say.
Maybe you could explain this better than I could, Loki.
But basically, this doesn't mean like one game does not mean one skew.
A skew is...
Guitar Hero 5, Guitar plus Game on Wii is one SKU.
Guitar plus Drum plus Game on Wii is one SKU.
Game alone, another SKU, right?
Yeah.
It's basically kind of how it works.
Just because there's less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be less games, although that's kind of the conclusion a lot of people are jumping to.
And remember that this year alone, and this is including Guitar Hero Van Halen, there has been 41 SKUs.
Wow.
So less than that doesn't necessarily mean that much of a difference.
And that's because, you know, you have four different systems, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii, that all these games are coming out on.
And then you have the Jumbo Kit, the game alone, and the game and guitar.
The DS, and also possibly the PSP, which is actually supposed to be coming out next year as well.
Oh, wow.
And if you want to include the iPhone, I guess.
Right.
And also, by the way, Bobby in the chat room, which I think is interesting, he's bringing this up as well, says, another term co-opted by blogs that he's using correctly is price point.
That's a marketing term, not something, say, to talk about how much something costs you at retail.
And we're probably just as guilty as the next guy of using that term a lot.
It's kind of interesting how that has – that term, I would say, has almost evolved.
Right.
Maybe that's not what it's supposed to mean, but that's what everyone thinks it means now.
I always use MSRP.
Yeah, microtransaction.
Yeah, that too.
Anyway, getting off the subject a little bit here, but just because there's talking about less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean less games, although I personally think we're not going to see the Metallica and Van Halen-style releases next year in Aerosmith.
I don't think we're going to see any band-only releases next year, especially not after this whole stink about what's going on in Guitar Hero 5 with the band soon.
Actually, because of that stink,
Really?
Yeah, because then they'd have that one band that's already agreed to have their likeness in there, and then they're not really singing other people's songs.
I don't know, though.
Part of me just says it's kind of been done with all the big bands that are going to get their own game.
I mean, granted, I'm sure there's a million people.
Everybody's going to shout out their favorite band.
But are these games really selling that well?
I mean, come on.
The Van Halen one, they were given away.
Yeah.
Van Halen's still selling pretty well because a lot of people didn't buy it within that one month.
It's that one month.
After September, you aren't getting it for free.
I'm just surprised.
Again, I'm going to take a lot of hate with this comment, but I don't care.
Van Halen doesn't deserve their own game.
Especially not if they're going to ignore the latter half of the career.
I understand that.
And yeah, a lot of the older games like Aerosmith does not sell for shit right now.
But it's old.
It is old, but it doesn't matter though.
It's still another band.
Metallica?
Once in a while.
Smash Hits?
Never.
Never.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I see a couple people in chat are making a reference to Michael Jackson.
Specifically, I'll read this comment from Sterlok.
He has his own game coming.
and DarkSakura.com
I already have a theory of what Drum Hero is.
It's going to be something for either the DSi or an iPhone.
If you think about it, Guitar Hero can't do that on the DSi because there's no place to plug the guitar in.
But you better believe it, that drum skin that they put out for Band Hero, the DS version, can fit on the DSi.
So there's your drum.
drum hero that's actually one of the more creative thoughts I've heard is that maybe a lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that this is like a sequel to Guitar Hero but maybe it's an iPhone port makes a lot of freaking sense it'd be kind of neat to do something on Xbox Live Arcade or something like that too you know then that way you don't need a guitar you can just play it with your you know buttons hmm
That is a very interesting prospect.
Vib Ribbon
There are some songs in Lego Rock Band I want to play, but not the whole thing.
So I'll probably buy the game just to import the songs, but when it's in the clearance bin.
Because right now, $50 for the game plus another $10 for the import fees, I'm not feeling it.
But the game will end up in the bargain bin inevitably at some point, so I'll buy it then.
It's kind of interesting with all of these SKUs, if you want to say, or games coming out,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm surprised that Boom Boom Rocket, was that what it was called?
Remember that game that came out on Xbox?
I was actually really good at that game.
I had a bunch of high scores for a while.
I probably don't anymore.
But Boom Boom Rocket, I'm kind of surprised they never did anything with that.
All the songs in that were classical songs.
Imagine if they had actually put some licensed songs or some fun techno things into that shell.
That game could have been a whole lot more.
Yeah, it would have been cool.
and then of course, the inevitable Bobby's Yelling Out, Beat and Groovy but that game was always just doomed for disaster we all knew Konami was not going to have the faith to try and get licensed songs there by the way, did you realize Poppin' Music Wii came out?
no, somebody in chat said it, and I actually kind of went and went, oh yeah, that came out, huh but I just don't have interest in it oh by the way, it's coming out sell some copies did you sell some copies?
nope just curious not a copy
I know better than the torch of my customers like that
It's got dates!
Realistic.
I don't know.
This thing's been the figment of my imagination for about four years.
There's supposed to have a simultaneous PS3 and Xbox 360 release for Final Fantasy XIII in the US and in Europe on the 9th of March, 2010.
So, hey, we've only got a few more months to go.
Of course, if you're in Japan, you get it next month.
And it's kind of interesting because the turnaround, you know, they promised that it was going to be a much quicker turnaround this time, but they really made it happen, you know, especially considering there's a 360 port in the works as well.
You know, a four-month turnaround by Square standards really doesn't seem all that bad when you were at least looking at nine months before.
Like, how long did it take for Final Fantasy X to come over here from the Japanese one?
Plenty.
Like, almost a year, right?
Something like that.
Yeah.
So...
I liked, though, that they did this whole announcement in this big trailer.
Like, it's just this big event of a game.
Because I guess Final Fantasy XIII does deserve that a little bit.
But Square's got a lot riding on this game, don't they?
Well, they tend to throw a lot of their stuff in on their Final Fantasy franchise.
I mean, that is really what I would say has kept them on the map.
I just don't remember all this fanfare over XII.
That's all.
Well, XII was kind of.
As there shouldn't have been.
I liked XII.
XII just came out at a very bad time.
XII should have been made for the PS3 and 360.
It just came out at a bad time.
They should have just delayed it a year and put it on the next, now gen or whatever you want to call them, consoles.
Yeah.
I was going to say that the guy in the trailer was a douche.
Yeah, a little bit.
He had kind of a douchey vibe, didn't he?
But it's like, you know, it's kind of typical of them to do something very fanfare like that because...
Lyonna Lewis The Theme Song
So here in the US and UK, but not in Japan.
So they're actually having different artists, which is kind of new because even when they localized the Kingdom Hearts song, it was still Utada, Hikaru.
But she's also bilingual.
I got concert tickets for her in January.
I'm so excited.
Anyhow, but what was I going to say before I got sidetracked with that?
Oh, this is the first time that they've had like a different artist singing it over here, right?
No.
No, did they do that with 12?
I don't remember.
They did that with 10 too.
Wasn't it the same?
It was the same song.
Oh, I forgot about 10-2.
That's right.
Yeah, they got What's Her Face from Jade.
Yeah, Sweet Box or whatever it was called.
That's right.
I forgot about that.
And I was really shocked.
And they changed one of the ending videos in the U.S.
version from the Japanese version.
They actually changed it because of her differences in singing it.
So...
Well, actually, the song that's going to be in Final Fantasy XIII is a song called My Hands.
It's actually on Leona Lewis' next album.
And if you're curious what the power ballad of Final Fantasy XIII is going to sound like, we have a little sneak peek for you right here.
We can only play a little clip of it because it's all copyright and stuff.
Here's a sneak peek.
So it sounds like your typical, like, sitting in the dentist's office, kind of, you know, Celine Dion station, you know, power ballad music, you know.
Which is kind of typical of the Final Fantasy ballads.
It actually does sound pretty J-pop ballad, actually.
A little bit.
What if they announce something horrible like Popo Sao or something like... Sexy Back is the theme song of Final Fantasy XIII.
Sexy Back, yeah.
No, that's Final Fantasy XIII versus Sexy Back.
So there you go, Leona Lewis, which actually, you know, I gotta say, though, that's a pretty good-sized name to land.
But you know what's funny?
You know who her record label is?
Sony.
So, kind of, who knows, maybe a little bit of networking there, but Leona Lewis, you know, that's a pretty, you know, it's not a triple-A artist, but she's hot shit right now.
Unfortunately, because of the Sony license, Xbox 360 version will be getting popos out.
Shut up.
I don't know about the UK but uh she's she's big over here in fact she's the only celebrity from a British reality show except maybe Susan Boyle that is well known over here whereas I'm assuming over there they probably have a lot of our American idols so they're probably not all of them I can't imagine people like Taylor Hicks are big in the UK but probably Kelly Clarkson and
Some of those people are big in the UK.
I still think that's a pretty decent-sized name to have.
Let's not forget, folks, that's...
That's for some people, it's not necessarily a draw, but it makes a lot of people do a double take.
It kind of, you know, I don't think anybody's going to buy this game because Leona Lewis is in it, but it's definitely going to make a lot of people go, hey, it's going to make some of these critics of video games are not a legitimate art form or video games are not on the same level as movies and TV shows kind of turn their heads and go, oh, oh, Leona Lewis is doing the theme song.
Really?
That's that's interesting.
That's only because they approached Bryan Adams first and he turned him down.
Shut up.
He's the king of power ballads.
All right.
Speaking of release dates, let's check out some closer release dates to, you know, like this week.
So, Loki, since you finished a bite of your wing there, I'll start with the U.S.
dates.
There's nothing coming out this week.
What are you talking about?
No really good stuff.
There's actually...
Lots of stuff.
Depends though what area of the world you're in or United States because that stuff might have already come out with people breaking street date because they suck.
No, but of course this week Left 4 Dead 2 making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not PlayStation 3, PC.
You wish on the 360 or PS3.
Anyways, Assassin's Creed 2 coming out on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Also this week, some smaller titles including Planet 51 Of course, tying in with the new movie coming out That'll be out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP Today, actually, New Super Mario Bros.
Wii came out That's pretty awesome Resident Evil Darkseid Chronicles also coming out on the Wii this week
Buck Fever, if you happen to like deer hunting games, also coming out on the Wii.
Seems to be a lot of deer hunting games on the Wii lately.
Formula One on PSP, coming from Codemasters.
NCAA Basketball 2010, out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Also Formula One for the Wii as well.
This week, another big old bundle game, which I'm not sure is going to sell very well, but Tony Hawk's Ride with the skateboard will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii for a whopping $120.
The re-release of Stoked, the bigger edition, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.
Ubisoft pimping out their Pets games with Pets Hamster Superstars featuring what appears to be a rollerblading hamster, which is very disturbing.
LEGO Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC this week.
And also, I believe, the DS and PSP.
Assassin's Creed Bloodlines on PSP this week.
Also, Assassin's Creed 2 Discovery on the DS.
Seen It, Bright Lights, Big Screen out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii God of War Collection coming out on the PlayStation 3 with a demo of God of War 3 in there so that'll be pretty cool Yu-Gi-Oh!
50s Tag Force 4 on PSP
Just Dance from Ubisoft out on the Wii, which the game looks absolutely ridiculous.
You remember that stupid minigame that they made me play instead of the sledding one I wanted to play in Rayman's Raven Rabbids TV Party?
I remember this.
This was at PAX, right?
Did that happen?
Yes, it was.
And unfortunately, this game is very similar to that, so...
I don't know, you'd probably look ridiculous playing it.
Jamie will get a kick out of this.
The Sims 3 World Adventures expansion was coming out this week as well on PC.
What does that mean?
You can go to France.
You can go on safari.
On France.
I can go to the Louvre.
I can take my fake character out for a baguette.
Be our guest, be our guest.
Sorry, Loki.
Can I read some quick chat comments, though, because there's some really funny shit.
Yeah, it's only in that voice, though.
Okay, then.
I will read some comments from Jet.
SSJ100 and Matt says that as far as the Final Fantasy theme song goes, Christopher Walken doing Poker Face should be in it.
And I'm thinking so much that.
Christopher Walken doing anything should be in a video game.
Or Cartman doing Poker Face.
or Cartman doing poker face or kind of like a mishmash of both.
Also, some strange chat.
I didn't read this whole thing, but they were talking about sales figures for DJ Hero.
Some chatters calling it a flop, but I didn't realize it was a flop.
In fact, I thought I saw some article this week that just in those first few days, like because the game came out, what, October 27th?
And just in those last few days, it sold like 100,000 copies or something?
Yeah.
I mean, granted, that's across four different platforms, and I think maybe like 3,000 were sold on the PS2, but, you know, you figure they're not gonna sell well there.
I mean, it's a little early to call that game a flop, right?
Yeah, I don't think it's sold as, you know, much as, say, like a Guitar Hero game, but then again, it's also way more expensive than a Guitar Hero game, so...
Guitar Hero 1
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
it is the best music game song list for an initial game in a series ever I wouldn't go so far to say as I enjoy it as much as say maybe the third mix or the sixth mix or sixth style or whatever of other games but I will say as far as an initial song list goes for a franchise launching music game it's the best song list there has ever been in a music game ever yeah
Alright, continuing on release dates.
This is a big one.
LittleBigPlanet coming to the PSP this week.
That should be pretty exciting.
Disney's The Princess and the Frog, not so exciting on DS and Wii this week.
Hey, I want to see that movie.
You shut up, hater.
Yeah, but the game's not going to be great.
Yeah, the game's going to be stupid.
The movie will be cool, but the game, not so much.
And talk about random licenses, D3.
Kamen Rider Dragon Knight on the Wii and DS.
Um...
Photo Frenzy on the Nintendo DS from Kokum International.
And if I remember correctly, I thought that was a DSi-only game.
Maybe not.
Pets, Dogs, Talent Show.
Yet another animal that's dressed up and on a skateboard coming to the DS from Ubisoft.
God forbid they do that to animals.
And...
This is kind of cool.
Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue coming to the Wii this week.
Oh, God, I remember talking about that like weeks and weeks ago that it was coming out for the Wii and now just out of nowhere here it is, right?
Boom, there it is.
Boom.
Jumbo Safari.
Imagine Artist on the Nintendo DS.
Let's see.
And some smaller games.
Rec Room on the Wii.
I think that's about it.
Next week though, Hello Kitty Party on DS.
Woo freaking hoo.
Alright, let's go to some Japanese releases and some of the things you have to look forward to over there.
Just like we have Left 4 Dead 2 coming out over here, you have that coming out in Japan as well in their own version coming out on the 19th because they get their releases on Fridays if I remember right.
Or no, I think they come out like Thursday or something.
And over there it's called Ha!
Zombies!
Tycho Notatujen
Callin' Kuroki Chakushin
or something and it looks to be like a kind of a scarier game that's coming out on the Wii.
I don't see any screenshots but definitely it's got one of those like Japanese grudge looking girls on the front and then like a little cell phone so I think it's has something to do with like cell phone horror or something.
I don't know exactly what cell phone horror would be but this game is it.
Hey on the PlayStation 2 your monthly bill from AT&T with an iPhone.
Oh, Loki, sometimes I feel like there should be a two-drink minimum to listen to this show with you on it.
PlayStation 2, Seke, Saikyou, Gensi, Ego, Kuza.
For those that are still buying PS2 games on the Nintendo DS, Monster Finder comes out.
And then also next week, just so you know, they're also getting like hella, hella, hella Hello Kitty peripherals.
Like a new little pouch and a DSi slim pouch and all this stuff.
I think it's like an anniversary, actually, of Hello Kitty.
I think so too.
Mario and Sonic, by the way, at the Vancouver Olympics also comes out in Japan this week.
And lastly, taking a look at the Sony PSP, Armored Core, Silent Line Portable coming out over there, as well as Jak and Daxter, a new release there, and a game called Mina no Navi comes out on the PSP.
Those are your Japanese release dates.
In the UK on the 17th, we have Left 4 Dead 2.
We have Gyromancer on the 18th.
And a bunch of stuff on the 20th.
Assassin's Creed 2.
Assassin's Creed Bloodlines.
Assassin's Creed 2 Discovery.
Okay, just different versions of it.
Dragon Age Origins.
F1 2009.
LittleBigPlanet on PSP.
New Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010.
Saw.
Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper Sims 3 World Adventures Wii and Tony Hawk Ride I just want to mention that like next week or actually the week after next there's a game coming out on the Wii over here that's like all sorts of fail it's an exercise game called Your Shape it features Jenny McCarthy and guess what okay
They're super intelligent over Ubisoft.
They decided, hey, you know what?
Even though the Wii has this wonderful motion capture system with Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, we're going to use a webcam to capture your movement just like the eye toy.
I'm just worried about the shape it's going to tell me I am.
Congratulations, you are a pear.
Congratulations, you're shaped like Rosie O'Donnell.
No!
You are a leopard.
What?
Does he make A-sets?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Let's keep moving on.
He realizes Part A is going on two hours tonight just for Part A. Good times.
Obviously, we've been gone a week.
And she's jumping and excited.
Fitness, that's fun and focused on you.
Jenny McCarthy's just excited to have a job this week.
Seriously, what has she done?
Besides, I think, a National Lampoon movie, maybe, here and there?
Alright, a few more stories and then do a break already.
Good lord.
Loki.
I have another story?
Yes.
Don't release dates.
It's your turn.
We're talking about Jenny McCarthy and how... The hell with her.
Anyways, Modern Warfare 2, of course, selling lots and lots and lots of copies.
Of course, in the UK, it sold 1.23 million units, the first day breaking first day sales records over there.
So that's pretty awesome.
I guess everybody loves Modern Warfare over there.
And of course, in the US...
4.7 million units in day one sales, making it probably the biggest game this year and the biggest game for quite a while.
So, um, yay!
I don't know.
Dan Storr
Hey look, it's gamers waiting for a game!
Oh my goodness, that pandemonium!
Well, because people need to be reminded for some reason that video games are a huge business.
And you know, this game probably made more money than most of the box office did this weekend.
Like, what was the big movie this weekend?
2012 or whatever?
And I don't think it...
I mean, even if it made $100 million, which I don't think it did.
That's half the movie's budget right there.
But that's probably still less than what Modern Warfare 2 made.
Granted, of course, the game is, what, $60 or it's a movie ticket.
Not to spoil anything about 2012.
Did you see it?
Yes, I went and saw it earlier today.
It looks ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.
After the fourth time, count it, fourth time that they took off on a runway and outrunning an earthquake.
That happened multiple times in this movie.
It was just like, really?
Really?
These movies are just getting ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
I realize there's an audience for these movies, and clearly it's Loki.
But, like, Independence Day, I watched.
I was all excited about it.
It was cool.
Day after tomorrow, I was kind of like, okay, really?
We're running away from, like, weather blasts and things like this?
Listen, you can outrun weather, okay?
It's a fact.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
is his job.
He's a failed author.
Like, really?
No, it's actually very funny.
Seriously, there's multiple times that they're flying the plane out of things.
They outran a volcano blast.
They outran building toppling.
How is the plane taking off from a landing strip and somehow sinking into the ground?
They were pulling up on the plane, yet going deep into the ground.
What?
It just... I'm sorry, there's a point where I'm like, this is just too much.
And this movie looks to be too much.
As I know, it was completely ridiculous.
And it was.
It lived up to its ridiculousness.
On the ridiculous scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not so ridiculous and 10 being completely fucking ridiculous, how ridiculous is 2012?
I would give this an 8.5 because a 10 I think would have to be Wild Zero because Wild Zero is so ridiculous.
They chopped a UFO in half with a samurai sword.
And it's a punk band.
Which, by the way, the samurai sword I think came out of his guitar.
That movie sounds awesome.
And there was zombie love.
And I've got your copy.
I forgot I even have that movie.
Amazing.
And any movie that has Guitar Wolf in it instantly rolls.
Okay, and Tiger Claw wants to clarify, 2012 has made $225 million worldwide and $65 million domestically.
And he sources ComingSoon.net as the source for the monetary figures.
But probably Modern Warfare 2 still makes more money in the week that it's out than this movie did.
I mean, it's just huge.
And honestly, though, it seriously...
It's a good movie to watch.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
But that's why you watch it.
It would make an awesome Riff Trax movie.
Oh my God, it's going to make an awesome Riff Trax movie.
Okay, back to Modern Warfare for a minute because I really, really don't care about 2012 anymore.
I do care, though, about that Facebook group about shut the fuck up, the world's not going to end in 2012.
That cracked me up.
I signed up for that.
I know.
I signed up last week for an undisclosed amount of people arbitrarily signing up for a cause or something like that.
I signed up for that.
That was funny.
There's an app for that.
Anyway, back to Modern Warfare 2.
Here's the thing I don't understand.
Loki, I need somebody to translate for me and for some reason I feel like you would understand this game better than I do because I'm not knocking the game, but keep in mind these type of war sims are not really my thing.
So what is it about this game that is making it sell zillions?
And yes, it is in fact selling zillions.
Well...
Thanks for watching!
Chatters, feel free to help me out, too.
Why is Modern Warfare 2 such a landmark game?
It's very gritty.
You're playing undercover.
In the beginning, I think you're undercover as part of a terrorist cell because you're infiltrating them from the inside, but you have to murder people and stuff like that, innocent people in an airport and whatnot, seeing they've got controversy or whatever.
So is it kind of trying to ride on that whole America, fuck yeah wave?
Mm-hmm.
Well, it's America and a bunch of other countries are getting all fucked over because there's one part where you're like, you know, storming the White House because terrorists have taken it over.
So, I mean, it's kind of, yeah, you know, fighting terrorism is cool.
And the online's really sweet.
I think of like a, guys, I don't know, like a Halo 3 or something like that because Halo 3 had a really short campaign and the online was awesome.
It's kind of the same with Modern Warfare 2.
The campaign's pretty cool, short, but it's awesome.
Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says even PC boycotters are playing Modern Warfare 2.
I did see that screenshot of like all the people in the boycott group on Steam were playing the game.
My god, if I could sum up like arguing on the internet in a picture, like you know how they say a picture is worth a thousand words?
Like if I had to explain debate on the internet, like that picture does it right there.
That is trying to debate someone on the internet summed up into a picture.
Do the same thing when Left 4 Dead 2 comes out this week.
Go snap a picture of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.
I bet there's shitloads of people playing it.
Yeah, because you know what?
Because they're sheep.
Because they're like, ah, but I want to play it.
Okay, I will.
And they'll justify it saying, oh, well, they took care of what I needed them to take care of.
Or whatever.
Let's see.
Quiltipo in chat says it's a manly macho game that makes people feel tough.
It's a modern version of when we used to go outside and play like Army Man or whatever.
Make-believe.
Now it's just all... Pleased to bury the G.I.
Joes in a mass graveyard.
Interesting.
Again, I'm not knocking the game.
I guess for what it is, it's a landmark game and certainly the graphics I've seen look very realistic and everything.
I realize just not every game I'm going to get and that's just the way it is.
Just like there's a lot of people that probably sit here and go, really?
Why do they play so many music games?
They talk all the time about music games and I think they're stupid.
Everybody's just into whatever they're into.
I just was kind of curious why this game above the countless other war games that are released.
Anyhow, got one more news story for you guys, and we're going to get into the classic video game of the week, and this actually has to do with the Zune.
You know, we talk a lot about iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, you know, and all the gaming that's going on there.
Well, certainly Microsoft wants a piece of that, too, with their own handheld device, the Zune.
And while the Zune doesn't make phone calls, the Zune does play movies, listen to music, and now it will do games, too.
Um...
There's a new firmware update that happened.
It was 4.3, and apparently there are now six free games on the Zoom Marketplace.
That's right, free.
Project Gotham Racing Ferrari Edition, Lucky Lane Bowling, Vans Skate Pool Service, Piano, Checkers, you know, classic game in there too.
and a game called Audio Surf Tilt which is a port of sorts of the popular game Audio Surf that was available on the PC where you can use your own MP3s.
I've actually played that game.
It's quite a bit of fun.
If you like music games, speaking of which, Audio Surf is a nice little investment.
That's kind of a fun game.
So now you can play that on the Zune as well.
So, you know, Zune's kind of trying to step it up there a little bit as a portable device.
And, of course, I'm sorry, not just a portable device, but, you know, kind of up there with the iPhone with its all-in-one kind of device there.
And for those that were asking, you know, when is Microsoft going to get into handheld gaming, I guess this is what we've got, at least so far.
So, I don't know, any interest in these games?
I'm curious what Project Gotham looks like and the audio surf I'm certainly interested in, especially if it plays off your MP3s from the Zune.
I think that's pretty cool.
But at the same time, I wouldn't drop several hundred dollars on the Zune just to check it out.
I'm just wondering when the hell they're going to actually release the X and A stuff on the Zune.
When's that happening?
Yeah, I heard something like that was supposed to happen, huh?
They talked about it a while ago.
DarkSakura, what video game did you pick for the kiddies tonight?
River City Ransom!
Woohoo!
By the way, the vault's cold.
Were you very cold going into the vault to pick out the game?
Actually, even though I love the NES version, I'm picking a specific one, and that's the example that have given us for our YouTube.
It's Downtown Neketsu Monogatari, which is Downtown Hot-Blooded Story.
In the PAL region, it came out as Street Games.
And it's one of the Kunio games.
And you can hear the music is a little different here.
In fact, let me play a little clip here.
I'll have to find this on my main cabinet You can play PC Engine games on your main?
Yeah, I can play anything I want.
Oh, you've got the emulator set up.
But yeah, this is... There are also versions for the X68000, the Game Boy Advance.
It came out on Virtual Console.
But basically, since it's one of the Kunio games, you know, and with Neketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, which was Renegade, and Neketsu Koko Dodgeball-bu, which was Super Dodgeball, which I have covered...
Yeah, I think that was a previous game you did because I love Super Dodgeball.
But basically you were playing high school kids in the Japanese version.
They're Kunio, Enriki, and over here it's Alex and Ryan as they go to try to rescue the girl.
And by going against different, I guess, you know, delinquent gangs or whatever.
And so it's just a little street brawler, you know, walk down the street, punch some people, and then you stop in for, you know, a burger.
and a free smile.
And a free smile.
So, you also of course have passwords so you can start off in different parts of the game.
But I did pick this one in particular.
Oh yeah, actually I needed to mention some differences between the Japanese version.
They actually changed the school uniforms into t-shirts and jeans.
You know, that type of stuff.
Also, now you just noticed...
Hello!
Would you like to make a request?
I can do whatever I want.
This game was also famous for having a butt.
I remember that.
You remember that?
In the sauna sequence?
You saw a butt.
Well, it was probably just a public bath or, you know, whatever.
But yeah.
This was the other bit.
More voice acting.
So for a little, you know, TurboGrafx-16 style cartridge.
No.
No?
This was PCCD, PC Engine CD.
But still, that wasn't the most technologically advanced, I mean at the time it was, but it's pretty impressive.
You had Redbook Audio with this, you had voice acting because it had a higher storage capacity.
Well, I mean, you heard the vocal intro for Dracula X on PC Engine, so it could definitely do it.
Just pre-record it and have it go up.
It's just interesting because I never really knew this version was here, even though I loved River City Ransom as a kid, and I see everybody in chat, BARF!
Everybody remembers some of the great dialogue that we got over here, which I'm sure was just great localization, but it came out very funny.
Kind of like the original English, if you will.
Because I highly doubt that's what they were saying in the Japanese thing, was BARF.
Well, also, the company that localized it was American Technos, which was a subsidiary of Technos Japan.
They actually brought out another Kunio game that came out over here.
It's Crashin' the Boys Street Challenge, although it's more of the same type, but not really super, super linked.
And, yeah, in Japan, that one was...
and Bikkuri Neketsu Shin Kiroku Harukanaru Kin Medal, which was Astonishing Hot-Blooded New Records Distant Gold Medals.
So, but yeah.
I love how they like to butcher names and everything when they come out.
But yeah, it did come back out on Virtual Console, so those with Wii, go get it!
However, I will just say this to this date.
The Super CD version is my favorite.
Alright, so your classic video game of the week, River City Ransom, or in this case, Downtown at Neketsu, Monogatari.
There it is.
Your classic game of the week from the archives.
and you know what a recently released game reminds me I would actually even consider it a spiritual successor because Dan and I were talking about it which is how I was thinking of doing this one is the oh crap now I just forgot the name where you play as a delinquent boy beating up other people badass bully badass rumble or something can't go bonch badass rumble that's it
Kenko Bancho.
Kenko Bancho.
That's it.
Hmm.
All right.
Well... Because that's how Dan we had to get that game.
And Dan's like, I want it just because it has badass in the name.
Just because of the name.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our show.
But we're not done yet.
We're going to come back for plenty more, which is pretty amazing because part A tonight was two hours.
That's one of our longest part A's in a while.
But that's okay.
We've obviously had a lot to talk about between the swine flu and gaming and all that food and all that other fun stuff.
But we are going to take a quick break.
We're going to talk about
We will be right back with more of
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 15th of 2009, where we are taping the 344th episode of our podcast, as we do every Sunday night live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG
and just kind of your typical little power ballad from Final Fantasy.
I kind of tuned it out.
Yeah, I kind of tuned it out a little bit.
You know, you just kind of have to imagine, you know, that's going to be the big romance scene with lightning and snow and what do they get?
Partially cloudy and whatever these guys' names are in the game.
No, it's going to be snow and that red-headed chick and one of them like flying through the... What's her name?
Thundersnow?
No, it's on Thunderstone.
30% chance of precipitation, is that her name?
No.
It's funnier, though, if you imagine it being that tough-looking army dude that raises all the chocobos, and he's singing it to a chocobo.
That is funny.
That is pretty damn funny.
There you go.
See, doesn't that make that song a lot funnier?
It'll be Snow getting it on with his motorcycle, which turns into the Twin Shivas, and yeah.
All right.
Anyhow, there you go.
Love it or hate it.
It's the ballad from Final Fantasy XIII.
And those of you that weren't listening live tonight, that's okay.
I'm sure that – I think her album comes out on Tuesday, so if you really want to hear it, you can check it out on iTunes.
Anyhow, we're going to get back into the show tonight.
Let's go ahead and go into rapid-fire news first because I failed to load the Twitter topics during the break.
Fail.
I know.
Well, we only had a short break tonight.
So while I get that up, we'll go ahead and do rapid-fire news, and then we will do Twitter topics.
Force Armor
Could very well be horse armor or a campaign to get horse armor.
Or it could be horse shit.
Or how about this?
There are no horses in Final Fantasy.
Oh my god.
Sorry.
Chocobo armor.
That'd be cool.
I don't like tactics games.
What? !
Oh my god, do I really do this show with you guys?
I really don't like tactics games.
I recognize it as an amazing game.
I personally do not dig the tactics games.
Command & Conquer 4 has been announced to be coming out next year on March 16th.
They call it Tiberian Twilight, and I hate that subtitle because it reminds me of that crappy vampire movie series and book series.
Crappy series in general.
Did you know that Burger King near us is staying open 24 hours for two days because of the stupid Twilight movies?
That's sad.
Why would Burger King... I mean, I realize they have the whole Twilight promotion.
Yeah, they have a big old Twilight promotion going.
It's on the crowns.
That's blasphemy.
Woo!
I was so bored this week, Loki, when I was sick.
I was watching the Rachel Ray show.
That right there should tell you something.
She was giving makeovers to Twilight fans to make them look like Twilight characters.
And I'm just sitting there going, Isn't she supposed to cook?
I would rather be at work.
So she took them the hot topic.
I thought she was supposed to cook
in the form of a pack from AFI including songs Beautiful Thieves, End Transmission, Love Like Winter, Medicaid, and the Leaving Song Part 2.
I like Love Like Winter.
That's a good song.
and that'll be available as a pack for 680 Microsoft Points or $8.50 in real money and of course available individually for $2 each or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii Points.
You can kind of figure that out.
And finally, the individual song for this week though is The Bangles, Walk Like an Egyptian.
Awesome!
For $2.
And for the PSP, Dead Kennedy's California Uber Allies.
Nice.
Or...
Uber Alls.
They spelled allies wrong.
Stupid.
Sleater Kinney with You're No Rock and Roll Fun.
And that's also $2.
Dude, Walk Like an Egyptian I think would actually be kind of a hard song to play.
I seem to remember it had a very fast guitar and drum part.
It's a song that people recognize.
People like songs that people can recognize.
Exactly.
But now I'm trying to think about what the game Walk Band would look like.
All I can picture are just these horrible, horrific stereotypes that really shouldn't be repeated, but that's just what pops into my mind.
I can't help it, but I'm sure it would be a hideously racist game.
50 different renditions of I'm Turning Japanese.
Alright, anyhow.
Moving on to another rapid fire news tonight.
The wireless N network adapter has made its way out to America.
If you want to pay $100 for it, the wireless N networking adapter is out.
It's dual band, 5 gigahertz, 2 point, you know what, it's
I'm not going to read all the technical specs because I'm just not that nerdy.
Just trust me.
It's out.
And if you like your wireless fast, very fast, then this will get it fast.
But do remember you need an end router or this will do no good.
It'll just be no faster.
Yeah, well, it'll be no faster.
It'll just revert to B or G or whatever it is you have in your house.
Anyhow, also, Madden NFL Arcade coming out November 24th and 25th, depending on what platform you're on.
It will come out for $15 on the PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on their respective service.
This is Madden NFL Arcade.
I'm assuming, I don't know a whole lot more about this game, but I'm assuming this just plays a little more like, not so probably intense with your play picks and so forth.
It's probably just more of a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
It's just another excuse to get you to spend money on this because, hey, they tried it with NBA and with, you know, NHL, so why not try it with Madden, their number one selling sports franchise?
Why not?
I mean, $15 is not exactly, you know, it's on the higher end of the arcade games.
I have to read this comment from chat before I get to the last story I have here.
SJ100Matt says, Walk Band sounds like a parody from South Park, like playing Rampart to keep the Mongolians from ripping down my shitty wall.
lastly for me for rapid fire news tonight Criterion's developed Need for Speed game is making its way out next year that is official I guess from Criterion Games website I don't know if that is the Need for Speed online game but it's another game coming out there from Criterion is next year so if you like your you know explosive car wrecks there you go
Well, Star Trek Online, how's this for Gearswitch, will be out on February 2nd, 2010.
Or, if you want to go by the star date, 63554.5.
But yeah, I am totally, totally, totally very happy with that because I will be playing the hell out of it.
And also, they were saying that the events that happened in the movie affect the game.
Even though the movie's a parallel universe thing.
Yes.
Strange.
Maybe this is a reboot universe game.
Interesting.
That would be very, very interesting.
Honestly, my gut reaction to hearing this was, already?
I seriously thought it was not going to be until next Christmas, and now I'm sitting here going, holy crap, it's going to be out in February?
February 2nd?
Oh my god.
Bye, WoW.
Yeah.
Well, also, new Beatles Right Band download content on November 17th with Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
So, that'll be pretty cool.
November 17th, not too far to go.
Also, that's actually going to be for Xbox 360 and Wii.
And then for the iPhone, there is a Commodore 64 emulator back on the iPhone store.
So... Because I guess they patched out... I remember it was there before, and you could somehow trick it into running BASIC, but then that means you could write your own code on the iPhone.
That's a big no-no.
Well, right, because it was rejected because of the basic interpreter.
But now they have removed it, and then other people figured out how to get back into it.
And so apparently now it's just on with even further revised code.
And also has a boost in performance and three new games, international basketball, international baseball, and international tennis.
Also included are Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Arctic Shipwreck, Jack Attack, and Jupiter Lander.
I actually played Le Mans when I was a kid.
I remember that game.
So those aren't totally obscure games.
Some of those are pretty well-known Commodore 64 games.
Alright, before we get back into more news, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.
We always ask before the show for you to send us your topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
And if you're not following us on Twitter, why not?
Follow us.
Enjoy our twit spam.
Twitter.com slash OLR is our username of the Orange Lounge Radio.
Sterlok tweeted us tonight wanting to know, I'm curious what your guys' opinion is on the visually impaired gamer suing Sony.
As a blind gamer myself, I find it to be a bad move.
And I had no idea what Sterlok was talking about, but I found it interesting, so I tweeted back.
I said, give me a link.
And Sterlok gave me a link.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I hadn't heard about this, but keep in mind I was a little bit out of it for a week.
So here's the story has to do with a visually impaired gamer who has basically sued Sony.
And a lot of this has to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that, quote, no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any persons who owns leases or leases to or operates a place of public accommodation.
So in other words, you know, you can't
and many more.
I don't know why though, but I guess this thing actually gets into massively multiplayer online titles requesting the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations for gamers with disability impaired visual processing.
So it's kind of interesting to hear this lawsuit comes to light.
I would have liked to hear more about, and I think Sturlock's in chat, I'd kind of like to hear more about his feelings against the story.
Because I think that's kind of interesting.
Um...
You know, it's tough.
I can imagine it's very tough to have a disability such as blindness or deafness.
And this isn't the first time we've had a listener who has a major disability who's kind of talking about games.
And I think a lot of these things that we take for granted sometimes, like for instance, have we ever sat here and said, oh man, the graphics in the game were awesome and just everything looks so real and the water effects were so cool.
and we have to sometimes realize like not everybody like sees that you know I know what they do in the movie world is that they actually will release movies in the theaters particular showings throughout the day or a special you know theater time or whatever where they actually have or a device that actually describes the scenes to folks while they're watching the movie you know because if you can't see what's going on it might actually say you know
Tom Cruise's character is walking into a bar or something, you know, like that type of thing.
It'll actually kind of describe the scenes for you, which, you know, makes sense.
Just like we have closed captioning for deaf folks, you know, who can't, you know, will see that and it'll be little musical notes of someone singing or what have you.
You know, there's other little ways they accommodate.
Video games don't really have a lot of that.
Does the ADA really apply here though?
I'm not so sure.
I think it might be a little bit of extreme to say that.
I think certainly though there is a statement being said here though that a game company that could cater to this could certainly bring in an audience that a lot of folks seem to be neglecting.
Does that make sense?
Well, yeah, it's just, there's certain things that I think people need to have a reasonable expectation about.
That, this is for an MMO, right?
Well, I think in part, but this is about games in general.
I mean, imagine if you were blind.
There are some, yeah, that it has to do with the type of game, with...
For example, if it's something that as a game requires a number of visual clues, if I personally, this is just me, for example, when my hand was hurting, I could not physically play any game except for singing in Rock Band.
And I don't like to sing, but I sing in rock bands so I can play.
I know that's a weak excuse, but I'm just using it as a personal example.
I think that if it's a game that, yes, modifications can be made to it so that someone can participate, there needs to be a release or a server or some way that you can enable somebody to do that.
But if it is something that requires visual clues so strongly that there is no possible way...
to simulate the same feel of the game through any other course of action.
If you could do it with sound, that would be great.
Especially if you could have a big speaker set up over your monitor that you could use directional sound like that.
That's one thing.
But you're talking about this has to do with the bottom line.
The company's main concern is going to be is your business going to be worth the money that we're going to spend to keep your business?
And I don't really think that the ADA is going to apply to that.
Because, I mean, for example, say that...
I say that I damaged my larynx and I really wanted to sing in rock band.
There's no possible way they can make me able to sing.
I'm sorry.
They can't do it.
Maybe I can play a keyboard or something with it.
That's reasonable.
But do you see what my point is?
There are just some things that you cannot compensate for.
I think the bottom line, though, and I think the point that Sherlock was trying to make with the story is that a lawsuit's not really the way to go about making your point.
And I think that's what he disagrees with.
And I, to some extent, say, yeah, a lawsuit's a little silly.
We have enough frivolous lawsuits in this country.
I think the key is reward the companies that address your needs.
exactly you know if there's MMOs out there that give those better audio clues to the things that you know sometimes we take for granted as visual you know descriptions or you know giving you more directional type of you know sound or clues or whatever it may be reward those companies for their efforts or even a special video mode because I know that in some cases certain colors will register in different types of blindness that others won't have like you know a special color filter because you can easily do that
Changing Flashes in DDR for Epilepsy
Interesting.
So there's lots of very interesting little subtle changes that they try to do in games to make them more accessible.
And I think we reward companies that do that.
Well, also, and I hate to say that this stinks of that situation where there's one lawyer, wheelchair-bound, who was going around to... Actually, not even going to some of these places.
Picking places like Julian, California.
They did it there.
Forcing businesses to either go out of business or spend all this money...
to make places accessible when the places were accessible anyway.
Going back and suing places that he had never been to.
Some people actually seek... This is a problem that I have with the American Disabilities Act is that...
and there's a lot of good that came from it.
Don't get me wrong.
I think there is a lot of good that came from it and I think that if a company wants the business, they do need to cater to everybody.
They need to be courteous.
I don't think there should be a law to force people to be courteous, but they should be courteous.
They should be mindful of their clientele.
At the same time, I think that it opened up a lot of doors for abuse.
A lot of doors for abuse.
And again, I'm actually out of work right now under the American Disabilities Act because I physically could not use my hand.
I was grateful for it.
It gave me the recovery time I needed.
But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to go to work and say, you're forcing me to do my job, I'm suing.
You know?
It's the same thing.
I think that it's actually trying to...
www.DarkSakura.com
So something developers have to be mindful for.
Go play another game.
Seriously, just play another game.
The one suing?
Yeah.
Play another game.
If they're going to be bitches, why do you want them to have your money?
Do something else.
Let's move on with some more tweets.
Fernando on the Twitter says, Philharmonic band, yes or no?
That's kind of a broad question.
Didn't we get Wii Music?
If you're going to join a Philharmonic band, I was a band geek.
Dark Sakura was a band geek.
Loki, were you a band geek?
Nope.
Well, two out of three say join the band.
It's a good experience.
But I don't know.
It could be talking about a CD coming out or something.
I don't know.
It's kind of broad.
Ray Iannami says, OLR, Modern Warfare 2 gets a 9.5 from IGN and a 1.5 reader average.
And I actually tweeted back because I was kind of like, okay, well, the sales figures don't say 1.5.
So I said, oh, is this people spamming it with negative reviews?
Because they're doing the Amazon thing.
They're spamming it with negative reviews because they're pissed about the server lockout.
And Ray Iannami says, yes, people who bought the PC version claim it's like playing a console FPS on a PC.
Well, don't buy it, and don't let us catch you on Steam playing the game and get screenshots of it, because that says way more than a silly 1.5 average on some site I don't even read anyway ever will.
I don't know what else to say about that.
Red Entertainment says, of these three major releases recently, which is the best?
Uncharted 2, The Ballad of Gay Tony, or Modern Warfare 2?
See, I haven't played any of those games.
Yeah, it just depends on the person you ask.
Certainly those are all games that are going to be up there when we talk about Game of the Year.
Maybe not so much Gay Tony because it's an expansion of last year's game, but...
If you're talking about which one do I have the most hype for, I really want to check out Uncharted 2 because that just seems like the game I would enjoy most out of the three.
But that's just me.
I think they're just different games.
It really depends on the type of gamer it is.
BlueSwim tweets, what do you think of Crush 40 of Sonic Adventure fame coming to the Rock Band Network?
I hadn't heard, but I guess it was inevitable that some of these video game related bands are going to come out through the Rock Band Network.
That's pretty cool.
Also, any thoughts on Steven Tyler leaving Aerosmith?
He's not going to leave Aerosmith.
It's all for show.
They're fighting like any family does after a while.
He had a diva tantrum.
Exactly.
He had a diva tantrum.
They'll work it out.
They'll probably be on break for a little while, but they'll bring it out.
They were on a break.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So yeah, this is the season for Child's Play, obviously the holiday season.
So definitely check out some of the stuff they're doing.
I'm just looking at this Desert Bus tweet, which is Desert Bus, D-E-S-E-R-T Bus on Twitter.
It is the Desert Bus for Hope Charity.
I wonder if this is the same thing that they did from last year where they actually sat and played that Desert Bus game.
on the feed.
I guess they are.
DesertBus.org.
You can actually go and look at the feed and watch them play this incredibly boring freaking game.
But it's all for a good cause.
Why don't you play a better game for a good cause?
That's my thing.
I mean, it's like, seriously, if you're going to do it anyway, just play a better game.
Well, I think it goes back to that whole thing, like, people like to pay to watch other people be tortured.
Well, then they should play, what was it, that, uh... The, uh...
Thank you for watching!
TigerClaw sends us one that says Modern Warfare 2 is banned in Russia and actually sent us a link here to a website that talks about console versions of Modern Warfare 2 have been banned in Russia and it's due to the content of the No Russian mission and that's the controversial airport massacre level and I guess the Russian government didn't like that.
Raised the ire of the Russian gaming public as well as some politicians.
In Soviet Russia, gameplay you.
All right, let's move on with some more stories here.
Loki, start us off with a story about Gran Turismo.
Yes, Gran Turismo, the game that will just never come out, and now it's just taking even longer because they're saying that it's being held up for marketing reasons, which is retarded.
Just say development, okay?
Not marketing, because then that just says, oh, yeah, we could release it, but we're going to be assholes.
So Gran Turismo 5...
We will release Gran Turismo 5 March in Japan, but for other regions it has not been decided yet.
and this is asked by Motoring Magazine what the holdup was in the western release of the game.
That's more depending on Sony Computer Entertainment America's marketing decisions.
What is...
The problem with just releasing a game and then marketing it.
Why does it have to be marketed right out the gate?
Are day one numbers that critical to a game's success?
Yeah, but also you have to figure that I'm not positive if it falls with them.
But at the same time, they're going to be having God of War 3 coming out, at least in the U.S.
That's supposed to be sometime in March.
So perhaps they're going to try to...
Sandbag the next year numbers by releasing it in the first quarter of their financial 2010 year.
Or 2011, I don't know how they really count it.
Usually a lot of the game companies, their financial year starts either in April or at the end of March.
That's why you'll see the first big push for games sandbagged into March.
All right.
Well, moving on to the games that are a lot closer to its release.
1 vs. 100, of course, had its early first season happen and then the games kind of disappeared for a little while.
But guess what?
Season 2 is starting November 19th at 5 o'clock Pacific.
1 vs. 100 extended play begins then to get you all warmed up for Season 2.
More than a half a million people competed in the 15-week beta season and they're trying to get even more people to show up for Round 2.
Extended Play, I guess, is now going to have themed trivia every weeknight, although I assume they'll still have kind of some general trivia, too.
And then, of course, the more Extended Play you play, apparently you have a better chance of being picked as one of the mob or even the one themselves, and you get to compete for actual prizes!
Woo!
Two million Microsoft points, apparently, were given away during the first season.
No, you get Microsoft Space Bucks.
It's not really cash, but in Microsoft's world, it's cash.
Oh, it's not like Smash TV.
So, there you go.
More money, more prizes.
I love it.
You know what?
As much as we're kind of making fun of it now, this actually is, of sorts, kind of like a groundbreaking game and I think is one of the huge things that Xbox 360 has going for it right now that no other system has.
My only wish is that they would do more games.
Like, why another season of 1 vs. 100?
How about some, like, Price is Right or Press Your Luck or, I don't know, you know, I understand 1 vs. 1.
Price is Right would be so awesome.
It would be amazing.
Amazeballs, as they say.
But I'll take 1 vs. 100 Season 2.
Everybody loves a good trivia game.
It'll be a lot of fun.
DarkSakura, any plans to join in on 1 vs. 100 Season 2?
Nope.
Well, fine.
I'll play by myself.
I have other stuff to play.
Like what?
Like a game that's coming out on the 8th of December over here in the U.S.
Yes.
Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
WeMake Flashlight
and um well there's no combat in it but the um the cool thing though that Climax is keeping is um all the stuff that Akira Yamaoka did for the music so that's going to be really happy um I'm just really really looking forward to it I think it's going to be fantastic and it better scare the crap out of me just saying it was one of the more fun demos I played at uh um E3 so I'm excited about it
DarkSakura.com
But see, seriously though, boy in his blob, no advertising, 9,200 units.
I mean, we could easily do that with President Cat.
This is why, again, I heard those stories about President Cat only selling 100 copies, and I know I went off on the last show we had.
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry.
Like, if a game like Boy in His Blob sells 9,200 in this country, I can't believe President Cat only sold 100 units.
And by the way, there was an awesome article on Kotaku.
I don't want to talk about President Cat every week on the show, but
Kotaku did an awesome piece that kind of called out those sites that were showing like the pictures with nobody in them where you could clearly see there were barricades so the booth just wasn't open yet fucking called those sites out by showing another picture later in the day that had a lot of people there and like basically kind of saying like well all these sites are just misrepresenting what's going on although granted President Cat probably wasn't in the top 50 sales figures well I mean I don't think any of us really thought it was going to be
But neither was Boy and his blob, that's for sure.
And over there, I'm sure, the fact that they actually had a booth and were doing signings or whatever, that's more than you can say that big buck hunting or buck fever is going to do.
Buck fever is going to sell a lot because people are like, oh, hunting game, me buy.
That's exactly what they say, too, at Walmart.
Well, with President Cat, people are going to be like, oh my god, cute cat game, and they're going to buy that.
And that's what's going to happen.
Boy and his blob, they're like, uh, uh, blob?
No, boy?
I like boys.
No, I don't like boys.
That's wrong, you know?
So...
Where in the hell were you going with that, Loki?
I don't even know.
That's funny.
No, but again, I love that they called out those sites.
What are you guys trying to start?
Really?
Know your facts before you report on them.
And there were some pretty big sites that were running this story that this big failure of a launch event or whatever happened.
Thanks for watching!
Everybody fucking loves cats!
It's just the effort.
And a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, don't put any effort out there.
They expect everybody else to kind of just sell it for them.
Anyway, I just want to give major props to Kotaku for calling those people out that ran that story.
Think twice before you dish out your haterade, folks.
Think twice.
Anyhow, Loki, next story.
Yes, so the iPhone gets all sorts of crazy games, and there's a new one now that has you in the role of a firefighter called Firefighter 360, and it's actually kind of an augmented reality game.
It will create fires.
DarkSakura.com
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
So although this game sounds a little cheesy, I think the whole idea that it exists in the first place is kind of cool.
And someone asked, what happens when you point it at real fire?
Does the fire catch fire?
Nice.
That's crazy.
Deep.
That's kind of like that question about what happens when a tree falls in the woods or something.
It goes, ah!
Is that it that's going on in the iPhone world, Loki?
Well, there's other things.
And this is actually something more of Jamie's Alley, though.
R-Type is coming to the iPhone.
Woo-hoo!
Or iPod Touch, I guess.
It's basically... I don't know.
It looks kind of neat.
And they're basically collaborating with Irem Software Engineering, I guess, the company that put it out.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Apple, if they want more games, they should just release something that plugs into the bottom that gives you a little controller.
How hard would that be?
How hard would that be?
Not very.
Exactly.
But then I guess the whole thought would be, well, not everybody would have one, so then these games wouldn't be open to everybody.
Well, you know, have, like, control scheme choices or something.
I don't know.
Have it detect if it's there and use that.
If not, it uses the on-screen thing.
I just think gaming on the iPhone could be so much better if there were, like, more to control with than just the touchscreen, because, you know, there's only so much you can do with your fat thumb.
Trust me, I know from experience.
DarkSakura.com
Out of the Box
Well, anyhow, of course, Moonwalker was a pretty epic game.
It was in the arcade and then, of course, on the Sega Genesis.
I'm imagining that this is the Sega Genesis version that's going to come over, but, of course, they do have arcade games emulatable on the Wii.
It's going to be the Genesis version.
Yeah, because I don't think they have any Sega games.
No, they do, actually.
Didn't Golden Axe come out on the emulator thing?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This is going to go the way of my Excitebike review.
You'll download it, play it for 10 minutes, and go, God, Moonwalker was pretty fucking awesome, but I'm already bored of it.
And then you'll never play it again, like a lot of virtual console games.
But it won't matter, because Nintendo and Sega have your money.
Moonwalker was kind of neat.
It was different, but I don't know if it's aged well.
I think it's probably more of just cashing in on Michael Jackson's death, which is kind of sad, but a lot of people are doing it.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us.
Yep, um, actually just one from Spazinator.
Alrighty then.
It's long.
Well, it's just one.
Hi folks, I was initially going to call in about this subject tonight, but after seeing your tweet asking for mail, I decided to email you instead.
This email will be a first for me on your show for one single reason.
You see, despite the fact that I've been a fan of Sony systems since 97, I've decided that it's time to virtually rip Sony a new one.
Suffice to say, based on that last statement,
It is safe for everyone to assume I'm not happy with Sony right now.
Not at all.
And it's all due to one reason.
Their worthless piece of motherfucking POS DRM on their movies slash video downloads.
See, the thing is, I have been sinking good hard money into that service every week for movies, TV shows, etc.
that I had built up a decent collection, backing it all onto an external HDD as I buy it all.
In all, I had sunk several hundred dollars into the video service.
Well, as of this past Friday, all that money went down the drain.
See, here's the thing.
I was about to launch a game and it had to update before I could play it, but the system froze while it was updating, requiring a hard reset.
That, of course, corrupted the game, leaving a large, unusable file on my HDD.
So the kicker was, I couldn't delete it by highlighting it, pushing triangle, and selecting delete, thus requiring me to reformat my HDD to get rid of it, which I did.
I started redownloading my games as per usual and tried putting my video content back onto my internal HDD and watch it.
Here's the so-called good part.
I could transfer the videos back, but the DRM was all fouled up and the videos were unplayable.
As common sense would suggest, I called Sony and explained to the rep what happened.
Unfortunately, the response I got back was less than optimal, to put it lightly.
To paraphrase, they said I was shit out of luck and had to buy everything all over again.
I have to say it, but this is 100% pure, unadulterated, grade A fucking horseshit.
I love that term.
On one hand, I can sympathize with the fact that they want to curtail any kind of piracy, which is fine, but this could have been handled very differently and in a better manner.
I'm reasonably sure that they kept records of what each customer purchases, at least for their own bookkeeping purposes.
Also, obviously, for videos, one can only have one system activated at one time, so it's not like I could share these videos if I wanted to, not that I would, mind you.
Frankly, it kills me that I've been supporting them for so long and sunk so much money into that.
In the end all, I practically get a fucky from them and get spat in the face and kicked in the junk.
This really is making me seriously consider becoming a Rabid360 fanboy.
So in closing, and in the event that Sony is listening to the live broadcast or the podcast, I have to say this.
Fuck you and fuck the drama initiative sharks that you...
rode in on and subsequently jumped.
If Sony wants to keep me as a customer and avoid some serious negative PR, I seriously suggest they fix this issue ASAP.
This email was brought to you by Sony's Borked DRM, thus rendering this email unreadable.
I will say one thing.
It's not with Sony, but with Apple.
When I had to completely reboot my iPhone and lost everything I downloaded since... Well, let's see.
I did it in...
February and lost everything since November the year before and when I called in because they keep a record of all of my purchases I explained to them what happened I said yeah I was updating my iPhone for the first time in four months and it's like okay well we'll just reauthorize everything up to the last date of your last update and they did that and so it was just those things that they set up for me to queue to redownload why can't Sony do something like that it's fucking Sony that
is interesting.
I've not heard a lot like that.
I'm kind of sitting here a little bit in awe because I was listening to the first half of the email.
I was kind of sitting here going, well, you just need to call Sony and then they reset things because I think that's what Microsoft does.
Granted, I don't know so much about the video end of things.
I just know that they do that with the games is that they can reset the licenses.
Hell, you can do it yourself.
I think once a year you can reset your licenses.
same thing with Apple does something very similar like you know if you have to reinstall Windows or whatever and you get five plays per account or whatever you know this is they don't even sell music with DRM anymore anyway they got rid of it but for the DRM music that you still have you get like up to five computers I don't know
Regardless, I'm kind of sitting here in shock hearing this story.
This is a little bit surprising to me that I haven't heard this before.
But granted, I don't know a lot of people that use the video marketplace so heavily.
I don't think there's a lot of people that are really into the digital distribution.
I know...
you've called into the show several times talking about various animes and stuff so you know I know you're a heavy user of this so this is kind of surprising to me so I think you've done a good first step by starting to get the word out there that this is going on the way I see it you have a couple of options from here you can call Sony back
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
maybe try to get a clearer answer about what their policy is on it because you know I'm hearing that the rep told you that you were shit out of luck but I just as a consumer activist if you will that has a podcast I want to know a little more about the why why did they tell you that you were shit out of luck your other options once you've figured that out and once you have a really good solid reason you understand their policy you can do one of two things or you can do both
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
that Sony does say you're shit out of luck for something you legally purchased yourself when you had to fix something that they broke, right?
He said his drive corrupted, right?
Yeah.
So that's... And he had to do a hard reset and it corrupted his game data.
So he had the only way to get rid of it because it wouldn't delete was to reformat it.
Um...
or you could, and if you want, you could try to get your story out there a little more.
Once you kind of know, understand the policies a little more, email some of your favorite game blogs, see who might run the story, especially if you do end up sending a complaint to Better Business Bureau, you could see what happens.
Now, granted, there's also other things to check out here, and this is where our chat room's piping up.
Something very big to consider here.
Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, but why should Sony let them play it again?
A store does not replace your disc if you lose or scratch it.
And certainly that's a valid devil's advocate argument, is that, you know, if you just damage the data, you're shit out of luck if it were a Blu-ray disc that you dropped on the floor.
It was an accident, but you dropped it, you broke it, you're screwed, right?
This is due to their...
I know, there's just something where I totally respect where Brad's coming from with that statement.
There's just something about what Spazinator's saying that just doesn't sound fair to me.
Isn't this part of the reason we do digital distribution?
Yeah.
The advantage is supposed to be that I have a digital version of it that doesn't get damaged the way a physical copy does.
We always talk about the pros and cons about why should people have physical versions instead of digital versions, but we don't often talk about why should people have digital versions instead of physical ones.
And again, if Apple and Microsoft have these competitive DRM management schemes, then Sony should be taking a task for having one that is less than ideal, I suppose.
So, very interesting.
I don't know what else to think of this I would say call back, talk to a supervisor if you can't hear from the supervisor get their complaint address and write them a letter make sure also when you talk to their people that you document names, what time you called you want to know who you spoke to who their supervisor is you want to record all of that because the next step after writing them a letter is if you get nothing from that go to the Better Business Bureau
and for the I just would like to know what is their policy and you know I could go on to Sony's website and actually read the little blah blah blahs and probably figure it out for myself I don't have time to do that while trying to do a live radio show but I would kind of like our listeners to try and figure that out for the next week and maybe we'll see some emails on that what exactly is their policy when it comes to this stuff like just the whole you're shit out of luck response I mean just I'm a customer service trainer that's not the type of thing you tell a customer ever is that you're shit out of luck there's always something
Even if that something is, here is our complaint address if you don't like the policy.
This is our policy, and if you don't agree with it, here's an address to complain about it.
That is better than, well, fuck you.
You know what I mean?
Just what I'm hearing, just as the customer service trainer in me is crying a little bit.
So...
Keep in mind, I used to take escalated calls at my work.
I used to talk to all the pissed off people.
I know that there's something that can be done.
If you want to keep someone's business, because keep in mind, I'm going into a little bit of the world of business, and maybe this is something you can use, Rob.
Actually, I remember going through a couple of training seminars that were called A Complaint is a Gift.
and was talking about for every eight people that have a bad experience, at least two of them will talk about it.
Two of them will talk to eight more people.
You know what I mean?
And they'll keep passing it around by word.
For every, I think...
I've heard the same thing, just not with numbers.
I think the numbers always seem to change.
That principle.
But you're also going to run into the person who is an activist.
The person who's going to take the initiative and get up and write the letter.
The Jamie.
I actually adopted that whole attitude after taking that seminar.
I'll tell you this, if any place has given me bad service for any reason, if I know specifically that they haven't done things that they should do, I will say something about it.
Because if no one says anything about it to the company, how are they going to know to fix it?
How are they going to know that maybe so-and-so rep screwed up until you call them on it?
I think there's not enough people who call other people on their bullshits.
and to be fair if I know we have had people that work for we have been mentioned on the official Sony Playstation 3 Twitter before this show on the official Twitter yes
because we've had friends that work at Sony.
So please, by all means, Sony, the floor is yours.
If we are misrepresenting these facts, if this emailer had a bad experience and needs to be corrected, please contact us.
You know how.
There's many different ways to do it.
State your side of the case.
If we are misrepresenting you, we want to make it right.
But on the other hand, if your policy sucks, we also want to call you out on it.
Sorry, but that's what we do.
So by all means, let's hear both sides of the story.
Okay, well, that's pretty much what I was getting to next, is that, you know, there's always two sides of a story, but again, they don't know a situation exists until it's brought to their attention.
Right, and this could, unfortunately, be just a bad experience with the customer service rep.
And if that is their policy, this could be a step to changing it.
Who knows?
We'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, um, is that it for Mailbag then, for now?
That's the one and only.
Alright, well, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com That was a good email.
It was a good discussion.
So, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com if you want to, um, and he always gets through on the phone, so I'm sure he's going to call in later to talk about it.
So, it'll come up again later, I'm sure, but it was an interesting discussion.
And I would be very curious
If you run a game blog out there, I'm too lazy to do this, so here you can take this story and just say it was inspired by this show.
Throw us a bone.
I would like to see the DRM policies of the various companies side by side.
I would like someone to make that nice little chart that says, here's what it is with Microsoft, here's what it is with Nintendo for their limited video service in Japan, which I think they have.
Here's what it is to the US.
I would like to see that kind of side by side so the consumer can be better informed going into this.
I would like to kind of see that.
Anyhow.
I agree.
All right.
Let's get into the FUs of the week.
And I was supposed to have a story and I neglected to link it.
So I've got to bring it up real quick.
So FU starts to me for not being prepared tonight.
DarkSakura
My F.U.
goes to pissy attitudes.
That's it.
Loki, F.U.
to the stores that think that it's necessary to break street to compete with GameStop and other stores.
You just suck and make my job harder.
My F.U.
just goes to the swine flu.
I mean, really.
Need I say more?
You heard the first 20 minutes of tonight's show.
Finally, we found that story that's supposed to inspire tonight's FUs.
You remember this came from a couple weeks ago.
Do you remember hearing about the raid where the police guys busted into the house and started playing the Nintendo Wii during the raid?
No.
Maybe this was the show you weren't here because you did miss a show or two because you had other things going on.
There was actually police that broke into a house and started playing the Wii that was there.
Seriously, really?
You're professionals and you're sitting there playing the Wii or whatever on the job?
Well, apparently what happens is that as
As punishment, did these officers get fired?
Did they get suspended without pay?
No, they're going to have to go through some retraining.
The officers even, those names are being withheld because they are undercover police.
And the company is saying they are learning from their mistakes.
So in other words, these officers that were screwing around playing the Wii on the job got a slap on the wrist and are getting sent back to training.
And as a trainer...
You know what, no, for the sake of separating my job from this, I'm not going to get into it.
I will tell you this.
There's certain things about that excuse that really strike a nerve with me, and that's all I can say.
I have to keep my work and personal separate, though.
Well, then I will talk about my experience.
Go for it.
As a person who is required to take a certain number of training classes a year, I think that they're just going to be more inconvenienced than anything else to go to a class to learn stuff that they already know.
There's a difference between knowing something and caring enough to put it into practice.
That's my point.
It's just going to be, oh, we have to sit in the class for a day.
You know.
There is so much I want to say, but can't.
I just can't.
I'm sorry.
Say after the show so you can get it out.
After the show, I would love to share it with you personally, but I can't talk about it on a platform where people... I don't know who has access to it and who could share it with who.
But there's just so much I could say about this.
I will say this, though, and I will tell you this because I do know our trainers and I know the hard work that they put into it.
That's why I usually at least pay attention, but all of them know...
But do you think these guys are going to sit there and pay attention?
Probably not.
They're dicks.
So this is probably a waste of everyone's time, right?
Yeah.
Anyhow, let's move on with some other stories.
I don't think playing a Wii is cause for suspension, but still.
At the same time, though, like, really, you're there to do a job.
I think the bad press for the police itself is punishment enough, I suppose.
Might be bad enough, yeah.
I suppose.
All right, Loki.
All right.
Anyways, so this is kind of cool because, of course, you know, huge Grand Theft Auto fan.
Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC just recently got an update to, I believe, live.
The Games for Windows Live also kind of got an update as well.
And with that, the download content for The Lost and Damned, the achievements are showing up now on Game for Windows Live for...
So that can only mean one thing, that the download content that once was exclusive to the Xbox 360 is coming to PC.
And that makes sense, because if you think about it, if Microsoft paid to have that download content made, or at least paid for the exclusivity, Games for Windows is still Microsoft, so perhaps we will see both episodes eventually released for the PC, and probably sooner than later.
That's pretty sweet.
Sorry, PS3 owners, no word on that.
Interesting.
Although, it could open the door to that, possibly?
Not necessarily.
I mean, they could literally port this in a heartbeat.
I mean, everything that's on there can be, you know, it's a multi-platform anyways.
It could be ported, like, seriously super quick.
Because they already have the hardware done.
I mean, the engine's already done.
They don't really have to change too much.
But they're just not gonna because they're under contract.
And especially if, you know, $50 million says, you know,
That kind of buys some time, I should say.
It probably will never make it over to the PS3.
Well, dudes, I got one more story for you.
Dudes, do you like Barbie?
Of course you do, because how else is the Xbox Live Marketplace selling Avatar clothing?
Because that's basically what it is.
It's Barbie for dudes.
And dudettes, of course, too.
But hey, some people like to buy these clothes and dress their own little character and buy the Malibu Beach backgrounds and whatever else you can get on Xbox Live Marketplace.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Just so you know.
Also of interest, a Da Vinci's Flying Machine.
If you want to get that.
240 Microsoft points for that.
Well, that's also from Assassin's Creed 2.
I actually kind of want that.
I don't know.
I kind of... You know what?
I can see...
I can sit here and make fun of this stuff a little bit.
Granted, I'm no better.
I spent $10 on a Warcraft bet this week, so I'm really no better.
But I do find this stuff to be a little silly.
And even I can admit, what I did was silly too.
But I just think this whole buying for your virtual costume, when a lot of games don't even really use them, I mean, I guess a few do, like Guitar Hero does and stuff, maybe more will next year or what have you, but pretty soon it's all going to be Natal, so you will be in the game anyway, not your avatar.
So, I don't know.
Whatever, though.
There you go.
Anyhow, some folks in chat are complaining that the stream has died, but I am seeing... Oh, we did drop for a minute.
But we're reconnected now, and we're good.
So I guess the stream did drop for a minute.
I don't know what happened there.
Technical glitch!
It happens.
Don't know what to do.
I was downloading all that porn.
Sorry, Rob.
There you go.
Knew it!
And again, live folks, keep in mind there's not a lot we can do when the stream goes down.
It does usually tend to come back right away.
So our biggest advice to our live listeners would be just wait patiently 30 seconds and reload.
You usually won't miss too much.
You just miss me making jokes about how the Xbox Live Marketplace is like Barbie for dudes.
That's all.
All right.
You didn't miss much.
Alright, let's get into the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give us a call.
Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
Go ahead and give us a call.
Speaking of technical difficulties, I hate the new Skype.
If you've been listening in the past few weeks, Skype got a makeover the last couple months and I hate it.
I miss the old one so, so, so much.
I miss the first version of Skype we used several years ago.
I would see everybody that was calling in so everybody would have a fair shot of being on the show because I could actually pick callers that I didn't recognize were calling in and you rotate it a little bit.
I don't even get that now in Skype.
Now Skype likes to randomly drop calls and do all this stuff.
I just, I hate it.
We all hate it.
Hey, what up?
This is X-Link calling from Melbourne, Florida.
Was that in your neck of the woods?
Did that happen?
No, it didn't happen around me.
It happened in a different part of town.
But it's great to know that these wonderful cops who get sworn to duty have nothing better to do than raid a house and play a Wii.
And the fix is more training, is the fix.
Yes.
Yes.
Not suspension, not getting fired, but more training.
Because clearly, they were not trained properly the first time.
Yes.
This is how you bowl a 300 game in Wii.
So the responsibility falls upon the trainers of the company to do the... Never mind.
Go ahead.
What's on your mind?
Anyways, I called because I want to call about a PSP game that recently came out, but before I do that, Spazinator, quick tip.
I don't know why he couldn't have a copy, like, hooked up his PS3 to the...
PC or through his PSP and then copy it onto his PC because every time when I get something new downloaded from the PlayStation Store, I always try to make a copy available on my hard drive just in case if something would happen or crash, I would have that backup as a storage
I think that's what he said he did.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's kind of a weird situation.
Yeah, it's very weird.
That's why I'm kind of sitting here going, you know, whereas I think Spazinator has some very valid concerns.
I feel like there's a piece of the puzzle.
I need to hear Sony's policy on this because I feel like that piece is missing and we might be misrepresenting their policy a little bit and I don't want to do that either.
I don't see why you could do it as long as you have the idea and everything.
I don't see why there would be a problem with it.
I'm very curious to see how this further develops.
I think he'll do it.
I think he'll follow up on it and let us know.
Well, I had an interesting situation earlier on.
I'm trying to make this quick, too.
I bought Mass Effect a while back for the PC and unfortunately didn't have the CD code, though I could have easily gone on Torrent and got a no CD fix and stuff like that.
I really wanted to have it legalized.
I actually went through the EA website, talked to somebody through the chat, which was absolutely horrid.
The guy told me just to call the manufacturer and get a key from them, which I don't think he understood that it wasn't a download.
Um, so I ended up calling the, um, the, uh, long distance phone number for the tech support, uh, was put on hold for 20 minutes, got through to a guy.
The guy was very nice, very civilized.
I explained to him very nicely my problem and explained to him about it and, um, gave him the, you know, and we went through all the steps and he told me, he gave me, uh, he sent me an email.
He said on the email, he goes, go to this page.
He goes, what's your response?
And he goes, set up some, uh, photos of the booklet and show that the fact that you didn't get a CD key.
Um,
Um, did it, and the very next day they sent me a CD, uh, another person from the tech support sent me a CD key so I can actually have a legit version of my game.
Which was very cool, instead of paying like 10 or 20 bucks for a CD key for it.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm not at liberty to say specifically people I know that were affected by it, but some names you might remember from the shows yesteryear.
So it's very unfortunate, and we hope for the best for our fans.
Definitely.
I know one or two from the Ted Braun, but like you said, too, I'm not going to mention any names either.
Obviously, we want to respect their privacy and wish them the best of luck because layoffs are never any fun.
Most definitely.
I've been playing a game for the pinball.
It's the Pinball Heroes.
It's the $3.99 one that recently came out on the PlayStation Network.
It's a very good game.
$3.99 pinball.
I like it very much.
The only problem I had with it was the fact that...
for each of the tables it's $3.99 but it has great scoring system it keeps a little achievement I think there's trophies you can get for it too if you hook it up to the PS3 through their trophy system
Um, but, um, it keeps on only scoring for not only for local when you play, you know, the, uh, the PlayStation, but also you can go against other people from around the globe that has the game on the network.
It will upload your score and go against other people's score, which is really awesome.
Um, it's, it, the only problem I had with it was the multi-ball was the screen would kind of like zoom outward, um,
and it would get kind of the table would get much smaller but when it's done it will zoom back in but if you're in multi-ball and you really have a hard time seeing I can see that being like a partly of a problem seeing like the little balls and like guys that goes around and hit stuff but other than that I've been having a lot of fun with it and for a four-hour game that's not that bad.
All right.
Well, we appreciate the perspective and all that.
So I'm going to go ahead and let you go, though, so we can get some more calls.
But thank you for your – you had a hometown buffet of stories tonight, but I like it.
I like hearing all the different stuff.
So some reviews and customer service goods and bads all rolled into one.
I just thought it was ironic.
It was this whole customer service thing, and then I had the customer service this week.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you, Gil.
Take care, and, hey, have fun on World of Warcraft.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for that crack.
Hey, you're welcome.
I'm going to win myself out of it.
Good luck.
Alright, that was X-Link here on Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll take a couple more calls.
Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku
Saku, you're the type of guy that's into Modern Warfare, right?
Well, yeah, and I mean, I would play it if they had dedicated servers on the PC, then I would have justification to spend money on it.
Oh, so you're one of the protesters that is actually protesting.
Yes, I mean, I have the money right now, and even if I didn't have the money, I wanted to see how this would play out first.
Just so I could see how this new matchmaking would work on the PC.
And lo and behold, it works just like the 360, works like the console versions.
Well, props to you sticking to your guns and actually meaning it and actually sticking to the cause.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's almost like the Halo effect.
Have you ever seen how the subsequent Halo releases, like Halo 2 and 3, and you see people lining up for midnight launches?
It's kind of that.
When you have a game that managed to develop a big following on the first type of game, the first non-World War 2 game in the Call of Duty franchise, and yet that game managed to get Halo numbers for its sequel.
which it took a Bungie 3 just to get that amount whereas Infinity War just got it on the second try.
It was a surprise hit.
No one would have thought Modern Warfare would outdo the whole Call of Duty series.
That was completely unexpected.
I bought Halo 3 just for shits and giggles I had my 360 back then
But to be honest, I never got into the campaign mode at all.
I was just trying to do multiplayer because I don't play shooters on consoles.
I just play it on keyboard and mouse.
A bit old-fashioned.
Alright, but to summarize though, you still say that folks shouldn't get Modern Warfare 2, at least not on the PC, until they address what the fans want.
In other words, if they...
Basically, if they want a good single-player experience with the keyboard and mouse, then by all means, they should buy it.
But, you know, you have to really stick to your guns if you really want to wait out until Infinity Ward decides to come to their senses and release something for the community that it apparently backstabbed when killing off the dedicated servers.
You know buddy, I'm sure I don't even have to ask, but what about this rumor that they might allow the dedicated servers later on for more money?
Well, that depends on whether or not that actually comes to fruition.
Whether or not it's just a rumor, so you'd rather take it with a grain of salt.
What I heard recently was that the hackers managed to outdo them already.
They already had dedicated server support and a console.
The little console that you hit whenever you press the tilde key on the keyboard, just like any other first-person shooter.
Now you have...
Someone managed to hack the game and add console support, dedicated server as a proof of concept.
No surprise.
None.
None.
I mean, the hacker community, when they set out to do something, they fucking do it.
So I have to say I'm not surprised at all.
Basically, it won't be that long before Infinity Ward gets steamed to add that in the blacklist for back.
And then all the folks that run the hacked version get banned.
Um, Zaku, I know you may not have called in.
I made you kind of talk about Modern Warfare 2.
I don't know if that's originally why you called in tonight, but before we let you go, I wanted to let you get out whatever you wanted to actually call in and talk about tonight.
Oh man, I'm trying to basically play DJ Hero for the first time last night under the influence of alcohol.
It was a little bit of a transition since I'm more of a 2DX kind of guy.
But, you know, it's going to take a while.
I mean, I don't see it as a game I would normally play on my own.
It's because most of the songs are of a genre that I don't listen to.
I mean, there are some good ones.
you know the stuff that with Tiesto and Paul Van Dyke for example and even the one where Tears for Fears and Pajano is like you know mixed up but it's really not like 2DX at all is it?
of course I kind of see it that way because it's basically in this game you actually scratch and you actually move a crossfader so I guess in a sense Activision made it more realistic yeah it's different alright Zaku we gotta let you go buddy but thanks so much for the call as always and take care okay
Have a good one.
Later, you too.
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to get in.
Maybe we'll take one more call.
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
Not really, but here's what I got.
They're going to be doing possibly, well, there's a possible spin-off they're talking about doing for Modern Warfare starring, and I had to laugh because the character's name is Ghost, so it'd be like a Modern Warfare Ghost character.
StarCraftGoes, but not.
But not.
Anyways.
Hey, we got a phone call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Good evening, OU across the ocean.
OU in the land of the free or so we're to say.
The state that falls into the ocean in 2012.
That's where we are.
Oh, what the hell?
We're all dead.
Oh, hello there, OLR.
This is that one, Aki Ripper.
But John Cusack survives, so the hell with the rest of us.
Aki Ripper, it's been forever since we've heard from you.
What is on your mind, buddy?
Oh wow, what's on my mind?
Once again, I've given a reason actually to buy a Wii since, well, I saw footage of that new Super Mario Bros.
And, well, since I still actually haven't bought a Wii, even though I actually have like four games, actually already have four games, so... Wait, so you already have the games, but you just didn't have the Wii?
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
That's kind of the backwards way of doing it, but okay.
It really was like, I was at that point of like, there was like this plenty of games that I'm really interested in, but I either choose to buy the console and have no games, or buy the games or have no console.
That's why you're the crazy Swedish guy.
That's no problem.
Once again, it's quite fun in a way since I'm the kind of collector in a way.
That's cool, though.
That's cool.
Let me ask you, though.
And having things on my shelf is like a bonus.
Let me ask you, though, about New Super Mario Bros., because obviously the game just came out over here today.
I was actually kind of surprised.
I haven't touched the game myself yet outside of my short experience with it at E3, and you don't judge a game based off an E3 build.
But I'm kind of surprised because, of course, the gaming community did a little bit of backlash with the game with the whole easy button stuff that's going around, although we've talked a little more about how that's actually integrated into the game, and it kind of sounds like it might be interesting.
But the other thing, I was looking at some of the Metacritic scores for this.
The game's getting glowing reviews.
The game is probably going to end up on people's top ten list when all is said and done at the end of the year.
Many critics...
The reason I'm basing, in a way though, the video I saw was on Giant Bomb, and they were playing 4 player co-op, and that looked hilarious fun, really, so, that had me like stoked for it, so.
When I actually have three of my friends come over to play video games, it'll be great.
But my only concern is, is single-player mode fun, too?
Because sometimes, I have to play video games by myself.
In fact, that's most of the time.
Here's another thing, in a way, though, is that, well, the following week, in a way, though, if I get my Wii, I will still be busy, in a kind of way, with the new Sims 3 expansion.
So...
I'm right there with you on that.
You are not alone in this studio with that.
Now, one question, though.
Do you have President Cat sitting on your shelf?
No, I don't.
Unfortunately, not yet.
Speaking of which, since we have a mod-friendly one around your block, so to say, and...
I was wondering, is it, since I heard about the 360 bannings and such, well, I own a 360, but I have no plans whatsoever on shipping that one, but I was thinking about getting a shipped, getting a flashed or shipped Wii.
Is that like any, how does that work out, so to say?
Loki, do you recommend people do this to their Wii's or is this a risk you don't want to take or what?
There's mods now that seriously, you open the Wii up and you have to have a tri-wing screwdriver to do that but that's easy to get.
and DarkSakura.com.
It's very unlikely that you will break it up, especially when you're not soldering it.
I either solder my chip in, and from a person who can't solder for shit, soldering hair-thin wires on there, I'm surprised it works still.
But it does, and if I can do it, then anybody can do it.
So, yeah, it's seriously a new board, so they have some that literally will just plug in.
Was it worth it?
You have to step away from the I-did-it-because-I-can mentality for a little bit.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Interesting.
Yeah, well, once again, for the clarification whatsoever, I'm not really interested in pirating games.
Well, still, you can do it for playing region free stuff.
When you do such a thing, from my point of view, is to buy imports, right?
Yeah, like I said, I played President Cat on it.
I also, back in the day, I imported, you know, Smash Brothers.
That's right, you had the Japanese Smash Brothers.
Yeah, I remember that when you premiered that on, what was it, Uprade?
No, it wasn't Uprade.
It was Justin.TV or something.
It was either our Ustream at the time, or no, I'm sorry, we've never been on Ustream.
We actually have a Ustream channel, we just never used it.
It's Justin.TV, or what was before that?
Uprader 11.
Uprader 11, that's the one.
All games was all...
Up On That Channel
I don't know what plans that is for the network.
We usually find out about that stuff after it's already set in motion.
But certainly when I read that tweet, I was like, oh, that's pretty exciting for them.
Because I kind of miss having that spot to...
The best E3 I still think was the year that we had the arena and that whole thing going on.
I don't know about you guys, that was my favorite E3.
It was also the one where we probably worked the hardest and were the most tired afterwards, but just getting to all convene afterwards with the other podcasters, very much like us, in that really fun, almost frat house kind of place that I'm sure just lost somebody a shitload of money.
Poor Ron.
Yeah.
But goddamn, it was fun while it lasted.
So anyway, sorry.
Got a little off the tangent there, but it was worth mentioning.
Best of luck to our pals.
Well, what more?
Well, what more?
Well, it's been released like more than a few games around, and I still haven't... I have barely, in a way, though, installed Dragon Age and played it for like...
Two minutes in a kind of way.
I don't know how it didn't make the show roll tonight, but I heard about the gay sex in Dragon Age and the lesbian sex and all this stuff.
Can't you have sex with an animal or something in that game?
What?
What?
No, seriously.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not follow up my big story about gay sex in a video game that's not completely tacky with, oh, by the way, you can also have sex with an animal.
You sound like a Prop 8 supporter right now.
That's what you sound like.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
No, I'm kidding.
I don't have anything else.
Let me finish up with Aki Ripper, then we'll talk about Dragon Age.
Before I brought sex into it, what were your thoughts on Dragon Age?
It looks really nice, and, well, you don't need a supercomputer to actually run it, since, well, I run it on mine, and that one isn't...
That one is actually a bit old, but in a way also, my other computer actually, or my primary gaming rig blew up the other month, and well, I had to replace it, and well, I'm up and running once again, so I will...
I have heard glowing reviews on Dragon Age though.
A lot of people are really into this game.
Once I get the time to play it, it will probably be good.
But for...
I was being stupid, actually, the other week also, since I actually bought Borderlands 2.
So I now have plenty of games, and in a way, though, I'm not playing anything, kind of.
You sound like Loki.
That's me.
Okay, Ripper, we've got to let you go, so we wrap up the show.
But thank you so much for calling in, as always, and best of luck with obtaining the Wii and getting your gaming rig up and going again, okay?
Yeah, thank you.
All right, later, dude.
Alright, we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.
Sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but of course you can always send us an email if you didn't get through.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or of course we're on Twitter as well, Twitter.com slash OLR.
Real quickly with last minute stories, I don't know if you had anything else, Loki, but I just want to say about Dragon Age, I did see the scene on YouTube, and you know, I like what they, not just the man on man, but the woman on woman, I saw them both or whatever, and I just like that
It's just kind of there.
And it's a little bit cheesy.
But then again, sex in video games is cheesy.
Well, I'm not positive about the animals.
I read that a long time ago when they were covering it.
I'm like, what?
I haven't seen a YouTube on that.
That sounds like fable.
That sounds like something fable would do.
Yeah.
Anyhow, no, I just... It was funny.
Anyway, but in the end, I'm not going to buy a game just because it has gay sex in it.
I want to buy a good game, so...
It looks like it might actually be... I'm hearing really good things on it.
It's a good game that has gay sex in it.
It's win-win.
Alright, Loki, any other last-minute stories for us?
No, not really.
Not anything I ever want to cover.
I got a text message from a buddy of mine that I guess would qualify as a last minute story who went and saw 2012.
Yet again, all these people going to see 2012.
I know, I don't get it either, Jamie.
I don't get it either.
But Prince of Persia movie trailer from Disney looks fantastic, even better than 2012 itself.
Full theater cheered for it.
That's stupid.
No one cheers for Prince of Persia.
I would cheer if they actually are making a decent video game-related movie, of which I hear Prince of Persia just might be.
It might be.
That just struck me as interesting, though, that the theater would cheer for a trailer.
You're right, you don't hear about that a lot when it's not Harry Potter or one of those.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura DarkSakura
Shopping around, shopping around.
What are you shopping for?
Just looking at stuff.
Porns!
Not porn.
Blue Elf 2, 309.1, jam a card.
He's trying to find you a BurgerTime, Rob.
No, it's not BurgerTime.
And my final thought for the night is, I do want a main cabinet, I think.
I think I want one.
I want to play Miss World New 96 at my own convenience, whatever.
Dude.
That would be the game I would play, too.
You know it.
That's going to be the first game I fire up on that thing.
The 309-in-1 card has Miss World New 96 on there.
Amazing.
I'm surprised it's even included on there.
What is that?
Is that a... It's a card... Is that a super gun?
No, no, no.
It's not a super gun.
I was thinking about building a super gun out of it or building a bar top out of it.
It's basically a JAMA card that has four gigs worth of games on there.
including all the fighting games and all the beat-em-ups and stuff like that, but for some reason they also have Miss Nude World 96 on there, and I'm not sure why, but... Everybody, move your body!
I'm just like, oh, Rob would like that, but, you know.
All right.
Anyhow, that's it.
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show even when we are not always punctual with either the podcast or just being here because we get sick or what have you.
But we do appreciate the support of our fans.
I was actually checking out the listener accounts tonight.
We actually had a lot of people listening earlier on in the first hour before people start to go to bed and so forth.
So thank you guys so much for that and for your continued support of our show.
We really appreciate it.
We'll continue to be here for you guys and be free.
All we always ask is just tell somebody you know about the show.
Help spread the word.
It's word of mouth.
That's what helps an independent podcast survive.
We don't have marketing dollars or advertisements in magazines or billboards or any of that fun stuff or E3 booths.
So please, please continue to tell friends and spread the word about not only what we're doing here on Orange Lounge Radio but what the All Games Network is doing.
Because if you hate our show, you might like one of the other ones on the network might be talking about the games that you're interested in hearing.
it's a win-win situation though continuing to grow independent podcasting because we tell it like it is so we'll be back to do it all again next week barring any outbreaks of malaria or something here in studio so we'll see you guys next week until then I'm Rob she's Jamie he's Loki and we're out
