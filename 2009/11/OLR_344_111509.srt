1
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIII finally gets a release date in the U.S.

2
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: and U.K.

3
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:36,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with 75% less sickness.

5
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:45,600
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,741
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:50,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be joining you for the next three hours with my awesome co-host, always here with me.

8
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Hack, hack, cough, wheeze.

10
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

11
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:03,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you're feeling much better this week than those that heard the show a couple weeks ago, which we'll get into because the story is actually kind of funny.

12
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,053
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:13,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

15
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,235
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing?

16
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:17,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Techmaster Loki, who has to learn how to turn his mic off before we start the show.

17
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the mic off earlier because...

18
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I just turned it off.

19
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Travis had that whole setup in his house.

20
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:47,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what Bobby has in his house, and he does, of course, the show before us, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf on all games.

21
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if he has the whole thing.

22
00:01:50,387 --> 00:02:04,473
[SPEAKER_08]: We have wired mics that just plug into this mixing board very crudely that Shermie the cat has to walk through like she's Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment to get through the cords.

23
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,895
[SPEAKER_05]: She seriously looks up at me and goes, meh.

24
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,296
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

25
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:28,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

26
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Gremlins Live in Those Little Boxes

27
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:58,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

28
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:27,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, we've been doing this ghetto style for seven years, and it's one of those things where if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

29
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,561
[SPEAKER_05]: If it ain't fixed, don't break it.

30
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:29,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

31
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:44,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, so why we weren't here last week, which is funny because I had promised a couple weeks ago on the show that we weren't going to miss any more shows in 2009, which is also funny because you haven't heard the last month worth of podcasts, and it all ties into the same reason.

32
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, it's because Rob had diphtheria and I had malaria.

33
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,212
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but it's close.

34
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:49,833
[SPEAKER_08]: It's close.

35
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:50,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the deal.

36
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:59,035
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were here live a couple weeks ago, and you will hear this on the podcast eventually, we're going to have a big dump this week like we had last month where we'll get all the shows up.

37
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:03,997
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you were here with us live a couple weeks ago, DarkSakura was very ill during the show.

38
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:10,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And we kind of all chalked that up to, well, she has the plague again, which she always seems to get once a year, or a sinus infection.

39
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,999
[SPEAKER_05]: My annual sinus infection.

40
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kicked up all that dust earlier.

41
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

42
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we figured, okay, Jamie is just the sick girl.

43
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody went to high school with one.

44
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:24,243
[SPEAKER_08]: There was that girl who just seemed to get sick all the time, just no matter what.

45
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:30,905
[SPEAKER_05]: My sinus infection is literally an annual thing, and it's always right in the start of November I start getting sick.

46
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,545
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you, Jamie, but you're the sick girl.

47
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,426
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the cootie girl.

48
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:34,586
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

49
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:36,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll hear some cooties.

50
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Shove, shove.

51
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:00,957
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

52
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And she says, oh, what's wrong?

53
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, I don't know.

54
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:19,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just really sick.

55
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:23,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to just make sure I don't have H1N1 or something crazy like that.

56
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:28,477
[SPEAKER_08]: She's all, oh, my dear, because she's an old Filipino lady, so she always says my dear and honey and all those things.

57
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my dear, open your mouth.

58
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:32,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you have a very red mouth.

59
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think you have laryngitis.

60
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,601
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not have H1N1, my dear.

61
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want me to give you the test anyway, my dear?

62
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:40,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, yeah, just for peace of mind, give you the H1N1 test.

63
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:43,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So they shoved the Q-tip up my nose and all that fun stuff.

64
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:46,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it still hurts, but no, it wasn't that bad.

65
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,930
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did all that and I'm thinking, okay, whatever, I have laryngitis.

66
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And she says, if I'm still sick on Thursday, call her and she'll give me an antibiotic.

67
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:56,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still sick on Thursday.

68
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I've missed two days of work at this point.

69
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:01,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So I get an antibiotic and Thursday night was really the worst of it.

70
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the night where I lied down and I thought, oh my God, I...

71
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Like literally, I saw the light.

72
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:20,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when I closed my eyes and was lying there on the couch in my Snuggie with my Star Trek Next Generation movies playing on Blu-ray because that's what I did when I was sick is I watched every single Star Trek Next Generation movie on Blu-ray in my Snuggie.

73
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally shut my eyes and I started to see the light.

74
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:27,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just lying there going, this is awful, this is horrible, whatever I have.

75
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:32,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But finally it started to go away and I'm thinking, oh, antibiotics got rid of what I had.

76
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I must have had a strep throat.

77
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,360
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems to be the most obvious thing that I have.

78
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So finally Saturday goes, Sunday goes.

79
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Monday I go to work because I'm thinking, I've missed four days of work.

80
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of work for somebody who's a trainer, for somebody with, I have a very high work ethic.

81
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like to miss work.

82
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:50,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So I go to work Monday morning.

83
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:52,410
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

84
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my dear, you have H1N1.

85
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Your test came back positive.

86
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:09,184
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking, what?

87
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:13,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I am back at work sick and I had H1N1 this whole time and I didn't even know it.

88
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So it turns out that H1N1 test that she didn't even think I needed came back positive.

89
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:23,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think part of, you know, and no disrespect to my doctor, I didn't have a fever when I went in there.

90
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:24,949
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently I had H1N1.

91
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Prisby asks if your doctor is Ms.

92
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:27,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo.

93
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, actually, she apparently sounds a lot like Ms.

94
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:30,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo.

95
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how old Filipino lady sounds like Ms.

96
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo, but just work with me on this.

97
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:36,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, Rob calls me.

98
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:40,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, one of the first people I call is Jamie because I start to piece it together in my head.

99
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, how the fuck did I get the swine flu?

100
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:45,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody else at Rocky is saying anything about it.

101
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody else seems to be saying it.

102
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking, oh my god, Jamie has these signs.

103
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie gave me the swine flu.

104
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I knew it in my mind.

105
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Jamie's the one that gave me the swine flu.

106
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:57,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm also thinking, oh my god, Matt has a swine flu too and he doesn't know it.

107
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:01,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first people I contact... Yeah, I'm so swine flu-ed out right now.

108
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:02,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell.

109
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Matt, were you sick at all the past couple weeks?

110
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:11,379
[SPEAKER_09]: My throat was kind of scratchy for about five days.

111
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But kind of scratchy as in, hey, that kind of feels scratchy and I get distracted by something else and don't notice it.

112
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,081
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really, though, how it starts.

113
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts in the throat.

114
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was the same with me.

115
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:27,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So somehow Matt, with his Cylon genes or something, was able to avoid the swine flu.

116
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:30,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still saying it's because he eats enough meat that it gives him an immunity.

117
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:31,565
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

118
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate enough swine, see?

119
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:41,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually ended up calling my doctor, well, I talked to the advice nurse at Kaiser.

120
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:44,757
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, oh no, you're coming in, you're coming in.

121
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:55,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So I finally actually talked to my doctor, and we go over all of the symptoms, because he had actually seen me a week before for my sprained ankle, which still, by the way, hurts like a bitch.

122
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:20,897
[SPEAKER_05]: and we know he's like well you know you had all of these symptoms you know you're you had that with your throat you started off with a dry cough you know it's like that's not how your sinus infections tend to go you know he's and a lot of times now they know by the symptoms because they're pretty standard and I ran a fever for me I actually got up to a hundred but that's high for me

123
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,918
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kept running a fever after the fact.

124
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:34,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole big thing for me, what my plague usually is, is if I don't treat a sinus infection or anything sinus related right away, I will always get bronchitis.

125
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last time that it got really bad, I got pneumonia.

126
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was sick for three months.

127
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a nightmare.

128
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:47,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But now he put me on like a week of antibiotics to make sure that I don't get pneumonia again.

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the interesting thing is my doctor's approach was very different than yours.

130
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:54,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they put me on Tamiflu, which a little late for that, right?

131
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever.

132
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got pulled out of work for a week.

133
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I was already over it.

134
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:04,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So was I. Yeah, but I was already two weeks over it is the whole thing.

135
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:05,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

136
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:08,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a big part of it, too, because you kind of talk about that.

137
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will get to talking about video games, but I think this story is hilarious.

138
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping I'd get pulled out of work so I could go.

139
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:14,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan was sick.

140
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:14,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay home.

141
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks before me, Dan was sick.

142
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:21,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you don't catch a sinus infection from somebody.

143
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not contagious.

144
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe Dan started this whole thing.

145
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

146
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:33,827
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got pulled out of work for a week and I was pissed when it happened because I'm thinking like, I'm going to miss nine days of work and I'm trying to teach a class, right?

147
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:34,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, what's the point?

148
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:35,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already over it.

149
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:36,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

150
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss her dearly, I wish she was still here She didn't get to the doctor early enough, did she?

151
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so, no.

152
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:17,979
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't have insurance.

153
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think you mentioned that she eventually was pulled to the doctor to go.

154
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:26,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, that's why my grandmom started having the same symptoms.

155
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to her on Wednesday, and I was like, you go to the doctor tomorrow.

156
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:30,287
[SPEAKER_05]: You go.

157
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow.

158
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as I know, she's okay.

159
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me read this from chat here.

160
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:39,213
[SPEAKER_08]: DangerSkew in chat says, H1N1 is the most overrated disease ever.

161
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is from chat.orangeonsradio.com.

162
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:41,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes and no.

163
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,912
[SPEAKER_08]: The number one killer of people with AIDS is pneumonia.

164
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:22,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually described it.

165
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to describe it to somebody.

166
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it's kind of like having 24-hour aides.

167
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:36,444
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to catch something secondary in that window, and I don't mean to speak so nonchalantly about something serious, but if I could explain how H1N1 is dangerous, that's why.

168
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,165
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

169
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:06,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So to kind of wrap this all up, because we've been talking about this for a while here, and I know folks want us to get to the games.

170
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Pneumonia is H1N1's mother-in-law.

171
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:11,805
[SPEAKER_08]: You just don't want her to come visit.

172
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:12,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

173
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:16,288
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but to wrap it all up, you know, again, the moral of the story, you know, I'm fine.

174
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:17,749
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's fine.

175
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,371
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get H1N1, you'll probably be fine, too.

176
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably won't even know you had it.

177
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But please see a doctor.

178
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to urgent care.

179
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:50,135
[SPEAKER_08]: or not necessarily the ER because ERs are really bombarded they're very expensive keep in mind there's a lot of urgent care clinics that can do the same thing a lot cheaper a lot of free clinics as well if you don't have insurance at all just see a doctor get treatment get on some type of medication that will build up your immunity so that way you don't catch something secondary so is it that bad no but should you take it seriously absolutely so that's kind of the moral of the story

180
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:56,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we've talked about our sickness and why we've been gone... And by the way, because again, this kept Jamie down for two weeks.

181
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,599
[SPEAKER_08]: This kept me out for two weeks.

182
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,581
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why things have fallen behind with the feed.

183
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:01,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I still have a cough too.

184
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,082
[SPEAKER_08]: You might hear me cough.

185
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's, I think, officially three and a half weeks later.

186
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still having to...

187
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:18,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The same type of, you know, that same cough that I had when I was developing that bronchitis back then, so I still have to be careful.

188
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:19,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm living on Ricola.

189
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,443
[SPEAKER_05]: A steady diet of Ricola.

190
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:23,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently Chinese food.

191
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:23,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

192
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:24,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

193
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:52,505
[SPEAKER_08]: enough about flu chat let's get into actually our gaming weeks as we usually like to start the show off with talking about the games we've been playing funny enough you think with nine days out of work I'd played a lot more video games but that's kind of not the case I don't know if that's true for you too DarkSakura but what kind of games you've been playing for the past couple weeks well I um excuse me I did something bad Rob what'd you do I've been a bad girl

194
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:53,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Maran,

195
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,914
[SPEAKER_05]: since I renewed my account, and then twice by myself.

196
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I have hit a milestone.

197
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I now have a character that is past level 10.

198
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations!

199
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:31,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I have level 15.

200
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Draw 9 age.

201
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the world of talent points.

202
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,300
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you like it here.

203
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,320
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's how it starts.

204
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,941
[SPEAKER_09]: First you do it with a friend, and then you start doing it by yourself.

205
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing you know, you just can't stop.

206
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:45,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing you know, you're playing EverQuest.

207
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking about Warcraft?

208
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:47,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you talking about... Never mind.

209
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

210
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:09,832
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

211
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:46,387
[SPEAKER_05]: and Dan's in the other room and I'm going I've got a wildebeest and he comes in and going so you do and then I was like taking screen captures of my uh of my griffin because I was doing oh we're going back and forth on a griffin and I'm paying for it

212
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just... I was just being a goof.

213
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,013
[SPEAKER_05]: An utter goof playing, but it was pretty fun.

214
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I like playing by myself.

215
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:57,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we play games?

216
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,017
[SPEAKER_08]: To have fun.

217
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:10,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And whatever that is for you, and especially in a very broad game like World of Warcraft or any MMO, if that's taking screenshots, if that's slash dancing, if that's roleplaying, whatever it is, it might not be just grinding to 80 as fast as you can.

218
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be a variety of other things that make it fun.

219
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So, more power to you.

220
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:19,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you about that, but maybe I'll think of it later.

221
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if DarkSakura's done with her gaming week, then I'll move on to Loki.

222
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:23,844
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

223
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,165
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week was okay.

224
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play a whole lot, though.

225
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, for the last two weeks, I haven't played a lot.

226
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been just working on the main cabin and getting that working.

227
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:44,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly choosing a front end, because I was originally going to start with Hyper Spin, which is really flashy and looks awesome, but the problem is you have to make a theme for every single game.

228
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And I downloaded every single game that's out there for MAME right now.

229
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:56,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would take forever to get skins for everything or make skins from scratch.

230
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:58,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just way too much damn work.

231
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:04,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I may end up going back to that though because I think you can actually put different settings for each game you launch in Hyper Spin.

232
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:07,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus it's a lot more flexible in what you can run in it.

233
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:23,629
[SPEAKER_09]: but right now I currently have Maximus Arcade on my system and I've been kind of working with that a little bit their configuration that they had for launching games and using the menu right now is really jacked up compared to what the

234
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:25,895
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

236
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:15,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's just, it's a lot, because I didn't know what games I wanted, so I said, okay, what the hell, I'm just going to download everything.

237
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:22,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did, I downloaded everything, including clones of games, multiple ROM dumps for each game.

238
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:23,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss World New 96?

239
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that's on there, of course.

240
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,264
[SPEAKER_09]: All the porno games.

241
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming over!

242
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:34,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, every game that's out there is on there, including ones that are like 50,000 Mahjong games I need to get rid of.

243
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:39,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just have to go and sort through everything, which is what really takes the time.

244
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

245
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:59,132
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing too is, because my cabinet has a dual sync monitor, so I can run games at the low resolution 15kHz, which is what most arcade games are, like all their old school ones, or medium resolution for some of the newer games.

246
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:09,260
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, if you run it at the medium resolution, your newer games look nice, but your older games aren't quite as sharp because it's not running at the native resolution anymore.

247
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a debate whether I want to make it look nice for most of my games or just some of my games.

248
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:21,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty much just going to leave it alone right now because I get to the Switch to actually flip it to that medium resolution.

249
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to take stuff apart and I don't want to do that.

250
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, enough of the cabinet stuff.

251
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:38,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just say real quick on a related note, because I'm looking at our chat room, BlackWolf, of course our old buddy Bobby, who does the show before us on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, live on Sunday nights, says, You describe me.

252
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:40,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a ton of consoles hooked up to my TV.

253
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I often play them?

254
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:44,893
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I could if I wanted to.

255
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:46,814
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds very Jamie as well.

256
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But mine aren't all hooked up.

257
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:50,036
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could.

258
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have the pile of Sega hooked up in the vault.

259
00:20:54,459 --> 00:21:01,161
[SPEAKER_08]: and how often do you go in there and say, you know what, today I want to play, I don't know, I'm just feeling very Afterburner today.

260
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I want to play after, do you do that?

261
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:03,842
[SPEAKER_05]: We do that shit.

262
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:04,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really?

263
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:11,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We do, but sometimes we also break out the PC Engine and play some cue cards.

264
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:17,708
[SPEAKER_05]: In the front room, we loaned our Wii to Dan's mom for some reason.

265
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:23,152
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 hooked up out in the front.

266
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation 3, since it's a piece of shit, just collects dust.

267
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,617
[SPEAKER_05]: We do nothing but play our Xbox 360.

268
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:32,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Ironically, I'm in the complete opposite boat right now.

269
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't replaced my Xbox 360.

270
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Three months now.

271
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Haven't needed to.

272
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:37,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing everything on the PS3.

273
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like in the complete opposite boat you are, but okay.

274
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:41,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes the show great.

275
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Except, Rob, we have a choice.

276
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:45,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, snap.

277
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,030
[SPEAKER_08]: You got me there.

278
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:47,713
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to do?

279
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:50,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that... No, well, technically our PS3 is our Blu-ray player.

280
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:51,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a choice, too.

281
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I could play the Wii if I want to, like,

282
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,712
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I basically swapped her the banned console because she doesn't play online, so she doesn't give a shit.

284
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,570
[SPEAKER_09]: She just wants a console that's modded, and it works just fine.

285
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,392
[SPEAKER_09]: It just can't go on live anymore, so hey, problem solved there.

286
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:26,693
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have her broken console.

287
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:32,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I have another console that's starting to go, and I have a friend's console that they brought in.

288
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:36,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he's giving it to me or what, but it's kind of broken, so I have three consoles that need to be fixed.

289
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,102
[SPEAKER_09]: which I'm planning on doing soon.

290
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:46,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a console coming from New Zealand actually that's a Japanese region console that's also modded so I can actually play some of the Japanese region games.

291
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:52,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have the four consoles that work right now that we're playing on.

292
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:59,651
[SPEAKER_09]: But the ironic part was the console that got banned is the console that we don't really play modded games on.

293
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,333
[SPEAKER_09]: We've played like one modded game on that and that's the one that gets banned.

294
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:06,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine, which is seeing all sorts of like it is...

295
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirty.

296
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirty, naughty machine.

297
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:14,262
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a filthy, filthy Xbox.

298
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and the one that my boss plays on, which was my old modded console that died once and came back, and it's completely just seen all sorts of burns and you name it, whatever.

299
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:26,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Those consoles are fine.

300
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:28,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing wrong with those.

301
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,749
[SPEAKER_09]: But sure, the one that played it one time, it's gone.

302
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:32,441
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

303
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck me, one got banned.

304
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:00,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

305
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:05,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand now they're banning consoles because they don't want you to play games.

306
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:08,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they were going to ban your live account or whatever.

307
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I throw this question to you from chat real quick?

308
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Loki think Microsoft is right by banning consoles?

309
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:17,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have the right to do it.

310
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:21,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as far as banning you off live, I don't understand why they would do that.

311
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:25,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I understand the cheating part and stuff like that, but if you think about it,

312
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:27,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

313
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:44,552
[SPEAKER_09]: What's to really motivate you from trying to get your... I mean, because now, there's no fear of you getting banned off live because you're already banned off live.

314
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:48,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So burn whatever the fuck you want now and play it on the console without consequence.

315
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really kind of the thing right now.

316
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't understand why they would do that.

317
00:24:52,697 --> 00:24:56,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish... There should have been another way they could penalize somebody, but whatever.

318
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess if you want to play on live... It's not that bad.

319
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,421
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not banning your account, I guess.

320
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:02,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be worse.

321
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:05,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, the only thing that happens when your console gets banned...

322
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:08,148
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

323
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's just, it's an inconvenience, I guess.

324
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I understand why they're cracking it.

325
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,362
[SPEAKER_08]: An inconvenient banning, the new movie by Al Gore.

326
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:50,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're actually, to be honest, you know, we really modded the consoles, not necessarily to play pirated games, but we were really just playing, you know, modded copies of Grand Theft Auto.

327
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:57,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we're playing, you know, all have episodes of Liberty City Discs, all legit copies, and that's what we've been playing.

328
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:03,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why we're kind of surprised that, you know, the one console's banned, because we haven't played a burned game, well, actually, I take that back, we played

329
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:11,445
[SPEAKER_09]: One new burned copy of Grand Theft Auto on that one because I found a new way to get around their mod patch or something like that.

330
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So we tested it once and it didn't really work.

331
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then we went back to just playing the normal disc.

332
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:20,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently that one time, though, they found out.

333
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they decided to ban that console.

334
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:28,754
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just ironic because we've been playing normal copies of games on all these consoles for the longest time now.

335
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:33,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if anything, they should be generous to me because I bought six copies of their damn game, you know.

336
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:37,034
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

337
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,381
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they finally died.

338
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:01,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost beat him too.

339
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

340
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:02,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

341
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:06,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheater and usually they drop out and I talk so much trash doing that.

342
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:08,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

343
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awful.

344
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

345
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

346
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:14,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

347
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:20,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really it.

348
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still sitting on my copy of Borderlands.

349
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:25,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even touched yet.

350
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, I need to play this tonight.

351
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:28,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play this tonight.

352
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:30,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And I go home and I end up working on the arcade cabinet.

353
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point, I'm going to play the damn game.

354
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:37,355
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what it all comes back to.

356
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:08,461
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week, you know, surprisingly enough, because I was so sick, I didn't get to play a lot.

357
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:13,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a lot of like TV and movie watching, which funny enough, I did get my PlayStation 3 Netflix streaming disc.

358
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to play around with that a little bit.

359
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:23,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's pretty much the same stuff you're going to see on the Xbox version without the party chat, which my Xbox was borked before I got to play with that feature anyway.

360
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm none the wiser.

361
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,618
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

362
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:51,953
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

363
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:19,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as far as new games go, one of the new games I played, I was joking about the Wii earlier because DarkSakura was saying that she had choice.

364
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:22,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, well, I still have choice between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

365
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And funny enough, I did turn on the Wii to check out the Excitebike World Tour.

366
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the name of it?

367
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:29,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Excitebike World Rally.

368
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:31,723
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

369
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:44,992
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

370
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:07,143
[SPEAKER_08]: These games, these 8-bit games, we used to spend so much time with back in the day.

371
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them you can still spend a lot of time with today.

372
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:19,447
[SPEAKER_08]: But now, thanks to the wide world of emulation, how many of you guys will just load up a cartridge on emulation, play it for like three minutes, and be all, I remember this game.

373
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:20,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, thrill's done.

374
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:21,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

375
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:21,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Play something else.

376
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:22,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much, yeah.

377
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:22,908
[SPEAKER_08]: That's...

378
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:52,396
[SPEAKER_08]: What I felt playing this Excitebike World Rally Yes, I realized there was online mode Yes, the game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the day You know, I am totally aware of all these improvements they made to the game But yet, when the game itself hasn't really felt like it's changed that much I was just kind of like, eh, I'm over it And that's my honest feedback on Excitebike I can't really tell you if it's a good game or a bad game Because I was just kind of over it in ten minutes

379
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,243
[SPEAKER_08]: and that was my experience with Excitebike.

380
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:58,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You make my soul hurt, Rob.

381
00:30:58,284 --> 00:30:58,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

382
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:00,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because.

383
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:01,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know what's funny?

384
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to play Excitebike for hours when I was like 10 or 11 years old.

385
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,191
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to play this game.

386
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:09,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I would spend hours making tracks.

387
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:11,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Making the damn tracks.

388
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:33,264
[SPEAKER_08]: and all this stuff and yet when I played this new one I was just kind of over it in 10 minutes and maybe to be fair maybe part of that was because the same day I played this was the same day I found out I had swine flu so I kind of had all of that on my mind at the same time so you know in the interest of full disclosure maybe I just didn't play this game in the right mood and you know I think a lot of people can admit

389
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,741
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:23,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But, full disclosure, I had all this other crap going on too So naturally I played a lot of World of Warcraft as well One other game I did check out was a game called 30 Second Hero I downloaded this onto the PSP when I was sick Because, you know, when the doctor tells you not to go outside and give people your germs You're like, okay, but I'm bored, I need something to do I'll go onto PlayStation Store and see if there's an arcade game I want to download And then I realized, oh yeah, they have all these PSP games you can download now What do I want to play?

391
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:26,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I played the demo for Half Minute Hero a while ago and I really liked it

392
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:27,948
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

393
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:59,461
[SPEAKER_08]: The battles automatically play themselves, so you don't have to sit there and go, fight, fight, fight, item, potion, fight.

394
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:00,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't do any of that.

395
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:06,626
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have battles that happened, and you just kind of tear through them, and it's just a fast, fast game.

396
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:17,975
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is, is that you go and you run through the forest or do whatever you do to the cave where the bad guy is, but in each level, it's episodic.

397
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,537
[SPEAKER_08]: The first level is very straightforward, but then later on,

398
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:21,237
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:33:47,649 --> 00:34:12,505
[SPEAKER_08]: because really the gist of the game is how do I get from point A to B to C to D as quick as possible making this whole thing work what's the solution without running out of time and that's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is and although I just overly simplified the game I think what's selling a lot of people on this is like kind of the nod to 8-bit cliches because seriously some of the dialogue in the game made me laugh out loud because the time goddess is like

400
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I will reset time for money.

401
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:15,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

402
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:16,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

403
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like money, hearts.

404
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:23,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like these very cliche, over-the-top things that just made me laugh.

405
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I kind of liked Half Minute Hero.

406
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:27,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it give you lulls?

407
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave me a lot of lulls.

408
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:37,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, you know, I think the people that at least localized the game, if not developed it, were kind of just in on the joke and knew what they were doing.

409
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:38,709
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it paid off.

410
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:40,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a cute game. $30...

411
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:42,839
[SPEAKER_08]: P-R-P-G

412
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:02,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a PRPG, yeah, a puzzle role-playing game.

413
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:03,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

414
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And then lots and lots and lots and lots of WoW.

415
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:13,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought back from the dead my 80 Druid and brought it into another guild that a lot of my friends had transferred to.

416
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:21,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also had my Paladin, my Helodin, I guess you could say, is level 72 now.

417
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So, being sick, WoW, bad combination.

418
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:25,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, honestly...

419
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:27,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Runway

420
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:46,401
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

421
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.

422
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:54,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if that does it for everybody's gaming week, we can finally get into some gaming news here now that we've been on air for about 40 minutes.

423
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:55,311
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob.

424
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:55,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Food.

425
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:56,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Food, Rob.

426
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:57,594
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk more food?

427
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

428
00:35:58,455 --> 00:35:59,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I do kind of want some yogurt or something.

429
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:00,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just fat.

430
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:01,538
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

431
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:07,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I do want to say real quick in the housekeeping department, our podcast feed is disgustingly behind.

432
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,821
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just sadly been a recurring theme this year.

433
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I blame the flu for that.

434
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:14,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We will get all caught up this week.

435
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:18,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a big dump of episodes just as we had, I think, back in October when we had some of the same thing going on.

436
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:22,652
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will get that all caught up for you guys that rely on the podcast feed.

437
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:29,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And we apologize for that, but do keep in mind the number one priority is pulling off this live show every Sunday night when we can.

438
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:30,877
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with sickness.

439
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,458
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with food.

440
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:32,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with all that stuff.

441
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:32,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk games.

442
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:33,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off.

443
00:36:53,703 --> 00:37:16,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, well, as you may remember, earlier this week we had one of the biggest game launches this year, and, you know, probably for a while, but Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out, and of course, being that it is a major game, there are going to be those out there who decide to break street dates and release the game early to try to be competitive, usually against GameStop.

444
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:30,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently some local shops in New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some parts of Ohio, were responsible for this, and actually kind of from what I've seen all around the U.S.

445
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:43,218
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently in these areas in particular, what's interesting though is to combat this, GameStop on a corporate level has allowed their stores to break street date as well, and release the game early.

446
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:44,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

447
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,620
[SPEAKER_09]: What gets even more interesting is this isn't the only title that's happened to.

448
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, the same thing is happening now with the titles coming out next week, Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

449
00:37:55,203 --> 00:38:01,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Three game stops in the New Jersey area, Jersey City, have been putting out Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

450
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:13,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Also saying that it was a call from their corporate office saying go ahead and put it out because there are mom and pop shops nearby that are also putting it out.

451
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:21,561
[SPEAKER_09]: To simply summarize this, it's a big ol' clusterfuck right now.

452
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:23,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pain in the ass.

453
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Pain in my ass is really what it is.

454
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:27,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, really curious.

455
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:35,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the facts are, we know some GameStops are bending the street dates to compete with mom and pop stores, or at least that's the claim.

456
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,851
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not happening at every GameStop.

457
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening, assumably, in areas where...

458
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:43,336
[SPEAKER_08]: They're losing pre-orders to other stores who broke street date.

459
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:49,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So first, let me ask you, because you work in retail and you said this is a giant pain in your ass.

460
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,479
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your perspective on all this?

461
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well here's what happened with Call of Duty.

462
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,701
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, it was very clear what the street date was.

463
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:04,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And Activision has graciously street dated all of their titles during the fourth quarter.

464
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:05,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Which makes it very...

465
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:19,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice for distribution because we can get it to our stores that we supply, get it to them early enough so that they have it day one to be on an even playing field with GameStop.

466
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:21,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Because GameStop, they're so massive.

467
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:24,510
[SPEAKER_09]: They get everything prior to street date because they're direct.

468
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do get stuff a lot of times on street date, but then we have to ship it to our customers and whatnot.

469
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:34,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody was under... They understood when the street dates were.

470
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:41,957
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, though, there's some of these small stores that are like, well, I don't know how I'm going to compete with GameStop.

471
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:45,979
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just so massive, and I don't get all these perks and stuff that GameStop has.

472
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:47,300
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't even try.

473
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,163
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just plain, like, I don't know what to do to be competitive with them.

474
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:57,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So they decide that they're going to go ahead and put product out early to get a competitive edge.

475
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:59,787
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, though, they get caught.

476
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:02,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other problem is...

477
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:06,765
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop

478
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:28,684
[SPEAKER_09]: They would go buy a copy of the game or whatever, get a receipt, get some sort of evidence.

479
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:34,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for Modern Warfare 2, they actually had a tip line and they would call in and report it.

480
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:41,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually what happens then is they will collect all these stores that were in violation of street dates.

481
00:40:41,948 --> 00:40:45,809
[SPEAKER_09]: They then go to all the distributors out there and go, okay, are these your customers?

482
00:40:46,850 --> 00:41:11,749
[SPEAKER_09]: and if they are you need to um take care of this by and for you know Modern Warfare 2 here's the penalty one they would no longer be able to buy Modern Warfare 2 for the life of the title if they're out of it they're fucked it doesn't matter they're not gonna be able to buy any more copies of it um also any further Activision titles they will no longer be able to get before street day um

483
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:33,312
[SPEAKER_09]: and also they're going to evaluate it whereas any sub-distributors out there, people that we basically sell to and then they turn and sell to other stores, they would also be blacklisted from selling a title if they were caught selling it early or whatnot or if these stores that they were servicing were selling early, they would also be blacklisted.

484
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:38,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting because I haven't heard this on any of the articles I'm reading so it's kind of fascinating to hear this.

485
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:50,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and this also goes, and especially with Modern Warfare 2, actually everybody's been kind of careful after Madden 10 this year because Madden 10, a whole bunch of stores broke street on it, and EA got...

486
00:41:51,547 --> 00:42:19,633
[SPEAKER_09]: pissed, they got really fucking pissed, like, first off we are looking, we're not gonna street date any more titles to distribution so fuck you guys, even though you know, we had no customers that were actually breaking street, but they just decided to blanket everybody and do that same thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum and Warner decided, you know what, we're just gonna do the same thing as EA, we're just gonna say fuck you guys and we're not gonna ship anything early anymore um, and then the other thing is then they decide, okay, well we're gonna

487
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:47,902
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe allow you to do that but you're going to have to get written signed agreements from all your customers you know they're going to be street dated and we're going to have to ship it two separate shipments it's just a pain in the ass so Activision now you know they weren't too happy about this whole thing they obviously did not authorize GameStop to do this but you know GameStop being as big as they are they can pretty much do this and go what are you going to do about it and Activision is going to go well can't do anything because they're our largest customer we can't piss them off so

488
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,910
[SPEAKER_09]: E.A.

489
00:42:50,170 --> 00:43:05,943
[SPEAKER_09]: and Ubisoft were watching the street dates closely for Left 4 Dead 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 because of this whole thing that happened with Modern Warfare 2 they wanted to make sure that no one was violating street dates on their titles

490
00:43:06,644 --> 00:43:08,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, to kind of go back around again.

491
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:15,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So these stores think that they're going to get competitive advantage against everybody else, and not necessarily GameStop, but mom-pops, whomever.

492
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:21,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and I hate to, like, blame just mom-pop shops for, you know, Violin Street, because they're not the only ones that do it.

493
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, 7-Eleven does it.

494
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:25,923
[SPEAKER_09]: There's...

495
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:28,037
[SPEAKER_09]: All sorts of people that do it.

496
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,419
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop did it.

497
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,139
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop did it.

498
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:36,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing is, it's always just a few people that just don't give a shit, that ruin it for everybody.

499
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's these same stores time and time again.

500
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,430
[SPEAKER_09]: They're violating street date on everything.

501
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Madden, for example, they know who... I mean, these people...

502
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:55,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I could especially see that with 7-Eleven, because you know 7-Elevens are notorious for being independently owned by folks, and probably a lot of them don't even want to be selling games.

503
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:59,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they probably are just kind of like, whatever, with this whole thing.

504
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:00,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I could especially see it there.

505
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and there's like, you know...

506
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:03,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you this much.

507
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:12,731
[SPEAKER_09]: If GameStop, corporate, has given these stores authorization to sell this game early, it's because they know who's selling it early around them, and they will get caught.

508
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:22,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I was reading some TalkBack stuff on this Kotaku article, and there's one of the guys in there that was actually an owner of a mom-and-pop shop.

509
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:24,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like...

510
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,769
[SPEAKER_09]: What a fucking douchebag the guy is.

511
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, you know, we knew what the street date was.

512
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:33,435
[SPEAKER_09]: We decided we're going to go ahead and here he goes.

513
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:34,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my two cents.

514
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I own a small mom-and-pop game store.

515
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:42,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Modern Warfare 2 brought in ten times as much revenue as the store has ever done in a single game.

516
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:43,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

517
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I sold the game one day early.

518
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:46,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have had it last Thursday.

519
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:52,029
[SPEAKER_09]: But did you think I sold anywhere near as many copies without having it early?

520
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:52,610
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

521
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,670
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

522
00:44:54,178 --> 00:44:55,799
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

523
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, that's a cop-out right there.

524
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:25,557
[SPEAKER_09]: The only jump you have on GameStop is that you can't afford to pick up enough copies to supply your customers.

525
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:29,580
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I don't believe that you run out of copies for your customers in the first place.

526
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And second off, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from GameStop.

527
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:43,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And just using that as an excuse to put out a game early, well, first off, you probably can get blacklisted from all the distributors out there, especially if they find out that you're selling games early.

528
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a matter of time.

529
00:45:47,472 --> 00:45:52,654
[SPEAKER_09]: If your customers are that unloyal to you, where you don't have it out early, they're going to go elsewhere.

530
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:59,458
[SPEAKER_09]: People, yeah, there are rabid fans of games that are going to go wherever they can get it early, but I'm sorry, that's not an excuse.

531
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:02,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there an easy answer to this, though?

532
00:46:02,147 --> 00:46:08,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, the bottom line is the consumer is just ultimately going to go wherever they can get it.

533
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:11,370
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll go to the Ma and Pa store if it's out there.

534
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:20,133
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll go to GameStop if Kotaku, Joystick, Destructoid, whoever runs a story that, hey, these GameStops in such and such New Jersey broke the street date.

535
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:27,736
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there were people driving in from Pennsylvania and New York to these stores just to get the damn game because the series has that big level fans.

536
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:28,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the problem.

537
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:30,799
[SPEAKER_09]: What they need to do is basically this.

538
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,263
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to enforce the street date violators.

539
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:39,930
[SPEAKER_09]: So if these people are breaking the street, they need to enforce it so that these people are reprimanded for doing that.

540
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,331
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes GameStop.

541
00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:43,374
[SPEAKER_09]: These stores need to be all...

542
00:46:45,177 --> 00:47:03,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you give GameStop an exception because they decided to break the law because someone else was, well, I'm sorry, you know, if I decide to break the law because I see someone else breaking the law, like, for example, if I see someone speeding past me on the freeway and I decide, hey, you know what, I'm going to go 100 miles an hour, too, and I get pulled over for speeding, I can't blame them for speeding.

543
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my own choice.

544
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:10,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, devil's advocate, not that I don't agree with you, but devil's advocate, when you break street date, you're not breaking the law.

545
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:12,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

546
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:28,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go into that agreement with your distributor or whomever, the publisher, if you're not going to abide by it.

547
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:34,766
[SPEAKER_08]: How can the playing field be leveled between the Ma and Pa stores and the GameStops from your perspective?

548
00:47:34,806 --> 00:47:36,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm kind of surprised.

549
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:42,409
[SPEAKER_08]: You're placing a lot more blame on the Ma and Pa stores than I kind of would have thought, considering those are the folks that you work with.

550
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:44,290
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of what you say makes sense.

551
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bottom line is that these places...

552
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Claim they can't compete with GameStop

553
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:30,320
[SPEAKER_09]: you know a lot of people also like the stupid little perks that you get from ordering with GameStop you know little trinkets and crap that if you actually look at it you know it's not that great in the first place you know some of the

554
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:34,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you really need a keychain for a game?

555
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:36,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be fine without that?

556
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:36,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

557
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:41,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Are these mom-and-pop stores going to give you a better trade-in value on your game than GameStop?

558
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:42,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

559
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:43,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends.

560
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the customer service going to be better?

561
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:47,325
[SPEAKER_09]: It all depends.

562
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:50,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like all this hatred for shopping at Walmart or something.

563
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:55,332
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like shopping at Walmart and you find the prices to be fair, then why not shop there?

564
00:48:55,492 --> 00:48:57,253
[SPEAKER_09]: They just...

565
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:04,695
[SPEAKER_09]: They just try to compete with them, and then they give up so easily because they're not as big.

566
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:08,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, well, why can't they get all the advertising materials that GameStop has?

567
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:13,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they make a lot of it in-house, and they buy a lot of games, so they have the publisher backing for a lot of this stuff.

568
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:16,765
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the pull to where they actually make the publishers pay them for shelf space.

569
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:20,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're never going to be as big as GameStop.

570
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:21,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over it.

571
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to find a different way to compete.

572
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:27,894
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have other stores out there that do just fine, and they abide by all the street dates.

573
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:29,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it can be done.

574
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:34,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting little mini-debate in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.

575
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,953
[SPEAKER_08]: DangerSkew says, Easy solution.

576
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:43,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Implement some type of server-side solution that does not allow the game to be played until street date, just like what PC games are starting to do.

577
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,804
[SPEAKER_08]: But GameGuru and Frisbee pipe up and say, No, no online activation.

578
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:49,566
[SPEAKER_08]: The games won't work offline.

579
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:51,518
[SPEAKER_08]: and so forth.

580
00:49:52,278 --> 00:49:52,879
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do that.

581
00:49:52,979 --> 00:50:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because there's people that aren't connected to online and if that's the case, if they're not connected online, there's no way to verify what date you have in your system.

582
00:50:00,445 --> 00:50:02,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can switch a date around and it wouldn't matter.

583
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:08,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't think that's a solution and really it's just going to come with enforcing street dates.

584
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:08,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

585
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:09,371
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

586
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,276
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll get their attention.

587
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:34,018
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, GameStop can't fucking just go break Street Date because they feel that they need to be competitive against these stores.

588
00:50:34,258 --> 00:50:37,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, you're not going to lose sales to these stores.

589
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're fucking GameStop.

590
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to matter if you sell two less copies.

591
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,721
[SPEAKER_09]: You're GameStop.

592
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:43,701
[SPEAKER_09]: You make $7 billion a year.

593
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:45,042
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not fucking matter.

594
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think any action should be taken against GameStop for this?

595
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:49,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it should.

596
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:55,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what they should have done is taken... They would have had a lot more pull if they took the high road and didn't put out any of these games.

597
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:57,533
[SPEAKER_09]: If they just said, hey, look, we play by the rules.

598
00:50:58,574 --> 00:51:04,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they actually have the pull where they can go, listen, you're not fucking street dating anymore titles because this is what happens when you're street dating them.

599
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're a big proponent of not street dating titles.

600
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:07,202
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

601
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the mom-pop stores get it two days later and then they have the advantage.

602
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:12,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

603
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:31,581
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

604
00:51:53,196 --> 00:52:00,361
[SPEAKER_08]: A huge thing they're talking about today is that some Italian website started selling the MP3s for the new Lady Gaga album.

605
00:52:00,762 --> 00:52:04,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So of course, one person went in and downloaded it, and what do you think happened?

606
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:11,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Now everybody who browses that community has a copy of the new Lady Gaga album about 10 days before it was actually supposed to come out.

607
00:52:11,889 --> 00:52:12,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it happens all the time.

608
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,392
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter if it's the new Lady Gaga album or whatever.

609
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:22,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Promo copies go out to... And I might be talking about some musician that you personally don't care about, but keep in mind...

610
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:31,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm throwing music, movies, games all in the same boat here with broken... You know, one person ruined... In this case, not even in America.

611
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:38,953
[SPEAKER_08]: One person in Italy on the internet ruins it, the street date, and it has colossal repercussions.

612
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:40,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

613
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:42,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Games leak online early all the time.

614
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:43,137
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time.

615
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:43,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

616
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:45,803
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

617
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:20,476
[SPEAKER_09]: promo copies are sent out there to get people to supply the album in their store movies, screeners get put out there or they're just dumping region 5 DVDs from Russia that come out early and you have DVD copies of all sorts of movies that are out in theaters now and stuff like that

618
00:53:20,976 --> 00:53:21,637
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

619
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be fair, some of them do.

620
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:52,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of the day, Lady Gaga's probably not going to hurt any from this happening.

621
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:59,618
[SPEAKER_08]: But the point still stands is that there's a lot of people getting this stuff before they're supposed to be.

622
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:02,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And it only delays the inevitable anyways.

623
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:08,145
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone's waiting for a pirated copy, yeah, they may want to play it early.

624
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,829
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, that also has its repercussions, as with the console bannings.

625
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:20,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, everything has its downside to it, but I think, like, I know, for example, Grand Theft Auto 4.

626
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I downloaded a copy early because I wanted to play it right away.

627
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:31,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But when it came out, I bought six copies of it because I just wanted to play it really early because I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.

628
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:34,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Needed to play it, like in the heroine or something.

629
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:39,475
[SPEAKER_09]: but I still bought it.

630
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:44,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a problem with just downloading something early and not paying for it.

631
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to say that I haven't done that before.

632
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:52,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably have, but it's stuff that I wouldn't have bought anyways or stuff I try once for three minutes and throw it away.

633
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:55,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a lot of the Wii games out there.

634
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:59,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, chat, folks, look at the big picture.

635
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:02,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not specifically talking about Lady Gaga.

636
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using that as an example.

637
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:06,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just one I happened to notice because I personally like her.

638
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:08,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But I realize a lot of you don't.

639
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:09,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the bigger picture.

640
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:16,478
[SPEAKER_08]: This has happened to every musician because that window between when the critics get it and all that is way too big.

641
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:17,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, one –

642
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:34,647
[SPEAKER_08]: especially with how quick and portable music files are one internet person leaks it and everybody on the internet has it insert your favorite band here, it's happened to them it's the swine flu of the internet I guess you could say that so, alright, anyhow

643
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:40,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we can move on to other stories, but it's just very interesting because in a way there's no easy answer.

644
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:49,683
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stuff that's just going to be... This isn't going away, it's just been brought to the forefront for once, I guess.

645
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:51,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting comment from Chad.

646
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:54,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to state here, though, because I thought this also plays a part of it.

647
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:58,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Jimmy Jack in chat says, GameStop has a limited business model anyway.

648
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:02,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Once digital distribution is mainstream, they are screwed.

649
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

650
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:03,533
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

651
00:56:18,032 --> 00:56:18,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big thing.

652
00:56:19,472 --> 00:56:23,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of these stores, you know, they're selling copies that are sealed.

653
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:26,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they don't have a copy that's not sealed, they're not selling it to their customer.

654
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,615
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another thing that separates them.

655
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:40,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, if you maybe just don't like going into GameStop because they have maybe a limited selection of PC titles, maybe they don't have the retro games you're looking for, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from all these other people out there.

656
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:43,600
[SPEAKER_09]: If that were the case, then there wouldn't be any mom and pop shops because you just can't compete.

657
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:51,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you know, and in some places, again, I don't want to stereotype all, but a lot of times GameStop kind of has that...

658
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:55,407
[SPEAKER_08]: or about it of like you get a lot of people that don't really care about their jobs.

659
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:58,348
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a lot of college kids who just, you know, looking for something to do, right?

660
00:56:58,388 --> 00:56:59,388
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to work fast food.

661
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:05,331
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I, again, that's not all the employees, but I think it's certainly a stereotype they have to deal with.

662
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:12,913
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, you know, in a lot of Ma and Pa stores, Ma and Pa who are running that store obviously have a love of video games if they're running the place in the first place.

663
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:16,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times you're going to get people who really, really freaking care about what they're doing.

664
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:17,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Again,

665
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,537
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

666
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:39,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think that they liked video games all that much.

667
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:39,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew them.

668
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:42,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, they didn't really like video games all that much.

669
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

670
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,101
[SPEAKER_08]: They just sold it because they knew that's where the money was at the time.

671
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:04,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of times passion leaves when the company gets that big.

672
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about money.

673
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It's less about really if you like video games or not.

674
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:11,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that we're selling video games because it makes us a lot of money.

675
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,013
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a capitalist society.

676
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all based on the bottom line.

677
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:14,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Money, money, money.

678
00:58:15,674 --> 00:58:15,934
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

679
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:17,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on, guys.

680
00:58:17,055 --> 00:58:18,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to move on to another story.

681
00:58:18,615 --> 00:58:19,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

682
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:21,136
[SPEAKER_08]: From one controversial topic to another.

683
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:22,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of passionate people...

684
00:58:24,312 --> 00:58:24,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And Hypocritical

685
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:47,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to get into the political aspect of it.

686
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:48,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not.

687
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:54,369
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless, PETA's there and sometimes they do these very big things for show.

688
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:55,511
[SPEAKER_05]: PETA's are tasty with hummus.

689
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,722
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I once – and I think I've probably told this story before.

690
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:09,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I was kind of talking to online on a dating website a guy who worked for PETA and it was very – I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff.

691
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:13,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I also used to date a gay Republican, which to me was fascinating too.

692
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I like diverse people even when sometimes that diversity doesn't agree with me.

693
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:18,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of –

694
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:19,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's interesting.

695
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:25,756
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know from talking to somebody who works directly with the organization, they're very passionate about what they do.

696
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:30,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether you agree with them or not, they definitely have huge passion.

697
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And they get very creative.

698
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:36,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the ways they get creative is that they do these little online games to get their message across.

699
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:42,849
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a game that they put out a while ago, Super Chick Sisters, which was there to kind of protest KFC.

700
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:44,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember we talked about it on the show a while back.

701
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:45,751
[SPEAKER_08]: This was back in 2007.

702
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

703
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:47,873
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a brand new...

704
00:59:48,613 --> 00:59:52,856
[SPEAKER_08]: New Super Chick Sisters So just in time for new Super Mario Bros.

705
00:59:52,916 --> 01:00:09,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii that came out today We also have new Super Chick Sisters But it has nothing to do with KFC this time No, it's all about McDonald's I don't know what the specifics is But obviously the McNuggets did not get there very easily So it probably has something to do with that whole thing

706
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:18,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not played the game myself, but I imagine they are not happy about how the chicken turns into the McNugget, so they've built this whole game about awareness.

707
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:26,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess the whole idea behind it is how they tap into the market, is that they're not...

708
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:29,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a poster.

709
01:00:29,848 --> 01:00:31,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a protest.

710
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:36,113
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a flash video game which oftentimes tend to be very viral.

711
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:36,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean look about it.

712
01:00:36,814 --> 01:00:38,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about it here on the show.

713
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But more the kind of creativity in their marketing.

714
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:46,802
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's out there and to which I see Jamie and Loki rolling their eyes.

715
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:53,187
[SPEAKER_05]: This next time you talk to someone from PETA, ask them how many animals they euthanize every year.

716
01:00:55,248 --> 01:01:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask them about how many of their higher-ups have type 2 diabetes and have to take insulin.

717
01:01:02,154 --> 01:01:05,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when the next time I'm going to be in Norfolk, Virginia is, which is where their office is.

718
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when I was talking to the dude.

719
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,484
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, whatever.

720
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:15,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

721
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:17,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have no problem with PETA if they weren't big hypocrites.

722
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:19,049
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

723
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:24,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, stepping away from what PETA's all about and all this, because I don't know.

724
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:27,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know enough about PETA because I've just never really cared.

725
01:01:28,193 --> 01:01:34,579
[SPEAKER_08]: What about this whole, this is how they market their message, is creating these viral flash video games.

726
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:37,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it's actually pretty defamatory, too.

727
01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:39,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the Cooking Mama one?

728
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:40,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I do remember that.

729
01:01:40,124 --> 01:01:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

730
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, though, I mean, it's like...

731
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:58,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they really care whose toes they step on because they think that they're invincible and honestly I would love to have a full scale investigation gone into the business practices of PETA

732
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:07,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting, because I am looking at a screenshot here from the game, and it's not like they're trying to hide the fact that it's Mario.

733
01:02:07,238 --> 01:02:09,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a big red M on his cap.

734
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,802
[SPEAKER_08]: He very much looks like Mario.

735
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:19,910
[SPEAKER_08]: If I were Nintendo, I might think I could sue over protection of my character, although, I don't know, but then can't you get into parody and all this?

736
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:20,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

737
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:25,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have to have enough remarkable difference that, you know...

738
01:02:26,603 --> 01:02:29,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that actually is close enough to infringement right there.

739
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:33,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, looking from where I am right here, it looks like Mario and Luigi.

740
01:02:34,928 --> 01:02:37,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got my glasses on and everything.

741
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:38,370
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Mario and Luigi.

742
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:44,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you get super close up, you can see a little text on there that says, Princess Pamela Anderson kidnapped again.

743
01:02:44,614 --> 01:02:46,555
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where I know this is not a Nintendo game.

744
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:47,095
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

745
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:50,417
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I go, okay, A... I'm sorry, that looks like Mario.

746
01:02:50,557 --> 01:02:51,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Pamela Anderson...

747
01:02:52,418 --> 01:03:19,706
[SPEAKER_08]: was maybe good looking like 20 years ago when she was on Baywatch but she's no princess now she's barbed wire she'd kick their ass again I was just talking about oh no they didn't earlier and funny enough I'm going to bring them up again once in a while they'll run these pictures of Pamela Anderson without makeup and oh my heavens she is not good looking anymore is she with Tommy Lee or Kid Rock at this point who fucking cares well I'll know

748
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:22,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously she's big on PETA.

749
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:24,569
[SPEAKER_08]: She's one of their big supporters and stuff.

750
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:25,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why she gets named the princess.

751
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because they're brainwashing people, especially people who have no brains.

752
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:29,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

753
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:31,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just move on.

754
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:34,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to get it out there.

755
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:37,079
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting marketing using video games.

756
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,382
[SPEAKER_08]: It is showing you, I will say this, let me finish on this thought.

757
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:43,665
[SPEAKER_08]: You, as a gamer, are being targeted.

758
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:46,235
[SPEAKER_08]: for propaganda.

759
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:48,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I brought this up.

760
01:03:48,956 --> 01:03:49,836
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I wanted to say.

761
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:54,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Just serve me up a plate of fried sea kittens.

762
01:03:54,577 --> 01:04:04,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, it's going to be an argument between Guitar Hero 5 and Madden for KFC's side or Super Chick Sisters.

763
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I don't recognize Super Chick Sisters but Guitar Hero 5 and Madden tell me to go eat chicken.

764
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to listen to them.

765
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:41,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't want to piss off Chick-fil-A The cows say to eat more chicken They have signs Alright, this was the worst possible show to bring up this topic on Let's move on Well, especially since you're in, you know, PETA Hater Central Which would be me But I don't hate I don't hate You know what, I hate hypocrites I do, there are things I hate But I'm trying not to hate I do not hate people

766
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Project Natal

767
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:08,784
[SPEAKER_05]: There are details, including release dates, sort of.

768
01:05:09,966 --> 01:05:17,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be looking at it possibly around November 2010, and it should be costing around 50 bucks.

769
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:23,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are speculating that 5 million units will be ready by that time.

770
01:05:24,941 --> 01:05:26,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're thinking big seller.

771
01:05:27,405 --> 01:05:33,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't really just have a bunch of happy gamers all on them.

772
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,758
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Time Magazine all on them.

773
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:46,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Project Natal made it into the top 50 invention poll on the Time Magazine website.

774
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:49,073
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that possible for a device that's not even out?

775
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,954
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been invented.

776
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:53,476
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been invented on display.

777
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:54,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And who's played it?

778
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:55,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Jimmy Fallon.

779
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Big deal.

780
01:05:56,779 --> 01:05:57,960
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's Jimmy Fallon.

781
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,902
[SPEAKER_08]: He means a lot to everybody, right?

782
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:00,462
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

783
01:06:00,883 --> 01:06:01,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Chirp chirp, cricket cricket.

784
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:15,796
[SPEAKER_05]: They're quoted, they're saying that Project Natal, because it uses several cameras and the microphone and because it's so much more intuitive than anything that's been out to this date and is going to be put out on a mass consumer market, it's right up there with the bladeless fan.

785
01:06:15,816 --> 01:06:15,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

786
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:17,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Virtual Boy X2-5

787
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:47,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

788
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you know what the iToy was good for?

789
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:53,363
[SPEAKER_08]: The wash-in-windows game that played that song from the 1920s.

790
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:54,463
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

791
01:06:54,563 --> 01:06:56,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, when I'm wash-in-windows.

792
01:06:56,404 --> 01:06:59,086
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the greatest thing they ever did with the iToy, okay?

793
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:01,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And that game actually worked pretty well.

794
01:07:01,387 --> 01:07:07,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of these other games they released for the iToy did not play like you think they would on the back of the box.

795
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:22,277
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm saying, again, I realize Natal is a much higher advanced technology than iToy, but when I see this little 12-year-old girl walking up and trying on her clothes by waving her hand, I'm kind of like, okay, well, that's what they want us to believe it really plays like.

796
01:07:23,117 --> 01:07:28,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we were making that joke is that when Natal was being previewed, like, wasn't this a scene in Clueless like 10 years ago?

797
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:32,583
[SPEAKER_08]: But how is it really going to work that flawlessly?

798
01:07:32,603 --> 01:07:37,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Because part of me goes, you know, well, my DS is supposed to understand me saying blue, too.

799
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,928
[SPEAKER_08]: But here I am going, brew!

800
01:07:39,508 --> 01:07:40,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Brew!

801
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:41,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Brew!

802
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me mention some of the other things that are on the list.

803
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:45,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

804
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:51,478
[SPEAKER_05]: For the list of stuff that's... And I actually can't really call this a list of inventions.

805
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:53,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are...

806
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily all real inventions.

807
01:07:58,084 --> 01:08:00,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are innovations in existing technology.

808
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:01,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are books.

809
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:03,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is on the list.

810
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the Snuggie on the list?

811
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:08,914
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dog Snuggie is on... I approve of the list.

812
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:14,419
[SPEAKER_08]: The Snuggie is the greatest invention of modern times.

813
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:15,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen The Sleepy?

814
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,781
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dog Snuggie, Rob.

815
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:17,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dog Snuggie.

816
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen the Sleepy?

817
01:08:19,231 --> 01:08:20,992
[SPEAKER_09]: No, what's the Sleepy?

818
01:08:21,032 --> 01:08:26,915
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a sleeping bag made out of bed sheets that has no zipper.

819
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a pillow inside of it.

820
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:29,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

821
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:31,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's some of the stuff that's on here.

822
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these are actually pretty worthy.

823
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:38,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The $10 million lightbulb, I love it, is actually a lightbulb that runs on LEDs.

824
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:41,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just as bright as any lightbulb and will never burn out.

825
01:08:42,966 --> 01:08:44,708
[SPEAKER_05]: They've actually teleported atoms.

826
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:56,563
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a guy who lost his vision and when I figured out with these other guys how to have a camera implanted into his eyeball so that he can record stuff.

827
01:08:57,952 --> 01:08:59,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Robot Penguins Robot Penguins, Rob

828
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:28,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

829
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:53,732
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... I don't see... A team of Dutch scientists is closing in on culturing stem cells from pigs and growing muscle in a petri dish.

830
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:54,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

831
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: In vitro meat.

832
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:57,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I understand.

833
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:01,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe now this list makes a little more sense because a lot of these are things we haven't actually gotten to do ourselves.

834
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:05,084
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I have never grown meat myself.

835
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:06,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never grown my own meat to eat.

836
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:07,947
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounds like much more of a math thing to do.

837
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:08,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the robo-penguin.

838
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:09,268
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

839
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:09,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

840
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:13,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So Natal, I see, fits into this list because a lot of these things.

841
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:20,119
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, I also say, does Project Natal really deserve to be up there with meat that you grow?

842
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,760
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds...

843
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:24,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The unicycle thing.

844
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:26,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched that thing.

845
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:33,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Project Natal, I would say... Because you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a unicycle.

846
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:36,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a Segway.

847
01:10:36,811 --> 01:10:39,052
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that thing on South Park called?

848
01:10:40,674 --> 01:10:41,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

849
01:10:41,474 --> 01:10:44,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever I see these new riding devices, I always think of that thing on South Park.

850
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:46,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That one episode.

851
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:48,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of you listeners know what I'm talking about.

852
01:10:48,897 --> 01:10:49,918
[SPEAKER_05]: A 3D camera.

853
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:52,681
[SPEAKER_05]: The smart bullet is my favorite invention on the list.

854
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:57,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bullet that you can trigger to explode after you've already shot it into somebody.

855
01:10:57,846 --> 01:11:00,888
[SPEAKER_05]: You can choose when the bullet explodes.

856
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best thing ever.

857
01:11:05,132 --> 01:11:06,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to piss me off.

858
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:06,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

859
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I just shot you and if I hit this button, you're fucked.

860
01:11:09,677 --> 01:11:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: They've also figured out how to levitate a mouse with magnets.

861
01:11:12,694 --> 01:11:13,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

862
01:11:26,798 --> 01:11:29,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob, it was the Wild Wacky Action Bike.

863
01:11:30,722 --> 01:11:32,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Wild Wacky Action Bike.

864
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube Funk, what the fuck.

865
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:40,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, something else from Microsoft coming soon, of course, would be the Fall Update.

866
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:44,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can expect that on Tuesday, November 17th.

867
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:52,782
[SPEAKER_09]: With that will be coming the Facebook and Twitter integration, as well as Last.fm and all sorts of other fun stuff.

868
01:11:53,783 --> 01:12:04,818
[SPEAKER_09]: and um honestly still haven't really played around the Facebook and Twitter stuff other than the one time I posted on Twitter saying hey I'm posting from an Xbox 360 which apparently everybody else did so now I feel like a loser um

869
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:08,108
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

870
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:42,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Integration with Facebook, a little shot of the cross-media bar there with a Facebook link there.

871
01:12:43,211 --> 01:12:48,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And also some thumbnails of photos in a grid layout.

872
01:12:49,095 --> 01:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So some other features coming possibly in a later expansion to the, I guess, the new cross-media bar.

873
01:12:59,241 --> 01:12:59,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is...

874
01:13:00,362 --> 01:13:04,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, I guess, because we need a lot more updates from consoles for different things.

875
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:16,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I know with at least the Xbox 360 one, I know they're going to add some screenshots and stuff like that, which would be pretty awesome, because then when I kill people in Grand Theft Auto, I can share it with everybody.

876
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:21,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Although that would be a lot of photos I'm sharing, because I kick a lot of ass in that game.

877
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:22,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe not.

878
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:23,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

879
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:25,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's interesting.

880
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:26,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think, Jamie?

881
01:13:27,127 --> 01:13:28,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that you would probably use?

882
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:31,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Although you don't play much on the PlayStation 3, do you?

883
01:13:31,211 --> 01:13:31,952
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I really don't.

884
01:13:32,132 --> 01:13:33,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably wouldn't use it.

885
01:13:33,373 --> 01:13:36,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually...

886
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:43,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest, a lot of the little networking stuff through the consoles, I really have no interest in.

887
01:13:44,112 --> 01:13:48,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the only things that I use for my networking is my iPhone and my computer.

888
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:57,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would actually more irritate me, I think, if I was being interrupted in a game for Facebook.

889
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:05,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just hoping that they don't have automatic updates for trophies or achievements or something like that.

890
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that they've kind of tried something a little bit with Twitter with Uncharted 2.

891
01:14:09,456 --> 01:14:12,238
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a big pain in the ass?

892
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:17,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really seen anything from that because I don't think a lot of people use it because they realize how annoying that would be.

893
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Raptor thing is what pisses me off.

894
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:22,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I've seen that too.

895
01:14:22,146 --> 01:14:22,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of annoying.

896
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:24,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially with Twitter.

897
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:26,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can kind of block some of that stuff now.

898
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:57,354
[SPEAKER_09]: and at least with Facebook in fact actually I've been going through on Facebook and kind of blocking all of the apps which actually makes it really nice because now I can actually see what my friends are updating without having to sort through all those apps on there I've been doing much the same still kind of going through everything and hopefully hopefully I can actually get down to where it's just my friends posting and stuff like that but there are a few though especially from Rob that I can't block because they're actually a screenshot that he has on there but um

899
01:14:58,362 --> 01:14:58,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

900
01:14:58,823 --> 01:14:59,704
[SPEAKER_05]: The sorority life?

901
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:01,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, no, it's not sorority life.

902
01:15:01,226 --> 01:15:03,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a quiz or something that he's doing.

903
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:05,152
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually go in and block a lot of those quizzes, too.

904
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:06,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I've been doing that.

905
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:13,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do hide app whenever you get a post up on your wall.

906
01:15:13,765 --> 01:15:13,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

907
01:15:14,486 --> 01:15:20,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually do that with a lot of stuff now, because honestly, I'm irritated by a lot of it.

908
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:27,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only thing that I actually even play anymore on Facebook is the stupid little pet game that I like so much.

909
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,870
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pet Society thing.

910
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:31,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

911
01:15:33,811 --> 01:15:34,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

912
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to be using a lot of the Facebook stuff and Twitter.

913
01:15:37,672 --> 01:15:39,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're going to use some Last.fm stuff.

914
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,652
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

915
01:16:00,174 --> 01:16:05,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, I'm updating my Twitter from Xbox, and then I never see another tweet from the Xbox.

916
01:16:06,036 --> 01:16:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only thing I worry about, again, is just the TwitSpam that we're already seeing, not just from Xbox, but like Uncharted 2 and some of these other games.

917
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:16,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I just beat Level 3 in Uncharted 2.

918
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:17,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care!

919
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all the Raptor people need to shut up.

920
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:27,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is, is that unlike Facebook, Twitter has no button where I can say, filter all posts with hashtag Uncharted 2 in it.

921
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:29,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

922
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not knocking Uncharted 2.

923
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:34,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it myself, but I hear the game is fabulous and it looks like fun.

924
01:16:34,577 --> 01:16:35,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play it myself.

925
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:38,179
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm just saying this whole tweet spam thing has got to go.

926
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:39,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with Facebook.

927
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:41,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It was basically just to say, hey, we did it first.

928
01:16:42,421 --> 01:16:42,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

929
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:44,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

930
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, moving on to other topics and maybe a game that might be publishing status updates to your Facebook very soon.

931
01:16:54,086 --> 01:16:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Drum Hero is a game that has been trademarked by Activision.

932
01:16:58,329 --> 01:17:01,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, though, this doesn't mean that necessarily the game is being made or anything.

933
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:02,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought they already did this.

934
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:02,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just...

935
01:17:03,112 --> 01:17:07,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, a lot of people were kind of having this whole little like, wait a minute, haven't we heard this before?

936
01:17:07,774 --> 01:17:10,814
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing, and this is what makes this newsworthy.

937
01:17:11,455 --> 01:17:17,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Previously, Activision trademarked the titles Guitar Villain and Drum Villain, and this was way back in 2007 when they did that.

938
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:19,918
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

939
01:17:47,003 --> 01:18:08,027
[SPEAKER_08]: In an interview with MCVUK.com, CEO Dan Rosenwig of the Guitar Hero brand and works for Activision says that the publisher is apparently already working on new versions of Guitar Hero and Band Hero and that there will also be more DJ Hero, which I'm sure all of this makes you go, duh, duh, and more duh.

940
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:09,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know more of these games is coming.

941
01:18:09,788 --> 01:18:13,108
[SPEAKER_08]: But one thing they are saying, fewer SKUs in 2010.

942
01:18:13,969 --> 01:18:15,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But keep in mind, SKU is a term...

943
01:18:16,676 --> 01:18:19,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been, well, let's say skewed over the past couple years.

944
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:26,161
[SPEAKER_08]: This has kind of made its way from a retail-only world to the mainstream game blogs.

945
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody throws this term skew around.

946
01:18:28,562 --> 01:18:29,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And what does skew really mean?

947
01:18:29,983 --> 01:18:32,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Skew is essentially like a barcode, I guess you could say.

948
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you could explain this better than I could, Loki.

949
01:18:35,526 --> 01:18:39,288
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, this doesn't mean like one game does not mean one skew.

950
01:18:39,768 --> 01:18:40,469
[SPEAKER_08]: A skew is...

951
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:45,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 5, Guitar plus Game on Wii is one SKU.

952
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:49,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar plus Drum plus Game on Wii is one SKU.

953
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Game alone, another SKU, right?

954
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:51,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

955
01:18:52,578 --> 01:18:53,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically kind of how it works.

956
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:59,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because there's less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be less games, although that's kind of the conclusion a lot of people are jumping to.

957
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:05,529
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember that this year alone, and this is including Guitar Hero Van Halen, there has been 41 SKUs.

958
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:06,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

959
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So less than that doesn't necessarily mean that much of a difference.

960
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:17,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's because, you know, you have four different systems, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii, that all these games are coming out on.

961
01:19:17,904 --> 01:19:21,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the Jumbo Kit, the game alone, and the game and guitar.

962
01:19:22,168 --> 01:19:26,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The DS, and also possibly the PSP, which is actually supposed to be coming out next year as well.

963
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:26,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

964
01:19:27,608 --> 01:19:29,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to include the iPhone, I guess.

965
01:19:29,809 --> 01:19:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

966
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:41,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, by the way, Bobby in the chat room, which I think is interesting, he's bringing this up as well, says, another term co-opted by blogs that he's using correctly is price point.

967
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:45,280
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a marketing term, not something, say, to talk about how much something costs you at retail.

968
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're probably just as guilty as the next guy of using that term a lot.

969
01:19:48,502 --> 01:19:52,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting how that has – that term, I would say, has almost evolved.

970
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:52,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

971
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:56,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's not what it's supposed to mean, but that's what everyone thinks it means now.

972
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:57,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I always use MSRP.

973
01:19:58,006 --> 01:19:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, microtransaction.

974
01:19:59,327 --> 01:19:59,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that too.

975
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:12,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, getting off the subject a little bit here, but just because there's talking about less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean less games, although I personally think we're not going to see the Metallica and Van Halen-style releases next year in Aerosmith.

976
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:21,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we're going to see any band-only releases next year, especially not after this whole stink about what's going on in Guitar Hero 5 with the band soon.

977
01:20:21,374 --> 01:20:22,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, because of that stink,

978
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:23,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

979
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:29,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because then they'd have that one band that's already agreed to have their likeness in there, and then they're not really singing other people's songs.

980
01:20:31,562 --> 01:20:32,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, though.

981
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:36,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of me just says it's kind of been done with all the big bands that are going to get their own game.

982
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, I'm sure there's a million people.

983
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:41,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's going to shout out their favorite band.

984
01:20:42,187 --> 01:20:44,828
[SPEAKER_08]: But are these games really selling that well?

985
01:20:45,068 --> 01:20:45,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

986
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:47,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The Van Halen one, they were given away.

987
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

988
01:20:49,372 --> 01:20:52,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Van Halen's still selling pretty well because a lot of people didn't buy it within that one month.

989
01:20:53,739 --> 01:20:54,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that one month.

990
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,903
[SPEAKER_09]: After September, you aren't getting it for free.

991
01:20:58,667 --> 01:20:59,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just surprised.

992
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:02,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm going to take a lot of hate with this comment, but I don't care.

993
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Van Halen doesn't deserve their own game.

994
01:21:04,289 --> 01:21:08,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially not if they're going to ignore the latter half of the career.

995
01:21:08,892 --> 01:21:10,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

996
01:21:10,593 --> 01:21:15,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, a lot of the older games like Aerosmith does not sell for shit right now.

997
01:21:15,915 --> 01:21:16,996
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's old.

998
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:18,577
[SPEAKER_09]: It is old, but it doesn't matter though.

999
01:21:18,617 --> 01:21:19,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still another band.

1000
01:21:20,858 --> 01:21:21,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Metallica?

1001
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:23,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while.

1002
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Smash Hits?

1003
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:25,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.

1004
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:25,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.

1005
01:21:27,864 --> 01:21:28,625
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1006
01:21:51,885 --> 01:21:54,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I see a couple people in chat are making a reference to Michael Jackson.

1007
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:56,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, I'll read this comment from Sterlok.

1008
01:21:56,469 --> 01:21:57,330
[SPEAKER_08]: He has his own game coming.

1009
01:22:07,034 --> 01:22:07,675
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

1010
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:25,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I already have a theory of what Drum Hero is.

1011
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:29,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be something for either the DSi or an iPhone.

1012
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:35,614
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about it, Guitar Hero can't do that on the DSi because there's no place to plug the guitar in.

1013
01:22:36,014 --> 01:22:41,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But you better believe it, that drum skin that they put out for Band Hero, the DS version, can fit on the DSi.

1014
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:42,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's your drum.

1015
01:22:43,547 --> 01:23:01,792
[SPEAKER_08]: drum hero that's actually one of the more creative thoughts I've heard is that maybe a lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that this is like a sequel to Guitar Hero but maybe it's an iPhone port makes a lot of freaking sense it'd be kind of neat to do something on Xbox Live Arcade or something like that too you know then that way you don't need a guitar you can just play it with your you know buttons hmm

1016
01:23:02,512 --> 01:23:03,673
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a very interesting prospect.

1017
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Vib Ribbon

1018
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:54,575
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some songs in Lego Rock Band I want to play, but not the whole thing.

1019
01:23:54,975 --> 01:23:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll probably buy the game just to import the songs, but when it's in the clearance bin.

1020
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:04,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Because right now, $50 for the game plus another $10 for the import fees, I'm not feeling it.

1021
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:08,783
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game will end up in the bargain bin inevitably at some point, so I'll buy it then.

1022
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:14,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting with all of these SKUs, if you want to say, or games coming out,

1023
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:16,925
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1024
01:24:32,094 --> 01:24:35,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised that Boom Boom Rocket, was that what it was called?

1025
01:24:35,835 --> 01:24:37,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that game that came out on Xbox?

1026
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually really good at that game.

1027
01:24:38,596 --> 01:24:40,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a bunch of high scores for a while.

1028
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably don't anymore.

1029
01:24:41,716 --> 01:24:47,098
[SPEAKER_08]: But Boom Boom Rocket, I'm kind of surprised they never did anything with that.

1030
01:24:47,638 --> 01:24:49,618
[SPEAKER_08]: All the songs in that were classical songs.

1031
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:56,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine if they had actually put some licensed songs or some fun techno things into that shell.

1032
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,861
[SPEAKER_08]: That game could have been a whole lot more.

1033
01:24:59,061 --> 01:24:59,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it would have been cool.

1034
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:13,093
[SPEAKER_08]: and then of course, the inevitable Bobby's Yelling Out, Beat and Groovy but that game was always just doomed for disaster we all knew Konami was not going to have the faith to try and get licensed songs there by the way, did you realize Poppin' Music Wii came out?

1035
01:25:13,273 --> 01:25:27,619
[SPEAKER_08]: no, somebody in chat said it, and I actually kind of went and went, oh yeah, that came out, huh but I just don't have interest in it oh by the way, it's coming out sell some copies did you sell some copies?

1036
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:30,901
[SPEAKER_08]: nope just curious not a copy

1037
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I know better than the torch of my customers like that

1038
01:25:58,164 --> 01:25:59,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got dates!

1039
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:00,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Realistic.

1040
01:26:00,646 --> 01:26:00,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1041
01:26:00,946 --> 01:26:03,507
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing's been the figment of my imagination for about four years.

1042
01:26:05,748 --> 01:26:16,715
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposed to have a simultaneous PS3 and Xbox 360 release for Final Fantasy XIII in the US and in Europe on the 9th of March, 2010.

1043
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:19,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey, we've only got a few more months to go.

1044
01:26:20,557 --> 01:26:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you're in Japan, you get it next month.

1045
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:35,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of interesting because the turnaround, you know, they promised that it was going to be a much quicker turnaround this time, but they really made it happen, you know, especially considering there's a 360 port in the works as well.

1046
01:26:35,675 --> 01:26:41,720
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a four-month turnaround by Square standards really doesn't seem all that bad when you were at least looking at nine months before.

1047
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, how long did it take for Final Fantasy X to come over here from the Japanese one?

1048
01:26:45,703 --> 01:26:46,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty.

1049
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, almost a year, right?

1050
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

1051
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:49,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1052
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:49,907
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1053
01:26:51,546 --> 01:26:55,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked, though, that they did this whole announcement in this big trailer.

1054
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just this big event of a game.

1055
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:00,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I guess Final Fantasy XIII does deserve that a little bit.

1056
01:27:00,974 --> 01:27:04,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But Square's got a lot riding on this game, don't they?

1057
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:10,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they tend to throw a lot of their stuff in on their Final Fantasy franchise.

1058
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is really what I would say has kept them on the map.

1059
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:16,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't remember all this fanfare over XII.

1060
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:17,527
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

1061
01:27:17,887 --> 01:27:18,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, XII was kind of.

1062
01:27:18,908 --> 01:27:19,709
[SPEAKER_09]: As there shouldn't have been.

1063
01:27:20,743 --> 01:27:21,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked XII.

1064
01:27:22,024 --> 01:27:23,745
[SPEAKER_08]: XII just came out at a very bad time.

1065
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,806
[SPEAKER_08]: XII should have been made for the PS3 and 360.

1066
01:27:26,286 --> 01:27:28,568
[SPEAKER_08]: It just came out at a bad time.

1067
01:27:28,728 --> 01:27:32,930
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have just delayed it a year and put it on the next, now gen or whatever you want to call them, consoles.

1068
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1069
01:27:34,731 --> 01:27:37,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say that the guy in the trailer was a douche.

1070
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:39,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a little bit.

1071
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:40,775
[SPEAKER_09]: He had kind of a douchey vibe, didn't he?

1072
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:45,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's like, you know, it's kind of typical of them to do something very fanfare like that because...

1073
01:27:46,224 --> 01:27:46,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Lyonna Lewis The Theme Song

1074
01:28:09,002 --> 01:28:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So here in the US and UK, but not in Japan.

1075
01:28:13,265 --> 01:28:19,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're actually having different artists, which is kind of new because even when they localized the Kingdom Hearts song, it was still Utada, Hikaru.

1076
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's also bilingual.

1077
01:28:21,691 --> 01:28:23,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I got concert tickets for her in January.

1078
01:28:23,072 --> 01:28:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited.

1079
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:29,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, but what was I going to say before I got sidetracked with that?

1080
01:28:29,196 --> 01:28:34,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is the first time that they've had like a different artist singing it over here, right?

1081
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,020
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1082
01:28:35,281 --> 01:28:35,961
[SPEAKER_08]: No, did they do that with 12?

1083
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:37,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

1084
01:28:37,202 --> 01:28:37,882
[SPEAKER_05]: They did that with 10 too.

1085
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:39,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it the same?

1086
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the same song.

1087
01:28:41,897 --> 01:28:43,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I forgot about 10-2.

1088
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:44,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1089
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:48,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they got What's Her Face from Jade.

1090
01:28:48,462 --> 01:28:50,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sweet Box or whatever it was called.

1091
01:28:50,523 --> 01:28:51,104
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1092
01:28:51,144 --> 01:28:51,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot about that.

1093
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:52,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was really shocked.

1094
01:28:53,005 --> 01:28:58,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And they changed one of the ending videos in the U.S.

1095
01:28:58,509 --> 01:28:59,770
[SPEAKER_05]: version from the Japanese version.

1096
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually changed it because of her differences in singing it.

1097
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:05,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1098
01:29:05,871 --> 01:29:11,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, the song that's going to be in Final Fantasy XIII is a song called My Hands.

1099
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:13,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually on Leona Lewis' next album.

1100
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:18,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're curious what the power ballad of Final Fantasy XIII is going to sound like, we have a little sneak peek for you right here.

1101
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:20,936
[SPEAKER_08]: We can only play a little clip of it because it's all copyright and stuff.

1102
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:21,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a sneak peek.

1103
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:39,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like your typical, like, sitting in the dentist's office, kind of, you know, Celine Dion station, you know, power ballad music, you know.

1104
01:29:40,188 --> 01:29:43,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of typical of the Final Fantasy ballads.

1105
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually does sound pretty J-pop ballad, actually.

1106
01:29:48,473 --> 01:29:49,053
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

1107
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:59,359
[SPEAKER_09]: What if they announce something horrible like Popo Sao or something like... Sexy Back is the theme song of Final Fantasy XIII.

1108
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:01,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Sexy Back, yeah.

1109
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,042
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's Final Fantasy XIII versus Sexy Back.

1110
01:30:04,986 --> 01:30:10,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go, Leona Lewis, which actually, you know, I gotta say, though, that's a pretty good-sized name to land.

1111
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:11,332
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what's funny?

1112
01:30:11,352 --> 01:30:12,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who her record label is?

1113
01:30:13,013 --> 01:30:13,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony.

1114
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:21,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So, kind of, who knows, maybe a little bit of networking there, but Leona Lewis, you know, that's a pretty, you know, it's not a triple-A artist, but she's hot shit right now.

1115
01:30:22,241 --> 01:30:26,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, because of the Sony license, Xbox 360 version will be getting popos out.

1116
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:27,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1117
01:30:28,635 --> 01:30:51,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the UK but uh she's she's big over here in fact she's the only celebrity from a British reality show except maybe Susan Boyle that is well known over here whereas I'm assuming over there they probably have a lot of our American idols so they're probably not all of them I can't imagine people like Taylor Hicks are big in the UK but probably Kelly Clarkson and

1118
01:30:51,793 --> 01:30:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those people are big in the UK.

1119
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that's a pretty decent-sized name to have.

1120
01:30:58,424 --> 01:31:00,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not forget, folks, that's...

1121
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for some people, it's not necessarily a draw, but it makes a lot of people do a double take.

1122
01:31:06,845 --> 01:31:24,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of, you know, I don't think anybody's going to buy this game because Leona Lewis is in it, but it's definitely going to make a lot of people go, hey, it's going to make some of these critics of video games are not a legitimate art form or video games are not on the same level as movies and TV shows kind of turn their heads and go, oh, oh, Leona Lewis is doing the theme song.

1123
01:31:24,737 --> 01:31:25,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1124
01:31:25,337 --> 01:31:26,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that's interesting.

1125
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only because they approached Bryan Adams first and he turned him down.

1126
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:30,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1127
01:31:31,262 --> 01:31:33,083
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the king of power ballads.

1128
01:31:34,064 --> 01:31:34,344
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1129
01:31:34,404 --> 01:31:40,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of release dates, let's check out some closer release dates to, you know, like this week.

1130
01:31:40,489 --> 01:31:44,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, since you finished a bite of your wing there, I'll start with the U.S.

[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing coming out this week.

1133
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:46,894
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you talking about?

1134
01:31:48,735 --> 01:31:49,416
[SPEAKER_09]: No really good stuff.

1135
01:31:49,436 --> 01:31:49,896
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually...

1136
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:51,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of stuff.

1137
01:31:51,432 --> 01:31:58,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Depends though what area of the world you're in or United States because that stuff might have already come out with people breaking street date because they suck.

1138
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:06,899
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but of course this week Left 4 Dead 2 making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not PlayStation 3, PC.

01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:21,562

1149
01:33:22,503 --> 01:33:28,290
[SPEAKER_09]: The re-release of Stoked, the bigger edition, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.

01:33:30,157 --> 01:33:40,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Ubisoft pimping out their Pets games with Pets Hamster Superstars featuring what appears to be a rollerblading hamster, which is very disturbing.

[SPEAKER_09]: LEGO Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC this week.

[SPEAKER_09]: 50s Tag Force 4 on PSP

1157
01:34:19,665 --> 01:34:25,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Dance from Ubisoft out on the Wii, which the game looks absolutely ridiculous.

1158
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:31,871
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember that stupid minigame that they made me play instead of the sledding one I wanted to play in Rayman's Raven Rabbids TV Party?

1159
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:32,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember this.

1160
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:33,812
[SPEAKER_08]: This was at PAX, right?

1161
01:34:33,832 --> 01:34:34,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Did that happen?

1162
01:34:34,692 --> 01:34:35,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was.

1163
01:34:35,653 --> 01:34:38,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, this game is very similar to that, so...

1164
01:34:40,822 --> 01:34:42,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, you'd probably look ridiculous playing it.

1165
01:34:43,885 --> 01:34:44,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie will get a kick out of this.

1166

01:34:52,632 --> 01:34:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to France.

1169
01:34:54,234 --> 01:34:58,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on safari.

1170
01:34:58,737 --> 01:34:59,678
[SPEAKER_08]: On France.

01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go to the Louvre.

1172
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:06,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I can take my fake character out for a baguette.

1173
01:35:07,045 --> 01:35:08,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Be our guest, be our guest.

1174
01:35:10,635 --> 01:35:11,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Loki.

1175
01:35:11,356 --> 01:35:13,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I read some quick chat comments, though, because there's some really funny shit.

1176
01:35:13,337 --> 01:35:14,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's only in that voice, though.

1177
01:35:14,879 --> 01:35:15,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then.

1178
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:17,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I will read some comments from Jet.

1179
01:35:18,222 --> 01:35:26,389
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 and Matt says that as far as the Final Fantasy theme song goes, Christopher Walken doing Poker Face should be in it.

1180
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:28,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking so much that.

1181
01:35:28,571 --> 01:35:30,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Christopher Walken doing anything should be in a video game.

1182
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:31,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Cartman doing Poker Face.

1183
01:35:32,757 --> 01:35:35,278
[SPEAKER_08]: or Cartman doing poker face or kind of like a mishmash of both.

1184
01:35:36,058 --> 01:35:37,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, some strange chat.

1185
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:42,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't read this whole thing, but they were talking about sales figures for DJ Hero.

1186
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Some chatters calling it a flop, but I didn't realize it was a flop.

1187
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:52,442
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I thought I saw some article this week that just in those first few days, like because the game came out, what, October 27th?

1188
01:35:52,802 --> 01:35:55,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And just in those last few days, it sold like 100,000 copies or something?

1189
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:56,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1190
01:35:56,383 --> 01:36:03,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, that's across four different platforms, and I think maybe like 3,000 were sold on the PS2, but, you know, you figure they're not gonna sell well there.

1191
01:36:03,445 --> 01:36:05,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a little early to call that game a flop, right?

1192
01:36:06,146 --> 01:36:13,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think it's sold as, you know, much as, say, like a Guitar Hero game, but then again, it's also way more expensive than a Guitar Hero game, so...

1193
01:36:14,423 --> 01:36:15,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 1

1194
01:36:36,451 --> 01:36:37,072
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1195
01:36:53,889 --> 01:37:22,460
[SPEAKER_08]: it is the best music game song list for an initial game in a series ever I wouldn't go so far to say as I enjoy it as much as say maybe the third mix or the sixth mix or sixth style or whatever of other games but I will say as far as an initial song list goes for a franchise launching music game it's the best song list there has ever been in a music game ever yeah

1196
01:37:23,581 --> 01:37:25,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, continuing on release dates.

1197
01:37:25,963 --> 01:37:26,663
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a big one.

1198
01:37:26,743 --> 01:37:28,624
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet coming to the PSP this week.

1199
01:37:28,865 --> 01:37:29,845
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be pretty exciting.

1200
01:37:31,446 --> 01:37:35,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Disney's The Princess and the Frog, not so exciting on DS and Wii this week.

1201
01:37:35,589 --> 01:37:36,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I want to see that movie.

1202
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:37,290
[SPEAKER_09]: You shut up, hater.

1203
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but the game's not going to be great.

1204
01:37:39,011 --> 01:37:39,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the game's going to be stupid.

1205
01:37:40,012 --> 01:37:42,854
[SPEAKER_09]: The movie will be cool, but the game, not so much.

1206
01:37:44,695 --> 01:37:47,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And talk about random licenses, D3.

1207
01:37:47,657 --> 01:37:50,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Kamen Rider Dragon Knight on the Wii and DS.

1208
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:51,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1209
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:58,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Photo Frenzy on the Nintendo DS from Kokum International.

1210
01:37:58,369 --> 01:38:00,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I remember correctly, I thought that was a DSi-only game.

1211
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:01,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not.

1212
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Pets, Dogs, Talent Show.

1213
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:10,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet another animal that's dressed up and on a skateboard coming to the DS from Ubisoft.

1214
01:38:10,832 --> 01:38:12,852
[SPEAKER_09]: God forbid they do that to animals.

1215
01:38:13,673 --> 01:38:13,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1216
01:38:15,086 --> 01:38:15,906
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of cool.

1217
01:38:16,126 --> 01:38:18,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue coming to the Wii this week.

1218
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:25,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, I remember talking about that like weeks and weeks ago that it was coming out for the Wii and now just out of nowhere here it is, right?

1219
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:25,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom, there it is.

1220
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:26,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.

1221
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:27,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Jumbo Safari.

1222
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine Artist on the Nintendo DS.

1223
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:32,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1224
01:38:33,272 --> 01:38:34,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And some smaller games.

1225
01:38:34,513 --> 01:38:35,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Rec Room on the Wii.

1226
01:38:39,795 --> 01:38:40,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's about it.

1227
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week though, Hello Kitty Party on DS.

1228
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:45,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo freaking hoo.

1229
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:48,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to some Japanese releases and some of the things you have to look forward to over there.

1230
01:38:49,292 --> 01:38:58,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like we have Left 4 Dead 2 coming out over here, you have that coming out in Japan as well in their own version coming out on the 19th because they get their releases on Fridays if I remember right.

1231
01:38:59,314 --> 01:39:02,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, I think they come out like Thursday or something.

1232
01:39:02,814 --> 01:39:04,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And over there it's called Ha!

1233
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:06,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Zombies!

1234
01:39:24,426 --> 01:39:25,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Tycho Notatujen

1235
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:51,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Callin' Kuroki Chakushin

1236
01:40:06,431 --> 01:40:10,732
[SPEAKER_08]: or something and it looks to be like a kind of a scarier game that's coming out on the Wii.

1237
01:40:11,052 --> 01:40:21,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any screenshots but definitely it's got one of those like Japanese grudge looking girls on the front and then like a little cell phone so I think it's has something to do with like cell phone horror or something.

1238
01:40:22,314 --> 01:40:25,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly what cell phone horror would be but this game is it.

1239
01:40:25,735 --> 01:40:29,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey on the PlayStation 2 your monthly bill from AT&T with an iPhone.

1240
01:40:33,024 --> 01:40:37,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Loki, sometimes I feel like there should be a two-drink minimum to listen to this show with you on it.

1241

[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 2, Seke, Saikyou, Gensi, Ego, Kuza.

1244
01:40:52,995 --> 01:40:56,717

1245
01:40:57,238 --> 01:40:59,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's like an anniversary, actually, of Hello Kitty.

1246
01:41:00,017 --> 01:41:00,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so too.

1247

01:42:13,206 --> 01:42:14,986
[SPEAKER_09]: They're super intelligent over Ubisoft.

1267
01:42:15,006 --> 01:42:16,187
[SPEAKER_09]: They decided, hey, you know what?

1268
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:26,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the Wii has this wonderful motion capture system with Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, we're going to use a webcam to capture your movement just like the eye toy.

1269
01:42:26,369 --> 01:42:29,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just worried about the shape it's going to tell me I am.

[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, you are a pear.

1271
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:34,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, you're shaped like Rosie O'Donnell.

1272
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:36,211
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1273
01:42:39,432 --> 01:42:40,572
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a leopard.

1274
01:42:41,312 --> 01:42:41,452
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1275
01:42:42,972 --> 01:42:43,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he make A-sets?

1276
01:42:43,933 --> 01:42:45,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1277
01:42:47,855 --> 01:42:48,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's keep moving on.

1278
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:52,678
[SPEAKER_08]: He realizes Part A is going on two hours tonight just for Part A. Good times.

1279
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:55,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we've been gone a week.

1280
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's jumping and excited.

1281
01:42:57,361 --> 01:42:59,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Fitness, that's fun and focused on you.

1282
01:42:59,723 --> 01:43:03,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny McCarthy's just excited to have a job this week.

1283
01:43:03,505 --> 01:43:04,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, what has she done?

1284
01:43:06,007 --> 01:43:09,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides, I think, a National Lampoon movie, maybe, here and there?

1285
01:43:10,168 --> 01:43:12,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, a few more stories and then do a break already.

1286
01:43:12,517 --> 01:43:12,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord.

1287
01:43:14,484 --> 01:43:14,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1288
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:16,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I have another story?

1289
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:17,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1290
01:43:17,966 --> 01:43:18,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't release dates.

1291
01:43:18,426 --> 01:43:18,746
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your turn.

1292
01:43:18,766 --> 01:43:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about Jenny McCarthy and how... The hell with her.

1293
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:28,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, Modern Warfare 2, of course, selling lots and lots and lots of copies.

1294
01:43:28,934 --> 01:43:37,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, in the UK, it sold 1.23 million units, the first day breaking first day sales records over there.

1295
01:43:37,741 --> 01:43:39,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty awesome.

1296
01:43:39,183 --> 01:43:41,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess everybody loves Modern Warfare over there.

1297
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:44,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, in the US...

1298
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:54,179
[SPEAKER_09]: 4.7 million units in day one sales, making it probably the biggest game this year and the biggest game for quite a while.

1299
01:43:54,459 --> 01:43:57,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yay!

1300
01:43:57,482 --> 01:43:59,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1301
01:44:00,782 --> 01:44:01,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan Storr

1302
01:44:16,821 --> 01:44:19,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey look, it's gamers waiting for a game!

1303
01:44:19,423 --> 01:44:21,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my goodness, that pandemonium!

1304
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because people need to be reminded for some reason that video games are a huge business.

1305
01:44:26,889 --> 01:44:33,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, this game probably made more money than most of the box office did this weekend.

1306
01:44:33,594 --> 01:44:35,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what was the big movie this weekend?

1307
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:36,056
[SPEAKER_08]: 2012 or whatever?

1308
01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:37,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think it...

1309
01:44:38,698 --> 01:44:40,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even if it made $100 million, which I don't think it did.

1310
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:42,899
[SPEAKER_09]: That's half the movie's budget right there.

1311
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's probably still less than what Modern Warfare 2 made.

1312
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, of course, the game is, what, $60 or it's a movie ticket.

1313
01:44:51,722 --> 01:44:53,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to spoil anything about 2012.

1314
01:44:54,142 --> 01:44:54,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see it?

1315
01:44:54,923 --> 01:44:56,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I went and saw it earlier today.

1316
01:44:56,363 --> 01:44:57,643
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks ridiculous.

1317
01:44:57,723 --> 01:44:58,624
[SPEAKER_09]: It is ridiculous.

1318
01:44:59,604 --> 01:45:06,826
[SPEAKER_09]: After the fourth time, count it, fourth time that they took off on a runway and outrunning an earthquake.

1319
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,731
[SPEAKER_09]: That happened multiple times in this movie.

1320
01:45:10,651 --> 01:45:11,652
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just like, really?

1321
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:12,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1322
01:45:12,772 --> 01:45:14,413
[SPEAKER_08]: These movies are just getting ridiculous.

1323
01:45:14,453 --> 01:45:14,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1324
01:45:14,793 --> 01:45:18,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize there's an audience for these movies, and clearly it's Loki.

1325
01:45:18,734 --> 01:45:23,176
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, Independence Day, I watched.

1326
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:24,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I was all excited about it.

1327
01:45:24,596 --> 01:45:25,156
[SPEAKER_08]: It was cool.

1328
01:45:25,577 --> 01:45:28,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Day after tomorrow, I was kind of like, okay, really?

1329
01:45:28,978 --> 01:45:31,959
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running away from, like, weather blasts and things like this?

1330
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:34,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, you can outrun weather, okay?

1331
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fact.

1332
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1333
01:45:52,714 --> 01:45:53,454
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1334
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:19,830
[SPEAKER_08]: is his job.

1335
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:21,252
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a failed author.

1336
01:46:21,372 --> 01:46:21,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, really?

1337
01:46:35,976 --> 01:46:37,778
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's actually very funny.

1338
01:46:38,258 --> 01:46:42,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, there's multiple times that they're flying the plane out of things.

1339
01:46:42,703 --> 01:46:44,525
[SPEAKER_09]: They outran a volcano blast.

1340
01:46:44,925 --> 01:46:47,488
[SPEAKER_09]: They outran building toppling.

1341
01:46:47,788 --> 01:46:55,296
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the plane taking off from a landing strip and somehow sinking into the ground?

1342
01:46:55,896 --> 01:46:59,100
[SPEAKER_09]: They were pulling up on the plane, yet going deep into the ground.

1343
01:47:00,017 --> 01:47:00,217
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1344
01:47:00,777 --> 01:47:04,959
[SPEAKER_08]: It just... I'm sorry, there's a point where I'm like, this is just too much.

1345
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:07,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And this movie looks to be too much.

1346
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,140
[SPEAKER_09]: As I know, it was completely ridiculous.

1347
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:09,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was.

1348
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:13,162
[SPEAKER_09]: It lived up to its ridiculousness.

1349
01:47:13,692 --> 01:47:19,275
[SPEAKER_08]: On the ridiculous scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not so ridiculous and 10 being completely fucking ridiculous, how ridiculous is 2012?

1350
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:26,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I would give this an 8.5 because a 10 I think would have to be Wild Zero because Wild Zero is so ridiculous.

1351
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,961
[SPEAKER_09]: They chopped a UFO in half with a samurai sword.

1352
01:47:29,441 --> 01:47:30,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a punk band.

1353
01:47:31,102 --> 01:47:33,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, the samurai sword I think came out of his guitar.

1354
01:47:33,884 --> 01:47:36,706
[SPEAKER_09]: That movie sounds awesome.

1355
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:37,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was zombie love.

1356
01:47:38,066 --> 01:47:38,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got your copy.

1357
01:47:40,608 --> 01:47:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot I even have that movie.

1358
01:47:43,547 --> 01:47:43,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

1359
01:47:44,388 --> 01:47:47,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And any movie that has Guitar Wolf in it instantly rolls.

1360
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:55,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and Tiger Claw wants to clarify, 2012 has made $225 million worldwide and $65 million domestically.

1361
01:47:55,114 --> 01:48:00,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And he sources ComingSoon.net as the source for the monetary figures.

1362
01:48:01,678 --> 01:48:06,060
[SPEAKER_08]: But probably Modern Warfare 2 still makes more money in the week that it's out than this movie did.

1363
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just huge.

1364
01:48:07,421 --> 01:48:08,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, though, it seriously...

1365
01:48:10,245 --> 01:48:11,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good movie to watch.

1366
01:48:11,266 --> 01:48:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

1367
01:48:12,386 --> 01:48:13,307
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's why you watch it.

1368
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:15,288
[SPEAKER_09]: It would make an awesome Riff Trax movie.

1369
01:48:15,449 --> 01:48:17,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, it's going to make an awesome Riff Trax movie.

1370
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:21,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, back to Modern Warfare for a minute because I really, really don't care about 2012 anymore.

1371
01:48:22,313 --> 01:48:26,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I do care, though, about that Facebook group about shut the fuck up, the world's not going to end in 2012.

1372
01:48:26,816 --> 01:48:27,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That cracked me up.

1373
01:48:27,837 --> 01:48:28,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I signed up for that.

1374
01:48:28,817 --> 01:48:29,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1375
01:48:29,998 --> 01:48:38,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I signed up last week for an undisclosed amount of people arbitrarily signing up for a cause or something like that.

1376
01:48:38,604 --> 01:48:39,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I signed up for that.

1377
01:48:39,184 --> 01:48:39,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

1378
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:41,345
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an app for that.

1379
01:48:41,946 --> 01:48:44,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, back to Modern Warfare 2.

1380
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:46,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing I don't understand.

1381
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:58,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I need somebody to translate for me and for some reason I feel like you would understand this game better than I do because I'm not knocking the game, but keep in mind these type of war sims are not really my thing.

1382
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:03,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is it about this game that is making it sell zillions?

1383
01:49:04,072 --> 01:49:06,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, it is in fact selling zillions.

1384
01:49:07,693 --> 01:49:07,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

1385
01:49:08,769 --> 01:49:09,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1386
01:49:22,981 --> 01:49:24,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatters, feel free to help me out, too.

1387
01:49:24,422 --> 01:49:28,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is Modern Warfare 2 such a landmark game?

1388
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very gritty.

1389
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:33,450
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing undercover.

1390
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:44,298
[SPEAKER_09]: In the beginning, I think you're undercover as part of a terrorist cell because you're infiltrating them from the inside, but you have to murder people and stuff like that, innocent people in an airport and whatnot, seeing they've got controversy or whatever.

1391
01:49:44,318 --> 01:49:49,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it kind of trying to ride on that whole America, fuck yeah wave?

1392
01:49:49,343 --> 01:49:49,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1393
01:49:50,323 --> 01:49:58,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's America and a bunch of other countries are getting all fucked over because there's one part where you're like, you know, storming the White House because terrorists have taken it over.

1394
01:49:58,585 --> 01:50:03,866
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, it's kind of, yeah, you know, fighting terrorism is cool.

1395
01:50:03,926 --> 01:50:05,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And the online's really sweet.

1396
01:50:05,226 --> 01:50:11,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I think of like a, guys, I don't know, like a Halo 3 or something like that because Halo 3 had a really short campaign and the online was awesome.

1397
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:13,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the same with Modern Warfare 2.

1398
01:50:13,508 --> 01:50:16,109
[SPEAKER_09]: The campaign's pretty cool, short, but it's awesome.

1399
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:21,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says even PC boycotters are playing Modern Warfare 2.

1400
01:50:21,772 --> 01:50:25,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see that screenshot of like all the people in the boycott group on Steam were playing the game.

1401
01:50:26,574 --> 01:50:32,636
[SPEAKER_08]: My god, if I could sum up like arguing on the internet in a picture, like you know how they say a picture is worth a thousand words?

1402
01:50:32,656 --> 01:50:36,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if I had to explain debate on the internet, like that picture does it right there.

1403
01:50:36,698 --> 01:50:39,979
[SPEAKER_08]: That is trying to debate someone on the internet summed up into a picture.

1404
01:50:43,777 --> 01:50:46,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the same thing when Left 4 Dead 2 comes out this week.

1405
01:50:46,658 --> 01:50:48,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Go snap a picture of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.

1406
01:50:48,919 --> 01:50:50,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet there's shitloads of people playing it.

1407
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:51,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because you know what?

1408
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:53,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're sheep.

1409
01:50:53,542 --> 01:50:56,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're like, ah, but I want to play it.

1410
01:50:56,223 --> 01:50:56,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I will.

1411
01:50:58,604 --> 01:51:03,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll justify it saying, oh, well, they took care of what I needed them to take care of.

1412
01:51:03,607 --> 01:51:04,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Or whatever.

1413
01:51:05,428 --> 01:51:05,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1414
01:51:06,348 --> 01:51:09,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiltipo in chat says it's a manly macho game that makes people feel tough.

1415
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a modern version of when we used to go outside and play like Army Man or whatever.

1416
01:51:17,006 --> 01:51:17,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Make-believe.

1417
01:51:18,127 --> 01:51:20,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's just all... Pleased to bury the G.I.

1418
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:21,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Joes in a mass graveyard.

1419
01:51:22,685 --> 01:51:23,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1420
01:51:24,706 --> 01:51:25,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm not knocking the game.

1421
01:51:26,548 --> 01:51:32,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess for what it is, it's a landmark game and certainly the graphics I've seen look very realistic and everything.

1422
01:51:32,171 --> 01:51:37,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize just not every game I'm going to get and that's just the way it is.

1423
01:51:37,455 --> 01:51:40,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like there's a lot of people that probably sit here and go, really?

1424
01:51:40,637 --> 01:51:42,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they play so many music games?

1425
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:44,179
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk all the time about music games and I think they're stupid.

1426
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's just into whatever they're into.

1427
01:51:46,381 --> 01:51:52,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I just was kind of curious why this game above the countless other war games that are released.

1428
01:51:53,885 --> 01:52:00,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, got one more news story for you guys, and we're going to get into the classic video game of the week, and this actually has to do with the Zune.

1429
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:05,088
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we talk a lot about iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, you know, and all the gaming that's going on there.

1430
01:52:05,128 --> 01:52:09,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, certainly Microsoft wants a piece of that, too, with their own handheld device, the Zune.

1431
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:16,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And while the Zune doesn't make phone calls, the Zune does play movies, listen to music, and now it will do games, too.

1432
01:52:17,091 --> 01:52:17,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1433
01:52:18,243 --> 01:52:19,924
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new firmware update that happened.

1434
01:52:19,944 --> 01:52:23,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 4.3, and apparently there are now six free games on the Zoom Marketplace.

1435
01:52:23,906 --> 01:52:24,627
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, free.

1436
01:52:25,047 --> 01:52:33,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Gotham Racing Ferrari Edition, Lucky Lane Bowling, Vans Skate Pool Service, Piano, Checkers, you know, classic game in there too.

1437
01:52:34,712 --> 01:52:43,476
[SPEAKER_08]: and a game called Audio Surf Tilt which is a port of sorts of the popular game Audio Surf that was available on the PC where you can use your own MP3s.

1438
01:52:43,516 --> 01:52:44,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually played that game.

1439
01:52:44,276 --> 01:52:44,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite a bit of fun.

1440
01:52:45,237 --> 01:52:48,738
[SPEAKER_08]: If you like music games, speaking of which, Audio Surf is a nice little investment.

1441
01:52:48,758 --> 01:52:49,619
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a fun game.

1442
01:52:50,339 --> 01:52:51,920
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you can play that on the Zune as well.

1443
01:52:54,423 --> 01:52:58,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, Zune's kind of trying to step it up there a little bit as a portable device.

1444
01:52:58,705 --> 01:53:06,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, I'm sorry, not just a portable device, but, you know, kind of up there with the iPhone with its all-in-one kind of device there.

1445
01:53:06,707 --> 01:53:13,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those that were asking, you know, when is Microsoft going to get into handheld gaming, I guess this is what we've got, at least so far.

1446
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:16,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know, any interest in these games?

1447
01:53:17,758 --> 01:53:24,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious what Project Gotham looks like and the audio surf I'm certainly interested in, especially if it plays off your MP3s from the Zune.

1448
01:53:24,281 --> 01:53:25,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's pretty cool.

1449
01:53:26,501 --> 01:53:29,983
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I wouldn't drop several hundred dollars on the Zune just to check it out.

1450
01:53:30,043 --> 01:53:35,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering when the hell they're going to actually release the X and A stuff on the Zune.

1451
01:53:35,045 --> 01:53:35,745
[SPEAKER_09]: When's that happening?

1452
01:53:35,785 --> 01:53:37,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard something like that was supposed to happen, huh?

1453
01:53:39,326 --> 01:53:40,367
[SPEAKER_08]: They talked about it a while ago.

1454
01:53:42,157 --> 01:53:45,138
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what video game did you pick for the kiddies tonight?

1455
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:45,539
[SPEAKER_08]: River City Ransom!

1456
01:53:45,559 --> 01:53:45,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

1457
01:54:11,262 --> 01:54:12,368
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the vault's cold.

1458
01:54:14,468 --> 01:54:16,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you very cold going into the vault to pick out the game?

1459
01:54:18,511 --> 01:54:24,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, even though I love the NES version, I'm picking a specific one, and that's the example that have given us for our YouTube.

1460
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:33,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Downtown Neketsu Monogatari, which is Downtown Hot-Blooded Story.

1461
01:54:34,381 --> 01:54:36,223
[SPEAKER_05]: In the PAL region, it came out as Street Games.

1462
01:54:38,304 --> 01:54:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of the Kunio games.

1463
01:54:39,805 --> 01:54:41,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can hear the music is a little different here.

1464
01:54:42,307 --> 01:54:43,467
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, let me play a little clip here.

1465
01:54:44,949 --> 01:54:54,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to find this on my main cabinet You can play PC Engine games on your main?

1466
01:54:55,148 --> 01:54:55,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can play anything I want.

1467
01:54:56,008 --> 01:54:57,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you've got the emulator set up.

1468
01:54:57,509 --> 01:55:05,813
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, this is... There are also versions for the X68000, the Game Boy Advance.

1469
01:55:07,154 --> 01:55:08,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out on Virtual Console.

1470
01:55:08,655 --> 01:55:23,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, since it's one of the Kunio games, you know, and with Neketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, which was Renegade, and Neketsu Koko Dodgeball-bu, which was Super Dodgeball, which I have covered...

1471
01:55:24,503 --> 01:55:27,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that was a previous game you did because I love Super Dodgeball.

1472
01:55:28,366 --> 01:55:31,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically you were playing high school kids in the Japanese version.

1473
01:55:31,849 --> 01:55:39,055
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Kunio, Enriki, and over here it's Alex and Ryan as they go to try to rescue the girl.

1474
01:55:40,396 --> 01:55:46,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And by going against different, I guess, you know, delinquent gangs or whatever.

1475
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:53,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just a little street brawler, you know, walk down the street, punch some people, and then you stop in for, you know, a burger.

1476
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: and a free smile.

1477
01:55:55,435 --> 01:55:56,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And a free smile.

1478
01:55:56,536 --> 01:56:03,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you also of course have passwords so you can start off in different parts of the game.

1479
01:56:04,342 --> 01:56:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did pick this one in particular.

1480
01:56:07,605 --> 01:56:11,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, actually I needed to mention some differences between the Japanese version.

1481
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:17,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually changed the school uniforms into t-shirts and jeans.

1482
01:56:17,953 --> 01:56:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that type of stuff.

1483
01:56:21,276 --> 01:56:22,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, now you just noticed...

1484
01:56:23,427 --> 01:56:23,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello!

1485
01:56:23,607 --> 01:56:25,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to make a request?

1486
01:56:25,648 --> 01:56:27,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do whatever I want.

1487
01:56:53,067 --> 01:56:54,348
[SPEAKER_08]: This game was also famous for having a butt.

1488
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

1489
01:57:17,411 --> 01:57:17,971
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember that?

1490
01:57:18,371 --> 01:57:19,312
[SPEAKER_08]: In the sauna sequence?

1491
01:57:19,772 --> 01:57:20,533
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw a butt.

1492
01:57:21,614 --> 01:57:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was probably just a public bath or, you know, whatever.

1493
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:27,659
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

1494
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:29,520
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the other bit.

1495
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:30,041
[SPEAKER_00]: More voice acting.

1496
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:33,743
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a little, you know, TurboGrafx-16 style cartridge.

1497
01:57:33,783 --> 01:57:33,884
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1498
01:57:33,904 --> 01:57:33,964
[SPEAKER_00]: No?

1499
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: This was PCCD, PC Engine CD.

1500
01:57:45,872 --> 01:57:51,675
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, that wasn't the most technologically advanced, I mean at the time it was, but it's pretty impressive.

1501
01:57:52,156 --> 01:57:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You had Redbook Audio with this, you had voice acting because it had a higher storage capacity.

1502
01:57:57,319 --> 01:58:06,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you heard the vocal intro for Dracula X on PC Engine, so it could definitely do it.

1503
01:58:06,644 --> 01:58:08,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pre-record it and have it go up.

1504
01:58:09,045 --> 01:58:14,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just interesting because I never really knew this version was here, even though I loved River City Ransom as a kid, and I see everybody in chat, BARF!

1505
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody remembers some of the great dialogue that we got over here, which I'm sure was just great localization, but it came out very funny.

1506
01:58:24,258 --> 01:58:26,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like the original English, if you will.

1507
01:58:27,501 --> 01:58:30,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I highly doubt that's what they were saying in the Japanese thing, was BARF.

1508
01:58:31,812 --> 01:58:43,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, the company that localized it was American Technos, which was a subsidiary of Technos Japan.

1509
01:58:44,818 --> 01:58:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually brought out another Kunio game that came out over here.

1510
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:55,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Crashin' the Boys Street Challenge, although it's more of the same type, but not really super, super linked.

1511
01:58:56,082 --> 01:58:57,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, in Japan, that one was...

1512
01:59:00,104 --> 01:59:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: and Bikkuri Neketsu Shin Kiroku Harukanaru Kin Medal, which was Astonishing Hot-Blooded New Records Distant Gold Medals.

1513
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:11,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah.

1514
01:59:13,272 --> 01:59:15,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how they like to butcher names and everything when they come out.

1515
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:20,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it did come back out on Virtual Console, so those with Wii, go get it!

1516
01:59:20,817 --> 01:59:23,919
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I will just say this to this date.

1517
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:28,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super CD version is my favorite.

1518
01:59:30,563 --> 01:59:38,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so your classic video game of the week, River City Ransom, or in this case, Downtown at Neketsu, Monogatari.

1519
01:59:38,973 --> 01:59:39,334
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

1520
01:59:39,975 --> 01:59:41,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week from the archives.

1521
01:59:42,122 --> 02:00:11,663
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know what a recently released game reminds me I would actually even consider it a spiritual successor because Dan and I were talking about it which is how I was thinking of doing this one is the oh crap now I just forgot the name where you play as a delinquent boy beating up other people badass bully badass rumble or something can't go bonch badass rumble that's it

1522
02:00:13,115 --> 02:00:13,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Kenko Bancho.

1523
02:00:13,796 --> 02:00:14,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Kenko Bancho.

1524
02:00:14,736 --> 02:00:15,097
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1525
02:00:15,457 --> 02:00:15,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1526
02:00:16,878 --> 02:00:17,238
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1527
02:00:17,979 --> 02:00:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... Because that's how Dan we had to get that game.

1528
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:21,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dan's like, I want it just because it has badass in the name.

1529
02:00:22,602 --> 02:00:23,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because of the name.

1530
02:00:23,903 --> 02:00:24,143
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1531
02:00:24,163 --> 02:00:25,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our show.

1532
02:00:25,904 --> 02:00:26,605
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're not done yet.

1533
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:31,348
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to come back for plenty more, which is pretty amazing because part A tonight was two hours.

1534
02:00:31,729 --> 02:00:33,490
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of our longest part A's in a while.

1535
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,070
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay.

1536
02:00:34,371 --> 02:00:39,074
[SPEAKER_08]: We've obviously had a lot to talk about between the swine flu and gaming and all that food and all that other fun stuff.

1537
02:00:39,094 --> 02:00:39,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are going to take a quick break.

1538
02:00:39,955 --> 02:00:40,555
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about

1539
02:00:40,635 --> 02:00:42,176
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be right back with more of

1540
02:01:07,955 --> 02:01:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 15th of 2009, where we are taping the 344th episode of our podcast, as we do every Sunday night live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1541
02:01:23,715 --> 02:01:24,335
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG

1542
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:53,351
[SPEAKER_08]: and just kind of your typical little power ballad from Final Fantasy.

1543
02:01:53,371 --> 02:01:54,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of tuned it out.

1544
02:01:54,192 --> 02:01:55,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I kind of tuned it out a little bit.

1545
02:01:55,532 --> 02:02:01,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you just kind of have to imagine, you know, that's going to be the big romance scene with lightning and snow and what do they get?

1546
02:02:01,456 --> 02:02:03,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Partially cloudy and whatever these guys' names are in the game.

1547
02:02:04,058 --> 02:02:08,381
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's going to be snow and that red-headed chick and one of them like flying through the... What's her name?

1548
02:02:08,441 --> 02:02:08,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Thundersnow?

1549
02:02:09,818 --> 02:02:11,740
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's on Thunderstone.

1550
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,161
[SPEAKER_08]: 30% chance of precipitation, is that her name?

1551
02:02:14,042 --> 02:02:14,682
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1552
02:02:14,962 --> 02:02:22,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funnier, though, if you imagine it being that tough-looking army dude that raises all the chocobos, and he's singing it to a chocobo.

1553
02:02:22,308 --> 02:02:23,349
[SPEAKER_08]: That is funny.

1554
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:24,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty damn funny.

1555
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:25,211
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1556
02:02:25,231 --> 02:02:26,552
[SPEAKER_08]: See, doesn't that make that song a lot funnier?

1557
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:30,335
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be Snow getting it on with his motorcycle, which turns into the Twin Shivas, and yeah.

1558
02:02:31,434 --> 02:02:31,674
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1559
02:02:32,055 --> 02:02:32,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, there you go.

1560
02:02:32,895 --> 02:02:33,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it or hate it.

1561
02:02:33,456 --> 02:02:36,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the ballad from Final Fantasy XIII.

1562
02:02:36,678 --> 02:02:38,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And those of you that weren't listening live tonight, that's okay.

1563
02:02:39,901 --> 02:02:44,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that – I think her album comes out on Tuesday, so if you really want to hear it, you can check it out on iTunes.

1564
02:02:44,685 --> 02:02:47,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we're going to get back into the show tonight.

1565
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:52,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go ahead and go into rapid-fire news first because I failed to load the Twitter topics during the break.

1566
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:52,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

1567
02:02:53,111 --> 02:02:53,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1568
02:02:53,452 --> 02:02:54,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we only had a short break tonight.

1569
02:02:54,993 --> 02:02:58,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I get that up, we'll go ahead and do rapid-fire news, and then we will do Twitter topics.

1570
02:02:58,976 --> 02:02:59,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Force Armor

1571
02:03:21,158 --> 02:03:24,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Could very well be horse armor or a campaign to get horse armor.

1572
02:03:24,202 --> 02:03:25,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be horse shit.

1573
02:03:25,223 --> 02:03:25,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how about this?

1574
02:03:25,924 --> 02:03:27,966
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no horses in Final Fantasy.

1575
02:03:28,627 --> 02:03:29,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1576
02:03:29,148 --> 02:03:30,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1577
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:31,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocobo armor.

1578
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:33,173
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be cool.

1579
02:03:33,834 --> 02:03:34,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like tactics games.

1580
02:03:34,734 --> 02:03:35,055
[SPEAKER_08]: What?! !

1581
02:03:58,001 --> 02:03:59,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, do I really do this show with you guys?

1582
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:01,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't like tactics games.

1583
02:04:01,268 --> 02:04:04,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognize it as an amazing game.

1584
02:04:05,657 --> 02:04:08,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally do not dig the tactics games.

1585
02:04:11,155 --> 02:04:16,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Command & Conquer 4 has been announced to be coming out next year on March 16th.

1586
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:22,858
[SPEAKER_09]: They call it Tiberian Twilight, and I hate that subtitle because it reminds me of that crappy vampire movie series and book series.

1587
02:04:23,678 --> 02:04:24,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Crappy series in general.

1588
02:04:25,419 --> 02:04:30,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that Burger King near us is staying open 24 hours for two days because of the stupid Twilight movies?

1589
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,840
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sad.

1590
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:35,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would Burger King... I mean, I realize they have the whole Twilight promotion.

1591
02:04:35,521 --> 02:04:37,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they have a big old Twilight promotion going.

1592
02:04:37,361 --> 02:04:38,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the crowns.

1593
02:04:38,462 --> 02:04:39,362
[SPEAKER_09]: That's blasphemy.

1594
02:04:39,382 --> 02:04:39,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

1595
02:04:42,984 --> 02:04:45,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so bored this week, Loki, when I was sick.

1596
02:04:46,166 --> 02:04:49,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching the Rachel Ray show.

1597
02:04:49,548 --> 02:04:51,028
[SPEAKER_08]: That right there should tell you something.

1598
02:04:51,569 --> 02:04:56,632
[SPEAKER_08]: She was giving makeovers to Twilight fans to make them look like Twilight characters.

1599
02:04:57,712 --> 02:05:00,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just sitting there going, Isn't she supposed to cook?

1600
02:05:00,754 --> 02:05:02,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I would rather be at work.

1601
02:05:03,015 --> 02:05:04,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So she took them the hot topic.

1602
02:05:06,104 --> 02:05:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought she was supposed to cook

1603
02:05:27,813 --> 02:05:38,444
[SPEAKER_09]: in the form of a pack from AFI including songs Beautiful Thieves, End Transmission, Love Like Winter, Medicaid, and the Leaving Song Part 2.

1604
02:05:40,026 --> 02:05:41,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Love Like Winter.

1605
02:05:41,227 --> 02:05:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good song.

1606
02:05:42,575 --> 02:05:54,199
[SPEAKER_09]: and that'll be available as a pack for 680 Microsoft Points or $8.50 in real money and of course available individually for $2 each or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii Points.

1607
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:55,499
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kind of figure that out.

1608
02:05:56,039 --> 02:06:00,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, the individual song for this week though is The Bangles, Walk Like an Egyptian.

1609
02:06:01,101 --> 02:06:01,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome!

1610
02:06:01,841 --> 02:06:01,961
[SPEAKER_09]: For $2.

1611
02:06:03,702 --> 02:06:07,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the PSP, Dead Kennedy's California Uber Allies.

1612
02:06:08,364 --> 02:06:08,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1613
02:06:09,044 --> 02:06:09,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Or...

1614
02:06:09,924 --> 02:06:10,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Uber Alls.

1615
02:06:10,924 --> 02:06:11,944
[SPEAKER_09]: They spelled allies wrong.

1616
02:06:12,064 --> 02:06:12,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid.

1617
02:06:13,805 --> 02:06:16,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Sleater Kinney with You're No Rock and Roll Fun.

1618
02:06:17,566 --> 02:06:18,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's also $2.

1619
02:06:18,346 --> 02:06:23,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Walk Like an Egyptian I think would actually be kind of a hard song to play.

1620
02:06:23,827 --> 02:06:25,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to remember it had a very fast guitar and drum part.

1621
02:06:25,847 --> 02:06:27,048
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a song that people recognize.

1622
02:06:27,488 --> 02:06:29,288
[SPEAKER_09]: People like songs that people can recognize.

1623
02:06:29,548 --> 02:06:30,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1624
02:06:30,328 --> 02:06:33,169
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I'm trying to think about what the game Walk Band would look like.

1625
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: All I can picture are just these horrible, horrific stereotypes that really shouldn't be repeated, but that's just what pops into my mind.

1626
02:06:43,611 --> 02:06:47,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it, but I'm sure it would be a hideously racist game.

1627
02:06:47,636 --> 02:06:50,500
[SPEAKER_09]: 50 different renditions of I'm Turning Japanese.

1628
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:51,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

1629
02:06:51,962 --> 02:06:54,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to another rapid fire news tonight.

1630
02:06:54,425 --> 02:06:58,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The wireless N network adapter has made its way out to America.

1631
02:06:59,050 --> 02:07:02,735
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to pay $100 for it, the wireless N networking adapter is out.

1632
02:07:02,795 --> 02:07:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dual band, 5 gigahertz, 2 point, you know what, it's

1633
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:09,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to read all the technical specs because I'm just not that nerdy.

1634
02:07:10,104 --> 02:07:10,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Just trust me.

1635
02:07:10,904 --> 02:07:11,285
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out.

1636
02:07:11,485 --> 02:07:15,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like your wireless fast, very fast, then this will get it fast.

1637
02:07:15,309 --> 02:07:18,733
[SPEAKER_08]: But do remember you need an end router or this will do no good.

1638
02:07:18,753 --> 02:07:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll just be no faster.

1639
02:07:20,775 --> 02:07:22,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it'll be no faster.

1640
02:07:22,057 --> 02:07:25,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll just revert to B or G or whatever it is you have in your house.

1641
02:07:26,121 --> 02:07:33,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, also, Madden NFL Arcade coming out November 24th and 25th, depending on what platform you're on.

1642
02:07:34,326 --> 02:07:41,211
[SPEAKER_08]: It will come out for $15 on the PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on their respective service.

1643
02:07:42,312 --> 02:07:44,213
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Madden NFL Arcade.

1644
02:07:44,553 --> 02:07:53,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming, I don't know a whole lot more about this game, but I'm assuming this just plays a little more like, not so probably intense with your play picks and so forth.

1645
02:07:54,059 --> 02:07:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably just more of a...

1646
02:07:55,831 --> 02:07:58,352
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1647
02:08:19,284 --> 02:08:19,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1648
02:08:20,665 --> 02:08:30,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just another excuse to get you to spend money on this because, hey, they tried it with NBA and with, you know, NHL, so why not try it with Madden, their number one selling sports franchise?

1649
02:08:31,129 --> 02:08:31,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

1650
02:08:32,189 --> 02:08:37,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, $15 is not exactly, you know, it's on the higher end of the arcade games.

1651
02:08:38,072 --> 02:08:41,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to read this comment from chat before I get to the last story I have here.

1652
02:08:41,253 --> 02:08:48,556
[SPEAKER_08]: SJ100Matt says, Walk Band sounds like a parody from South Park, like playing Rampart to keep the Mongolians from ripping down my shitty wall.

1653
02:08:52,064 --> 02:09:19,993
[SPEAKER_08]: lastly for me for rapid fire news tonight Criterion's developed Need for Speed game is making its way out next year that is official I guess from Criterion Games website I don't know if that is the Need for Speed online game but it's another game coming out there from Criterion is next year so if you like your you know explosive car wrecks there you go

1654
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:27,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Star Trek Online, how's this for Gearswitch, will be out on February 2nd, 2010.

1655
02:09:28,654 --> 02:09:32,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, if you want to go by the star date, 63554.5.

1656
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I am totally, totally, totally very happy with that because I will be playing the hell out of it.

1657
02:09:39,659 --> 02:09:51,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, they were saying that the events that happened in the movie affect the game.

1658
02:09:52,426 --> 02:09:54,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though the movie's a parallel universe thing.

1659
02:09:54,126 --> 02:09:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1660
02:09:54,807 --> 02:09:55,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Strange.

1661
02:09:55,707 --> 02:09:57,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is a reboot universe game.

1662
02:09:57,907 --> 02:09:58,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1663
02:09:58,507 --> 02:09:59,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be very, very interesting.

1664
02:10:01,548 --> 02:10:03,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, my gut reaction to hearing this was, already?

1665
02:10:04,529 --> 02:10:09,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I seriously thought it was not going to be until next Christmas, and now I'm sitting here going, holy crap, it's going to be out in February?

1666
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:10,310
[SPEAKER_08]: February 2nd?

1667
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:11,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

1668
02:10:13,011 --> 02:10:13,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, WoW.

1669
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:14,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1670
02:10:15,703 --> 02:10:22,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, new Beatles Right Band download content on November 17th with Sgt.

1671
02:10:22,945 --> 02:10:24,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

1672
02:10:25,926 --> 02:10:28,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that'll be pretty cool.

1673
02:10:28,286 --> 02:10:30,007
[SPEAKER_05]: November 17th, not too far to go.

1674
02:10:33,588 --> 02:10:38,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, that's actually going to be for Xbox 360 and Wii.

1675
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the iPhone, there is a Commodore 64 emulator back on the iPhone store.

1676
02:10:49,619 --> 02:10:59,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So... Because I guess they patched out... I remember it was there before, and you could somehow trick it into running BASIC, but then that means you could write your own code on the iPhone.

1677
02:10:59,448 --> 02:11:00,249
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a big no-no.

1678
02:11:00,868 --> 02:11:04,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right, because it was rejected because of the basic interpreter.

1679
02:11:06,129 --> 02:11:11,050
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they have removed it, and then other people figured out how to get back into it.

1680
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:16,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And so apparently now it's just on with even further revised code.

1681
02:11:17,291 --> 02:11:25,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And also has a boost in performance and three new games, international basketball, international baseball, and international tennis.

1682
02:11:26,213 --> 02:11:32,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Also included are Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Arctic Shipwreck, Jack Attack, and Jupiter Lander.

1683
02:11:33,377 --> 02:11:35,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually played Le Mans when I was a kid.

1684
02:11:35,298 --> 02:11:36,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that game.

1685
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:38,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So those aren't totally obscure games.

1686
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:42,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those are pretty well-known Commodore 64 games.

1687
02:11:42,583 --> 02:11:45,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, before we get back into more news, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.

1688
02:11:46,805 --> 02:11:51,408
[SPEAKER_08]: We always ask before the show for you to send us your topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

1689
02:11:51,428 --> 02:11:53,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're not following us on Twitter, why not?

1690
02:11:54,195 --> 02:11:54,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow us.

1691
02:11:55,636 --> 02:11:56,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy our twit spam.

1692
02:11:56,916 --> 02:12:02,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR is our username of the Orange Lounge Radio.

1693
02:12:02,538 --> 02:12:09,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Sterlok tweeted us tonight wanting to know, I'm curious what your guys' opinion is on the visually impaired gamer suing Sony.

1694
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:12,642
[SPEAKER_08]: As a blind gamer myself, I find it to be a bad move.

1695
02:12:13,022 --> 02:12:17,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had no idea what Sterlok was talking about, but I found it interesting, so I tweeted back.

1696
02:12:17,123 --> 02:12:17,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, give me a link.

1697
02:12:18,504 --> 02:12:19,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sterlok gave me a link.

1698
02:12:20,004 --> 02:12:21,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard about that.

1699
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:25,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't heard about this, but keep in mind I was a little bit out of it for a week.

1700
02:12:26,098 --> 02:12:32,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the story has to do with a visually impaired gamer who has basically sued Sony.

1701
02:12:33,001 --> 02:12:51,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of this has to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that, quote, no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any persons who owns leases or leases to or operates a place of public accommodation.

1702
02:12:51,669 --> 02:12:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, you know, you can't

1703
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,770
[SPEAKER_08]: and many more.

1704
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:33,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why though, but I guess this thing actually gets into massively multiplayer online titles requesting the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations for gamers with disability impaired visual processing.

1705
02:13:35,352 --> 02:13:38,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of interesting to hear this lawsuit comes to light.

1706
02:13:39,355 --> 02:13:45,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have liked to hear more about, and I think Sturlock's in chat, I'd kind of like to hear more about his feelings against the story.

1707
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:47,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that's kind of interesting.

1708
02:13:49,264 --> 02:13:49,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1709
02:13:50,598 --> 02:13:52,038
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's tough.

1710
02:13:52,998 --> 02:13:59,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I can imagine it's very tough to have a disability such as blindness or deafness.

1711
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:03,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't the first time we've had a listener who has a major disability who's kind of talking about games.

1712
02:14:04,141 --> 02:14:17,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of these things that we take for granted sometimes, like for instance, have we ever sat here and said, oh man, the graphics in the game were awesome and just everything looks so real and the water effects were so cool.

1713
02:14:17,443 --> 02:14:43,739
[SPEAKER_08]: and we have to sometimes realize like not everybody like sees that you know I know what they do in the movie world is that they actually will release movies in the theaters particular showings throughout the day or a special you know theater time or whatever where they actually have or a device that actually describes the scenes to folks while they're watching the movie you know because if you can't see what's going on it might actually say you know

1714
02:14:44,179 --> 02:14:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom Cruise's character is walking into a bar or something, you know, like that type of thing.

1715
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:50,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll actually kind of describe the scenes for you, which, you know, makes sense.

1716
02:14:51,461 --> 02:14:59,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like we have closed captioning for deaf folks, you know, who can't, you know, will see that and it'll be little musical notes of someone singing or what have you.

1717
02:14:59,924 --> 02:15:01,464
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's other little ways they accommodate.

1718
02:15:01,804 --> 02:15:04,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games don't really have a lot of that.

1719
02:15:05,689 --> 02:15:08,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the ADA really apply here though?

1720
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:10,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not so sure.

1721
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be a little bit of extreme to say that.

1722
02:15:12,971 --> 02:15:26,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I think certainly though there is a statement being said here though that a game company that could cater to this could certainly bring in an audience that a lot of folks seem to be neglecting.

1723
02:15:28,315 --> 02:15:28,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make sense?

1724
02:15:29,663 --> 02:15:38,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, it's just, there's certain things that I think people need to have a reasonable expectation about.

1725
02:15:39,491 --> 02:15:41,673
[SPEAKER_05]: That, this is for an MMO, right?

1726
02:15:42,814 --> 02:15:44,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think in part, but this is about games in general.

1727
02:15:44,976 --> 02:15:46,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, imagine if you were blind.

1728
02:15:46,397 --> 02:15:52,482
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some, yeah, that it has to do with the type of game, with...

1729
02:15:54,404 --> 02:16:12,038
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if it's something that as a game requires a number of visual clues, if I personally, this is just me, for example, when my hand was hurting, I could not physically play any game except for singing in Rock Band.

1730
02:16:12,901 --> 02:16:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't like to sing, but I sing in rock bands so I can play.

1731
02:16:16,462 --> 02:16:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's a weak excuse, but I'm just using it as a personal example.

1732
02:16:20,963 --> 02:16:33,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if it's a game that, yes, modifications can be made to it so that someone can participate, there needs to be a release or a server or some way that you can enable somebody to do that.

1733
02:16:33,785 --> 02:16:40,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it is something that requires visual clues so strongly that there is no possible way...

1734
02:16:41,807 --> 02:16:47,468
[SPEAKER_05]: to simulate the same feel of the game through any other course of action.

1735
02:16:47,548 --> 02:16:49,668
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could do it with sound, that would be great.

1736
02:16:50,168 --> 02:16:54,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you could have a big speaker set up over your monitor that you could use directional sound like that.

1737
02:16:55,349 --> 02:16:55,949
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing.

1738
02:16:56,870 --> 02:17:02,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're talking about this has to do with the bottom line.

1739
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:10,492
[SPEAKER_05]: The company's main concern is going to be is your business going to be worth the money that we're going to spend to keep your business?

1740
02:17:11,805 --> 02:17:17,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't really think that the ADA is going to apply to that.

1741
02:17:18,238 --> 02:17:20,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, for example, say that...

1742
02:17:23,775 --> 02:17:28,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I say that I damaged my larynx and I really wanted to sing in rock band.

1743
02:17:28,117 --> 02:17:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no possible way they can make me able to sing.

1744
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:31,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1745
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:33,600
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't do it.

1746
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can play a keyboard or something with it.

1747
02:17:36,502 --> 02:17:37,242
[SPEAKER_05]: That's reasonable.

1748
02:17:37,322 --> 02:17:38,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you see what my point is?

1749
02:17:39,344 --> 02:17:43,446
[SPEAKER_05]: There are just some things that you cannot compensate for.

1750
02:17:43,993 --> 02:17:51,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the bottom line, though, and I think the point that Sherlock was trying to make with the story is that a lawsuit's not really the way to go about making your point.

1751
02:17:51,398 --> 02:17:52,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what he disagrees with.

1752
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:57,102
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, to some extent, say, yeah, a lawsuit's a little silly.

1753
02:17:57,122 --> 02:17:59,003
[SPEAKER_08]: We have enough frivolous lawsuits in this country.

1754
02:17:59,363 --> 02:18:04,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the key is reward the companies that address your needs.

1755
02:18:04,767 --> 02:18:33,680
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly you know if there's MMOs out there that give those better audio clues to the things that you know sometimes we take for granted as visual you know descriptions or you know giving you more directional type of you know sound or clues or whatever it may be reward those companies for their efforts or even a special video mode because I know that in some cases certain colors will register in different types of blindness that others won't have like you know a special color filter because you can easily do that

1756
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:34,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Changing Flashes in DDR for Epilepsy

1757
02:18:59,133 --> 02:18:59,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1758
02:18:59,813 --> 02:19:05,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's lots of very interesting little subtle changes that they try to do in games to make them more accessible.

1759
02:19:05,755 --> 02:19:08,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we reward companies that do that.

1760
02:19:08,275 --> 02:19:18,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, and I hate to say that this stinks of that situation where there's one lawyer, wheelchair-bound, who was going around to... Actually, not even going to some of these places.

1761
02:19:19,338 --> 02:19:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Picking places like Julian, California.

1762
02:19:22,139 --> 02:19:22,639
[SPEAKER_05]: They did it there.

1763
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:27,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Forcing businesses to either go out of business or spend all this money...

1764
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: to make places accessible when the places were accessible anyway.

1765
02:19:32,962 --> 02:19:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back and suing places that he had never been to.

1766
02:19:36,023 --> 02:19:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people actually seek... This is a problem that I have with the American Disabilities Act is that...

1767
02:19:43,507 --> 02:19:45,708
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's a lot of good that came from it.

1768
02:19:45,748 --> 02:19:46,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

1769
02:19:46,368 --> 02:19:54,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is a lot of good that came from it and I think that if a company wants the business, they do need to cater to everybody.

1770
02:19:54,711 --> 02:19:57,092
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be courteous.

1771
02:19:57,872 --> 02:20:01,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there should be a law to force people to be courteous, but they should be courteous.

1772
02:20:01,213 --> 02:20:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be mindful of their clientele.

1773
02:20:04,335 --> 02:20:07,816
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, I think that it opened up a lot of doors for abuse.

1774
02:20:09,068 --> 02:20:10,649
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of doors for abuse.

1775
02:20:11,550 --> 02:20:18,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I'm actually out of work right now under the American Disabilities Act because I physically could not use my hand.

1776
02:20:18,795 --> 02:20:19,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I was grateful for it.

1777
02:20:19,655 --> 02:20:21,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me the recovery time I needed.

1778
02:20:21,697 --> 02:20:26,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to go to work and say, you're forcing me to do my job, I'm suing.

1779
02:20:28,582 --> 02:20:28,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

1780
02:20:30,283 --> 02:20:31,083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

1781
02:20:31,504 --> 02:20:34,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's actually trying to...

1782
02:20:36,926 --> 02:20:37,767
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

1783
02:20:58,516 --> 02:21:00,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So something developers have to be mindful for.

1784
02:21:00,618 --> 02:21:01,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play another game.

1785
02:21:02,419 --> 02:21:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, just play another game.

1786
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:04,280
[SPEAKER_08]: The one suing?

1787
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:04,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1788
02:21:05,281 --> 02:21:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Play another game.

1789
02:21:06,962 --> 02:21:10,364
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're going to be bitches, why do you want them to have your money?

1790
02:21:10,404 --> 02:21:11,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Do something else.

1791
02:21:11,625 --> 02:21:12,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more tweets.

1792
02:21:13,086 --> 02:21:16,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Fernando on the Twitter says, Philharmonic band, yes or no?

1793
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:19,671
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a broad question.

1794
02:21:19,691 --> 02:21:21,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we get Wii Music?

1795
02:21:21,192 --> 02:21:24,554
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to join a Philharmonic band, I was a band geek.

1796
02:21:24,594 --> 02:21:25,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura was a band geek.

1797
02:21:25,795 --> 02:21:26,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, were you a band geek?

1798
02:21:26,856 --> 02:21:26,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1799
02:21:27,691 --> 02:21:29,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, two out of three say join the band.

1800
02:21:29,775 --> 02:21:30,496
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good experience.

1801
02:21:31,137 --> 02:21:31,538
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

1802
02:21:31,998 --> 02:21:34,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be talking about a CD coming out or something.

1803
02:21:34,142 --> 02:21:34,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1804
02:21:34,443 --> 02:21:35,184
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of broad.

1805
02:21:36,789 --> 02:21:43,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Ray Iannami says, OLR, Modern Warfare 2 gets a 9.5 from IGN and a 1.5 reader average.

1806
02:21:43,531 --> 02:21:47,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually tweeted back because I was kind of like, okay, well, the sales figures don't say 1.5.

1807
02:21:47,472 --> 02:21:51,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said, oh, is this people spamming it with negative reviews?

1808
02:21:51,594 --> 02:21:53,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're doing the Amazon thing.

1809
02:21:53,834 --> 02:21:56,655
[SPEAKER_08]: They're spamming it with negative reviews because they're pissed about the server lockout.

1810
02:21:57,075 --> 02:22:02,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ray Iannami says, yes, people who bought the PC version claim it's like playing a console FPS on a PC.

1811
02:22:03,297 --> 02:22:16,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, don't buy it, and don't let us catch you on Steam playing the game and get screenshots of it, because that says way more than a silly 1.5 average on some site I don't even read anyway ever will.

1812
02:22:18,567 --> 02:22:19,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to say about that.

1813
02:22:20,028 --> 02:22:24,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Entertainment says, of these three major releases recently, which is the best?

1814
02:22:25,552 --> 02:22:28,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Uncharted 2, The Ballad of Gay Tony, or Modern Warfare 2?

1815
02:22:29,595 --> 02:22:32,457
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I haven't played any of those games.

1816
02:22:32,517 --> 02:22:34,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it just depends on the person you ask.

1817
02:22:35,019 --> 02:22:38,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly those are all games that are going to be up there when we talk about Game of the Year.

1818
02:22:38,501 --> 02:22:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not so much Gay Tony because it's an expansion of last year's game, but...

1819
02:22:43,044 --> 02:22:51,237
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're talking about which one do I have the most hype for, I really want to check out Uncharted 2 because that just seems like the game I would enjoy most out of the three.

1820
02:22:51,798 --> 02:22:53,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just me.

1821
02:22:53,181 --> 02:22:54,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're just different games.

1822
02:22:55,324 --> 02:22:56,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It really depends on the type of gamer it is.

1823
02:22:59,875 --> 02:23:04,877
[SPEAKER_08]: BlueSwim tweets, what do you think of Crush 40 of Sonic Adventure fame coming to the Rock Band Network?

1824
02:23:05,037 --> 02:23:11,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't heard, but I guess it was inevitable that some of these video game related bands are going to come out through the Rock Band Network.

1825
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:11,959
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

1826
02:23:12,459 --> 02:23:15,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, any thoughts on Steven Tyler leaving Aerosmith?

1827
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not going to leave Aerosmith.

1828
02:23:18,182 --> 02:23:19,342
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all for show.

1829
02:23:19,663 --> 02:23:22,184
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fighting like any family does after a while.

1830
02:23:22,204 --> 02:23:23,845
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a diva tantrum.

1831
02:23:24,005 --> 02:23:25,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1832
02:23:25,126 --> 02:23:26,147
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a diva tantrum.

1833
02:23:26,167 --> 02:23:26,927
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll work it out.

1834
02:23:27,428 --> 02:23:29,349
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll probably be on break for a little while, but they'll bring it out.

1835
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,031
[SPEAKER_08]: They were on a break.

1836
02:23:32,876 --> 02:23:33,737
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1837
02:23:49,657 --> 02:23:53,019
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, this is the season for Child's Play, obviously the holiday season.

1838
02:23:53,079 --> 02:23:55,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely check out some of the stuff they're doing.

1839
02:23:55,881 --> 02:24:01,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking at this Desert Bus tweet, which is Desert Bus, D-E-S-E-R-T Bus on Twitter.

1840
02:24:01,685 --> 02:24:03,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the Desert Bus for Hope Charity.

1841
02:24:03,927 --> 02:24:10,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if this is the same thing that they did from last year where they actually sat and played that Desert Bus game.

1842
02:24:11,372 --> 02:24:12,053
[SPEAKER_08]: on the feed.

1843
02:24:12,793 --> 02:24:13,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they are.

1844
02:24:13,434 --> 02:24:14,195
[SPEAKER_08]: DesertBus.org.

1845
02:24:14,215 --> 02:24:19,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually go and look at the feed and watch them play this incredibly boring freaking game.

1846
02:24:19,119 --> 02:24:20,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's all for a good cause.

1847
02:24:21,141 --> 02:24:23,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you play a better game for a good cause?

1848
02:24:23,923 --> 02:24:24,764
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my thing.

1849
02:24:24,804 --> 02:24:27,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like, seriously, if you're going to do it anyway, just play a better game.

1850
02:24:27,947 --> 02:24:32,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it goes back to that whole thing, like, people like to pay to watch other people be tortured.

1851
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then they should play, what was it, that, uh... The, uh...

1852
02:24:37,079 --> 02:24:38,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1853
02:24:54,758 --> 02:25:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw sends us one that says Modern Warfare 2 is banned in Russia and actually sent us a link here to a website that talks about console versions of Modern Warfare 2 have been banned in Russia and it's due to the content of the No Russian mission and that's the controversial airport massacre level and I guess the Russian government didn't like that.

1854
02:25:17,356 --> 02:25:21,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Raised the ire of the Russian gaming public as well as some politicians.

1855
02:25:22,142 --> 02:25:23,183
[SPEAKER_08]: In Soviet Russia, gameplay you.

1856
02:25:51,554 --> 02:25:53,876
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some more stories here.

1857
02:25:54,837 --> 02:25:57,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off with a story about Gran Turismo.

1858
02:25:57,339 --> 02:26:07,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Gran Turismo, the game that will just never come out, and now it's just taking even longer because they're saying that it's being held up for marketing reasons, which is retarded.

1859
02:26:08,349 --> 02:26:09,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Just say development, okay?

1860
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:15,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Not marketing, because then that just says, oh, yeah, we could release it, but we're going to be assholes.

1861
02:26:15,875 --> 02:26:16,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So Gran Turismo 5...

1862
02:26:17,717 --> 02:26:21,000
[SPEAKER_09]: We will release Gran Turismo 5 March in Japan, but for other regions it has not been decided yet.

1863
02:26:44,947 --> 02:26:50,455
[SPEAKER_09]: and this is asked by Motoring Magazine what the holdup was in the western release of the game.

1864
02:26:51,016 --> 02:26:56,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more depending on Sony Computer Entertainment America's marketing decisions.

1865
02:26:59,908 --> 02:27:00,208
[SPEAKER_08]: What is...

1866
02:27:00,888 --> 02:27:04,609
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem with just releasing a game and then marketing it.

1867
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:07,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does it have to be marketed right out the gate?

1868
02:27:07,211 --> 02:27:10,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Are day one numbers that critical to a game's success?

1869
02:27:10,072 --> 02:27:14,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but also you have to figure that I'm not positive if it falls with them.

1870
02:27:15,314 --> 02:27:20,856
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, they're going to be having God of War 3 coming out, at least in the U.S.

1871
02:27:21,636 --> 02:27:23,097
[SPEAKER_09]: That's supposed to be sometime in March.

1872
02:27:23,557 --> 02:27:25,498
[SPEAKER_09]: So perhaps they're going to try to...

1873
02:27:26,939 --> 02:27:33,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Sandbag the next year numbers by releasing it in the first quarter of their financial 2010 year.

1874
02:27:34,164 --> 02:27:37,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Or 2011, I don't know how they really count it.

1875
02:27:37,767 --> 02:27:42,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually a lot of the game companies, their financial year starts either in April or at the end of March.

1876
02:27:42,871 --> 02:27:48,935
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you'll see the first big push for games sandbagged into March.

1877
02:27:51,397 --> 02:27:51,597
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1878
02:28:07,367 --> 02:28:11,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving on to the games that are a lot closer to its release.

1879
02:28:11,771 --> 02:28:16,895
[SPEAKER_08]: 1 vs. 100, of course, had its early first season happen and then the games kind of disappeared for a little while.

1880
02:28:16,936 --> 02:28:17,496
[SPEAKER_08]: But guess what?

1881
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:21,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Season 2 is starting November 19th at 5 o'clock Pacific.

1882
02:28:22,621 --> 02:28:26,444
[SPEAKER_08]: 1 vs. 100 extended play begins then to get you all warmed up for Season 2.

1883
02:28:27,705 --> 02:28:34,051
[SPEAKER_08]: More than a half a million people competed in the 15-week beta season and they're trying to get even more people to show up for Round 2.

1884
02:28:34,831 --> 02:28:41,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Extended Play, I guess, is now going to have themed trivia every weeknight, although I assume they'll still have kind of some general trivia, too.

1885
02:28:42,074 --> 02:28:51,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, the more Extended Play you play, apparently you have a better chance of being picked as one of the mob or even the one themselves, and you get to compete for actual prizes!

1886
02:28:51,859 --> 02:28:52,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

1887
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:56,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Two million Microsoft points, apparently, were given away during the first season.

1888
02:28:56,941 --> 02:28:58,622
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you get Microsoft Space Bucks.

1889
02:28:58,982 --> 02:29:01,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really cash, but in Microsoft's world, it's cash.

1890
02:29:01,883 --> 02:29:03,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's not like Smash TV.

1891
02:29:04,244 --> 02:29:05,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1892
02:29:05,865 --> 02:29:07,406
[SPEAKER_04]: More money, more prizes.

1893
02:29:07,546 --> 02:29:07,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1894
02:29:07,987 --> 02:29:08,527
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1895
02:29:08,987 --> 02:29:18,554
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as we're kind of making fun of it now, this actually is, of sorts, kind of like a groundbreaking game and I think is one of the huge things that Xbox 360 has going for it right now that no other system has.

1896
02:29:19,234 --> 02:29:21,676
[SPEAKER_08]: My only wish is that they would do more games.

1897
02:29:22,156 --> 02:29:24,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why another season of 1 vs. 100?

1898
02:29:24,518 --> 02:29:29,021
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some, like, Price is Right or Press Your Luck or, I don't know, you know, I understand 1 vs. 1.

1899
02:29:29,061 --> 02:29:30,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Price is Right would be so awesome.

1900
02:29:30,422 --> 02:29:31,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be amazing.

1901
02:29:32,023 --> 02:29:33,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazeballs, as they say.

1902
02:29:35,913 --> 02:29:37,534
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll take 1 vs. 100 Season 2.

1903
02:29:37,634 --> 02:29:39,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody loves a good trivia game.

1904
02:29:39,114 --> 02:29:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a lot of fun.

1905
02:29:41,235 --> 02:29:43,916
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, any plans to join in on 1 vs. 100 Season 2?

1906
02:29:44,396 --> 02:29:44,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1907
02:29:45,196 --> 02:29:45,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, fine.

1908
02:29:46,636 --> 02:29:47,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play by myself.

1909
02:29:47,857 --> 02:29:48,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I have other stuff to play.

1910
02:29:49,817 --> 02:29:50,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what?

1911
02:29:50,498 --> 02:29:53,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a game that's coming out on the 8th of December over here in the U.S.

1912
02:29:55,639 --> 02:29:55,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1913
02:29:56,939 --> 02:29:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

1914
02:29:58,814 --> 02:29:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: WeMake Flashlight

1915
02:30:17,638 --> 02:30:44,686
[SPEAKER_05]: and um well there's no combat in it but the um the cool thing though that Climax is keeping is um all the stuff that Akira Yamaoka did for the music so that's going to be really happy um I'm just really really looking forward to it I think it's going to be fantastic and it better scare the crap out of me just saying it was one of the more fun demos I played at uh um E3 so I'm excited about it

1916
02:30:45,154 --> 02:30:45,674
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1917
02:31:15,373 --> 02:31:20,156
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, seriously though, boy in his blob, no advertising, 9,200 units.

1918
02:31:20,216 --> 02:31:22,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could easily do that with President Cat.

1919
02:31:22,197 --> 02:31:29,261
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why, again, I heard those stories about President Cat only selling 100 copies, and I know I went off on the last show we had.

1920
02:31:30,702 --> 02:31:31,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't believe it.

1921
02:31:31,702 --> 02:31:32,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1922
02:31:32,322 --> 02:31:38,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if a game like Boy in His Blob sells 9,200 in this country, I can't believe President Cat only sold 100 units.

1923
02:31:38,946 --> 02:31:41,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, there was an awesome article on Kotaku.

1924
02:31:42,028 --> 02:31:44,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to talk about President Cat every week on the show, but

1925
02:31:44,824 --> 02:32:13,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Kotaku did an awesome piece that kind of called out those sites that were showing like the pictures with nobody in them where you could clearly see there were barricades so the booth just wasn't open yet fucking called those sites out by showing another picture later in the day that had a lot of people there and like basically kind of saying like well all these sites are just misrepresenting what's going on although granted President Cat probably wasn't in the top 50 sales figures well I mean I don't think any of us really thought it was going to be

1926
02:32:14,393 --> 02:32:17,275
[SPEAKER_08]: But neither was Boy and his blob, that's for sure.

1927
02:32:17,395 --> 02:32:28,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And over there, I'm sure, the fact that they actually had a booth and were doing signings or whatever, that's more than you can say that big buck hunting or buck fever is going to do.

1928
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:32,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Buck fever is going to sell a lot because people are like, oh, hunting game, me buy.

1929
02:32:32,922 --> 02:32:37,324
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what they say, too, at Walmart.

1930
02:32:37,444 --> 02:32:41,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with President Cat, people are going to be like, oh my god, cute cat game, and they're going to buy that.

1931
02:32:41,706 --> 02:32:42,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's going to happen.

1932
02:32:43,615 --> 02:32:47,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy and his blob, they're like, uh, uh, blob?

1933
02:32:47,423 --> 02:32:48,224
[SPEAKER_09]: No, boy?

1934
02:32:48,545 --> 02:32:49,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I like boys.

1935
02:32:49,407 --> 02:32:50,348
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't like boys.

1936
02:32:50,389 --> 02:32:51,431
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong, you know?

1937
02:32:52,172 --> 02:32:52,373
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1938
02:32:54,411 --> 02:32:56,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Where in the hell were you going with that, Loki?

1939
02:32:56,273 --> 02:32:57,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.

1940
02:32:57,774 --> 02:32:58,275
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

1941
02:32:58,895 --> 02:33:03,700
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but again, I love that they called out those sites.

1942
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you guys trying to start?

1943
02:33:08,084 --> 02:33:08,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1944
02:33:08,544 --> 02:33:10,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Know your facts before you report on them.

1945
02:33:10,406 --> 02:33:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were some pretty big sites that were running this story that this big failure of a launch event or whatever happened.

1946
02:33:18,894 --> 02:33:19,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1947
02:33:35,352 --> 02:33:36,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody fucking loves cats!

1948
02:33:58,795 --> 02:33:59,696
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the effort.

1949
02:33:59,896 --> 02:34:03,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, don't put any effort out there.

1950
02:34:03,999 --> 02:34:06,481
[SPEAKER_09]: They expect everybody else to kind of just sell it for them.

1951
02:34:07,061 --> 02:34:11,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just want to give major props to Kotaku for calling those people out that ran that story.

1952
02:34:11,864 --> 02:34:13,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Think twice before you dish out your haterade, folks.

1953
02:34:14,526 --> 02:34:14,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Think twice.

1954
02:34:16,584 --> 02:34:18,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Loki, next story.

1955
02:34:19,326 --> 02:34:33,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so the iPhone gets all sorts of crazy games, and there's a new one now that has you in the role of a firefighter called Firefighter 360, and it's actually kind of an augmented reality game.

1956
02:34:33,636 --> 02:34:35,237
[SPEAKER_09]: It will create fires.

1957
02:34:36,798 --> 02:34:37,698
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1958
02:35:05,049 --> 02:35:05,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1959
02:35:26,189 --> 02:35:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1960
02:35:46,192 --> 02:35:51,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So although this game sounds a little cheesy, I think the whole idea that it exists in the first place is kind of cool.

1961
02:35:52,054 --> 02:35:55,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And someone asked, what happens when you point it at real fire?

1962
02:35:55,055 --> 02:35:56,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the fire catch fire?

1963
02:35:57,595 --> 02:35:57,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1964
02:35:58,156 --> 02:35:58,856
[SPEAKER_09]: That's crazy.

1965
02:35:59,176 --> 02:35:59,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Deep.

1966
02:36:01,757 --> 02:36:04,638
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of like that question about what happens when a tree falls in the woods or something.

1967
02:36:07,938 --> 02:36:08,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes, ah!

1968
02:36:11,059 --> 02:36:12,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it that's going on in the iPhone world, Loki?

1969
02:36:13,598 --> 02:36:15,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's other things.

1970
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:17,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is actually something more of Jamie's Alley, though.

1971
02:36:18,703 --> 02:36:21,125
[SPEAKER_09]: R-Type is coming to the iPhone.

1972
02:36:21,225 --> 02:36:22,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo-hoo!

1973
02:36:22,226 --> 02:36:23,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Or iPod Touch, I guess.

1974
02:36:24,007 --> 02:36:29,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically... I don't know.

1975
02:36:29,432 --> 02:36:30,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks kind of neat.

1976
02:36:31,514 --> 02:36:37,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're basically collaborating with Irem Software Engineering, I guess, the company that put it out.

1977
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:38,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1978
02:36:40,748 --> 02:36:41,329
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1979
02:37:04,497 --> 02:37:11,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple, if they want more games, they should just release something that plugs into the bottom that gives you a little controller.

1980
02:37:11,521 --> 02:37:12,382
[SPEAKER_08]: How hard would that be?

1981
02:37:12,862 --> 02:37:13,923
[SPEAKER_08]: How hard would that be?

1982
02:37:14,323 --> 02:37:14,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very.

1983
02:37:15,424 --> 02:37:15,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1984
02:37:17,935 --> 02:37:23,738
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I guess the whole thought would be, well, not everybody would have one, so then these games wouldn't be open to everybody.

1985
02:37:24,939 --> 02:37:28,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, have, like, control scheme choices or something.

1986
02:37:28,881 --> 02:37:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1987
02:37:29,301 --> 02:37:31,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Have it detect if it's there and use that.

1988
02:37:31,443 --> 02:37:33,164
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, it uses the on-screen thing.

1989
02:37:33,444 --> 02:37:40,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think gaming on the iPhone could be so much better if there were, like, more to control with than just the touchscreen, because, you know, there's only so much you can do with your fat thumb.

1990
02:37:41,608 --> 02:37:42,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me, I know from experience.

1991
02:37:44,127 --> 02:37:44,507
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1992
02:37:59,544 --> 02:38:00,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of the Box

1993
02:38:16,045 --> 02:38:18,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyhow, of course, Moonwalker was a pretty epic game.

1994
02:38:18,607 --> 02:38:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in the arcade and then, of course, on the Sega Genesis.

1995
02:38:20,909 --> 02:38:28,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm imagining that this is the Sega Genesis version that's going to come over, but, of course, they do have arcade games emulatable on the Wii.

1996
02:38:28,756 --> 02:38:29,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be the Genesis version.

1997
02:38:29,817 --> 02:38:32,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I don't think they have any Sega games.

1998
02:38:33,239 --> 02:38:34,120
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they do, actually.

1999
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:36,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't Golden Axe come out on the emulator thing?

2000
02:38:38,001 --> 02:38:39,001
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2001
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:58,462
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to go the way of my Excitebike review.

2002
02:38:58,702 --> 02:39:04,746
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll download it, play it for 10 minutes, and go, God, Moonwalker was pretty fucking awesome, but I'm already bored of it.

2003
02:39:04,886 --> 02:39:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'll never play it again, like a lot of virtual console games.

2004
02:39:07,248 --> 02:39:09,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But it won't matter, because Nintendo and Sega have your money.

2005
02:39:12,991 --> 02:39:15,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Moonwalker was kind of neat.

2006
02:39:15,493 --> 02:39:18,415
[SPEAKER_08]: It was different, but I don't know if it's aged well.

2007
02:39:18,595 --> 02:39:24,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's probably more of just cashing in on Michael Jackson's death, which is kind of sad, but a lot of people are doing it.

2008
02:39:25,267 --> 02:39:25,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2009
02:39:39,687 --> 02:39:44,488
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us.

2010
02:40:04,505 --> 02:40:06,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, um, actually just one from Spazinator.

2011
02:40:07,386 --> 02:40:07,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty then.

2012
02:40:07,766 --> 02:40:08,106
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long.

2013
02:40:08,986 --> 02:40:09,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just one.

2014
02:40:10,207 --> 02:40:17,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi folks, I was initially going to call in about this subject tonight, but after seeing your tweet asking for mail, I decided to email you instead.

2015
02:40:17,869 --> 02:40:22,230
[SPEAKER_05]: This email will be a first for me on your show for one single reason.

2016
02:40:22,570 --> 02:40:28,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, despite the fact that I've been a fan of Sony systems since 97, I've decided that it's time to virtually rip Sony a new one.

2017
02:40:28,832 --> 02:40:31,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Suffice to say, based on that last statement,

2018
02:40:32,253 --> 02:40:35,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It is safe for everyone to assume I'm not happy with Sony right now.

2019
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:36,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.

2020
02:40:36,822 --> 02:40:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all due to one reason.

2021
02:40:38,204 --> 02:40:42,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Their worthless piece of motherfucking POS DRM on their movies slash video downloads.

2022
02:40:44,767 --> 02:40:51,371
[SPEAKER_05]: See, the thing is, I have been sinking good hard money into that service every week for movies, TV shows, etc.

2023
02:40:51,411 --> 02:40:56,595
[SPEAKER_05]: that I had built up a decent collection, backing it all onto an external HDD as I buy it all.

2024
02:40:57,475 --> 02:41:00,517
[SPEAKER_05]: In all, I had sunk several hundred dollars into the video service.

2025
02:41:00,637 --> 02:41:02,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as of this past Friday, all that money went down the drain.

2026
02:41:03,579 --> 02:41:04,339
[SPEAKER_05]: See, here's the thing.

2027
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:11,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to launch a game and it had to update before I could play it, but the system froze while it was updating, requiring a hard reset.

2028
02:41:11,583 --> 02:41:16,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That, of course, corrupted the game, leaving a large, unusable file on my HDD.

2029
02:41:16,786 --> 02:41:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So the kicker was, I couldn't delete it by highlighting it, pushing triangle, and selecting delete, thus requiring me to reformat my HDD to get rid of it, which I did.

2030
02:41:24,930 --> 02:41:30,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I started redownloading my games as per usual and tried putting my video content back onto my internal HDD and watch it.

2031
02:41:31,417 --> 02:41:32,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the so-called good part.

2032
02:41:32,718 --> 02:41:36,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I could transfer the videos back, but the DRM was all fouled up and the videos were unplayable.

2033
02:41:37,163 --> 02:41:40,026
[SPEAKER_05]: As common sense would suggest, I called Sony and explained to the rep what happened.

2034
02:41:40,406 --> 02:41:43,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the response I got back was less than optimal, to put it lightly.

2035
02:41:43,669 --> 02:41:46,873
[SPEAKER_05]: To paraphrase, they said I was shit out of luck and had to buy everything all over again.

2036
02:41:48,464 --> 02:41:53,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say it, but this is 100% pure, unadulterated, grade A fucking horseshit.

2037
02:41:54,508 --> 02:41:55,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that term.

2038
02:41:55,889 --> 02:42:03,614
[SPEAKER_05]: On one hand, I can sympathize with the fact that they want to curtail any kind of piracy, which is fine, but this could have been handled very differently and in a better manner.

2039
02:42:03,975 --> 02:42:09,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reasonably sure that they kept records of what each customer purchases, at least for their own bookkeeping purposes.

2040
02:42:09,638 --> 02:42:17,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, obviously, for videos, one can only have one system activated at one time, so it's not like I could share these videos if I wanted to, not that I would, mind you.

2041
02:42:18,084 --> 02:42:22,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Frankly, it kills me that I've been supporting them for so long and sunk so much money into that.

2042
02:42:22,425 --> 02:42:26,926
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end all, I practically get a fucky from them and get spat in the face and kicked in the junk.

2043
02:42:27,906 --> 02:42:32,267
[SPEAKER_05]: This really is making me seriously consider becoming a Rabid360 fanboy.

2044
02:42:32,327 --> 02:42:37,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So in closing, and in the event that Sony is listening to the live broadcast or the podcast, I have to say this.

2045
02:42:38,228 --> 02:42:41,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you and fuck the drama initiative sharks that you...

2046
02:42:42,709 --> 02:42:44,970
[SPEAKER_05]: rode in on and subsequently jumped.

2047
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:51,493
[SPEAKER_05]: If Sony wants to keep me as a customer and avoid some serious negative PR, I seriously suggest they fix this issue ASAP.

2048
02:42:52,073 --> 02:42:56,155
[SPEAKER_05]: This email was brought to you by Sony's Borked DRM, thus rendering this email unreadable.

2049
02:42:56,915 --> 02:42:57,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say one thing.

2050
02:42:57,935 --> 02:43:00,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not with Sony, but with Apple.

2051
02:43:00,876 --> 02:43:07,719
[SPEAKER_05]: When I had to completely reboot my iPhone and lost everything I downloaded since... Well, let's see.

2052
02:43:07,819 --> 02:43:08,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it in...

2053
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: February and lost everything since November the year before and when I called in because they keep a record of all of my purchases I explained to them what happened I said yeah I was updating my iPhone for the first time in four months and it's like okay well we'll just reauthorize everything up to the last date of your last update and they did that and so it was just those things that they set up for me to queue to redownload why can't Sony do something like that it's fucking Sony that

2054
02:43:39,275 --> 02:43:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: is interesting.

2055
02:43:40,396 --> 02:43:42,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not heard a lot like that.

2056
02:43:42,398 --> 02:43:47,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of sitting here a little bit in awe because I was listening to the first half of the email.

2057
02:43:47,101 --> 02:43:52,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of sitting here going, well, you just need to call Sony and then they reset things because I think that's what Microsoft does.

2058
02:43:52,205 --> 02:43:55,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I don't know so much about the video end of things.

2059
02:43:55,848 --> 02:44:01,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know that they do that with the games is that they can reset the licenses.

2060
02:44:01,472 --> 02:44:02,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, you can do it yourself.

2061
02:44:02,573 --> 02:44:04,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I think once a year you can reset your licenses.

2062
02:44:05,095 --> 02:44:22,988
[SPEAKER_08]: same thing with Apple does something very similar like you know if you have to reinstall Windows or whatever and you get five plays per account or whatever you know this is they don't even sell music with DRM anymore anyway they got rid of it but for the DRM music that you still have you get like up to five computers I don't know

2063
02:44:24,326 --> 02:44:27,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, I'm kind of sitting here in shock hearing this story.

2064
02:44:27,588 --> 02:44:31,871
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little bit surprising to me that I haven't heard this before.

2065
02:44:32,451 --> 02:44:36,613
[SPEAKER_08]: But granted, I don't know a lot of people that use the video marketplace so heavily.

2066
02:44:37,514 --> 02:44:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's a lot of people that are really into the digital distribution.

2067
02:44:41,636 --> 02:44:41,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I know...

2068
02:44:42,917 --> 02:45:01,447
[SPEAKER_08]: you've called into the show several times talking about various animes and stuff so you know I know you're a heavy user of this so this is kind of surprising to me so I think you've done a good first step by starting to get the word out there that this is going on the way I see it you have a couple of options from here you can call Sony back

2069
02:45:02,142 --> 02:45:03,624
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2070
02:45:25,186 --> 02:45:51,723
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe try to get a clearer answer about what their policy is on it because you know I'm hearing that the rep told you that you were shit out of luck but I just as a consumer activist if you will that has a podcast I want to know a little more about the why why did they tell you that you were shit out of luck your other options once you've figured that out and once you have a really good solid reason you understand their policy you can do one of two things or you can do both

2071
02:45:53,561 --> 02:45:54,082
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2072
02:46:02,478 --> 02:46:10,560
[SPEAKER_08]: that Sony does say you're shit out of luck for something you legally purchased yourself when you had to fix something that they broke, right?

2073
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:12,381
[SPEAKER_08]: He said his drive corrupted, right?

2074
02:46:13,121 --> 02:46:13,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2075
02:46:13,841 --> 02:46:18,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's... And he had to do a hard reset and it corrupted his game data.

2076
02:46:18,382 --> 02:46:25,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had the only way to get rid of it because it wouldn't delete was to reformat it.

2077
02:46:28,025 --> 02:46:28,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2078
02:46:29,751 --> 02:46:34,919
[SPEAKER_08]: or you could, and if you want, you could try to get your story out there a little more.

2079
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:44,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you kind of know, understand the policies a little more, email some of your favorite game blogs, see who might run the story, especially if you do end up sending a complaint to Better Business Bureau, you could see what happens.

2080
02:46:44,753 --> 02:46:49,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, granted, there's also other things to check out here, and this is where our chat room's piping up.

2081
02:46:49,076 --> 02:46:50,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Something very big to consider here.

2082
02:46:51,097 --> 02:46:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, but why should Sony let them play it again?

2083
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:59,102
[SPEAKER_08]: A store does not replace your disc if you lose or scratch it.

2084
02:46:59,783 --> 02:47:07,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly that's a valid devil's advocate argument, is that, you know, if you just damage the data, you're shit out of luck if it were a Blu-ray disc that you dropped on the floor.

2085
02:47:08,489 --> 02:47:11,771
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an accident, but you dropped it, you broke it, you're screwed, right?

2086
02:47:12,091 --> 02:47:13,352
[SPEAKER_05]: This is due to their...

2087
02:47:15,188 --> 02:47:20,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, there's just something where I totally respect where Brad's coming from with that statement.

2088
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:25,552
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just something about what Spazinator's saying that just doesn't sound fair to me.

2089
02:47:25,693 --> 02:47:28,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't this part of the reason we do digital distribution?

2090
02:47:29,114 --> 02:47:30,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2091
02:47:30,955 --> 02:47:37,938
[SPEAKER_08]: The advantage is supposed to be that I have a digital version of it that doesn't get damaged the way a physical copy does.

2092
02:47:38,878 --> 02:47:48,323
[SPEAKER_08]: We always talk about the pros and cons about why should people have physical versions instead of digital versions, but we don't often talk about why should people have digital versions instead of physical ones.

2093
02:47:48,703 --> 02:48:02,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, if Apple and Microsoft have these competitive DRM management schemes, then Sony should be taking a task for having one that is less than ideal, I suppose.

2094
02:48:03,831 --> 02:48:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very interesting.

2095
02:48:08,305 --> 02:48:35,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to think of this I would say call back, talk to a supervisor if you can't hear from the supervisor get their complaint address and write them a letter make sure also when you talk to their people that you document names, what time you called you want to know who you spoke to who their supervisor is you want to record all of that because the next step after writing them a letter is if you get nothing from that go to the Better Business Bureau

2096
02:48:35,840 --> 02:49:04,656
[SPEAKER_08]: and for the I just would like to know what is their policy and you know I could go on to Sony's website and actually read the little blah blah blahs and probably figure it out for myself I don't have time to do that while trying to do a live radio show but I would kind of like our listeners to try and figure that out for the next week and maybe we'll see some emails on that what exactly is their policy when it comes to this stuff like just the whole you're shit out of luck response I mean just I'm a customer service trainer that's not the type of thing you tell a customer ever is that you're shit out of luck there's always something

2097
02:49:05,827 --> 02:49:10,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if that something is, here is our complaint address if you don't like the policy.

2098
02:49:10,349 --> 02:49:13,430
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our policy, and if you don't agree with it, here's an address to complain about it.

2099
02:49:13,791 --> 02:49:15,771
[SPEAKER_08]: That is better than, well, fuck you.

2100
02:49:16,112 --> 02:49:18,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

2101
02:49:18,333 --> 02:49:22,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Just what I'm hearing, just as the customer service trainer in me is crying a little bit.

2102
02:49:23,555 --> 02:49:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2103
02:49:24,892 --> 02:49:28,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, I used to take escalated calls at my work.

2104
02:49:29,213 --> 02:49:30,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to talk to all the pissed off people.

2105
02:49:32,654 --> 02:49:34,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's something that can be done.

2106
02:49:34,814 --> 02:49:43,315
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to keep someone's business, because keep in mind, I'm going into a little bit of the world of business, and maybe this is something you can use, Rob.

2107
02:49:45,796 --> 02:49:51,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I remember going through a couple of training seminars that were called A Complaint is a Gift.

2108
02:49:53,104 --> 02:50:04,570
[SPEAKER_05]: and was talking about for every eight people that have a bad experience, at least two of them will talk about it.

2109
02:50:04,910 --> 02:50:06,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them will talk to eight more people.

2110
02:50:06,771 --> 02:50:07,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2111
02:50:07,752 --> 02:50:09,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll keep passing it around by word.

2112
02:50:10,093 --> 02:50:11,514
[SPEAKER_05]: For every, I think...

2113
02:50:12,867 --> 02:50:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard the same thing, just not with numbers.

2114
02:50:14,809 --> 02:50:16,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the numbers always seem to change.

2115
02:50:16,311 --> 02:50:17,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That principle.

2116
02:50:17,632 --> 02:50:20,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're also going to run into the person who is an activist.

2117
02:50:21,476 --> 02:50:24,559
[SPEAKER_05]: The person who's going to take the initiative and get up and write the letter.

2118
02:50:24,599 --> 02:50:26,761
[SPEAKER_05]: The Jamie.

2119
02:50:26,782 --> 02:50:29,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually adopted that whole attitude after taking that seminar.

2120
02:50:31,609 --> 02:50:43,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you this, if any place has given me bad service for any reason, if I know specifically that they haven't done things that they should do, I will say something about it.

2121
02:50:43,296 --> 02:50:48,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if no one says anything about it to the company, how are they going to know to fix it?

2122
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they going to know that maybe so-and-so rep screwed up until you call them on it?

2123
02:50:57,765 --> 02:51:00,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's not enough people who call other people on their bullshits.

2124
02:51:01,407 --> 02:51:09,932
[SPEAKER_08]: and to be fair if I know we have had people that work for we have been mentioned on the official Sony Playstation 3 Twitter before this show on the official Twitter yes

2125
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:12,460
[SPEAKER_08]: because we've had friends that work at Sony.

2126
02:51:12,601 --> 02:51:17,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, by all means, Sony, the floor is yours.

2127
02:51:17,384 --> 02:51:25,211
[SPEAKER_08]: If we are misrepresenting these facts, if this emailer had a bad experience and needs to be corrected, please contact us.

2128
02:51:25,751 --> 02:51:26,312
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how.

2129
02:51:26,372 --> 02:51:27,533
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many different ways to do it.

2130
02:51:28,073 --> 02:51:29,234
[SPEAKER_08]: State your side of the case.

2131
02:51:29,314 --> 02:51:32,277
[SPEAKER_08]: If we are misrepresenting you, we want to make it right.

2132
02:51:33,217 --> 02:51:35,720
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other hand, if your policy sucks, we also want to call you out on it.

2133
02:51:35,740 --> 02:51:36,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, but that's what we do.

2134
02:51:37,061 --> 02:51:39,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So by all means, let's hear both sides of the story.

2135
02:51:40,549 --> 02:51:52,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, that's pretty much what I was getting to next, is that, you know, there's always two sides of a story, but again, they don't know a situation exists until it's brought to their attention.

2136
02:51:53,242 --> 02:51:57,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and this could, unfortunately, be just a bad experience with the customer service rep.

2137
02:51:57,607 --> 02:52:00,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that is their policy, this could be a step to changing it.

2138
02:52:00,329 --> 02:52:00,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

2139
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:01,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2140
02:52:04,469 --> 02:52:07,432
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2141
02:52:27,620 --> 02:52:31,062
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, is that it for Mailbag then, for now?

2142
02:52:31,282 --> 02:52:32,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one and only.

2143
02:52:32,422 --> 02:52:34,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com That was a good email.

2144
02:52:35,064 --> 02:52:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good discussion.

2145
02:52:35,864 --> 02:52:42,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com if you want to, um, and he always gets through on the phone, so I'm sure he's going to call in later to talk about it.

2146
02:52:43,108 --> 02:52:47,510
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it'll come up again later, I'm sure, but it was an interesting discussion.

2147
02:52:47,550 --> 02:52:49,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would be very curious

2148
02:52:51,821 --> 02:52:58,604
[SPEAKER_08]: If you run a game blog out there, I'm too lazy to do this, so here you can take this story and just say it was inspired by this show.

2149
02:52:58,644 --> 02:52:59,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw us a bone.

2150
02:53:00,044 --> 02:53:04,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see the DRM policies of the various companies side by side.

2151
02:53:04,606 --> 02:53:14,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like someone to make that nice little chart that says, here's what it is with Microsoft, here's what it is with Nintendo for their limited video service in Japan, which I think they have.

2152
02:53:14,705 --> 02:53:15,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what it is to the US.

2153
02:53:15,766 --> 02:53:20,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see that kind of side by side so the consumer can be better informed going into this.

2154
02:53:20,509 --> 02:53:21,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to kind of see that.

2155
02:53:23,711 --> 02:53:23,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

2156
02:53:24,071 --> 02:53:24,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

2157
02:53:25,071 --> 02:53:25,332
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2158
02:53:25,892 --> 02:53:27,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into the FUs of the week.

2159
02:53:28,013 --> 02:53:32,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was supposed to have a story and I neglected to link it.

2160
02:53:33,416 --> 02:53:34,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got to bring it up real quick.

2161
02:53:34,577 --> 02:53:37,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So FU starts to me for not being prepared tonight.

2162
02:53:37,950 --> 02:53:38,190
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

2163
02:54:04,411 --> 02:54:05,052
[SPEAKER_05]: My F.U.

2164
02:54:05,092 --> 02:54:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: goes to pissy attitudes.

2165
02:54:09,153 --> 02:54:09,554
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2166
02:54:12,395 --> 02:54:13,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, F.U.

2167
02:54:14,036 --> 02:54:19,298
[SPEAKER_09]: to the stores that think that it's necessary to break street to compete with GameStop and other stores.

2168
02:54:19,738 --> 02:54:22,700
[SPEAKER_09]: You just suck and make my job harder.

2169
02:54:25,441 --> 02:54:26,161
[SPEAKER_08]: My F.U.

2170
02:54:26,242 --> 02:54:28,663
[SPEAKER_08]: just goes to the swine flu.

2171
02:54:30,203 --> 02:54:30,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really.

2172
02:54:31,943 --> 02:54:32,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Need I say more?

2173
02:54:32,843 --> 02:54:34,564
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard the first 20 minutes of tonight's show.

2174
02:54:35,364 --> 02:54:38,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, we found that story that's supposed to inspire tonight's FUs.

2175
02:54:39,166 --> 02:54:41,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember this came from a couple weeks ago.

2176
02:54:41,627 --> 02:54:48,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember hearing about the raid where the police guys busted into the house and started playing the Nintendo Wii during the raid?

2177
02:54:48,590 --> 02:54:48,770
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2178
02:54:48,950 --> 02:54:53,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this was the show you weren't here because you did miss a show or two because you had other things going on.

2179
02:54:54,393 --> 02:54:58,279
[SPEAKER_08]: There was actually police that broke into a house and started playing the Wii that was there.

2180
02:54:59,961 --> 02:55:00,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, really?

2181
02:55:00,882 --> 02:55:03,687
[SPEAKER_08]: You're professionals and you're sitting there playing the Wii or whatever on the job?

2182
02:55:04,267 --> 02:55:07,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently what happens is that as

2183
02:55:08,241 --> 02:55:10,862
[SPEAKER_08]: As punishment, did these officers get fired?

2184
02:55:11,302 --> 02:55:13,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they get suspended without pay?

2185
02:55:13,643 --> 02:55:16,064
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're going to have to go through some retraining.

2186
02:55:16,804 --> 02:55:20,665
[SPEAKER_08]: The officers even, those names are being withheld because they are undercover police.

2187
02:55:21,325 --> 02:55:24,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And the company is saying they are learning from their mistakes.

2188
02:55:24,206 --> 02:55:30,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, these officers that were screwing around playing the Wii on the job got a slap on the wrist and are getting sent back to training.

2189
02:55:31,309 --> 02:55:32,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a trainer...

2190
02:55:33,493 --> 02:55:37,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, no, for the sake of separating my job from this, I'm not going to get into it.

2191
02:55:37,415 --> 02:55:38,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I will tell you this.

2192
02:55:38,456 --> 02:55:43,259
[SPEAKER_08]: There's certain things about that excuse that really strike a nerve with me, and that's all I can say.

2193
02:55:44,439 --> 02:55:46,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to keep my work and personal separate, though.

2194
02:55:46,541 --> 02:55:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I will talk about my experience.

2195
02:55:48,302 --> 02:55:48,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

2196
02:55:48,722 --> 02:55:56,967
[SPEAKER_05]: As a person who is required to take a certain number of training classes a year, I think that they're just going to be more inconvenienced than anything else to go to a class to learn stuff that they already know.

2197
02:55:58,127 --> 02:56:01,351
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference between knowing something and caring enough to put it into practice.

2198
02:56:02,212 --> 02:56:03,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my point.

2199
02:56:03,473 --> 02:56:07,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be, oh, we have to sit in the class for a day.

2200
02:56:07,538 --> 02:56:09,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

2201
02:56:12,165 --> 02:56:14,146
[SPEAKER_08]: There is so much I want to say, but can't.

2202
02:56:14,386 --> 02:56:14,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't.

2203
02:56:15,207 --> 02:56:15,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2204
02:56:15,767 --> 02:56:17,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Say after the show so you can get it out.

2205
02:56:17,268 --> 02:56:24,712
[SPEAKER_08]: After the show, I would love to share it with you personally, but I can't talk about it on a platform where people... I don't know who has access to it and who could share it with who.

2206
02:56:24,952 --> 02:56:26,412
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's just so much I could say about this.

2207
02:56:26,432 --> 02:56:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this, though, and I will tell you this because I do know our trainers and I know the hard work that they put into it.

2208
02:56:33,056 --> 02:56:38,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I usually at least pay attention, but all of them know...

2209
02:56:39,811 --> 02:56:41,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you think these guys are going to sit there and pay attention?

2210
02:56:41,913 --> 02:56:42,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

2211
02:56:42,353 --> 02:56:42,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They're dicks.

2212
02:56:43,013 --> 02:56:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is probably a waste of everyone's time, right?

2213
02:56:46,295 --> 02:56:46,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2214
02:56:48,316 --> 02:56:51,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on with some other stories.

2215
02:56:51,078 --> 02:56:54,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think playing a Wii is cause for suspension, but still.

2216
02:56:55,101 --> 02:56:59,083
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, though, like, really, you're there to do a job.

2217
02:57:00,584 --> 02:57:04,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the bad press for the police itself is punishment enough, I suppose.

2218
02:57:04,907 --> 02:57:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be bad enough, yeah.

2219
02:57:06,147 --> 02:57:06,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose.

2220
02:57:07,829 --> 02:57:08,449
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

2221
02:57:11,058 --> 02:57:11,438
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2222
02:57:12,159 --> 02:57:17,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so this is kind of cool because, of course, you know, huge Grand Theft Auto fan.

2223
02:57:17,903 --> 02:57:25,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC just recently got an update to, I believe, live.

2224
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:30,092
[SPEAKER_09]: The Games for Windows Live also kind of got an update as well.

2225
02:57:30,673 --> 02:57:39,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, the download content for The Lost and Damned, the achievements are showing up now on Game for Windows Live for...

2226
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:47,425
[SPEAKER_09]: So that can only mean one thing, that the download content that once was exclusive to the Xbox 360 is coming to PC.

2227
02:57:47,985 --> 02:58:03,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And that makes sense, because if you think about it, if Microsoft paid to have that download content made, or at least paid for the exclusivity, Games for Windows is still Microsoft, so perhaps we will see both episodes eventually released for the PC, and probably sooner than later.

2228
02:58:06,177 --> 02:58:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty sweet.

2229
02:58:07,278 --> 02:58:09,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, PS3 owners, no word on that.

2230
02:58:11,966 --> 02:58:12,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2231
02:58:12,326 --> 02:58:15,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, it could open the door to that, possibly?

2232
02:58:15,567 --> 02:58:16,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily.

2233
02:58:16,687 --> 02:58:19,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they could literally port this in a heartbeat.

2234
02:58:19,787 --> 02:58:25,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everything that's on there can be, you know, it's a multi-platform anyways.

2235
02:58:25,908 --> 02:58:28,269
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be ported, like, seriously super quick.

2236
02:58:28,849 --> 02:58:30,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they already have the hardware done.

2237
02:58:30,589 --> 02:58:32,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the engine's already done.

2238
02:58:32,170 --> 02:58:33,590
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really have to change too much.

2239
02:58:34,650 --> 02:58:36,550
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're just not gonna because they're under contract.

2240
02:58:37,190 --> 02:58:38,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially if, you know, $50 million says, you know,

2241
02:58:41,479 --> 02:58:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of buys some time, I should say.

2242
02:58:45,186 --> 02:58:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably will never make it over to the PS3.

2243
02:58:48,470 --> 02:58:50,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, dudes, I got one more story for you.

2244
02:58:51,091 --> 02:58:52,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Dudes, do you like Barbie?

2245
02:58:53,131 --> 02:58:58,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course you do, because how else is the Xbox Live Marketplace selling Avatar clothing?

2246
02:58:58,652 --> 02:59:00,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's basically what it is.

2247
02:59:00,813 --> 02:59:02,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Barbie for dudes.

2248
02:59:03,273 --> 02:59:04,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And dudettes, of course, too.

2249
02:59:05,233 --> 02:59:12,615
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, some people like to buy these clothes and dress their own little character and buy the Malibu Beach backgrounds and whatever else you can get on Xbox Live Marketplace.

2250
02:59:12,955 --> 02:59:13,916
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2251
02:59:41,618 --> 02:59:42,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know.

2252
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:45,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Also of interest, a Da Vinci's Flying Machine.

2253
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:46,840
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to get that.

2254
02:59:46,860 --> 02:59:48,441
[SPEAKER_08]: 240 Microsoft points for that.

2255
02:59:48,581 --> 02:59:49,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's also from Assassin's Creed 2.

2256
02:59:49,702 --> 02:59:50,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually kind of want that.

2257
02:59:52,923 --> 02:59:53,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2258
02:59:53,323 --> 02:59:54,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of... You know what?

2259
02:59:55,024 --> 02:59:55,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see...

2260
02:59:57,654 --> 03:00:00,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I can sit here and make fun of this stuff a little bit.

2261
03:00:01,276 --> 03:00:02,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I'm no better.

2262
03:00:02,497 --> 03:00:06,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent $10 on a Warcraft bet this week, so I'm really no better.

2263
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:09,062
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do find this stuff to be a little silly.

2264
03:00:09,102 --> 03:00:11,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And even I can admit, what I did was silly too.

2265
03:00:11,944 --> 03:00:27,394
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think this whole buying for your virtual costume, when a lot of games don't even really use them, I mean, I guess a few do, like Guitar Hero does and stuff, maybe more will next year or what have you, but pretty soon it's all going to be Natal, so you will be in the game anyway, not your avatar.

2266
03:00:27,894 --> 03:00:29,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

2267
03:00:30,356 --> 03:00:30,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, though.

2268
03:00:31,817 --> 03:00:32,237
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2269
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:43,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, some folks in chat are complaining that the stream has died, but I am seeing... Oh, we did drop for a minute.

2270
03:00:44,785 --> 03:00:46,326
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're reconnected now, and we're good.

2271
03:00:46,386 --> 03:00:48,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the stream did drop for a minute.

2272
03:00:48,167 --> 03:00:48,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what happened there.

2273
03:00:49,849 --> 03:00:50,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Technical glitch!

2274
03:00:51,390 --> 03:00:51,830
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens.

2275
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:52,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know what to do.

2276
03:00:52,490 --> 03:00:53,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I was downloading all that porn.

2277
03:00:53,531 --> 03:00:54,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Rob.

2278
03:00:55,092 --> 03:00:55,532
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2279
03:00:56,293 --> 03:00:56,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Knew it!

2280
03:00:57,560 --> 03:01:01,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, live folks, keep in mind there's not a lot we can do when the stream goes down.

2281
03:01:01,903 --> 03:01:03,644
[SPEAKER_08]: It does usually tend to come back right away.

2282
03:01:04,004 --> 03:01:08,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So our biggest advice to our live listeners would be just wait patiently 30 seconds and reload.

2283
03:01:08,548 --> 03:01:09,708
[SPEAKER_08]: You usually won't miss too much.

2284
03:01:09,748 --> 03:01:13,451
[SPEAKER_08]: You just miss me making jokes about how the Xbox Live Marketplace is like Barbie for dudes.

2285
03:01:13,731 --> 03:01:14,071
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

2286
03:01:14,872 --> 03:01:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2287
03:01:15,532 --> 03:01:16,173
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't miss much.

2288
03:01:16,826 --> 03:01:20,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get into the Skype line.

2289
03:01:20,187 --> 03:01:22,328
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give us a call.

2290
03:01:22,428 --> 03:01:24,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

2291
03:01:24,808 --> 03:01:25,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and give us a call.

2292
03:01:25,768 --> 03:01:30,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of technical difficulties, I hate the new Skype.

2293
03:01:30,210 --> 03:01:34,791
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been listening in the past few weeks, Skype got a makeover the last couple months and I hate it.

2294
03:01:35,311 --> 03:01:38,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the old one so, so, so much.

2295
03:01:38,532 --> 03:01:41,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the first version of Skype we used several years ago.

2296
03:01:41,533 --> 03:01:50,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I would see everybody that was calling in so everybody would have a fair shot of being on the show because I could actually pick callers that I didn't recognize were calling in and you rotate it a little bit.

2297
03:01:51,557 --> 03:01:53,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even get that now in Skype.

2298
03:01:53,518 --> 03:01:56,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Now Skype likes to randomly drop calls and do all this stuff.

2299
03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:57,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I hate it.

2300
03:01:58,226 --> 03:02:00,248
[SPEAKER_08]: We all hate it.

2301
03:02:00,288 --> 03:02:02,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what up?

2302
03:02:02,269 --> 03:02:04,091
[SPEAKER_01]: This is X-Link calling from Melbourne, Florida.

2303
03:02:04,111 --> 03:02:12,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that in your neck of the woods?

2304
03:02:12,437 --> 03:02:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that happen?

2305
03:02:14,218 --> 03:02:15,159
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it didn't happen around me.

2306
03:02:15,219 --> 03:02:16,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened in a different part of town.

2307
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:22,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's great to know that these wonderful cops who get sworn to duty have nothing better to do than raid a house and play a Wii.

2308
03:02:22,544 --> 03:02:25,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fix is more training, is the fix.

2309
03:02:25,066 --> 03:02:25,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2310
03:02:25,527 --> 03:02:25,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2311
03:02:26,147 --> 03:02:29,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Not suspension, not getting fired, but more training.

2312
03:02:29,329 --> 03:02:32,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Because clearly, they were not trained properly the first time.

2313
03:02:33,632 --> 03:02:33,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2314
03:02:34,252 --> 03:02:35,974
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you bowl a 300 game in Wii.

2315
03:02:36,154 --> 03:02:40,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So the responsibility falls upon the trainers of the company to do the... Never mind.

2316
03:02:41,157 --> 03:02:41,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

2317
03:02:41,497 --> 03:02:42,018
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

2318
03:02:42,738 --> 03:02:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I called because I want to call about a PSP game that recently came out, but before I do that, Spazinator, quick tip.

2319
03:02:50,303 --> 03:02:54,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why he couldn't have a copy, like, hooked up his PS3 to the...

2320
03:02:56,167 --> 03:03:14,183
[SPEAKER_01]: PC or through his PSP and then copy it onto his PC because every time when I get something new downloaded from the PlayStation Store, I always try to make a copy available on my hard drive just in case if something would happen or crash, I would have that backup as a storage

2321
03:03:15,064 --> 03:03:17,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what he said he did.

2322
03:03:39,690 --> 03:03:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2323
03:03:56,650 --> 03:03:57,450
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a weird situation.

2324
03:03:57,470 --> 03:03:58,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's very weird.

2325
03:03:59,391 --> 03:04:04,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm kind of sitting here going, you know, whereas I think Spazinator has some very valid concerns.

2326
03:04:04,613 --> 03:04:06,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like there's a piece of the puzzle.

2327
03:04:06,414 --> 03:04:14,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to hear Sony's policy on this because I feel like that piece is missing and we might be misrepresenting their policy a little bit and I don't want to do that either.

2328
03:04:14,277 --> 03:04:17,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why you could do it as long as you have the idea and everything.

2329
03:04:17,198 --> 03:04:18,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why there would be a problem with it.

2330
03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:21,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very curious to see how this further develops.

2331
03:04:21,380 --> 03:04:22,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he'll do it.

2332
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:24,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he'll follow up on it and let us know.

2333
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:26,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had an interesting situation earlier on.

2334
03:04:26,801 --> 03:04:27,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to make this quick, too.

2335
03:04:28,181 --> 03:04:38,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Mass Effect a while back for the PC and unfortunately didn't have the CD code, though I could have easily gone on Torrent and got a no CD fix and stuff like that.

2336
03:04:38,364 --> 03:04:40,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to have it legalized.

2337
03:04:41,801 --> 03:04:50,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went through the EA website, talked to somebody through the chat, which was absolutely horrid.

2338
03:04:50,434 --> 03:04:55,502
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy told me just to call the manufacturer and get a key from them, which I don't think he understood that it wasn't a download.

2339
03:04:56,503 --> 03:05:05,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I ended up calling the, um, the, uh, long distance phone number for the tech support, uh, was put on hold for 20 minutes, got through to a guy.

2340
03:05:05,549 --> 03:05:07,890
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy was very nice, very civilized.

2341
03:05:07,970 --> 03:05:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I explained to him very nicely my problem and explained to him about it and, um, gave him the, you know, and we went through all the steps and he told me, he gave me, uh, he sent me an email.

2342
03:05:16,976 --> 03:05:19,037
[SPEAKER_01]: He said on the email, he goes, go to this page.

2343
03:05:19,117 --> 03:05:20,258
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, what's your response?

2344
03:05:20,358 --> 03:05:25,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, set up some, uh, photos of the booklet and show that the fact that you didn't get a CD key.

2345
03:05:25,321 --> 03:05:25,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

2346
03:05:26,481 --> 03:05:33,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, did it, and the very next day they sent me a CD, uh, another person from the tech support sent me a CD key so I can actually have a legit version of my game.

2347
03:05:33,785 --> 03:05:37,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was very cool, instead of paying like 10 or 20 bucks for a CD key for it.

2348
03:05:38,331 --> 03:05:39,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2349
03:06:03,451 --> 03:06:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2350
03:06:29,041 --> 03:06:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not at liberty to say specifically people I know that were affected by it, but some names you might remember from the shows yesteryear.

2351
03:06:37,344 --> 03:06:41,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very unfortunate, and we hope for the best for our fans.

2352
03:06:41,566 --> 03:06:41,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

2353
03:06:41,826 --> 03:06:47,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one or two from the Ted Braun, but like you said, too, I'm not going to mention any names either.

2354
03:06:47,968 --> 03:06:52,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we want to respect their privacy and wish them the best of luck because layoffs are never any fun.

2355
03:06:52,790 --> 03:06:53,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Most definitely.

2356
03:06:54,866 --> 03:06:56,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a game for the pinball.

2357
03:06:56,828 --> 03:06:58,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Pinball Heroes.

2358
03:06:58,610 --> 03:07:01,512
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the $3.99 one that recently came out on the PlayStation Network.

2359
03:07:02,293 --> 03:07:03,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good game.

2360
03:07:03,815 --> 03:07:04,395
[SPEAKER_01]: $3.99 pinball.

2361
03:07:04,736 --> 03:07:06,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it very much.

2362
03:07:06,397 --> 03:07:09,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem I had with it was the fact that...

2363
03:07:11,161 --> 03:07:24,866
[SPEAKER_01]: for each of the tables it's $3.99 but it has great scoring system it keeps a little achievement I think there's trophies you can get for it too if you hook it up to the PS3 through their trophy system

2364
03:07:25,906 --> 03:07:37,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, it keeps on only scoring for not only for local when you play, you know, the, uh, the PlayStation, but also you can go against other people from around the globe that has the game on the network.

2365
03:07:37,556 --> 03:07:41,238
[SPEAKER_01]: It will upload your score and go against other people's score, which is really awesome.

2366
03:07:42,199 --> 03:07:48,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it, the only problem I had with it was the multi-ball was the screen would kind of like zoom outward, um,

2367
03:07:49,645 --> 03:08:08,315
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would get kind of the table would get much smaller but when it's done it will zoom back in but if you're in multi-ball and you really have a hard time seeing I can see that being like a partly of a problem seeing like the little balls and like guys that goes around and hit stuff but other than that I've been having a lot of fun with it and for a four-hour game that's not that bad.

2368
03:08:09,364 --> 03:08:09,744
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2369
03:08:10,465 --> 03:08:12,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we appreciate the perspective and all that.

2370
03:08:13,067 --> 03:08:16,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to go ahead and let you go, though, so we can get some more calls.

2371
03:08:16,370 --> 03:08:20,653
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you for your – you had a hometown buffet of stories tonight, but I like it.

2372
03:08:20,933 --> 03:08:22,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I like hearing all the different stuff.

2373
03:08:22,594 --> 03:08:26,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So some reviews and customer service goods and bads all rolled into one.

2374
03:08:27,378 --> 03:08:28,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was ironic.

2375
03:08:28,239 --> 03:08:31,321
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this whole customer service thing, and then I had the customer service this week.

2376
03:08:32,162 --> 03:08:32,602
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2377
03:08:33,042 --> 03:08:33,283
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2378
03:08:33,303 --> 03:08:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Gil.

2379
03:08:34,003 --> 03:08:36,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, and, hey, have fun on World of Warcraft.

2380
03:08:36,465 --> 03:08:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2381
03:08:36,886 --> 03:08:37,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

2382
03:08:37,647 --> 03:08:38,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that crack.

2383
03:08:38,508 --> 03:08:39,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're welcome.

2384
03:08:39,530 --> 03:08:41,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to win myself out of it.

2385
03:08:41,853 --> 03:08:42,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

2386
03:08:43,475 --> 03:08:46,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was X-Link here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2387
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:47,701
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a couple more calls.

2388
03:08:49,008 --> 03:08:50,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku

2389
03:09:10,662 --> 03:09:13,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Saku, you're the type of guy that's into Modern Warfare, right?

2390
03:09:14,125 --> 03:09:22,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and I mean, I would play it if they had dedicated servers on the PC, then I would have justification to spend money on it.

2391
03:09:23,411 --> 03:09:26,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so you're one of the protesters that is actually protesting.

2392
03:09:27,234 --> 03:09:33,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I mean, I have the money right now, and even if I didn't have the money, I wanted to see how this would play out first.

2393
03:09:34,119 --> 03:09:38,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I could see how this new matchmaking would work on the PC.

2394
03:09:38,901 --> 03:09:43,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, it works just like the 360, works like the console versions.

2395
03:09:44,123 --> 03:09:48,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, props to you sticking to your guns and actually meaning it and actually sticking to the cause.

2396
03:09:50,046 --> 03:09:51,147
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2397
03:10:07,444 --> 03:10:09,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like the Halo effect.

2398
03:10:09,425 --> 03:10:18,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen how the subsequent Halo releases, like Halo 2 and 3, and you see people lining up for midnight launches?

2399
03:10:18,870 --> 03:10:19,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of that.

2400
03:10:20,111 --> 03:10:36,200
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a game that managed to develop a big following on the first type of game, the first non-World War 2 game in the Call of Duty franchise, and yet that game managed to get Halo numbers for its sequel.

2401
03:10:37,537 --> 03:10:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: which it took a Bungie 3 just to get that amount whereas Infinity War just got it on the second try.

2402
03:10:47,124 --> 03:10:49,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a surprise hit.

2403
03:10:49,465 --> 03:10:54,329
[SPEAKER_02]: No one would have thought Modern Warfare would outdo the whole Call of Duty series.

2404
03:10:55,450 --> 03:10:57,211
[SPEAKER_02]: That was completely unexpected.

2405
03:10:58,769 --> 03:11:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought Halo 3 just for shits and giggles I had my 360 back then

2406
03:11:18,303 --> 03:11:21,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, I never got into the campaign mode at all.

2407
03:11:21,104 --> 03:11:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to do multiplayer because I don't play shooters on consoles.

2408
03:11:27,086 --> 03:11:29,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I just play it on keyboard and mouse.

2409
03:11:29,787 --> 03:11:31,068
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit old-fashioned.

2410
03:11:31,328 --> 03:11:40,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but to summarize though, you still say that folks shouldn't get Modern Warfare 2, at least not on the PC, until they address what the fans want.

2411
03:11:41,112 --> 03:11:41,992
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, if they...

2412
03:11:42,632 --> 03:11:49,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if they want a good single-player experience with the keyboard and mouse, then by all means, they should buy it.

2413
03:11:49,878 --> 03:12:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you have to really stick to your guns if you really want to wait out until Infinity Ward decides to come to their senses and release something for the community that it apparently backstabbed when killing off the dedicated servers.

2414
03:12:08,513 --> 03:12:15,807
[SPEAKER_08]: You know buddy, I'm sure I don't even have to ask, but what about this rumor that they might allow the dedicated servers later on for more money?

2415
03:12:16,772 --> 03:12:20,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that depends on whether or not that actually comes to fruition.

2416
03:12:20,753 --> 03:12:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not it's just a rumor, so you'd rather take it with a grain of salt.

2417
03:12:25,735 --> 03:12:29,137
[SPEAKER_02]: What I heard recently was that the hackers managed to outdo them already.

2418
03:12:29,277 --> 03:12:33,778
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had dedicated server support and a console.

2419
03:12:34,439 --> 03:12:40,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The little console that you hit whenever you press the tilde key on the keyboard, just like any other first-person shooter.

2420
03:12:40,241 --> 03:12:40,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have...

2421
03:12:41,641 --> 03:12:47,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone managed to hack the game and add console support, dedicated server as a proof of concept.

2422
03:12:48,087 --> 03:12:48,787
[SPEAKER_02]: No surprise.

2423
03:12:49,068 --> 03:12:49,288
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

2424
03:12:49,648 --> 03:12:49,888
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

2425
03:12:49,988 --> 03:12:53,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the hacker community, when they set out to do something, they fucking do it.

2426
03:12:53,551 --> 03:12:55,553
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to say I'm not surprised at all.

2427
03:12:55,573 --> 03:13:06,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it won't be that long before Infinity Ward gets steamed to add that in the blacklist for back.

2428
03:13:06,582 --> 03:13:09,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the folks that run the hacked version get banned.

2429
03:13:09,424 --> 03:13:11,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Zaku, I know you may not have called in.

2430
03:13:11,867 --> 03:13:13,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I made you kind of talk about Modern Warfare 2.

2431
03:13:13,630 --> 03:13:19,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's originally why you called in tonight, but before we let you go, I wanted to let you get out whatever you wanted to actually call in and talk about tonight.

2432
03:13:20,468 --> 03:13:27,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I'm trying to basically play DJ Hero for the first time last night under the influence of alcohol.

2433
03:13:28,112 --> 03:13:33,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of a transition since I'm more of a 2DX kind of guy.

2434
03:13:33,955 --> 03:13:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's going to take a while.

2435
03:13:36,276 --> 03:13:39,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't see it as a game I would normally play on my own.

2436
03:13:40,558 --> 03:13:45,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because most of the songs are of a genre that I don't listen to.

2437
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:46,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are some good ones.

2438
03:13:47,642 --> 03:13:59,971
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the stuff that with Tiesto and Paul Van Dyke for example and even the one where Tears for Fears and Pajano is like you know mixed up but it's really not like 2DX at all is it?

2439
03:14:00,091 --> 03:14:16,504
[SPEAKER_02]: of course I kind of see it that way because it's basically in this game you actually scratch and you actually move a crossfader so I guess in a sense Activision made it more realistic yeah it's different alright Zaku we gotta let you go buddy but thanks so much for the call as always and take care okay

2440
03:14:17,162 --> 03:14:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2441
03:14:17,742 --> 03:14:19,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Later, you too.

2442
03:14:19,063 --> 03:14:22,403
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to get in.

2443
03:14:22,543 --> 03:14:23,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll take one more call.

2444
03:14:25,384 --> 03:14:26,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

2445
03:14:29,525 --> 03:14:31,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really, but here's what I got.

2446
03:14:31,786 --> 03:14:43,689
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be doing possibly, well, there's a possible spin-off they're talking about doing for Modern Warfare starring, and I had to laugh because the character's name is Ghost, so it'd be like a Modern Warfare Ghost character.

2447
03:14:44,663 --> 03:14:46,123
[SPEAKER_08]: StarCraftGoes, but not.

2448
03:14:46,884 --> 03:14:47,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But not.

2449
03:14:47,444 --> 03:14:47,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

2450
03:14:48,164 --> 03:14:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we got a phone call.

2451
03:14:48,964 --> 03:14:49,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2452
03:14:49,864 --> 03:14:50,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2453
03:14:51,165 --> 03:14:53,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, OU across the ocean.

2454
03:14:53,946 --> 03:14:58,347
[SPEAKER_07]: OU in the land of the free or so we're to say.

2455
03:14:58,467 --> 03:15:00,507
[SPEAKER_08]: The state that falls into the ocean in 2012.

2456
03:15:00,547 --> 03:15:02,248
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we are.

2457
03:15:02,268 --> 03:15:03,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what the hell?

2458
03:15:03,308 --> 03:15:03,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all dead.

2459
03:15:03,808 --> 03:15:04,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hello there, OLR.

2460
03:15:04,949 --> 03:15:07,049
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that one, Aki Ripper.

2461
03:15:07,129 --> 03:15:09,370
[SPEAKER_08]: But John Cusack survives, so the hell with the rest of us.

2462
03:15:10,090 --> 03:15:12,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Aki Ripper, it's been forever since we've heard from you.

2463
03:15:12,571 --> 03:15:13,431
[SPEAKER_08]: What is on your mind, buddy?

2464
03:15:14,920 --> 03:15:17,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wow, what's on my mind?

2465
03:15:17,543 --> 03:15:24,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I've given a reason actually to buy a Wii since, well, I saw footage of that new Super Mario Bros.

2466
03:15:25,769 --> 03:15:40,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, since I still actually haven't bought a Wii, even though I actually have like four games, actually already have four games, so... Wait, so you already have the games, but you just didn't have the Wii?

2467
03:15:40,242 --> 03:15:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2468
03:15:40,973 --> 03:15:41,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

2469
03:15:43,194 --> 03:15:46,274
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of the backwards way of doing it, but okay.

2470
03:15:46,795 --> 03:16:02,399
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was like, I was at that point of like, there was like this plenty of games that I'm really interested in, but I either choose to buy the console and have no games, or buy the games or have no console.

2471
03:16:04,782 --> 03:16:06,283
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you're the crazy Swedish guy.

2472
03:16:06,363 --> 03:16:07,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no problem.

2473
03:16:11,990 --> 03:16:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, it's quite fun in a way since I'm the kind of collector in a way.

2474
03:16:17,677 --> 03:16:18,298
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool, though.

2475
03:16:18,318 --> 03:16:18,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

2476
03:16:19,098 --> 03:16:19,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you, though.

2477
03:16:19,999 --> 03:16:22,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And having things on my shelf is like a bonus.

2478
03:16:22,962 --> 03:16:26,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask you, though, about New Super Mario Bros., because obviously the game just came out over here today.

2479
03:16:27,206 --> 03:16:28,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually kind of surprised.

2480
03:16:28,827 --> 03:16:35,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't touched the game myself yet outside of my short experience with it at E3, and you don't judge a game based off an E3 build.

2481
03:16:35,666 --> 03:16:49,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm kind of surprised because, of course, the gaming community did a little bit of backlash with the game with the whole easy button stuff that's going around, although we've talked a little more about how that's actually integrated into the game, and it kind of sounds like it might be interesting.

2482
03:16:50,411 --> 03:16:53,212
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing, I was looking at some of the Metacritic scores for this.

2483
03:16:53,872 --> 03:16:55,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's getting glowing reviews.

2484
03:16:55,692 --> 03:16:59,514
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is probably going to end up on people's top ten list when all is said and done at the end of the year.

2485
03:17:00,014 --> 03:17:00,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Many critics...

2486
03:17:01,835 --> 03:17:22,914
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I'm basing, in a way though, the video I saw was on Giant Bomb, and they were playing 4 player co-op, and that looked hilarious fun, really, so, that had me like stoked for it, so.

2487
03:17:23,607 --> 03:17:26,910
[SPEAKER_08]: When I actually have three of my friends come over to play video games, it'll be great.

2488
03:17:27,310 --> 03:17:31,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But my only concern is, is single-player mode fun, too?

2489
03:17:31,653 --> 03:17:34,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Because sometimes, I have to play video games by myself.

2490
03:17:34,536 --> 03:17:35,636
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, that's most of the time.

2491
03:17:36,797 --> 03:17:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's another thing, in a way, though, is that, well, the following week, in a way, though, if I get my Wii, I will still be busy, in a kind of way, with the new Sims 3 expansion.

2492
03:17:49,507 --> 03:17:49,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2493
03:17:51,209 --> 03:17:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right there with you on that.

2494
03:17:52,870 --> 03:17:54,790
[SPEAKER_08]: You are not alone in this studio with that.

2495
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:57,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one question, though.

2496
03:17:57,151 --> 03:17:58,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have President Cat sitting on your shelf?

2497
03:17:59,932 --> 03:18:01,112
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't.

2498
03:18:01,473 --> 03:18:02,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, not yet.

2499
03:18:04,133 --> 03:18:13,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, since we have a mod-friendly one around your block, so to say, and...

2500
03:18:15,012 --> 03:18:35,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering, is it, since I heard about the 360 bannings and such, well, I own a 360, but I have no plans whatsoever on shipping that one, but I was thinking about getting a shipped, getting a flashed or shipped Wii.

2501
03:18:37,230 --> 03:18:41,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like any, how does that work out, so to say?

2502
03:18:42,073 --> 03:18:47,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you recommend people do this to their Wii's or is this a risk you don't want to take or what?

2503
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:56,328
[SPEAKER_09]: There's mods now that seriously, you open the Wii up and you have to have a tri-wing screwdriver to do that but that's easy to get.

2504
03:18:57,100 --> 03:18:57,600
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

2505
03:19:17,691 --> 03:19:20,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very unlikely that you will break it up, especially when you're not soldering it.

2506
03:19:21,153 --> 03:19:30,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I either solder my chip in, and from a person who can't solder for shit, soldering hair-thin wires on there, I'm surprised it works still.

2507
03:19:30,839 --> 03:19:33,721
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does, and if I can do it, then anybody can do it.

2508
03:19:34,162 --> 03:19:38,925
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, it's seriously a new board, so they have some that literally will just plug in.

2509
03:19:39,005 --> 03:19:40,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it worth it?

2510
03:19:40,105 --> 03:19:44,048
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to step away from the I-did-it-because-I-can mentality for a little bit.

2511
03:19:45,989 --> 03:19:46,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

2512
03:19:47,490 --> 03:19:48,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

2513
03:19:48,331 --> 03:19:48,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2514
03:19:49,291 --> 03:19:58,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, once again, for the clarification whatsoever, I'm not really interested in pirating games.

2515
03:19:58,797 --> 03:20:03,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, still, you can do it for playing region free stuff.

2516
03:20:03,581 --> 03:20:08,684
[SPEAKER_07]: When you do such a thing, from my point of view, is to buy imports, right?

2517
03:20:11,141 --> 03:20:13,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like I said, I played President Cat on it.

2518
03:20:13,562 --> 03:20:16,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I also, back in the day, I imported, you know, Smash Brothers.

2519
03:20:16,643 --> 03:20:18,144
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, you had the Japanese Smash Brothers.

2520
03:20:18,164 --> 03:20:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember that when you premiered that on, what was it, Uprade?

2521
03:20:23,727 --> 03:20:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't Uprade.

2522
03:20:24,647 --> 03:20:25,968
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Justin.TV or something.

2523
03:20:26,008 --> 03:20:29,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It was either our Ustream at the time, or no, I'm sorry, we've never been on Ustream.

2524
03:20:29,149 --> 03:20:30,830
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have a Ustream channel, we just never used it.

2525
03:20:31,990 --> 03:20:34,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Justin.TV, or what was before that?

2526
03:20:34,931 --> 03:20:35,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Uprader 11.

2527
03:20:36,112 --> 03:20:37,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Uprader 11, that's the one.

2528
03:20:37,132 --> 03:20:38,093
[SPEAKER_08]: All games was all...

2529
03:20:38,853 --> 03:20:39,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Up On That Channel

2530
03:21:04,918 --> 03:21:07,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what plans that is for the network.

2531
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:11,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We usually find out about that stuff after it's already set in motion.

2532
03:21:11,923 --> 03:21:15,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly when I read that tweet, I was like, oh, that's pretty exciting for them.

2533
03:21:15,786 --> 03:21:19,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I kind of miss having that spot to...

2534
03:21:21,806 --> 03:21:26,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The best E3 I still think was the year that we had the arena and that whole thing going on.

2535
03:21:27,148 --> 03:21:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about you guys, that was my favorite E3.

2536
03:21:29,708 --> 03:21:43,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also the one where we probably worked the hardest and were the most tired afterwards, but just getting to all convene afterwards with the other podcasters, very much like us, in that really fun, almost frat house kind of place that I'm sure just lost somebody a shitload of money.

2537
03:21:44,092 --> 03:21:44,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Ron.

2538
03:21:44,592 --> 03:21:44,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2539
03:21:46,124 --> 03:21:48,806
[SPEAKER_08]: But goddamn, it was fun while it lasted.

2540
03:21:49,326 --> 03:21:50,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, sorry.

2541
03:21:51,047 --> 03:21:53,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a little off the tangent there, but it was worth mentioning.

2542
03:21:54,370 --> 03:21:55,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of luck to our pals.

2543
03:21:55,490 --> 03:21:56,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what more?

2544
03:21:56,371 --> 03:21:57,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what more?

2545
03:21:57,812 --> 03:22:09,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's been released like more than a few games around, and I still haven't... I have barely, in a way, though, installed Dragon Age and played it for like...

2546
03:22:10,017 --> 03:22:11,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Two minutes in a kind of way.

2547
03:22:11,859 --> 03:22:18,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how it didn't make the show roll tonight, but I heard about the gay sex in Dragon Age and the lesbian sex and all this stuff.

2548
03:22:18,164 --> 03:22:21,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you have sex with an animal or something in that game?

2549
03:22:21,967 --> 03:22:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2550
03:22:22,708 --> 03:22:22,988
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2551
03:22:23,288 --> 03:22:23,768
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously.

2552
03:22:23,808 --> 03:22:25,130
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no.

2553
03:22:25,470 --> 03:22:34,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not follow up my big story about gay sex in a video game that's not completely tacky with, oh, by the way, you can also have sex with an animal.

2554
03:22:34,277 --> 03:22:36,319
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound like a Prop 8 supporter right now.

2555
03:22:36,991 --> 03:22:37,852
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you sound like.

2556
03:22:37,872 --> 03:22:38,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

2557
03:22:38,432 --> 03:22:38,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

2558
03:22:38,973 --> 03:22:39,494
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

2559
03:22:39,534 --> 03:22:41,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have anything else.

2560
03:22:42,757 --> 03:22:45,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me finish up with Aki Ripper, then we'll talk about Dragon Age.

2561
03:22:46,921 --> 03:22:49,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I brought sex into it, what were your thoughts on Dragon Age?

2562
03:22:50,805 --> 03:22:59,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks really nice, and, well, you don't need a supercomputer to actually run it, since, well, I run it on mine, and that one isn't...

2563
03:23:00,685 --> 03:23:20,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That one is actually a bit old, but in a way also, my other computer actually, or my primary gaming rig blew up the other month, and well, I had to replace it, and well, I'm up and running once again, so I will...

2564
03:23:21,184 --> 03:23:23,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I have heard glowing reviews on Dragon Age though.

2565
03:23:23,389 --> 03:23:24,651
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are really into this game.

2566
03:23:26,775 --> 03:23:30,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I get the time to play it, it will probably be good.

2567
03:23:30,763 --> 03:23:31,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But for...

2568
03:23:34,956 --> 03:23:40,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I was being stupid, actually, the other week also, since I actually bought Borderlands 2.

2569
03:23:41,419 --> 03:23:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So I now have plenty of games, and in a way, though, I'm not playing anything, kind of.

2570
03:23:48,122 --> 03:23:48,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound like Loki.

2571
03:23:49,422 --> 03:23:49,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me.

2572
03:23:50,903 --> 03:23:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Ripper, we've got to let you go, so we wrap up the show.

2573
03:23:53,284 --> 03:24:00,347
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you so much for calling in, as always, and best of luck with obtaining the Wii and getting your gaming rig up and going again, okay?

2574
03:24:01,067 --> 03:24:01,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.

2575
03:24:01,788 --> 03:24:02,448
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, later, dude.

2576
03:24:03,493 --> 03:24:05,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.

2577
03:24:05,194 --> 03:24:09,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but of course you can always send us an email if you didn't get through.

2578
03:24:09,195 --> 03:24:14,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or of course we're on Twitter as well, Twitter.com slash OLR.

2579
03:24:15,217 --> 03:24:28,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quickly with last minute stories, I don't know if you had anything else, Loki, but I just want to say about Dragon Age, I did see the scene on YouTube, and you know, I like what they, not just the man on man, but the woman on woman, I saw them both or whatever, and I just like that

2580
03:24:28,762 --> 03:24:29,843
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of there.

2581
03:24:30,303 --> 03:24:31,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a little bit cheesy.

2582
03:24:32,544 --> 03:24:33,965
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, sex in video games is cheesy.

2583
03:24:33,985 --> 03:24:35,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not positive about the animals.

2584
03:24:35,505 --> 03:24:37,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I read that a long time ago when they were covering it.

2585
03:24:37,747 --> 03:24:38,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, what?

2586
03:24:38,827 --> 03:24:40,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen a YouTube on that.

2587
03:24:40,628 --> 03:24:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like fable.

2588
03:24:41,829 --> 03:24:43,409
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like something fable would do.

2589
03:24:43,730 --> 03:24:43,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2590
03:24:44,710 --> 03:24:46,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, no, I just... It was funny.

2591
03:24:47,051 --> 03:24:52,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but in the end, I'm not going to buy a game just because it has gay sex in it.

2592
03:24:52,554 --> 03:24:54,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to buy a good game, so...

2593
03:24:55,879 --> 03:24:58,842
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it might actually be... I'm hearing really good things on it.

2594
03:24:59,143 --> 03:25:01,145
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good game that has gay sex in it.

2595
03:25:02,927 --> 03:25:03,467
[SPEAKER_08]: It's win-win.

2596
03:25:04,528 --> 03:25:06,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki, any other last-minute stories for us?

2597
03:25:06,630 --> 03:25:07,612
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

2598
03:25:07,652 --> 03:25:08,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Not anything I ever want to cover.

2599
03:25:10,205 --> 03:25:14,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a text message from a buddy of mine that I guess would qualify as a last minute story who went and saw 2012.

2600
03:25:14,848 --> 03:25:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet again, all these people going to see 2012.

2601
03:25:18,030 --> 03:25:19,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I don't get it either, Jamie.

2602
03:25:19,371 --> 03:25:19,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get it either.

2603
03:25:20,371 --> 03:25:26,795
[SPEAKER_08]: But Prince of Persia movie trailer from Disney looks fantastic, even better than 2012 itself.

2604
03:25:26,996 --> 03:25:28,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Full theater cheered for it.

2605
03:25:29,710 --> 03:25:30,751
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stupid.

2606
03:25:31,051 --> 03:25:33,613
[SPEAKER_09]: No one cheers for Prince of Persia.

2607
03:25:34,494 --> 03:25:41,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I would cheer if they actually are making a decent video game-related movie, of which I hear Prince of Persia just might be.

2608
03:25:41,159 --> 03:25:41,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be.

2609
03:25:43,200 --> 03:25:46,923
[SPEAKER_08]: That just struck me as interesting, though, that the theater would cheer for a trailer.

2610
03:25:46,943 --> 03:25:51,667
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right, you don't hear about that a lot when it's not Harry Potter or one of those.

2611
03:25:51,687 --> 03:25:51,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2612
03:25:53,268 --> 03:25:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2613
03:26:14,551 --> 03:26:15,752
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

2614
03:26:40,603 --> 03:26:42,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Shopping around, shopping around.

2615
03:26:42,805 --> 03:26:43,746
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you shopping for?

2616
03:26:44,046 --> 03:26:45,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Just looking at stuff.

2617
03:26:46,048 --> 03:26:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Porns!

2618
03:26:46,889 --> 03:26:47,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Not porn.

2619
03:26:49,111 --> 03:26:53,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Elf 2, 309.1, jam a card.

2620
03:26:53,355 --> 03:26:54,996
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to find you a BurgerTime, Rob.

2621
03:26:55,256 --> 03:26:56,037
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not BurgerTime.

2622
03:26:56,858 --> 03:27:01,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought for the night is, I do want a main cabinet, I think.

2623
03:27:01,322 --> 03:27:02,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I want one.

2624
03:27:02,543 --> 03:27:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play Miss World New 96 at my own convenience, whatever.

2625
03:27:05,986 --> 03:27:06,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude.

2626
03:27:07,423 --> 03:27:09,104
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the game I would play, too.

2627
03:27:09,164 --> 03:27:09,604
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it.

2628
03:27:09,644 --> 03:27:11,924
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be the first game I fire up on that thing.

2629
03:27:11,944 --> 03:27:15,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The 309-in-1 card has Miss World New 96 on there.

2630
03:27:15,806 --> 03:27:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

2631
03:27:16,786 --> 03:27:18,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised it's even included on there.

2632
03:27:18,627 --> 03:27:19,047
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

2633
03:27:19,067 --> 03:27:22,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a... It's a card... Is that a super gun?

2634
03:27:22,488 --> 03:27:22,968
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

2635
03:27:22,988 --> 03:27:23,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a super gun.

2636
03:27:23,768 --> 03:27:27,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking about building a super gun out of it or building a bar top out of it.

2637
03:27:27,890 --> 03:27:33,552
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a JAMA card that has four gigs worth of games on there.

2638
03:27:35,072 --> 03:27:45,242
[SPEAKER_09]: including all the fighting games and all the beat-em-ups and stuff like that, but for some reason they also have Miss Nude World 96 on there, and I'm not sure why, but... Everybody, move your body!

2639
03:27:45,562 --> 03:27:48,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, oh, Rob would like that, but, you know.

2640
03:27:49,082 --> 03:27:49,362
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2641
03:27:49,442 --> 03:27:50,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that's it.

2642
03:27:50,142 --> 03:27:51,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2643
03:27:52,023 --> 03:28:00,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show even when we are not always punctual with either the podcast or just being here because we get sick or what have you.

2644
03:28:00,327 --> 03:28:02,027
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do appreciate the support of our fans.

2645
03:28:02,448 --> 03:28:04,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually checking out the listener accounts tonight.

2646
03:28:04,829 --> 03:28:09,270
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually had a lot of people listening earlier on in the first hour before people start to go to bed and so forth.

2647
03:28:09,311 --> 03:28:12,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys so much for that and for your continued support of our show.

2648
03:28:13,012 --> 03:28:13,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We really appreciate it.

2649
03:28:13,833 --> 03:28:15,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll continue to be here for you guys and be free.

2650
03:28:15,954 --> 03:28:19,837
[SPEAKER_08]: All we always ask is just tell somebody you know about the show.

2651
03:28:20,137 --> 03:28:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Help spread the word.

2652
03:28:21,097 --> 03:28:21,718
[SPEAKER_08]: It's word of mouth.

2653
03:28:21,858 --> 03:28:23,679
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what helps an independent podcast survive.

2654
03:28:23,979 --> 03:28:29,923
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have marketing dollars or advertisements in magazines or billboards or any of that fun stuff or E3 booths.

2655
03:28:30,304 --> 03:28:37,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, please continue to tell friends and spread the word about not only what we're doing here on Orange Lounge Radio but what the All Games Network is doing.

2656
03:28:37,608 --> 03:28:42,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you hate our show, you might like one of the other ones on the network might be talking about the games that you're interested in hearing.

2657
03:28:43,413 --> 03:29:00,992
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a win-win situation though continuing to grow independent podcasting because we tell it like it is so we'll be back to do it all again next week barring any outbreaks of malaria or something here in studio so we'll see you guys next week until then I'm Rob she's Jamie he's Loki and we're out

2658
03:29:01,693 --> 03:29:04,474
