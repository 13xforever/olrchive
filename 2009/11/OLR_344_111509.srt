Orange, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, November 15th, 2009. Has GameStop decided to start ignoring street dates?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Is Facebook integration coming for the PS3?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And Final Fantasy 13 finally gets a release date in the U.S. and U.K.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange, Lounge, Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now with 75% less sickness.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you for the next three hours with my awesome co-hosts always here with me.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi!

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hack, hack, cough, wheeze.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Not really.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, you're feeling much better this week than those that heard the show a couple weeks ago.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Which we'll get into because the story is actually kind of funny.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But first, I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How are you doing? Techmaster Loki, who has to learn how to turn his mic off before we start the show.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I had the mic off earlier because I don't know why. I just turned it off.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I know. It's usually good practice if you're going to sit there and type on the keyboard or whatever to turn the mic off.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're not that fancy. I know a lot of people probably envision us in some studio where we have those big microphones on stands and all that stuff.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know if you've ever listened to Understation Live on Saturdays on All Games Radio where we tape our show, but they're on Saturday nights.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Travis had that whole setup in his house.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know what Bobby has in his house, and he does, of course, the show before us, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf on All Games.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know if he has the whole thing.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have wired mics that just plug into this mixing board very crudely that Sherby the cat has to walk through like she's Catherine Zeta-Jones in entrapment to get through the cords.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She seriously looks up at me and goes, meh.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Meow.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You've seen her do it.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have. I have.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's made the noise of, help me mommy. Help me.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So it's literally just cords everywhere in this spare bedroom of sorts in Dark Sakura's house, which is just kind of the work room, I guess you could call it.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
One has been taken care of.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I went out to the dollar store and bought Velcro ties.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Even when you use the zippy ties thing, it's not going to get that clean. I mean, it's going to get more orderly.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It'll keep us from tripping over half of them.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It won't feel like whenever we're starting the show we're unpacking Christmas lights, because you know how that goes.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Even when you pack the Christmas lights away nice and neat, you'll pull them out in one big blob that looks like a triple that lights up.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just because gremlins live in those little boxes.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Apparently. Clearly.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And Bobby is in our chat room, of course. Hi, Bobby.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And he says, I have the same setup that you saw I had at PAX, same mics.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And so I think he had the kind that actually sit there on the table.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Like if you remember like watching the old Howard Cosell sports show where they have the big mics sitting on the table or what have you.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Those are great.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, those are fun.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We don't have those.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We actually hold on the mics.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a wild world of games.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Good times.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right. Anyhow, and if you want to join us in our chat room, please join us.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And yeah, I see some folks in chat.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Go to Best Buy.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Go to Newegg.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Buy some stuff.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dude, we've been doing this ghetto style for seven years, and it's one of those things where if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If it ain't fixed, don't break it.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Exactly.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anyhow, so why we weren't here last week, which is funny because I had promised a couple weeks ago on the show that we weren't going to miss any more shows in 2009.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is also funny because you haven't heard like the last month worth of podcasts, and it all ties into the same reason.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, also, you know, it's because Rob had diphtheria and I had malaria.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, but it's close.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's close.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Here's the deal.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you were here live a couple weeks ago, and you will hear this on the podcast eventually, we're going to have a big dump this week like we had last month where we'll get all the shows up.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But if you were here with us live a couple weeks ago, Dark Sakura was very ill during the show.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And we kind of all chalked that up to, well, she has the plague again, which she always seems to get once a year, or a sinus infection.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
My annual sinus infection.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And I'd kicked up all that dust earlier.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, and so we figured, okay, Jamie is just, you know, the sick girl.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everybody went to high school with one.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There was that girl who just seemed to get sick all the time, just no matter what.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My sinus infection is literally an annual thing, and it's always right in the start of November I start getting sick.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We love you, Jamie, but you're the sick girl.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're the cootie girl.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, well, here's some cooties.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Shove, shove.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, funny enough, so we do the show Sunday, and come Monday, I'm starting to feel a little sick.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Tuesday that week, I start to get really sick.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
My first thought wasn't that I caught something from Jamie, because, again, she's cootie girl.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I never get things from her, because, you know, I actually get cooties from cootie girl.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I instead thought I got something at Rocky Horror on Halloween, because, you know, all those people.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I was running around in Rocky Horror attire, which, if you've been before, isn't much.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And, you know, I figured I caught just the flu or something.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Actually, my first thought was strep throat, because my throat was very sore.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, I go to the doctor on Tuesday, and she says, oh, what's wrong?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I'm like, I don't know.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm just really sick.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to just make sure I don't have H1N1 or something crazy like that.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She's all, oh, my dear.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because, you know, she's an old Filipino lady, so she always says my dear and honey and all this.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my dear, open your mouth.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, you have a very red mouth.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, I think you have laryngitis, but you do not have H1N1, my dear.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you want me to give you the test anyway, my dear?

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I said, yeah, just for peace of mind, give you the H1N1 test.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, they shoved the Q-tip up my nose and all that fun stuff, and yeah, it still hurts.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But, no, it wasn't that bad.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, I did all that, and I'm thinking, okay, whatever, I have laryngitis.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And she says, if I'm still sick on Thursday, call her, and she'll give me an antibiotic.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm still sick on Thursday.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've missed two days of work at this point.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, I get an antibiotic, and Thursday night was really the worst of it.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That was the night where I lied down, and I thought, oh, my God.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I, like, literally, I saw the light.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like, when I closed my eyes and was lying there on the couch in my Snuggie

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
with my Star Trek Next Generation movies playing on Blu-ray,

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because that's what I did when I was sick,

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
because I watched every single Star Trek Next Generation movie on Blu-ray in my Snuggie.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I literally shut my eyes, and I started to see the light.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I'm just lying there going, this is awful.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is horrible.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Whatever I have.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But, finally, it started to go away, and I'm thinking, oh, antibiotics got rid of what I had.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I must have had a strep throat.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That seems to be the most, you know, obvious thing that I have.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So, finally, Saturday goes, Sunday goes.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Monday, I go to work, because I'm thinking, I miss four days of work.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's a lot of work.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
For somebody who's a trainer, for somebody with, you know, I have a very high work ethic.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't like to miss work.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, I go to work Monday morning.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My doctor calls me four times while I'm trying to teach class,

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and I'm like, I have to, like, chase them down to get them to call me.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are they calling me four times?

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I call.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hello, my dear.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, my dear, you have H1N1.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your test came back positive.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I'm thinking, what?

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Here I am back at work sick, and I had H1N1 this whole time, and I didn't even know it.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, it turns out that H1N1 test that she didn't even think I needed came back positive.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And I think part of, you know, and no disrespect to my doctor, I didn't have a fever when I went in there.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, but apparently I had H1N1.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Prisby asks if your doctor is Miss Cleo.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes, actually, she does.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She apparently sounds a lot like Miss Cleo.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know how old Filipino lady sounds like Miss Cleo, but just work with me on this.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, next up Rob calls me.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, one of the first people I call is Jamie, because I start to piece it together in my head.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm like, how the fuck did I get the swine flu?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nobody else at Rocky is saying anything about it.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nobody else seems to be saying, and I'm thinking, oh, my God, Jamie has these sinuses.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Jamie gave me the swine flu.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And, like, I knew it in my mind.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm like, Jamie's the one that gave me the swine flu.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And then I'm also thinking, oh, my God, Matt has a swine flu, too, and he doesn't know it.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, like, the first people I contact.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, I'm so swine fluid out right now, I can't tell.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They drown my sorrows in chicken.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So, Matt, were you sick at all the past couple weeks?

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
My throat was kind of scratchy for about five days, but kind of scratchy as in, hey, that kind of feels scratchy,

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and I get distracted by something else and don't notice it.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's really, though, how it starts, is it starts in the throat.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, it was that same with me.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, somehow, Matt, with his Cylon genes or something, was able to avoid the swine flu.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm still saying it's because he eats enough meat that it gives him an immunity.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I eat enough swine, see?

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, I actually ended up calling my doctor, and, well, I talked to the advice nurse at Kaiser.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She was like, oh, no, you're coming in, you're coming in.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, I finally actually talked to my doctor, and we go over all of the symptoms,

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
because he had actually seen me a week before for my sprained ankle, which still, by the way, hurts like a bitch.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And he's like, well, you had all of these symptoms, you had that with your throat, you started off with a dry cough.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's like, that's not how your sinus infections tend to go.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And a lot of times now, they know by the symptoms, because they're pretty standard.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And I ran a fever for me. I actually got up to 100, but that's high for me.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But I kept running a fever after the fact.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And the whole big thing for me, what my plague usually is, is if I don't treat a sinus infection or anything sinus-related right away, I will always get bronchitis.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And the last time that it got really bad, I got pneumonia, and I was sick for three months.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And it was a nightmare, but now he put me on like a week of antibiotics to make sure that I don't get pneumonia.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, the interesting thing is, my doctor's approach was very different than yours.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He put me on Tamiflu, which, a little late for that, right, but whatever.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I got pulled out of work for a week. My doctor ordered me out.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was already over it.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So was I.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, but I was already two weeks over it, is the whole thing.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I don't know. And I think a big part of it, too, because you kind of talk about that as a soul.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And we will get to talking about video games, but I think this story is hilarious.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was hoping I'd get pulled out of work a second ago.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Dan was sick.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Stay home.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Two weeks before me, Dan was sick.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He might have had a tooth, I don't know.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was like, you don't catch a sinus infection from somebody. They're not contagious.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So maybe Dan started this whole thing. I don't know.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I find him.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I got pulled out of work for a week, and I was pissed when it happened, because I'm thinking like,

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm going to miss nine days of work when I'm trying to teach a class, right?

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I'm like, what's the point? I'm already over it.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But the point is, it's very dangerous to develop something secondary.

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So pulling me out of work for a week wasn't so much for my coworker's benefit,

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
as it was my own benefit to not catch anything else.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Because you might remember, if you've been listening to the show a long time,

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's kind of weird that we're talking about swine flu so nonchalantly,

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because it did take the life of a good friend of mine back in June.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I miss her dearly. I wish she was still here.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But back then, we didn't know.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I mean, even just in June, it's funny, we say back then, it was just a few months ago,

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
we didn't know as much about the swine flu.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I think what got her is that she had two things going on.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She had pneumonia and swine flu and ultimately passed away from it.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So that's where the swine flu is dangerous.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You talked to the doctor early enough, did she?

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't think so, no. She didn't have insurance.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, I think you mentioned that she eventually was pulled to the doctor to go.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But yeah, I mean, that's why my grandmom started having the same symptoms.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I talked to her on Wednesday.

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I was like, you go to the doctor tomorrow. You go tomorrow.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And as far as I know, she's okay.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And let me read this from chat here.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
DangerSkewInChat says, H1N1 is the most overrated disease ever.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And this is from chat.orangelsonserato.com.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes and no.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, you know, I didn't realize I had it until it was gone.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I think that's saying a lot.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And neither did Jamie.

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, I honestly thought I had strep throat.

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I thought I had a sinus infection.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But where you'd still need to see a doctor if you have these symptoms.

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just because it's overrated doesn't mean you don't want to take it seriously.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because again, these secondary infections are what's extremely dangerous.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's not the H1N1 itself that's bad.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's the fact that it breaks your body down.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And if you catch something else, that's really bad.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Like the feline aids.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, it's like, for lack of a better description, that actually is kind of, you know, the problem that you run into with any kind of immunodeficiency.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Mentioning aids, I was just saying that.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The number one killer of people with aids is pneumonia.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I actually described it.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was trying to describe it to somebody.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I said, it's kind of like having 24-hour aids.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, you don't want to catch something secondary in that window.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I don't mean to speak so nonchalantly about something serious.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But if I could explain how H1N1 is dangerous, that's why.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, the same thing is like why I always have to be careful with my sinus infections is that all of the drainage is going to carry bacteria down.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And that gets in your lungs.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You need to make sure that, you know, you're not going to get an infection in your lungs.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's just, that's really, it's, yeah, it's just like we were saying, it's like the flu opens the door for the pneumonia to come in.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Right.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So to kind of wrap this all up, because we've been talking about this for a while here.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I know folks want us to get to the games.

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, pneumonia is H1N1's mother-in-law.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You just don't want her to come visit.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, but to wrap it all up, you know, again, the moral of the story, you know, I'm fine.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Dark soccer is fine.

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you get H1N1, you'll probably be fine too.

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You probably won't even know you had it.

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But please see a doctor.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Go to urgent care.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or not necessarily the ER, because ERs are really bombarded.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They're very expensive.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Keep in mind there's a lot of urgent care clinics that can do the same thing a lot cheaper.

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A lot of free clinics as well if you don't have insurance at all.

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just see a doctor.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Get treatment.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Get on some type of medication that will build up your immunity so that way you don't catch something secondary.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So is it that bad?

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No.

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But should you take it seriously?

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Absolutely.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So that's kind of the moral of the story.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Now that we've talked about our sickness and why we've been gone.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And by the way, you know, because again, this kept Jamie down for two weeks.

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This kept me out for two weeks.

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This is why things have fallen behind with the feed.

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I still have a cough.

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, I still have a cough too.

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like now it's I think officially three and a half weeks later.

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm still having the same type of, you know, that same cough that I had when I was developing that bronchitis back then.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So I still have to be careful.

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm living on Ricola.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A steady diet of Ricola.

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And apparently Chinese food.

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Good times.

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All right.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Anyhow, enough about flu chat.

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's get into actually our gaming weeks as we usually like to start the show off with talking about the games we've been playing.

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Funny enough, you think with nine days out of work, I'd played a lot more video games.

285
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But that's kind of not the case.

286
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know if that's true for you too, DarkSakura.

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But what kind of games have you been playing for the past couple of weeks?

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, I did something bad, Rob.

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What did you do?

290
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've been a bad girl.

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Have you been very naughty?

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I've been naughty.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you need to be punished?

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I need to be spanked.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, this sounds like a raffle.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Spanking! Spanking!

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Spank DarkSakura for a dollar.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It could be like a charity fundraiser.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I signed back up for World of Warcraft.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, you've been very naughty indeed.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Which I am, again, far from addicted.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I have played once with Marin since I renewed my account.

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And then twice by myself.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I have hit a milestone.

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I now have a character that is past level 10.

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Congratulations!

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I have level 15!

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Draw nine age.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Welcome to the world of talent points.

310
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We hope you like it here.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
See, that's how it starts.

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
First you do it with a friend, and then you start doing it by yourself.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Next thing you know, you just can't stop.

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Next thing you know, you're playing EverQuest.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you talking about Warcraft, or are you talking about...

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Never mind.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Alcohol.

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's alcohol.

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ooh, alcohol.

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well.

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I'm actually making some Sims characters right now.

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What finally brought you back to WoW?

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What made you decide, okay, time for me to take the plunge and actually play a character this time,

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
as opposed to just slash dancing in Brill?

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Sauce did.

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Gotcha.

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You know, just because I had such a good time playing with her during the trial that I decided to come back,

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and I didn't like some of the stuff Activision did, but I liked some of the stuff, you know?

329
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So I gave it a go, and I had a pretty fun time, and you should have heard me the other day

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
complaining about doing that one Draw Night quest where you ride on the back of the wildebeest or whatever it is.

331
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I'm like, I got a wildebeest!

332
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I was like, hi, on Nyquil.

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And Dan's in the other room, and I'm going, I've got a wildebeest!

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And he comes in and goes, so you do.

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then I was like, taking screen captures of my, uh, of my griffin.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because I was doing, oh, we're going back and forth on a griffin, and I'm paying for it.

337
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It was just, I was just being a goof, an utter goof playing, but it was pretty fun.

338
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I like playing by myself.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's, it's, you, why do we play games?

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
To have fun, and whatever that is for you, and especially in a very broad game like World of Warcraft or any MMO,

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
whatever, if that's taking screenshots, if that's slash dancing, if that's role playing,

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
whatever it is, you know, it might not be just grinding to 80 as fast as you can.

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It might be, you know, a variety of other things that make it fun, so, you know, more power to you.

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Alright, I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you about that, but maybe I'll think of it later.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So, if DarkSakura's done with her gaming week, then I'll move on to Loki.

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
How was your gaming week?

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
My gaming week was okay.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I didn't play a whole lot, though.

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And actually, the last two weeks I haven't played a lot.

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've been just working on the main cabinet and getting that working.

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Mainly choosing a front end, because I was originally going to start with Hyper Spin,

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
which is really flashy and looks awesome, but the problem is you have to make a theme for every single game.

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I downloaded every single game that's out there for MAME right now.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So, I would take forever to get skins for everything or make skins from scratch.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's just way too much damn work.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I may end up going back to that, though, because I think you can actually put different settings for each game you launch in Hyper Spin.

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Plus, it's a lot more flexible in what you can run in it.

358
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But right now, I currently have Maximus Arcade on my system.

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And I've been kind of working with that a little bit.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Their configuration that they had for launching games and using the menu right now is really jacked up,

361
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
compared to what the keyboard encoder that I have for my arcade controls is.

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So, it didn't make any sense.

363
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'd have to drop a coin in my cabinet to launch a game, which is annoying.

364
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So, I fixed all that stuff, and after all that's said and done, I still haven't gotten to play a game on it yet.

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But hey, it works good, and I actually worked on a lot of stuff.

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I wired it up for stereo audio, which is pretty sweet.

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Loki, you strike me as one of those guys that doesn't necessarily do things to actually play them,

368
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
but you do things because you can.

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's one of those things where it's like, well, I built this whole arcade cabinet, and I have a thousand games on it.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I haven't really played any of them, but I could if I wanted to, and that's the point.

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, it's a lot because I didn't know what games I wanted, so I said, okay, what the hell, I'm just going to download everything.

372
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, I did. I downloaded everything, including clones of games, multiple ROM dumps for each game.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Ms. World Nude 96?

374
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, yeah, that's on there, of course.

375
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
All the porno games.

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm coming over!

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm telling you, every game that's out there is on there, including like 50,000 Mahjong games I need to get rid of.

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So, I just have to go and sort through everything, which is what really takes the time.

379
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then, the other thing, too, is because my cabinet has a dual sync monitor, so I can run games at the low resolution, 15 kilohertz,

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
which is what most arcade games are, like all their old school ones, or medium resolution for some of the newer games.

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The problem is, if you run it at the medium resolution, your newer games look nice,

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but your older games aren't quite as sharp because it's not running at the native resolution anymore.

383
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So, it's a debate whether I want to make it look nice for most of my games or just some of my games.

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm pretty much just going to leave it alone right now because I get to the Switch to actually flip it to that medium resolution.

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I have to take stuff apart and I don't want to do that.

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, anyways, enough of the cabinet stuff.

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Can I just say real quick on a related note, because I'm looking at our chat room,

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby, who does the show before us on All Games Radio,

389
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
www.allgames.com, live on Sunday nights, says,

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You describe me. I have a ton of consoles hooked up to my TV. Do I often play them? No, but I could if I wanted to.

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That sounds very Jamie as well.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Because mine are not hooked up.

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But you could.

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Well, we do have the pile of Sega hooked up in the vault.

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And how often do you go in there and say, You know what? Today I want to play.

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't know. I'm just feeling very afterburner today.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I just, I want to play after. Do you do that?

398
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We do that shit.

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you really?

400
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We do. But sometimes we also break out the PC Engine and play some cue cards.

401
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But like in the front room, we just had, well, we loaned our Wii to Dan's mom for some reason.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But we have the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 hooked up out in the front, and really the Playstation 3, since it's a piece of shit,

403
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
just collects dust and we do nothing but play our Xbox 360.

404
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ironically, I'm in the complete opposite boat right now. I still haven't replaced my Xbox 360 three months now.

405
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Haven't needed to.

406
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Been doing everything on the PS3. I'm like in the complete opposite boat you are, but okay.

407
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, yeah, except Rob, we have a choice.

408
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, snap. You got me there.

409
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What am I going to do?

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaking of that...

411
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No, well, technically our PS3 is our Blu-ray player.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I have a choice too. I can play the Wii if I want to, like, you know, which I did play.

413
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, I'll get to my game in a little bit. Sorry. I don't want to interrupt.

414
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No, no, no. That's all right. Sorry.

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Speaking of which, it's funny that you mentioned that.

416
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I had finally, you know, after all these rounds of consoles being banned and stuff, I had one of my consoles banned.

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Thankfully, and this is the best part because it works out perfectly, right now we have three consoles,

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
because I had my sister's console, which, you know, I basically swapped her the banned console,

419
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
because she doesn't play online, so she doesn't give a shit. She just wants a console that's modded.

420
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And it works just fine. It just can't go on live anymore.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So, hey, problem solved there. So I have her broken console.

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I have another console that's starting to go.

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And I have a friend's console that they brought in.

424
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know if he's given it to me or what, but it's kind of broken.

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So I have three consoles that need to be fixed, which I'm planning on doing soon.

426
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I have a console coming from New Zealand, actually, that's a Japanese region console that's also modded,

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
so I can actually play some of the Japanese region games.

428
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then I have the four consoles that work right now that we're playing on.

429
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But the ironic part was, the console that got banned is the console that we don't really play modded games on.

430
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We've played, like, one modded game on that, and that's the one that gets banned.

431
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's fine, which is seeing all sorts of, like, it is dirty.

432
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Dirty, naughty machine. Filthy Xbox.

433
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You know, and the one that my boss plays on, which was my old modded console that died once and came back,

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and it's completely just seeing all sorts of burns and you name it, whatever.

435
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Those consoles are fine. Nothing wrong with those.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But sure, the one that played it one time, it's gone.

437
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's funny, though, because they don't ban your live account. They only ban your console.

438
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So, since I have so many damn spare consoles, it's just like, oh, well, that's an inconvenience.

439
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Switch. That's it.

440
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I love that you talk so nonchalantly. Like, here I am talking about, I'm too lazy to get my Xbox replaced.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I haven't really done it for three months.

442
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And you're sitting here talking about, oh, I just got six Xbox 360s just kind of sitting in a stack in the corner.

443
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Ah, fuck me, one got banned. Let's put a new one.

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And I understand now, I mean, they're banning consoles because they don't want you to play games.

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I thought they were going to ban your live account or whatever.

446
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Can I throw this question to you from chat real quick?

447
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Lumi's in our chat room, chat.orangishonsider.com.

448
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Does Loki think Microsoft is right by banning consoles?

449
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Well, they have the right to do it, yeah.

450
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I think as far as banning you off live, I don't understand why they would do that.

451
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I mean, I guess I understand the cheating part and stuff like that, but if you think about it,

452
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
if they ban you off live, that's revenue that they're cutting off basically for themselves.

453
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Also, because you can't really get achievements or anything,

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
what's to really motivate you from trying to get your, I mean,

455
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
because now there's no fear of you getting banned off live because you're already banned off live.

456
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So burn whatever the fuck you want now and play it on the console without consequence.

457
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's really kind of the thing right now.

458
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So I don't understand why they would do that.

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I wish there should have been another way they could penalize somebody, but whatever.

460
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean, I guess if you want to play on live, it's not that bad.

461
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They're not banning your account, I guess.

462
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It could be worse.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Really, the only thing that happens when your console gets banned,

464
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
you can't connect to live and you can't install games onto your hard drive.

465
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I don't understand that second part, why you can't install games onto your hard drive,

466
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
throw on them faster, whatever.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fine. That's fine.

468
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
For example, my sister, she doesn't give a shit.

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
She doesn't know how to do that.

470
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
She doesn't care.

471
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
She just likes playing my crazy Grand Theft Auto that's modded

472
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
because she likes punchy people 50 blocks away.

473
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And who doesn't?

474
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And who doesn't? Yeah, exactly.

475
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So, I don't know. It's just an inconvenience, I guess.

476
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But yeah, I understand why they're...

477
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
An inconvenient banning, the new movie by Al Gore.

478
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, we're actually, to be honest, we really modded the consoles,

479
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
not necessarily to play pirated games,

480
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
but we were really just playing modded copies of Grand Theft Auto.

481
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And now we're playing, you know, all have episodes of Liberty City Discs,

482
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
all legit copies, and that's what we've been playing.

483
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So that's why we're kind of surprised that, you know,

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the one console's banned because we haven't played a burned game on...

485
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, actually, I take that back.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We played one new burned copy of Grand Theft Auto on that one

487
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
because I found a new way to get around their mod patch or something like that.

488
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So we tested it once and it didn't really work.

489
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And so then we went back to just playing the normal disc.

490
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And apparently that one time, though, they found out.

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And so they decided to ban that console.

492
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But it's just ironic because we've been playing normal copies of games

493
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
on all these consoles for the longest time now.

494
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I mean, if anything, they should be generous to me

495
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because I bought six copies of their damn game, you know?

496
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But whatever.

497
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto.

498
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Still hate the multiplayer in Ballad of Gay Tony,

499
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
but I'm kind of warming up to it a little bit.

500
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Still don't like how it's not very open world,

501
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but I'm kicking so much ass in it except for the fact...

502
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We got one guy that was ranked 10 the other day that was cheating.

503
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Totally cheater because he's...

504
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Two shots and all my health and armor is gone.

505
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Whereas my pistol, eight shots to the head.

506
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Then they finally died. Almost beat him too.

507
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Sad. Cheater.

508
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Usually they drop out and I talk so much trash to them.

509
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Good times.

510
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All right. Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

511
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Um...

512
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's really it.

513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I haven't really...

514
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm still sitting on my copy of Borderlands I haven't even touched yet.

515
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm just like, I need to play this tonight.

516
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I need to play this tonight.

517
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And I go home and I end up working on the arcade cabinet.

518
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So at some point I'm going to play the damn game.

519
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's like me. I downloaded a demo for a game called Torchlight

520
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
a couple days ago.

521
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I keep saying I need to make time to play this game.

522
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I need to make time to play this game.

523
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And I still haven't gotten around to playing the damn game.

524
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Just like I signed up for the beta for Battlefield...

525
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Or was it Battlefield Bad Company 2?

526
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm like, I'm not going to play this.

527
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll take your key anyways.

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Boy oh boy.

529
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But again, this all goes back to, I'm not going to play it.

530
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But if I wanted to, I could.

531
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And that's what it all comes back to.

532
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
My gaming week.

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Surprisingly enough, because I was so sick I didn't get to play a lot.

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I did a lot of TV and movie watching.

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But funny enough, I did get my Playstation 3 Netflix streaming disc.

536
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So I got to play around with that a little bit.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And you know, it's pretty much the same stuff you're going to see on the Xbox version

538
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
without the party chat.

539
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Which my Xbox was borked before I got to play with that feature anyway.

540
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So I'm none the wiser.

541
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So I'm cool with the PS3 disc.

542
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't notice a huge quality difference.

543
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It looks the same to me.

544
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I guess some folks are noticing a lot more artifacting on the PS3.

545
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I don't look at the stuff with as fine tooth and comb.

546
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm just like, you know, can I play the damn show?

547
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Does it look decent?

548
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And stuff still comes in HD if it's available on Netflix.

549
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Again, the biggest problem with Netflix streaming is it needs more stuff.

550
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But when you consider that you're not really paying a premium at this time

551
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
on top of what you pay for your Netflix fee, it's not that bad.

552
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I didn't pay a dime for the PS3 disc.

553
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I just signed up for the little thing and they sent it to me within a couple days.

554
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I didn't get it the very first day, but I signed up kind of late too.

555
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I got it like maybe four days later.

556
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So I think that's pretty cool.

557
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
A little perk to having Netflix.

558
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Also, as far as new games go, one of the new games I played,

559
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I was joking about the Wii earlier because Dark Soccer was saying that she had choice.

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And I'm like, well, I still have choice between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

561
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And funny enough, I did turn on the Wii to check out the Excitebike World Tour.

562
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Is that the name?

563
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Or Rally.

564
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Excitebike World Rally.

565
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Because I was pretty excited about this game.

566
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I saw the trailer for it.

567
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We did talk about it two weeks ago, right?

568
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I can't remember if it was the show we couldn't do.

569
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So we did talk about this game a little bit two weeks ago.

570
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I was really excited for it.

571
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I downloaded it, played it for about ten minutes,

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and then the magic just kind of wore off.

573
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And I don't want to say it's a bad game, because it's not.

574
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It is what it is.

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's a reimagining of the 8-bit Excitebike.

576
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But to be honest, I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.

577
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
How many of you guys have done this?

578
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
These games, these 8-bit games, we used to spend so much time with back in the day.

579
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And some of them you can still spend a lot of time with today.

580
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But now, thanks to the wide world of emulation,

581
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
how many of you guys will just load up a cartridge on emulation,

582
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
play it for like three minutes, and be all,

583
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I remember this game.

584
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Alright, Thrill's done. Let's move on. Play something else.

585
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Pretty much, yeah.

586
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's what I felt playing this Excitebike World Rally.

587
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, I realized there was online mode.

588
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes, the game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the day.

589
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You know, I am totally aware of all these improvements they made to the game.

590
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But yet, when the game itself hasn't really felt like it's changed that much,

591
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I was just kind of like, eh, I'm over it.

592
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And that's my honest feedback on Excitebike.

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I can't really tell you if it's a good game or a bad game,

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
because I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.

595
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And that was my experience with Excitebike.

596
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You make my soul hurt, Rob.

597
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Why?

598
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Just because.

599
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I mean, you know what's funny?

600
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We used to play Excitebike for hours when I was like ten or eleven years old.

601
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We used to play this game.

602
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I would spend hours making tracks.

603
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Making the damn tracks and all this stuff.

604
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And yet, when I played this new one, I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.

605
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And maybe, to be fair, maybe part of that was because the same day I played this

606
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
was the same day I found out I had swine flu.

607
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So I kind of had all of that on my mind at the same time.

608
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So in the interest of full disclosure, maybe I just didn't play this game in the right mood.

609
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And, you know, I think a lot of people can admit

610
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
maybe you've listened to a CD when you were in the wrong mood

611
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and you hated it even though you thought it was great later.

612
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Or you watched a movie that you thought sucked

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
just because you were in a bad mood when you watched it.

614
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And I think maybe I'm giving this game a little bit of that.

615
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So take my review, half-assed review, with a ginormous canister of salt, okay?

616
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It is what it is.

617
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But I'm just telling you, that's what I played and that's what I thought.

618
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But full disclosure, I had all this other crap going on too.

619
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So naturally, I played a lot of World of Warcraft as well.

620
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
One other game I did check out was a game called 30 Second Hero.

621
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I downloaded this onto the PSP when I was sick because, you know,

622
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
when the doctor tells you not to go outside and give people your germs,

623
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you're like, okay, but I'm bored, I need something to do.

624
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll go onto PlayStation Store and see if there's an arcade game I want to download.

625
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And then I realized, oh yeah, they have all these PSP games you can download now.

626
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What do I want to play?

627
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Ooh, I played the demo for Half Minute Hero a while ago and I really liked it.

628
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Let me check out the full game.

629
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So let me kind of try to summarize Half Minute Hero in a nutshell for you guys.

630
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes, it's a game that you play in 30 second spurts, but it's a little bit of a lie.

631
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like, I don't want you to think this game is like WarioWare because it's very not.

632
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's just, imagine that you're playing a game like Final Fantasy.

633
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, Dragon Warrior, I think is a better comparison.

634
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Imagine you're playing Dragon Warrior just, like, freaking on crack.

635
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Like, it's just fast.

636
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like, the battles automatically play themselves so you don't have to sit there and go,

637
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
fight, fight, fight, item, potion, fight.

638
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like, you don't do any of that.

639
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You just have battles that happened and you just kind of tear through them and it's just a fast, fast game.

640
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That's kind of what Half Minute Hero is, is that, you know, you go and you run through the forest

641
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
or do whatever you do to the cave where the bad guy is, but in each level, it's episodic.

642
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Like, the first level is very straightforward, but then later on, these little twists will come into play.

643
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Like, oh, the forest is on fire.

644
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So you have to get here and you have to get this item, but, you know, you have to do it all before the time runs out.

645
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Now, one thing they don't really tell you about the game, there's a time goddess that you can visit that will reset the clock,

646
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but it costs money exponentially every time you use her.

647
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So it's really, it's a giant puzzle game that plays like Dragon Warrior

648
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
because really the gist of the game is how do I get from point A to B to C to D as quick as possible,

649
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
making this whole thing work, what's the solution, without running out of time.

650
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And that's kind of what Half Minute Hero is.

651
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And although I just overly simplified the game, I think what's selling a lot of people on this is like kind of the nod to 8-bit cliches

652
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because seriously, some of the dialogue in the game made me laugh out loud

653
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
because the time goddess is like, I will reset time for money.

654
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why?

655
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I don't know, I just like money hearts, you know, like these very cliche, over-the-top things that just made me laugh.

656
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So that's why I kind of liked Half Minute Hero.

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Did it give you lulz?

658
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It gave me a lot of lulz and that, you know, I think the people that at least localized the game, if not developed it,

659
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
were kind of just in on the joke and knew what they were doing and I think it paid off.

660
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's a cute game. 30 bucks, kind of steep, but I think for a lot of people are still going to find it very rewarding.

661
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I will say it's worth the plunge if you are into puzzles and RPGs because I think this game is really a mix of both.

662
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I think this game can be better defined as a puzzler than an RPG.

663
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It just happens to have a lot of RPG elements, so there you go.

664
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You call it a PRPG.

665
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's a PRPG, yeah, a puzzle role-playing game, I like that.

666
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And then lots and lots and lots and lots of wow. I brought back from the dead my 80 druid and brought it into another guild that a lot of my friends had transferred to.

667
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I also had my paladin, my Heladin I guess you could say is level 72 now.

668
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So being sick, wow, bad combination.

669
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Although honestly, when you're really sick you don't want to focus on games.

670
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Games take thought and energy somewhat, whereas Netflix and Blu-rays, much more like I can just kind of watch it and just kind of fade in and out as I'm watching it.

671
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And Project Runway of course.

672
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Alright, anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.

673
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I think if that does it for everybody's gaming week we can finally get into some gaming news here now that we've been on air for about 40 minutes.

674
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
No Rob, food. Food Rob.

675
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You want to talk more food?

676
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
No.

677
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I do kind of want some yogurt or something. I'm just fat.

678
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Alright, anyhow, I do want to say real quick in the housekeeping department our podcast feed is disgustingly behind.

679
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's just sadly been a recurring theme this year.

680
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Obviously I blame the flu for that.

681
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We will get all caught up this week.

682
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We'll have a big dump of episodes just as we had I think back in October when we had some of the same thing going on.

683
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So we will get that all caught up for you guys that rely on the podcast feed.

684
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And we apologize for that, but do keep in mind the number one priority is pulling off this live show every Sunday night when we can.

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But of course we want to get the podcast out there because we know not everybody can join us on Sunday.

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's just sometimes we're a little slow.

687
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So please bear with us.

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's a lot more work than you'd think to turn the live show into what you actually hear on the podcast.

689
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news finally.

690
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We're done with sickness.

691
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We're done with food.

692
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We're done with all that stuff.

693
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Let's talk games.

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Loki, start us off.

695
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes.

696
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, as you may remember, earlier this week we had one of the biggest game launches this year, probably for a while.

697
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out.

698
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And of course, being that it is a major game, there are going to be those out there who decided to break street dates and release the game early to try to be competitive, usually against GameStop.

699
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Well, apparently some local shops in New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some parts of Ohio, were responsible for this and actually kind of from what I've seen all around the US.

700
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But apparently in these areas in particular, what's interesting though is to combat this, GameStop on a corporate level has allowed their stores to break street date as well and release the game early.

701
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What gets even more interesting is this isn't the only title that's happened to.

702
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Apparently the same thing is happening now with the titles coming out next week, Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

703
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Three GameStops in the New Jersey area, Jersey City, have been putting out Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

704
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Also saying that it was a call from their corporate office saying go ahead and put it out because there are mom and pop shops nearby that are also putting it out.

705
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:26,000
To simply summarize this, it's a big ol' clusterfuck right now. It's a pain in the ass. Pain in my ass is really what it is.

706
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm really, really curious. Okay, so the facts are we know some GameStops are bending the street dates to compete with mom and pop stores, or at least that's the claim.

707
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's not happening at every GameStop. It's happening, assumably, in areas where they're losing pre-orders to other stores who broke street date.

708
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So first, let me ask you, because you work in retail and you said this is a giant pain in your ass, what's your perspective on all this?

709
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Okay, well here's what happened with Call of Duty. First off, it was very clear what the street date was, and Activision has graciously street dated all of their titles during the fourth quarter,

710
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:19,000
which makes it very nice for distribution because we can get it to our stores that we supply, get it to them early enough so that they have a day one to be on an even playing field with GameStop.

711
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because GameStop, they're so massive, they get everything prior to street date because they're direct, and we do get stuff a lot of times on street date, but then we have to ship it to our customers and whatnot.

712
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So everybody was under, they understood when the street dates were. The problem is though, there's some of these small stores that are like,

713
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:50,000
well, I don't know how I'm going to compete with GameStop. They're just so massive and I don't get all these perks and stuff that GameStop has. They don't even try. They're just plain like,

714
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know what to do to be competitive with them. So they decide that they're going to go ahead and put product out early to get a competitive edge.

715
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The problem is though, they get caught, and the other problem is then these publishers don't just blame them.

716
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Can I stop you for a minute? Out of curiosity, just because I don't know, how do they get caught?

717
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
They get caught because other stores around them, other mom and pop shops, especially ones that are playing by the rules, or GameStop in this case,

718
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,000
they go and get basically, and this would work also with movies, anybody that's breaking the street on a movie, they would go buy a copy of the game or whatever, get a receipt,

719
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:41,000
get some sort of evidence. For Modern Warfare 2, they actually had a tip line and they would call in and report it. Usually what happens is they will collect all these stores that were in violation of street dates.

720
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
They then go to all the distributors out there and go, okay, are these your customers? If they are, you need to take care of this, buy.

721
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:02,000
For Modern Warfare 2, here's the penalty. One, they would no longer be able to buy Modern Warfare 2 for the life of the title. If they're out of it, they're fucked.

722
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It doesn't matter. They're not going to be able to buy any more copies of it. Also, any further Activision titles, they will no longer be able to get before street date.

723
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Also, they're going to evaluate it, whereas any sub distributors out there, people that we basically sell to and then they turn and sell to other stores,

724
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:32,000
they would also be blacklisted from selling a title if they were caught selling it early or whatnot, or if these stores that they were servicing were selling early.

725
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
They would also be blacklisted.

726
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Interesting, because I haven't heard this on any of the articles I'm reading, so it's kind of fascinating to hear this.

727
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Especially with Modern Warfare 2, everybody's been kind of careful after Madden 10 this year, because Madden 10, a whole bunch of stores broke street on it, and EA got pissed.

728
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
They got really fucking pissed. First off, we're not going to street date any more titles to distribution, so fuck you guys.

729
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Even though we had no customers that were actually breaking street, but they just decided to blanket everybody and do that.

730
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Same thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum, and Warner decided, you know what, we're just going to do the same thing as EA, and we're just going to say fuck you guys, and we're not going to ship anything early anymore.

731
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And then the other thing is, then they decide, okay, well we're going to maybe allow you to do that, but you're going to have to get written signed agreements from all your customers.

732
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
They're going to be street dated, and we're going to have to ship it two separate shipments. It's just a pain in the ass.

733
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Activision now, they weren't too happy about this whole thing. They obviously did not authorize GameStop to do this, but GameStop being as big as they are, they can pretty much do this and go, well what are you going to do about it?

734
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And Activision's just going to go, well, we can't do anything because they're our largest customer, we can't piss them off. Really, they can do whatever they want.

735
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And then of course, EA and Ubisoft were watching the street dates closely for Left 4 Dead 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 because of this whole thing that happened with Modern Warfare 2.

736
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They wanted to make sure that no one was violating street dates on their titles.

737
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So anyways, kind of go back around again. So these stores think that they're going to get competitive advantage against everybody else, and not necessarily GameStop, but MomPops, whomever. I hate to blame just MomPops shops for violating street because they're not the only ones that do it.

738
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I mean, 7-Eleven does it. There's all sorts of people that do it. And GameStop did it. And the thing is, it's always just a few people that just don't give a shit that ruin it for everybody.

739
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And it's these same stores, time and time again, they're violating street date on everything. Madden, for example, they know who... I mean, these people...

740
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:55,000
If I could especially see that with 7-Eleven, because you know 7-Elevens are notorious for being independently owned by folks, and probably a lot of them don't even want to be selling games.

741
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And so they probably are just kind of like, whatever, with this whole thing. I could especially see it there.

742
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah, and let me tell you this much. If GameStop corporate has given these stores authorization to sell this game early, it's because they know who's selling it early around them, and they will get caught.

743
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I was reading some TalkBack stuff on this Kotaku article, and there's one of the guys in there that was actually an owner of a MomPops shop, and it's just like, what a fucking douchebag the guy is.

744
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And he's like, you know, we knew what the street date was, we decided we're going to go ahead and... here he goes.

745
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Here's my two cents. I own a small MomPop game store. Modern Warfare 2 brought in ten times as much revenue as the store has ever done in a single game.

746
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Why? Because I sold the game one day early. I could have had it last Thursday, but did you think I sold anywhere near as many copies without having it early?

747
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
No. But I had to sign an agreement with my distributor saying I couldn't pick it up until Monday, even though they had it five days early.

748
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I can't afford to pick up hundreds, if not thousands, of copies of one game, although GameStop can.

749
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The only jump I have on GameStop is that we all have the old gaming systems and literally everything else, and we have games early.

750
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm sorry, that's a cop-out right there. The only jump you have on GameStop is that you can't afford to pick up enough copies to supply your customers.

751
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
First off, I don't believe that you run out of copies for your customers in the first place.

752
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And second off, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from GameStop, and just using that as an excuse to put out a game early...

753
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, first off, you probably can get blacklisted from all the distributors out there, especially if they find out that you're selling games early.

754
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's just a matter of time. And two, if your customers aren't that unloyal to you, where you don't have it out early, they're going to go elsewhere.

755
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
People, yeah, there are rabid fans of games that are going to go wherever they can get it early, but I'm sorry, that's not an excuse.

756
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Is there an easy answer to this, though? Because the bottom line is, the consumer is just ultimately going to go wherever they can get it.

757
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They'll go to the Ma and Pa store if it's out there. They'll go to GameStop if Kotaku, Joystiq, Destructoid, whoever runs a story that, hey, these GameStops in such-and-such New Jersey broke the street date.

758
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You know there were people driving in from Pennsylvania and New York to these stores just to get the damn game, because the series has that big a level of fans.

759
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, here's the problem. What they need to do is basically this. They need to enforce the street date violators.

760
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So if these people are breaking the street, they need to enforce it so that these people are reprimanded for doing that.

761
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That includes GameStop. These stores need to be all reprimanded the same.

762
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And if you give GameStop an exception because they decided to break the street because someone else was, well, I'm sorry.

763
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:03,000
If I decide to break the law because I see someone else breaking the law, like for example, if I see someone speeding past me on the freeway and I decide, hey, you know what, I'm going to go 100 miles an hour, too, and I get pulled over for speeding, I can't blame them for speeding.

764
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It was my own choice.

765
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Well, devil's advocate, not that I don't agree with you, but devil's advocate, when you break street date, you're not breaking the law.

766
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, but you're in violation of a contract that you have signed, so you're breaking a contract, and you have to take the penalties that are with that contract.

767
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't go into that agreement with your distributor or whomever, the publisher, if you're not going to abide by it.

768
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
How can the playing field be leveled between the Ma and Pa stores and the GameStops from your perspective?

769
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Because I'm kind of surprised. You're placing a lot more blame on the Ma and Pa stores than I kind of would have thought, considering those are the folks that you work with, but a lot of what you say makes sense.

770
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But the bottom line is that these places claim they can't compete with GameStop.

771
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You say bollocks because what can they do to ultimately compete with GameStop and everybody plays fair?

772
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If there's customer service, there's a lot of people, you'll read any of these stories about GameStop revenue, GameStop this, GameStop that, and there's always going to talk back to people,

773
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I hate shopping in GameStop, GameStop sucks because I hate talking to these people, they're always trying to give me a pre-order or something, blah, blah, blah.

774
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:23,000
There's people that hate GameStop and are looking for another alternative, but the problem is a lot of people also like the stupid little perks that you get from ordering with GameStop,

775
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
little trinkets and crap that, if you actually look at it, it's not that great in the first place.

776
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Some of the, like a keychain or something. Do you really need a keychain for a game? Are you going to be fine without that? Probably.

777
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Are these Ma and Pa stores going to give you a better trade-in value on your game than GameStop? Maybe. It depends.

778
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And is the customer service going to be better? It all depends. It's just all this hatred for shopping at Walmart or something.

779
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
If you like shopping at Walmart and you find the prices to be fair, then why not shop there?

780
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But they just try to compete with them and then they give up so easily because they're not as big.

781
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And they're like, well, why can't they get all the advertising materials that GameStop has? Well, they make a lot of it in-house and they buy a lot of games,

782
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
so they have the publisher backing for a lot of the stuff. They have the pull to where they actually make the publishers pay them for shelf space.

783
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I mean, you're never going to be as big as GameStop. Get over it. You've got to find a different way to compete.

784
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And I have other stores out there that do just fine. And they abide by all the street dates. So, it can be done.

785
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Interesting little mini-debate in our chatroom at chat.orangelandstrated.com.

786
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
DangerSkew says, easy solution. Implement some type of server-side solution that does not allow the game to be played until street date,

787
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
just like what PC games are starting to do. But GameGuru and Frisbee pipe up and say, no, no online activation.

788
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The games won't work offline, you know, and so forth.

789
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You can't do that. I mean, because there's people that aren't connected to, you know, online.

790
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And if that's the case, if they're not connected online, there's no way to verify what date you have in your system.

791
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I mean, you can switch a date around. I mean, it wouldn't matter. So, I don't think that's a solution.

792
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And really, it's just going to come with enforcing street dates.

793
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I mean, there's going to be violators out there, but you can start weeding them out with all these titles,

794
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
especially around the fourth quarter now that we've got a few titles, you know, under our belt.

795
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We can see who's, you know, violating these street dates and stop doing business with them.

796
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And, you know, you put out that list to all the distributors and listen, if you're caught doing business with them,

797
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
we stop doing business with you. And that'll get their attention.

798
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But at the same time, GameStop can't fucking just go break street date because they feel that they need to be competitive against these stores.

799
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm sorry. You're not going to lose sales to these stores. I mean, you're fucking GameStop.

800
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's not going to matter if you sell two less copies. You're GameStop. You make seven billion dollars a year.

801
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It does not fucking matter.

802
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Do you think anything, any action should be taken against GameStop for this?

803
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I think it should. I think what they should have done is taken...

804
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
They would have had a lot more pull if they took the high road and didn't, you know, put out any of these games.

805
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
If they just say, hey, look, we played by the rules, you know, because they actually have the pull where they can go,

806
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
listen, you're not fucking street dating more tiles because this is what happens when you're street dating them.

807
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And they're a big proponent of not street dating tiles. Do you know why!

808
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Because the mom and pop stores get it two days later and then they have the advantage.

809
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, you never hear the complaint. You know, oh, well we got it two days before this mom and pop store

810
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
because they have to get it shipped to them, you know.

811
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
They don't give a shit because they're always in advantage in that sense.

812
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The only time they have an even playing field is street dated tiles.

813
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And when people start violating that, then they get pissed off because now they're at a disadvantage.

814
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,160
advantage, and they don't want to be at a disadvantage for anything.

815
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,400
Not to continue to drag this out because we're already running long as it is, but I think

816
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,720
this is just a very interesting topic to me tonight. How do you think piracy plays a role

817
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,460
in this? Because when street dates are broken, this is ultimately what leads to piracy. Let

818
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,760
me give you a perfect example. One of the big things going on right now on a huge live

819
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,760
journal community, Oh No They Didn't, which is always a fun, hilarious read, a huge thing

820
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,320
they're talking about today is that some Italian website started selling the MP3s for the new

821
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,140
Lady Gaga album. So of course, one person went in and downloaded it, and what do you

822
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,460
think happened? Now everybody who browses that community has a copy of the new Lady

823
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,840
Gaga album about ten days before it was actually supposed to come out.

824
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,040
Actually it happens all the time. It doesn't matter if it's the new Lady Gaga album or

825
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,920
whatever. Promo copies go out to male.

826
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,880
And I might be talking about some musician that you personally don't care about, but

827
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,280
keep in mind, I'm throwing music, movies, games all in the same boat here with broken,

828
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,760
you know, one person ruin, in this case, not even in America, one person in Italy on the

829
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,320
internet ruins it, the street date, and it has colossal repercussions.

830
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:46,540
Exactly. Games leak online early all the time. All the time. But it's not necessarily from

831
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,000
people breaking street date. It could be. It could also be people, you know, working

832
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,320
at these companies. It could also be people working for GameStop to get the game early.

833
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,560
You never know who is supplying these games to these people that are ripping them. I mean,

834
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,820
same with the music stuff. Music promo copies are sent out there to get people to supply

835
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:10,800
the album in their store. Movies and screeners get put out there, or they're just dumping

836
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:18,480
Region 5 DVDs from Russia that come out early, and you have DVD copies of all sorts of movies

837
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,760
that are out in theaters now and stuff like that.

838
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,300
Well, I think especially with music, they have got to tighten the window between when

839
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,620
the thing is finished and when the thing hits the street, because obviously, that is a rough

840
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,060
market right now. I mean, but funny enough, this is where games could be headed before

841
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:39,760
too long. You know, I mean, music is, it's tough to be a musician right now with all

842
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,520
this stuff being pirated so crazy, you know?

843
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,080
Unless they're the smart people that actually take advantage of that kind of market.

844
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,640
And, to be fair, some of them do. And at the end of the day, Lady Gaga's probably not going

845
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,480
to hurt any from this happening, you know, but, you know, the point still stands is that,

846
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,800
you know, there's a lot of people getting this stuff before they're supposed to be quote

847
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
unquote.

848
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,560
And it only delays the inevitable anyways. I mean, if they're going to, you know, put

849
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,520
up, if someone's waiting for a pirated copy, yeah, they may play, you know, they may want

850
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:14,120
to play it early. Then again, that also has its repercussions as with the console bandings.

851
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,760
So, I mean, everything has its downside to it, but I think, like, I know, for example,

852
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,280
Grand Theft Auto IV. Yes, I downloaded a copy early because I wanted to play it right away.

853
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,160
But when it came out, I bought six copies of it because I just wanted to play it really

854
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,760
early because I couldn't wait to get my hands on it, needed to play it, like, like in the

855
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,040
heroine or something. But, you know, but I still bought it. And yeah, there's, I do have

856
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,200
a problem with, you know, just downloading something, you know, early and not paying

857
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,240
for it. Not to say that I haven't done that before. I probably have, but it's stuff that

858
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,120
I wouldn't have bought anyways or stuff I try once for three minutes and throw it away.

859
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,720
Like a lot of the Wii games out there.

860
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,440
So and again, chat folks, look at the big picture. I'm not specifically talking about

861
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,360
Lady Gaga. I'm using that as an example. It's just one I happen to notice because I personally

862
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,280
like her. But, you know, I realize a lot of you don't. Look at the bigger picture. This

863
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,400
has happened to every musician because that window between when the critics get it and

864
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,020
all that is way too big. And, you know, again, one, especially with how quick and portable

865
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,080
music files are, one internet person leaks it and everybody on the internet has it. Insert

866
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,300
your favorite band here. It's happened to them.

867
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,800
It's the swine flu of the internet.

868
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,880
I guess you could say that. So, all right. Anyhow, I guess we can move on to other stories,

869
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,080
but it's just very interesting because, you know, in a way there's no, I guess, easy answer.

870
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:47,360
But it's just, it's stuff that's just going to be, this isn't going away. It's just been

871
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,160
brought to the forefront for once, I guess.

872
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,680
Very interesting comment from chat. I want to state here though because I thought this

873
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,560
was also kind of plays a part of it. Jimmy Jack in chat says, GameStop has a limited

874
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:04,040
business model anyway. Once digital distribution is mainstream, they are screwed. And honestly,

875
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,840
in my opinion, you could replace GameStop with any of these stores we've been talking

876
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
about, right?

877
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,240
Like I said, there's lots of things they can do to compete. One of the things I'll give

878
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,560
you an example, Play and Trade. They allow their customers to try any game in their store

879
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,560
before they buy it. That's a big thing. And a lot of these stores, you know, they're selling

880
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,440
copies that are sealed. And if they don't have a copy that's not sealed, they're not

881
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,920
selling it to their customer. That's another thing that separates them.

882
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,360
Or if you maybe just don't like going into GameStop because they have maybe a limited

883
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,440
selection of PC titles, maybe they don't have the retro games you're looking for, there's

884
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,720
a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from all these other people out there. If that

885
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,920
were the case, then there wouldn't be any mom and pop shops because you just can't compete.

886
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,840
Also, you know, and in some places, again, I don't want to stereotype all, but a lot

887
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,360
of times GameStop kind of has that aura about it of like you get a lot of people that don't

888
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,280
really care about their jobs. You get a lot of college kids who are just, you know, looking

889
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,200
for something to do, right, that don't want to work fast food. You know, again, that's

890
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,760
not all the employees, but I think it's certainly a stereotype they have to deal with.

891
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,320
On the other hand, you know, in a lot of mom and pop stores, ma and pa who are running

892
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,280
that store obviously have a love of video games if they're running the place in the

893
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,920
first place. And a lot of times you're going to get people who really, really freaking

894
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,360
care about what they're doing. Again, not all the time because certainly there's people

895
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,080
that work at those places too that don't give a shit. But, you know, I'm just saying that

896
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,680
I could see that as being one thing too, is that when you deal with mom and pa's, you're

897
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,780
more likely to be dealing with somebody who truly loves gaming. You know, I don't know.

898
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,040
Maybe that, is that a fair statement? You think in theory, in theory? I know it's kind

899
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,440
of one of those things that like out loud, it makes sense, but I don't know. In practice,

900
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,080
it could be very different. Certainly I've met a lot of GameStop employees who really

901
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,320
love what they do. Well, I have an example. Sure. The video game swappers here in Sacramento,

902
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,880
when they were open, I don't really think that they liked video games all that much.

903
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,040
I knew them. And no, they didn't really like video games all that much. Interesting. They

904
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,000
just sold it because they knew that's where the money was at the time. I think a lot of

905
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,840
times passion leaves when the company gets that big. You know, it's just like, it's all

906
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,760
about money. It's less about, you know, really if you like video games or not, it's just

907
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,560
that we're selling video games because it makes us a lot of money. We're a capitalist

908
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,520
society. It's all based on the bottom line. Money, money, money. All right, let's move

909
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,200
on guys. I want to move on to another story. Oh boy, from one controversial topic to another.

910
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,000
Speaking of passionate people, we have another story about PETA, who we haven't talked about

911
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,760
a long time on this show. Sorry, I had to throw up. I was thinking about them right

912
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,480
now. As you're eating KFC, which funny, it kind of ties into this. Okay, here's the whole

913
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,760
thing. PETA is obviously the people for ethical treatment of animals. And therefore evil.

914
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,060
They're very controversial in their practices. You can certainly hear my co-hosts attesting

915
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:49,040
to the background. I'm not going to get into the political aspect of it. I'm just not.

916
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:56,360
But regardless, PETA is there and sometimes they do these very big things for show. You

917
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:02,100
know, I once, and I think I've probably told this story before, you know, once I was kind

918
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,920
of talking to online on a dating website, a guy who worked for PETA and it was very,

919
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,880
you know, I, I'm, I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff. You know, I also used to date a

920
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,400
gay Republican, which to me was fascinating too. I like diverse people, even when sometimes

921
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,320
that diversity doesn't agree with me. So it's kind of, I don't know, it's interesting, but

922
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,360
I know from, you know, talking to somebody who works directly with the organization,

923
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,420
they're very passionate about what they do, whether you agree with them or not, they definitely

924
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:33,800
have huge passion and they get very creative. And one of the ways they get creative is that

925
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,040
they do these little online games to get their message across. There was a game that they

926
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,760
put out a while ago, Super Chick Sisters, which was there to kind of protest KFC. And

927
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,000
I remember we talked about it on the show a while back. This was back in 2007. Well,

928
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,240
guess what? There is a brand new, new Super Chick Sisters. So just in time for new Super

929
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,280
Mario Brothers Wii that came out today, we also have new Super Chick Sisters, but it

930
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,280
has nothing to do with KFC this time. No, it's all about McDonald's. I don't know what

931
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,760
the specifics is, but obviously the McNuggets did not get there very easily. So it probably

932
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,140
has something to do with that whole thing. And I have not played the game myself, but

933
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:17,000
I imagine they are not happy about how the chicken turns into the McNugget. So they've

934
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,800
built this whole game about awareness. And I guess the whole idea behind it is how they

935
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:32,560
tap into the market is that they're not, it's not a poster. It's not a protest. It's a flash

936
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,160
video game, which oftentimes tend to be very viral. I mean, look about it. I'm talking

937
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,800
about it here on the show, but you know, more the kind of creativity in, in their marketing,

938
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,600
but it's out there and to which I see Jamie and Loki rolling their eyes. This next time

939
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:55,440
you talk to someone from PETA, ask them how many animals they euthanize every year. Ask

940
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:02,400
them about how many of their higher ups have type two diabetes and take insulin. I don't

941
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,120
know when the next time I'm going to be in Norfolk, Virginia is, which is where their

942
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:09,440
office is. But you know, and that's what, you know, when I was talking to the dude,

943
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:15,920
but you know, I, it's, you know, whatever. I just, well, no, you know what? I would have

944
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,960
no problem with PETA if they weren't big hypocrites. That's all. Well, okay. Stepping away from

945
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,620
what PETA is all about and all this, cause I don't know. I just don't know enough about

946
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:30,880
PETA cause I've just never really cared. What about this whole, this is how they market

947
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,480
their message is creating these viral flash video games. That's also, it's, it's actually

948
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,240
pretty defamatory too. Remember the cooking mama one? I do remember that. That was funny.

949
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:48,080
That, but in the end though, I mean, it's like, I don't think that they really care

950
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,280
whose toes they step on because they think that they're invincible. And honestly, I would

951
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:00,480
love to have a full scale investigation gone into the business practices of PETA. Very

952
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,960
interesting because I am looking at a screenshot here from the game and it's not like they're

953
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,360
trying to hide the fact that it's Mario. I mean, there's a big red M on his cap. He very

954
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:16,560
much looks like Mario. If I were a Nintendo, I might think I could sue over protection

955
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,320
of my character, although I don't know, but then can't you get into parody and all this?

956
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,680
I don't know. You still have to have enough remarkable difference that, you know, I, I

957
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,760
think that that actually is close enough to infringement right there. Cause I mean, from

958
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,560
looking from where I am right here, it looks like Mario and Luigi and I've got my glasses

959
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,400
on and everything. It looks like Mario and Luigi, but if you get super close up, you

960
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,920
can see little text on there that says princess Pamela Anderson kidnapped again. And that's

961
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,040
where I know this is not a Nintendo game. You know what I mean? That's where I go. Okay.

962
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:54,760
I'm sorry. That looks like Mario. Pamela Anderson was maybe good looking like 20 years ago when

963
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,760
she was on Baywatch, but she's no princess now. She's barbed wire. She kicked her ass.

964
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,600
I mean, if you've seen, again, I was just talking about, Oh no, they did an earlier

965
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,800
and funny enough, I'm going to bring them up again. Once in a while they'll run these

966
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,400
pictures of Pamela Anderson without makeup and Oh my heavens, she is not good looking

967
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,120
anymore. Is she with Tommy Lee or Kid Rock at this point? Who fucking cares? Who fucking

968
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:24,080
cares? We all know. But obviously she's big on PETA. She's one of their big supporters

969
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:30,840
and stuff. And that's why she gets people, especially people who have no brains. Alright,

970
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,000
let's just move on. I just wanted to get it out there. It's, it's interesting. Marketing

971
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,440
using video games. It is showing you, I will say this, let me finish on this thought. You

972
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:49,140
as a gamer are being targeted for propaganda. Yeah. That's, that's why I brought this up.

973
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:53,240
That's what I wanted to say. You just set me up a plate of, uh, you know, fried, you

974
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:00,480
know, sea kittens. I'm sorry. It's going to be an argument between guitar hero five and

975
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,280
Madden for KFC side or super chick sisters. I'm sorry. I don't recognize super chick sisters,

976
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,000
but guitar hero five and matter and tell me to go eat chicken. I'm going to have to listen

977
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,040
to them because I don't want to piss off. The cows say to eat more chicken. They have

978
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:23,680
signs. All right. This, this was the worst possible show to bring up this topic on. Let's

979
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,640
move on. Well, especially since you're in, you know, Peter Peter hater central, which

980
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:34,520
would be me, but I don't, I don't hate, I don't hate, I know it. I hate hypocrites.

981
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:39,480
I do. Okay. I know. I do. I do. There are things I hate, but I, I, I'm trying not to

982
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:49,800
hate people, but I do hate ideas and I hate hypocrisy. So fair enough. All right, let's

983
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:55,260
move on. That Peter sucks. Um, um, there's some, how about something that's completely

984
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:00,400
non-controversial and very happy for those of us who have our Xbox three sixties and

985
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:10,120
love them. Um, project Natal, there are details including release date sort of, um, we should

986
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:16,160
be looking at it, um, uh, possibly around November, 2010 and it should be costing around

987
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:25,000
50 bucks. And they are speculating that 5 million units will be ready by that time.

988
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,100
So they're thinking big seller and they don't really just have, you know, a bunch of happy,

989
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:38,240
you know, gamers all on them. They have time magazine all on them. Project Natal made it

990
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:47,040
into the top of 100 or no top 50 invention poll on, uh, on the time magazine website.

991
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,320
How is it possible for a device that's not even out, but it's been invented. It's been

992
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:56,840
invented in this on display, but who's played at Jimmy Fallon. Big deal, you know, like,

993
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:02,200
but it's Jimmy Fallon. He means a lot to everybody, right? No chirp, chirp, cricket, cricket.

994
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,560
They're quoted this saying that a project Natal because it uses several cameras and

995
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,320
the microphone and because it's so much more intuitive than anything that's been out to

996
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,080
this date and is going to be put out on a mass consumer market. It's right up there

997
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:20,240
with the blade. Yeah, but they haven't played like the super virtual boy X two five, you

998
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,480
know, that's coming out 2015. Okay. And I just want to clarify, we're all still approaching

999
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,720
Natal with a healthy dose of skepticism, right? Because I thought when we last talked about

1000
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,160
this, we're still sitting here going, okay, but yeah, but when we saw the eye toy in motion,

1001
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,180
it looked like it worked flawlessly too. Listen, you're not talking bad about the eye toy or

1002
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:44,220
PlayStation eye or say a, you know, the Xbox vision camera. I've never been burned by any

1003
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:51,240
of those ever. Wait a minute. Okay. You know what the eye toy was good for the wash and

1004
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:56,600
windows game that played that song from the 1920s. Yes. When I'm washing windows, that

1005
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,240
was the greatest thing they ever did with the eye toy. Okay. And that game actually

1006
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,260
worked pretty well, but a lot of these other games they released through the eye toy did

1007
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,880
not play like you think they would on the back of the box. All I'm saying again, I realize

1008
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,560
Natal is a much higher advanced technology than eye toy, but when I see this little like

1009
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:19,260
little 12 year old girl walking up and trying on her clothes by waving her hand, I'm kind

1010
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,880
of like, okay, well that's what they want us to believe. It really plays like, well,

1011
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,480
yeah, yeah. Remember, but, and we were making that joke is that when Natal was, was being

1012
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,380
previewed, like, wasn't this a scene in clueless like 10 years ago, but how is it, is it really

1013
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,920
going to work that flawlessly? Cause part of me goes, you know, well, my DS is supposed

1014
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,660
to understand me saying blue too, but here I am going brew, brew, brew. Let me mention

1015
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:48,820
some of the other things that are on the list. Okay. For the list of stuff that's, um, and,

1016
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:55,660
and I actually can't really call this a list of inventions because they're not necessarily

1017
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:01,680
all real inventions. Some are innovations and existing technology. Some are books. Pride

1018
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:07,440
and prejudice and zombies is on the list. If the Snuggie is on that list, the Snuggie

1019
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:14,680
is on the list. The Snuggie is the greatest invention of the modern times. Have you seen

1020
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,600
the Sleepy? The dog Snuggie, Rob, the dog Snuggie. Have you seen the Sleepy? No. What's

1021
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:26,000
the Sleepy? It's like a bed. It's like a, think a, um, sleeping bag made out of bedsheets

1022
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,760
that has no zipper and has a pillow inside of it. Amazing. Well, here's some of the stuff

1023
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,720
that's on here and some of these are actually pretty worthy. The 10 million dollar light

1024
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,140
bulb, I love it, is, is actually a light bulb that runs all on LEDs. It's just as bright

1025
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:47,020
as any light bulb and will never burn out. Um, they've actually teleported atoms. Uh,

1026
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:52,260
they have, uh, a guy who lost his vision in one eye figured out with these other guys

1027
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:58,300
how to have a camera implanted into his eyeball so that he can record stuff. They've got a

1028
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,760
chip that can actually make the blind see through the use of chip and special glasses,

1029
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,040
which is what I was on Facebook earlier calling. So didn't they already do this in Star Trek

1030
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:14,840
The Next Generation with Geordi Spicer? Um, there's vertical farming. That's cool. Okay,

1031
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,760
so great. Project Natal is right out there with vertical farming, but yet I guess none

1032
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,080
of us have enjoyed vertical farming. Rob, there's one more though that I think would

1033
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:29,080
appeal to you. Okay. Robot penguins. Robot penguins, Rob. I got a text message from Victoria

1034
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:35,560
today that said she got a leopard print Snuggie. You know what I replied? You can't because

1035
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:42,800
I wanted one of those meat farms. You can grow meat by parts, Rob. How great is that?

1036
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:49,920
I mean, you can grow meat. This is, I don't see a team of Dutch scientists is closing

1037
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,360
in on culturing stem cells from pigs and growing muscle in a Petri dish in vitro meat. Okay,

1038
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,600
so I understand. Maybe, maybe now this list makes a little more sense because a lot of

1039
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,560
these are things we haven't actually gotten to do ourselves. You know, I have never growed

1040
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,000
meat myself. I've never grown my own meat to eat. This sounds like more than that. Here's

1041
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,380
the Robo penguin. What? Okay, so Natal I see fits into this list cause a lot of these things,

1042
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:19,600
but then again I also say, does project Natal really deserve to be up there with meat that

1043
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:27,160
you grow? That sounds like the unicycle thing. All right. That was, I watched that thing.

1044
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:31,760
This stuff on there, Rob. No. Okay. Project Natal, I would say you wouldn't look ridiculous

1045
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,880
riding around on unicycle just like you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a Segway.

1046
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,320
What was that thing? What was that thing on a South Park called? Whenever I see these

1047
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,400
new writing devices, I always think of that thing on South Park, the, that one episode.

1048
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,040
I know some of you listeners know what I'm talking about. A 3d camera, a smart, the smart

1049
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,440
bullet is my favorite invention on the list. It's a bullet that you can trigger to explode

1050
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:01,880
after you've already shot it into somebody. You can choose when the bullet explodes. It's

1051
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:08,040
the best thing ever. It will, it will. You don't want to piss me off. Why not? I shot

1052
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,160
you and if I hit this button, you're fun. I've also figured out how to levitate a mouse

1053
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,640
with magnets. There is something even better than the smart bullet. They didn't have to

1054
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,520
have the smart bullet with a one liner at the end. So when you trigger it, it says a

1055
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,080
one liner, then you explode. That'd be even better. I don't know. They actually have an

1056
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:30,480
x-ray camera on the list. And Rob, it was the wild, or Wild Wacky Action Bike, which

1057
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:37,600
is a fun times. YouTube funk, what the funk. Well, something else from Microsoft coming

1058
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:45,400
soon of course would be the fall update and we can expect that on Tuesday, November 17th.

1059
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:50,880
With that will be coming the Facebook and Twitter integration as well as Last.fm and

1060
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,840
all sorts of other fun stuff. And honestly, still haven't really played around the Facebook

1061
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,280
and Twitter stuff other than the one time I posted on Twitter saying, hey, I'm posting

1062
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,520
from an Xbox 360, which apparently everybody else did so now I feel like a loser. But yeah,

1063
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:12,640
it's cool I guess. But if you feel sad because you don't own a 360 and happen to have a PS3,

1064
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,260
well fear not. There is a rumor that you're going to be getting integration to Facebook

1065
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:21,520
as well very soon. This is actually coming from some screenshots that leaked out from

1066
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:28,260
Sony's own website. Oopsie. Apparently Sony Computer Entertainment Europe had a few screenshots

1067
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,080
on their website including brand new things like the ability to change your gamer card

1068
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:40,960
colors as well as integration with Facebook. A little shot of the cross media bar there

1069
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:49,960
with a Facebook link there and also some thumbnails of photos in a grid layout. So some other

1070
01:12:49,960 --> 01:13:00,520
features coming possibly in a later expansion to the new cross media bar. Which is good

1071
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,280
I guess because we need a lot more updates from consoles for different things. I know

1072
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,280
with at least the Xbox 360 one I know they're going to add some screenshots and stuff like

1073
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,040
that which would be pretty awesome because then when I kill people in Grand Theft Auto

1074
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,600
I can share it with everybody. Although that would be a lot of photos I'm sharing because

1075
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,800
I kick a lot of ass in that game. Okay, maybe not. But yeah, it's interesting. So what do

1076
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,760
you think, Jamie? Something that you would probably use? Although you don't play much

1077
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,240
on the PlayStation 3, do you? No, I really don't. I probably wouldn't use it. But I

1078
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:42,960
actually, I'll be honest, a lot of the little networking stuff through the consoles I really

1079
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,720
have no interest in. Because the only things that I use for my networking is my iPhone

1080
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:56,560
and my computer. So it would actually more irritate me I think if I was being interrupted

1081
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:03,400
in a game for Facebook. Well I'm just hoping that they don't have automatic updates for

1082
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,880
trophies or achievements or something like that. I know that they kind of tried something

1083
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,800
a little bit with Twitter with Uncharted 2. It was a big pain in the ass. I haven't really

1084
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,840
seen anything from that because I don't think a lot of people use it because they realize

1085
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,400
how annoying that would be. Well the raptor thing is what pisses me off. Well yeah, I've

1086
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,840
seen that too. That's kind of annoying. Especially with Twitter, I mean you can kind of block

1087
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,400
some of that stuff now. At least with Facebook. In fact actually I've been going through on

1088
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,640
Facebook and kind of blocking all of the apps. Which actually makes it really nice because

1089
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,720
now I can actually see what my friends are updating without having to sort through all

1090
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,080
those apps on there. I've been doing much the same. Still kind of going through everything

1091
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:49,720
and hopefully I can actually get down to where it's just my friends posting and stuff like

1092
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,720
that. There are a few though, especially from Rob, that I can't block because there's actually

1093
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:01,320
a screenshot that he has on there. Which one? The Sorority Life? No it's not Sorority Life.

1094
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,280
That's like a quiz or something that he's doing. You can actually go in and block a

1095
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:14,560
lot of those quizzes too. You can do hide app whenever you get a post up on your wall.

1096
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,320
So I actually do that with a lot of stuff now because honestly I'm irritated by a lot

1097
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,760
of it. And the only thing that I actually even play anymore on Facebook is the stupid

1098
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:35,040
little pet game that I like so much. The pet society thing. And that's it. Yeah. So you're

1099
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,640
going to be using a lot of the Facebook stuff and Twitter. I know you're going to use some

1100
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,280
Last.fm stuff. Not particularly on Xbox. Well obviously my Xbox is still down and I don't

1101
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:49,400
really think I want to come back on board with Xbox for this. I mean I say this every

1102
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,900
week. I'll get my Xbox replaced eventually but this isn't really enough to kind of like

1103
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:57,480
sell me on it. Because again, I've watched the people update their Twitters from Xbox

1104
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,400
and you know everything I've seen so far. Hey guys, I'm updating my Twitter from Xbox

1105
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,600
and then I never see another tweet from the Xbox. And the only thing I worry about again

1106
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,760
is just the Twit spam that we're already seeing. Not just from Xbox but Uncharted 2 and some

1107
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,680
of these other games. I just beat level 3 in Uncharted 2. I don't care. Just all the

1108
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:24,160
raptor people need to shut up. And the problem is that unlike Facebook, Twitter has no button

1109
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:29,840
where I can say filter all posts with hashtag uncharted 2 in it. You know what I mean? And

1110
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,880
I'm not knocking uncharted 2. I haven't played it myself but I hear the game is fabulous

1111
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,400
and it looks like fun. I want to play it myself. But I'm just saying this whole tweet spam

1112
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:42,380
thing has got to go. Same thing with Facebook. It's basically just to say hey we did it first.

1113
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:50,020
I guess. Anyhow, alright well moving on to other topics and maybe a game that might be

1114
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:56,240
publishing status updates to your Facebook very soon. Drum Hero is a game that has been

1115
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,480
trademarked by Activision. Keep in mind though this doesn't mean that necessarily the game

1116
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,480
is being made or anything.

1117
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,480
I thought they already did this.

1118
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,940
It is just, well you know a lot of people were kind of having this whole little like

1119
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,980
wait a minute, haven't we heard this before? But here's the thing and this is what makes

1120
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:16,580
this newsworthy. Previously Activision trademarked the titles Guitar Villain and Drum Villain

1121
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,720
and this was way back in 2007 when they did that. But nothing ever became of these titles,

1122
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,880
at least not yet. Who knows? You never know what might be in the making. But nothing ever

1123
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,520
happened with those. But even though they trademarked Drum Villain, they never trademarked

1124
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,940
just straight up Drum Hero. That trademark never happened to everyone's surprise. It

1125
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,480
is just now being trademarked. Again though this doesn't necessarily mean they're going

1126
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,940
to do anything with it, although it certainly seemed logical.

1127
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,760
Now here's something else to keep in mind and kind of a related story that's going on.

1128
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:54,800
Apparently in an interview with MCVUK.com, CEO Dan Rosenweg of the Guitar Hero brand

1129
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,600
and works for Activision says that the publisher is apparently already working on new versions

1130
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:05,020
of Guitar Hero and Band Hero and that there will also be more DJ Hero, which I'm sure

1131
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:09,720
all of this makes you go, duh, duh, and more duh. We all know more of these games is coming.

1132
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:16,840
But one thing they are saying, fewer SKUs in 2010. But keep in mind SKU is a term that's

1133
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,600
been, well let's say skewed over the past couple of years. This has kind of made its

1134
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:27,800
way from a retail only world to the mainstream game blogs everybody throws this term SKU

1135
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,120
around. And what does SKU really mean? SKU is essentially like a bar code I guess you

1136
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,640
could say. Maybe you could explain this better than I could Loki. But basically this doesn't

1137
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:44,640
mean like one game does not mean one SKU. A SKU is Guitar Hero 5, Guitar plus game on

1138
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:51,240
Wii is one SKU. Guitar plus drum plus game on Wii is one SKU. Game alone, another SKU,

1139
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,940
right? Yeah. That's basically kind of how it works. Just because there's less SKUs doesn't

1140
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,900
necessarily mean there's going to be less games, although that's kind of the conclusion

1141
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,080
a lot of people are jumping to.

1142
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,280
Just remember that this year alone, and this is including Guitar Hero Van Halen, there

1143
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:10,600
has been 41 SKUs. So less than that doesn't necessarily mean that much of a difference.

1144
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:16,440
And that's because you have four different systems, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii that

1145
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:21,260
all these games are coming out on. And then you have the jumbo kit, the game alone, and

1146
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,260
the game and guitar.

1147
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,000
The DS and also possibly the PSP which is actually supposed to be coming out next year

1148
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
as well.

1149
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Oh wow.

1150
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And if you want to include the iPhone I guess.

1151
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,600
And also, by the way, Bobby in the chat room, which I think is interesting, he's bringing

1152
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,760
this up as well, says another term co-opted by blogs that he's using correctly is price

1153
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,640
point. That's a marketing term, not something, say, to talk about how much something costs

1154
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,000
you in retail. And we're probably just as guilty as the next guy of using that term

1155
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,520
a lot. It's kind of interesting how that has, that term I would say has almost evolved.

1156
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,520
Like maybe that's not what it's supposed to mean, but that's what everyone thinks it means

1157
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
now.

1158
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
I always use MSRP.

1159
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
Yeah, microtransaction.

1160
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,040
Yeah, I know that too. Anyway, anyhow, getting off the subject a little bit here, but just

1161
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,360
because there's talking about less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean less games. Although I personally

1162
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,280
think we're not going to see the Metallica and Van Halen style releases next year in

1163
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,240
Aerosmith. I don't think we're going to see any band only releases next year, especially

1164
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:21,160
not after this whole stink about what's going on in Guitar Hero 5 with the band seeing it.

1165
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,840
I think it would actually be because of that stink.

1166
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Really?

1167
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,580
Yeah, because then they'd have that one band that's already agreed to have their likeness

1168
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:31,500
in there and they're not really singing other people's songs.

1169
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,360
I don't know though, part of me just says it's kind of been done with all the big bands

1170
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,800
that are going to get their own game. I mean, granted, I'm sure, you know, there's a million

1171
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,160
people, everybody's going to shout out their favorite band, but are these games really

1172
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:47,680
selling that well? I mean, come on, the Van Halen one, they were given away.

1173
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:52,240
Van Halen is still selling pretty well because a lot of people didn't buy it within that

1174
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,760
one month. It's that one month after September, you aren't getting it for free unless you

1175
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,760
find it used.

1176
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,840
I'm just surprised. Again, I'm going to take a lot of hate with this comment, but I don't

1177
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,720
care. Van Halen underserved their own game, especially not if they're going to ignore,

1178
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,840
you know, the latter half of the career.

1179
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:14,200
I understand that. And yeah, a lot of the older games, like Aerosmith does not sell

1180
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,520
for shit right now. No one cares.

1181
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,520
But it's old.

1182
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:25,080
It's old, but it doesn't matter though. It's still another band. Metallica, once in a while.

1183
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:31,180
Smash Hits, never. Five sells well. Van Halen will start selling well. But the problem is

1184
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:36,120
when you release that many different games out there, you start getting, you know, obviously

1185
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:41,800
oversaturation with that title, and then people start ignoring the other ones. But if they

1186
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:47,360
plan it that way, that's fine, because they've gotten you to buy one release, you know, multiple

1187
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,560
releases a year. I don't know.

1188
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,280
And I see a couple people in chat are making reference to Michael Jackson. Specifically,

1189
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,440
I'll read this comment from Sturlock, says, I wouldn't be surprised by a Michael Jackson

1190
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,280
specific game. And I have to admit, of all these things that people randomly shout out,

1191
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,960
I suppose that's the one that I could see really happening, although, yeah, I don't

1192
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:13,540
think it would really be a rock band or guitar hero game. Michael Jackson could kind of have

1193
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,840
a new thing, like a new music game.

1194
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
You're supposed to be doing something.

1195
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,840
Based on Michael Jackson.

1196
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,960
Well, they're doing a Michael Jackson game already. It was already in the works before

1197
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,920
he died. I already have a theory of what Drum Hero is. It's going to be something for either

1198
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,800
the DSi or like an iPhone, something like that, because if you think about it, Guitar

1199
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,440
Hero can't do that on the DSi because there's no place to plug the guitar in. But you better

1200
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,360
believe that that drum skin that they put out for Band Hero, the DS version, can fit

1201
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,360
on the DSi. So there's your drum. Drum Hero.

1202
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,120
That's actually one of the more creative thoughts I've heard, is that maybe a lot of people

1203
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,520
are jumping to the conclusion that this is like a sequel to Guitar Hero, but maybe it's

1204
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,600
an iPhone port makes a lot of freaking sense.

1205
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,120
It'd be kind of neat to do something on Xbox Live Arcade or something like that, too. Then

1206
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:02,600
that way you don't need a guitar. You can just play it with your, you know, buttons.

1207
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,100
That is a very interesting prospect. You know, and also, kind of speaking of this, I was

1208
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,320
thinking about this earlier, and I think part of this was kind of inspired by Bobby's show

1209
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,560
because he was talking about Lego Rock Band tonight and he was kind of talking about the

1210
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,580
importing of the songs and all this. And I kind of got to thinking, like, how come nobody's

1211
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:24,520
jumped on that idea of releasing a music game that's just a shell very cheaply that maybe

1212
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,600
comes with a couple in-house produced songs? You know, maybe one or two big licensed songs

1213
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,480
for like ten bucks, fifteen bucks.

1214
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,720
Well, like the same concept that Vibribin had its own stuff in it, but you could bring

1215
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,680
in your own music, except in this case you'd be downloading to buy?

1216
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,320
Okay, yeah. The big difference would be that Vibribin, its whole thing was around importing

1217
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,960
your own CDs, but this would be around microtransactions, basically, buying the songs you want. And

1218
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,180
I think what made me think of this is that there are some songs in Lego Rock Band I want

1219
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:58,020
to play, but not the whole thing. So I'll probably buy the game just to import the songs,

1220
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:01,600
but when it's in the clearance bin. Because right now, you know, fifty bucks for the game

1221
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,560
plus another ten for the import fees, I'm not feeling it. But the game will end up in

1222
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,520
the bargain bin inevitably at some point, so I'll buy it then.

1223
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,140
You know, it's kind of interesting with all of these skews, if you want to say, or games

1224
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,900
coming out, I want to be able to pick and choose a little more. So it's kind of interesting

1225
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:23,480
there is no game out right now that's, you know, and I would think that Xbox Live Arcade

1226
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:29,120
or PSN would be the perfect place for a game like this to release just the shell of a game

1227
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,920
and make most of their money off the songs.

1228
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,480
I'm surprised that Boom Boom Rocket, was that what it was called? Remember that game that

1229
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,600
came out on Xbox? I was actually really good at that game. I had like a bunch of high scores

1230
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,400
for a while. I probably don't anymore. But Boom Boom Rocket, I'm kind of surprised they

1231
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:51,480
never did anything with that. You know, like all the songs in that were classical songs.

1232
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:56,180
Imagine if they had actually put like some licensed songs or some fun techno things into

1233
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,920
that shell. Like that game could have been a whole lot more.

1234
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,160
Yeah, it would have been cool.

1235
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:05,500
And then of course, the inevitable Bobby's yelling out, beat and groovy. But that game

1236
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,840
was always just doomed for disaster. We all knew Konami was not going to have the faith

1237
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,000
to try and get licensed songs there.

1238
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,240
By the way, did you realize Popping Music Week came out?

1239
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,840
No, I, somebody in chat said it and I actually kind of went and went, oh yeah, that came

1240
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,680
out, huh? But I just don't have interest in it.

1241
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:25,440
It was really contacted us a week before it came out. Oh, by the way, it's coming out.

1242
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,680
Sell some copies.

1243
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,920
Did you sell some copies? Move it?

1244
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,920
Nope.

1245
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,320
Oh, just curious.

1246
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,320
Not a copy.

1247
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,320
All right.

1248
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,120
I know better than to torture my customers like that.

1249
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:39,320
All right. Anyhow, so we'll see what happens with Guitar Hero in the coming year and Rock

1250
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,960
Band as well. I think it's inevitable. We all know it's coming in 2010, Rock Band 3.

1251
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,960
It's got to be happening.

1252
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
Oh yeah.

1253
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,840
That'll be our next E3. We're going to hear all about Rock Band 3 and Guitar Hero 6.

1254
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
Everyone's going to teach you how to play an instrument this time.

1255
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
Oh yeah, that's right. We'll see.

1256
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:59,280
Well, how about something a little bit more realistic? Final Fantasy 13. It's got dates.

1257
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,160
Realistic. I don't know. This thing's been the figment of my imagination for about four

1258
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,200
years.

1259
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:11,680
There's supposed to have a simultaneous PS3 and Xbox 360 release for Final Fantasy 13

1260
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:19,440
in the US and in Europe on the 9th of March, 2010. So hey, we've only got a few more months

1261
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:24,320
to go. Of course, if you're in Japan, then you get it next month.

1262
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,040
And it's kind of interesting because the turnaround, they promised that it was going to be a much

1263
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:32,500
quicker turnaround this time, but they really made it happen, especially considering there's

1264
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:38,440
a 360 port in the works as well. A four month turnaround by Square standards really doesn't

1265
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:42,560
seem all that bad when you were at least looking at nine months before. How long did it take

1266
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,960
for Final Fantasy 10 to come over here from the Japanese one?

1267
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,960
Plenty.

1268
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,960
Almost a year, right?

1269
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,960
Something like that.

1270
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,980
Yeah. I liked, though, that they did this whole announcement in this big trailer. It's

1271
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,760
just this big event of a game because I guess Final Fantasy 13 does deserve that a little

1272
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,360
bit, but Square's got a lot riding on this game, don't they?

1273
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,360
Well, they tend to throw a lot of their stuff in on their Final Fantasy franchise. I mean,

1274
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,560
that is really what I would say has kept them on the map.

1275
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,680
I just don't remember all this fanfare over 12. That's all.

1276
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:18,920
Well, 12 was kind of...

1277
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:24,560
As there shouldn't have been. I liked 12. 12 just came out at a very bad time. 12 should

1278
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,200
have been made for the PS3 and 360. It just came out at a bad time. They should have just

1279
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:34,640
delayed it a year and put it on the next Gen or whatever you want to call them, consoles.

1280
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,920
I was going to say that the guy in the trailer was a douche.

1281
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,240
Yeah, a little bit. He had kind of a douchey vibe, didn't he?

1282
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:46,700
But it's kind of typical of them to do something very fanfare like that because, after all,

1283
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:51,200
they do have the theater of fun that they have all their trailers that play in during

1284
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,200
E3.

1285
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,200
Except this last year.

1286
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,200
Except for last year, yeah.

1287
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,560
Now, didn't they also make a big announcement about the theme song for Final Fantasy 13?

1288
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:05,880
That they actually landed... Usually they just bring over the Japanese song, right?

1289
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,880
You know, like...

1290
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,040
Well, they got Leona Lewis to sing the theme song.

1291
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:15,600
So here in the US and UK, but not in Japan. So they're actually having different artists,

1292
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,320
which is kind of new because even when they localized the Kingdom Hearts song, it was

1293
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,320
still Utada Hikaru.

1294
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,640
But she's also bilingual.

1295
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,640
I got concert tickets for her in January. I'm so excited.

1296
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:31,160
Anyhow, but what was I gonna say before I got sidetracked with that? Oh, this is the

1297
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:34,680
first time that they've had like a different artist singing it over here, right?

1298
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,680
No.

1299
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,240
No, did they do that with 12? I don't remember.

1300
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,240
They did that with 10-2.

1301
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,620
Wasn't it the same?

1302
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,620
It was the same singer.

1303
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,160
Oh, I forgot about 10-2. That's right.

1304
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:48,560
Yeah, they got What's Your Face from Jade from...

1305
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Yeah, Sweet Box or whatever it was called. That's right. I forgot about that. And I was

1306
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,560
really shocked.

1307
01:28:53,560 --> 01:29:01,120
One of the ending videos in the US version from the Japanese version, they actually changed

1308
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:06,000
it because of her differences in singing it.

1309
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,440
Well actually, the song that's gonna be in Final Fantasy 13 is a song called My Hands.

1310
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,080
It's actually on Leona Lewis' next album. And if you're curious what the power ballad

1311
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,480
of Final Fantasy 13 is gonna sound like, we have a little sneak peek for you right here.

1312
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,520
We can only play a little clip of it because it's all copyrighted and stuff. Here's a sneak

1313
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,520
peek.

1314
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:37,760
So it sounds like your typical sitting in the dentist's office kind of Celine Dion station

1315
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,840
power ballad music, which is kind of typical of the Final Fantasy ballads.

1316
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,440
It actually does sound pretty J-pop ballad actually.

1317
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,440
A little bit.

1318
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:57,320
I think they announced something horrible like Popo Sow or something like, you know...

1319
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,560
Sexy Back is the theme song of Final Fantasy 13.

1320
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:05,080
Sexy Back. No, that's Final Fantasy 13 versus Sexy Back.

1321
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:09,440
So there you go, Leona Lewis. Which actually, I gotta say though, that's a pretty good sized

1322
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,440
name to land. But you know what's funny? You know who her record label is? Sony. So kind

1323
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,920
of, who knows, maybe a little bit of networking there. But Leona Lewis, that's a pretty...

1324
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,880
She's not a AAA artist, but she's hot shit right now.

1325
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,000
Unfortunately, because of the Sony license, the Xbox 360 version will be getting Popo

1326
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Sow.

1327
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:35,280
Shut up. I don't know about the UK, but she's big over here. In fact, she's the only celebrity

1328
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:41,920
from a British reality show, except maybe Susan Boyle, that is well known over here.

1329
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,040
Whereas I'm assuming over there, they probably have a lot of our American Idol. So they're

1330
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,720
probably not all of them. I can't imagine people like Taylor Hicks are big in the UK,

1331
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:56,160
but probably Kelly Clarkson and some of those people are big in the UK. So I still think

1332
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,560
that's a pretty decent sized name to have.

1333
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,900
Let's not forget, folks. For some people, it's not necessarily a draw, but it makes

1334
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:10,080
a lot of people do a double take. I don't think anybody's gonna buy this game because

1335
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,800
Leona Lewis is in it, but it's definitely gonna make a lot of people go, hey, it's gonna

1336
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,520
make some of these critics of video games are not a legitimate art form, or video games

1337
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,320
are not on the same level as movies and TV shows to turn their heads and go, oh, Leona

1338
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,920
Lewis is doing the theme song. Really? That's interesting.

1339
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,320
That's only because they approached Bryan Adams first and he turned them down.

1340
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,320
Shut up.

1341
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,160
He's the king of power ballads.

1342
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:39,720
All right. Speaking of release dates, let's check out some closer release dates to this

1343
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:45,200
week. So, Loki, you should finish a bite of your wing there. We'll start with the US states.

1344
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:49,520
There's nothing coming out this week. What are you talking about? No really good stuff.

1345
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,120
There's actually a lot of stuff. It depends on what area of the world you're in or United

1346
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,520
States because that stuff might have already come out with people breaking street date

1347
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,980
because they suck. No, but of course this week, Left 4 Dead 2, making its way out on

1348
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:14,600
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not PlayStation 3, PC. Anyways, Assassin's Creed 2 coming

1349
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:25,800
out on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Also this week, some smaller titles including Planet

1350
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:33,080
51, of course tying in with the new movie coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and

1351
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:40,240
DS and PSP. Today, actually, New Super Mario Brothers Wii came out. That's pretty awesome.

1352
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:47,200
Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles also coming out on the Wii this week. Buck Fever, if you

1353
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:51,760
happen to like deer hunting games, also coming out on the Wii. There seems to be a lot of

1354
01:32:51,760 --> 01:33:00,840
deer hunting games on the Wii lately. Formula 1 on PSP coming from Codemasters, NCAA Basketball

1355
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:11,360
2010 out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Also Formula 1 for the Wii as well. This week,

1356
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,000
another big old bundle game, which I'm not sure is going to sell very well, but Tony

1357
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,500
Hawk's Ride with the skateboard will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii

1358
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:28,680
for a whopping $120. The re-release of Stoked, the big air edition coming out on Xbox 360

1359
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:36,400
this week. Ubisoft pimping out their Pets games with Pets Hamsters Superstars featuring

1360
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:43,240
what appears to be a rollerblading hamster, which is very disturbing. LEGO Indiana Jones

1361
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:50,040
2, the adventure continues out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC this week. And also

1362
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:57,360
I believe the DS and PSP. Assassin's Creed Bloodlines on PSP this week, also Assassin's

1363
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:05,280
Creed 2 Discovery on the DS. Seen It, Bright Lights big screen out on PlayStation 3, Xbox

1364
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:12,420
360, and the Wii. God of War Collection coming out on the PlayStation 3 with a demo of God

1365
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:20,040
of War 3 in there, so that would be pretty cool. Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Tag Force 4 on PSP. Just

1366
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:26,040
Dance from Ubisoft out on the Wii, which the game looks absolutely ridiculous. Remember

1367
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,100
that stupid minigame that they made me play instead of the sledding one I wanted to play

1368
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,880
in Rayman's Raven Rabbids TV Party?

1369
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,720
I remember this. This is a PAX, right? Did that happen?

1370
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:41,160
Yes it was, and unfortunately this game is very similar to that, so I don't know, you'd

1371
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,880
probably look ridiculous playing it. Jamie will get a kick out of this. The Sims 3 World

1372
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,320
Adventures expansion was coming out this week as well on PC.

1373
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,040
Yay!

1374
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,040
What does that mean?

1375
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,720
You can go to France. You can go on safaris.

1376
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:07,040
On français! I can go to the Louvre. I can take my fake character out for a baguette.

1377
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,760
Be our guest, be our guest.

1378
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,400
Sorry, Loki. Can I read some quick chat comments though, because there's some really funny

1379
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,400
shit.

1380
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,400
Yeah, it's only in that voice though.

1381
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:22,400
Okay then, I will read some comments from Jet. SSJ100 and Matt says that as far as the

1382
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,800
Final Fantasy theme song goes, Christopher Walken doing Poker Face should be in it. And

1383
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,800
I'm thinking so much that. Christopher Walken doing anything should be in a video game.

1384
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
Or Cartman doing Poker Face.

1385
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,480
Or Cartman doing Poker Face. They're kind of like a mishmash of both.

1386
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,480
A duet.

1387
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:41,520
Some strange chat. I didn't read this whole thing, but they were talking about sales figures

1388
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,400
for DJ Hero. Some chatters calling it a flop, but I didn't realize it was a flop. In fact,

1389
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,680
I thought I saw some article this week that just in those first few days, because the

1390
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:54,800
game came out what, October 27th? And just in those last few days, it sold like 100,000

1391
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,800
copies or something?

1392
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Yeah.

1393
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,760
I mean, granted, that's across four different platforms, and I think maybe like 3,000 were

1394
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,880
sold in the PS2, but you figure they're not going to sell well there. I mean, it's a little

1395
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,200
early to call that game a flop, right?

1396
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,840
Yeah. I don't think it's sold as much as, say, a Guitar Hero game, but then again, it's

1397
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,560
also way more expensive than a Guitar Hero game.

1398
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,560
Did Guitar Hero 1 catch on right away?

1399
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,560
No. Not really.

1400
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,500
And that kind of had to build, too.

1401
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:23,800
It's all right. I mean, I think that they're going to be selling enough. I mean, they're

1402
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,400
making another one already, so.

1403
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,520
I think you have to look at the sales figures after Christmas, and then we can talk about

1404
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,520
if it's a flop or not.

1405
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:38,360
Yeah. Say, man, I've enjoyed the soundtrack to this game kind of like as much as I did

1406
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:43,760
with the early DDR games. The soundtracks are really good, and I mean, I've been listening

1407
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:48,640
to the whole soundtrack in my car, well, what I have dumped of it, and I love it. It's awesome.

1408
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,920
I will put this out there, and the Bamani fans can have their way with me. I don't care.

1409
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:01,520
It is the best music game song list for an initial game in a series ever. I wouldn't

1410
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,800
go so far to say as I enjoy it as much as, say, maybe the third mix or the sixth mix

1411
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,560
or sixth style or whatever of other games, but I will say as far as an initial song list

1412
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:19,640
goes for a franchise-launching music game, it's the best song list there has ever been

1413
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,160
in a music game ever.

1414
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:27,320
Yeah. All right. Continuing on our release dates. This is a big one. LittleBigPlanet

1415
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:32,400
coming to the PSP this week. That should be pretty exciting. Disney's The Princess and

1416
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,480
the Frog, not so exciting on DS and Wii this week.

1417
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,360
Hey, I want to see that movie. You shut up, hater.

1418
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,000
Yeah, but the game's not going to be great.

1419
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Yeah, the game's going to be stupid. They always are.

1420
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,640
The movie will be cool, but you know.

1421
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,640
They always are.

1422
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:49,560
Game, not so much. And talk about random licenses, D3. Common Rider Dragon Knight on the Wii

1423
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:58,920
and DS. Let's see. Photo Frenzy on the Nintendo DS from Kokum International. And if I remember

1424
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:05,520
correctly, I thought that was a DSi-only game. Maybe not. Petz Dog's Talent Show, yet another

1425
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:11,280
animal that's dressed up and on a skateboard coming to the DS from Ubisoft. God forbid

1426
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:17,880
they do that to animals. And this is kind of cool. Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue coming

1427
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,880
to the Wii this week.

1428
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,440
Oh, that. God, I remember talking about that like weeks and weeks ago that it was coming

1429
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,120
out for the Wii and now just out of nowhere, here it is, right?

1430
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,120
Boom, there it is.

1431
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,520
Boom. Jumbo Safari.

1432
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:35,080
Imagine Artist on the Nintendo DS. Let's see. And some smaller games. Wreck Room on the

1433
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:44,040
Wii. I think that's about it. Next week, though, Hello Kitty Party on DS.

1434
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,720
Woo-freaking-hoo. All right, let's go to some Japanese releases and some of the things

1435
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:51,400
you have to look forward to over there. Just like we have Left 4 Dead 2 coming out over

1436
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,920
here, you have that coming out in Japan as well in their own version coming out on the

1437
01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:01,560
19th because they get their releases on Fridays, if I remember right. Or no, I think they come

1438
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,840
out like Thursday or something.

1439
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,240
And over there it's called Ha! Zombies!

1440
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:10,960
Shut up. PlayStation 3, Ratchet and Clank Future, A Crack in Time comes out. That's

1441
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,220
the big release on the PS3 this week. Oddly enough, though, I don't see anything about

1442
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:20,720
Left 4 Dead on the PS3 over there, but is that not coming out on PS3 at all? Over there?

1443
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:25,080
Left 4 Dead 2? It's not coming out on PS3 over here.

1444
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,080
Why did I think it was?

1445
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,960
Because I goofed and said that earlier.

1446
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,040
Oh, okay. I just assumed it was, but okay. No, I guess that makes sense.

1447
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,400
Remember, Valve hates PS3.

1448
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:37,640
Yeah, I remember that now. All right, the Wii has a lot more to choose from, though.

1449
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:43,760
Taiko no Tatsujin has its own little version coming out. It's Wii Dodun Tuto Yomei. I

1450
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,800
don't believe this is the first Taiko no Tatsujin game coming out, but I believe this

1451
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:52,160
is the one that has the little inflatable drum that is disgustingly cute that you can

1452
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:56,240
get in a little bundle set there. So if you're a fan of that series, you have that to look

1453
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,720
forward to on the Wii this week.

1454
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:02,600
Otherwise, a game you might be interested in, Calling! Kuroki! Chakushin is coming out,

1455
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:06,440
and that looks to be kind of like a scary game. I think it's called The Calling or

1456
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:11,200
something, and it looks to be kind of a scarier game that's coming out on the Wii. I don't

1457
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:15,520
see any screenshots, but definitely it's got one of those Japanese grudge-looking girls

1458
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,300
on the front and then a little cell phone, so I think it has something to do with cell

1459
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:24,760
phone horror or something. I don't know exactly what cell phone horror would be, but

1460
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,760
this game is it.

1461
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:34,080
Hey, on the PlayStation 2, your monthly bill from AT&T with an iPhone! Oh, Loki, sometimes

1462
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:38,160
I feel like there should be a two-drink minimum to listen to this show with you on it. PlayStation

1463
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:43,760
2, Seke, Saikyo Yu, Gen-C, Igo, Kooza, for those that are still buying PS2 games, on

1464
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:49,360
the Nintendo DS, Monster Finder comes out! And then also next week, just so you know,

1465
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:54,200
they're also getting like hella hella Hello Kitty peripherals, like a new little pouch

1466
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:57,160
and a DSi slim pouch and all this stuff.

1467
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,940
I think it's like an anniversary, actually, of Hello Kitty.

1468
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,540
I think so too. Mario and Sonic, by the way, at the Vancouver Olympics also comes out in

1469
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:09,960
Japan this week. And lastly, taking a look at the Sony PSP, Armored Core, Silent Line

1470
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,640
Portable coming out over there, as well as Jak & Daxter, a new release there, and a game

1471
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:20,380
called Mina no Na'vi comes out on the PSP. Those are your Japanese release dates.

1472
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:26,600
In the UK, on the 17th, we have Left 4 Dead 2, we have Gyromancer on the 18th, and a bunch

1473
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:33,280
of stuff on the 20th. Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Bloodlines, Assassin's Creed

1474
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:39,760
2 Discovery, okay, just different versions of it, Dragon Age Origins, F1 2009, Little

1475
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:45,160
Big Planet on PSP, New Super Mario Brothers Wii, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of

1476
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:53,280
Sky, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Saw, BLEH, Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper, Sims

1477
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,380
3 World Adventures, Wii, and Tony Hawk Ride.

1478
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:03,400
I just wanted to mention that next week, or actually the week after next, there's a game

1479
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,880
coming out on the Wii over here that's like all sorts of fail. It's an exercise game called

1480
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:14,360
Your Shape. It features Jenny McCarthy, and guess what? Okay, they're super intelligent

1481
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:17,620
over Ubisoft. They decided, hey, you know what, even though the Wii has this wonderful

1482
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:23,500
motion capture system with Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, we're gonna use a webcam

1483
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,280
to capture your movement, just like the eye toy.

1484
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:30,920
I'm just worried about the shape it's gonna tell me I am. Congratulations, you are a

1485
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,920
pair.

1486
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,120
Congratulations, you're shaped like Rosie O'Donnell.

1487
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,480
Noooooo.

1488
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,480
You are a leopard.

1489
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:48,040
What? That doesn't make any sense. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1490
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:51,600
Let's keep moving on. You realize this part A is going on two hours tonight just for part

1491
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,560
A. Good times. Obviously we've been gone a week.

1492
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,880
And she's jumping and excited. Fitness that's fun and focused on you.

1493
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:04,360
Jenny McCarthy's just excited to have a job this week. Because seriously, what has she

1494
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:05,360
done?

1495
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,360
Exactly.

1496
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:10,680
Besides, I think like a National Lampoon movie, maybe, here and there? Alright, a few more

1497
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,640
stories and then do a break already.

1498
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,640
Good lord.

1499
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,640
Loki.

1500
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,920
Oh, I have another story?

1501
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,840
Yes. We don't release dates. It's your turn.

1502
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,680
We're talking about Jenny McCarthy and how, you know,

1503
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,680
The hell with her.

1504
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:28,920
Anyways, Modern Warfare 2, of course, you know, selling lots and lots and lots of copies.

1505
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:36,080
Of course, in the UK, it sold 1.23 million units the first day, breaking first day sales

1506
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:41,040
records over there. So that's pretty awesome. Guess everybody loves Modern Warfare over

1507
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,040
there.

1508
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:51,700
And of course, in the US, 4.7 million units in day one sales, making it probably the biggest

1509
01:43:51,700 --> 01:44:01,240
game this year and the biggest game for quite a while. So, yay! I don't know. Yeah, we kind

1510
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,960
of figured it was going to sell a lot.

1511
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,960
And it was on the news and everything. Like, I was watching, you know, one of the days

1512
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:10,320
I was home sick, I was watching the morning news and they were actually did a story about

1513
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,960
all the lines that were going on around midnight at the store.

1514
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,440
I saw pictures from Dan's store.

1515
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:18,240
Honestly, do we need more newscast stories where it's like, hey, look, it's gamers waiting

1516
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:22,040
for a game. Oh, my goodness, that pandemonium.

1517
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:26,680
Because people need to be reminded for some reason that video games are a huge business

1518
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:33,040
and, you know, this game probably made more money than most of the box office did this

1519
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,560
weekend. Like, what was the big movie this weekend, 2012 or whatever? And I don't think

1520
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,360
it, I mean, even if it made a hundred million, which I don't think it did.

1521
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,080
That's half the movie's budget right there.

1522
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:49,080
But that's probably still less than what Modern Warfare 2 made. You know, granted, of course,

1523
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,860
the game is, what, 60 bucks or it's a movie ticket.

1524
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,760
Not to spoil anything about 2012.

1525
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,760
Did you see it?

1526
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,440
Yes, I went and saw it earlier today.

1527
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,440
It looks ridiculous.

1528
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,440
It is ridiculous.

1529
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,440
I can't.

1530
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:06,200
After the fourth time, count it, fourth time that they took off on a runway and outrunning

1531
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:12,920
an earthquake. That happened multiple times in this movie. It was just like, really? Really?

1532
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,200
These movies are just getting ridiculous. I'm sorry. I realize there's an audience for

1533
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:24,040
these movies and clearly it's Loki, but like Independence Day, I watched, I was all excited

1534
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,640
about it. It was cool.

1535
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:30,400
Day after tomorrow, I was kind of like, okay, really? We're running away from like weather

1536
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,280
blasts and things like this and run before the cold gets...

1537
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,200
Listen, you can outrun weather, okay? It's a fact.

1538
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:38,640
It was a little bit ridiculous, but okay, whatever. It was a good popcorn flick. But

1539
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:45,360
I watched, like they had a clip of LA getting leveled or whatever on Yahoo movies or whatever

1540
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:49,680
and I was watching a clip from 2012 and I'm just sitting there the whole time going, this

1541
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,880
is so ridiculous because I think you're supposed to feel like excitement for John Cusack and

1542
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,320
his whole family getting out of these horrific situations.

1543
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,560
But all I can think about, because I don't know, this is just the kind of person I am,

1544
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,960
is that what about those millions of cars that are piling up on the freeway and these

1545
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,800
buildings that are toppling over? Why am I supposed to give a shit about this rich white

1546
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,600
dude who got a limo to escape from the...

1547
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,840
Listen, it's a middle class white dude.

1548
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:17,840
I'm sorry.

1549
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,020
The limo driving is his job.

1550
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,020
Why should I care about...

1551
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:22,020
He's a failed author.

1552
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,640
Okay, my bad for not paying the money to see the movie.

1553
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,640
No.

1554
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,640
But why should I give a shit about him when the movie is depicting millions of people

1555
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:35,600
dying in a catastrophe and it's supposed to be like a feel good movie? Like really?

1556
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,960
No, it's actually very funny because seriously, there's multiple times that they're flying

1557
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:47,840
the plane out of things. They outran a volcano blast. They outran buildings toppling. How

1558
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:55,920
is the plane taking off from a landing strip and somehow sinking into the ground? I mean,

1559
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:02,620
they were pulling up on the plane yet going deep into the ground. What? I'm sorry, there's

1560
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:07,520
a point where I'm like, this is just too much and this movie looks to be too much.

1561
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:13,700
I know it was completely ridiculous and it was. It lived up to its ridiculousness.

1562
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:17,460
On the ridiculous scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not so ridiculous and 10 being completely

1563
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:19,840
fucking ridiculous, how ridiculous is 2012?

1564
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:25,520
I would give this an 8.5 because a 10 I think would have to be Wild Zero because Wild Zero

1565
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:30,480
is so ridiculous. They chopped a UFO in half with a samurai sword and it's a punk band.

1566
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:35,880
I mean, which by the way, the samurai sword I think came out of his guitar. So, that movie

1567
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,120
sounds awesome. And there was Zombie Love.

1568
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,480
And I've got your copy.

1569
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:44,720
I forgot I even have that movie. Amazing.

1570
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,880
Any movie that has Guitar Wolf in it instantly rules.

1571
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:54,480
Okay, and Tigerclaw wants to clarify, 2012 has made $225 million worldwide and $65 million

1572
01:47:54,480 --> 01:48:01,760
domestically. Any sources coming soon.net as the source for the monetary figures.

1573
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,420
But probably Modern Warfare 2 still makes more money in the week that it's out than

1574
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,480
this movie did. I mean, it's just huge.

1575
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:12,480
And honestly though, it's seriously, it's a good movie to watch. It's absolutely ridiculous.

1576
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:16,060
But that's why you watch it. It would make an awesome RiffTrax movie. Oh my God, it's

1577
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:17,520
going to make an awesome RiffTrax movie.

1578
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,160
Okay, back to Modern Warfare for a minute because I really, really don't care about

1579
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:25,880
2012 anymore. I do care though about that Facebook group about shut the fuck up, the

1580
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,880
world's not going to end in 2012. That cracked me up.

1581
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,880
I signed up for that.

1582
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:37,120
I know. I signed up last week for an undisclosed amount of people arbitrarily signing up for

1583
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,520
a cause or something like that.

1584
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,520
I signed up for that.

1585
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:45,720
That was funny. There's an app for that. Anyway, back to Modern Warfare 2. Here's the thing

1586
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,280
I don't understand. Loki, I need somebody to translate for me and for some reason I

1587
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:54,200
feel like you would understand this game better than I do because I'm not knocking the game,

1588
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:59,920
but keep in mind these type of war sims are not really my thing. So what is it about this

1589
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:07,840
game that is making it sell zillions? And yes, it is in fact selling zillions.

1590
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:16,200
Well, the game is really fun, really intense. Online was awesome in the first one. I wouldn't

1591
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,440
know because I didn't play it, but everyone says it's awesome, therefore I'm blindly believing

1592
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
that.

1593
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:27,960
Chatters, feel free to help me out too. Why is Modern Warfare 2 so, like such a landmark

1594
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,960
game?

1595
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,600
It's very gritty. Like, I mean, there's, you know, you're playing undercover at, I guess

1596
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,120
in the beginning I think you're undercover as, you know, part of a terrorist cell because

1597
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,000
you're infiltrating them from the inside, but you have to murder people and stuff like

1598
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,160
that, innocent people in an airport and whatnot. You know, the scene that got controversy or

1599
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,160
whatever.

1600
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:49,720
Is it kind of trying to ride on that whole America fuck yeah wave?

1601
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:54,080
Well, it's America and a bunch of other countries are getting all fucked over because there's

1602
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:57,600
one part where you're like, you know, storming the White House because terrorists have taken

1603
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:04,560
it over. So, I mean, it's kind of, yeah, you know, fighting terrorism is cool and the online

1604
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:09,280
is really sweet. I think of like a guy's, I don't know, like a Halo 3 or something like

1605
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,560
that, because Halo 3 had a really short campaign and the online was awesome. It's kind of the

1606
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,800
same with Modern Warfare 2. Campaign's pretty cool, short, but it's awesome.

1607
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:21,080
ActDeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com says, even PC boycotters are playing Modern

1608
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,800
Warfare 2. I did see that screenshot of like all the people in the boycott group on Steam

1609
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,880
were playing the game. My God, if I could sum up, like arguing on the internet in a

1610
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,120
picture, like, you know, they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Like if I had to

1611
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,400
explain debate on the internet, like that picture does it right there. That is, that

1612
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:42,160
is trying to debate someone on the internet summed up into a picture.

1613
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:47,000
I bet, dude, do the same thing when Left 4 Dead 2 comes out this week. Let's go snap

1614
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,380
a picture of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group. I bet there's shit loads of people playing

1615
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:55,540
it. Yeah, because you know what? Cause they're sheep because they're like, ah, but I want

1616
01:50:55,540 --> 01:51:02,000
to play it. Okay. Well, and they'll justify it saying, oh, well they, they, uh, took care

1617
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,280
of what I needed them to take care of or whatever. Um, let's see. Uh, Quel Tipo in chat says

1618
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,240
it's a manly macho game that makes people feel tough. Is that what it's a, it's a, it's

1619
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:18,120
a modern version of when we used to go outside and play like army man or whatever, make believe.

1620
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:24,240
Now it's just all please to bury the GI Joes in a mass graveyard. Interesting. I, I, you

1621
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:28,760
know, I, again, I'm not knocking the game. I guess for what it is, it's a landmark game

1622
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:32,440
and it's certainly the graphics I've seen look very realistic and everything. I'm not,

1623
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:37,400
I realize, you know, just not every game I'm going to get and that's just the way it is.

1624
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:41,160
Just like there's a lot of people that probably sit here and go, really? Why do they play

1625
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:44,600
so many music games? They talk all the time about music games and I think they're stupid.

1626
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:49,240
You know, everybody's just into whatever they're into. I just was kind of curious why this

1627
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:56,200
game above the countless other war games that are released. Anyhow, um, got one more news

1628
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,780
story for you guys and we're going to get into the classic video game of the week and

1629
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:02,760
this actually has to do with the Zune. You know, we talk a lot about iPhone, iPhone,

1630
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,120
iPhone, you know, and all the gaming that's going on there. Well, certainly Microsoft

1631
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:10,840
wants a piece of that too with their own handheld device, the Zune. And while the Zune doesn't

1632
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:16,280
make phone calls, the Zune does play movies, listen to music, and now it will do games

1633
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:21,560
too. Um, there's a new firmware update that happened. It was 4.3 and apparently there

1634
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:26,280
are now six free games on the Zune marketplace. That's right, free. Project Gotham Racing

1635
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:33,280
Ferrari edition, Lucky Lane Bowling, Vans Skate Pool Service, Piano, Checkers, you know,

1636
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,040
classic game in there too, excuse me, classic game in there too, and a game called Audiosurf

1637
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:42,240
Tilt, which is a port of sorts of the popular game Audiosurf that was available on the PC

1638
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,080
where you can use your own MP3s. I've actually played that game. It's quite a bit of fun.

1639
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:48,860
If you like music games, speaking of which, Audiosurf is a nice little investment. That's

1640
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:55,360
kind of a fun game. Um, so now you can play that on the Zune as well. Um, so, you know,

1641
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,840
Zune's kind of trying to step it up there a little bit as a portable device, and of

1642
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:03,160
course, I'm sorry, not just a portable device, but kind of up there with the iPhone with

1643
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:08,640
its all in one kind of device there, and for those that were asking, you know, when is

1644
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,080
Microsoft going to get into handheld gaming, I guess this is what we've got, at least so

1645
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:19,200
far. So, I don't know, any interest in these games? Like, I'm curious what Project Gotham

1646
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:23,000
looks like and the Audiosurf I'm certainly interested in, especially if it plays off

1647
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,720
your MP3s from the Zune. I think that's pretty cool. Um, but at the same time, I wouldn't

1648
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:30,040
drop several hundred dollars on the Zune just to check it out.

1649
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,760
I'm just wondering when the hell they're going to actually release, you know, was it the

1650
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,720
XNA stuff on the Zune? When's that happening?

1651
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,640
Yeah, I heard something like that was supposed to happen, huh?

1652
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,960
I talked about it like a while ago.

1653
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,560
I don't know. I don't think that's come full circle yet as to when that's actually going

1654
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:50,560
to happen when you see the indie games on the Zune. So, maybe soon. Anyhow, let's get

1655
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,680
into that part of the show that we like to take a trip down memory lane and look at a

1656
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:58,800
classic video game from The Vault. Every week, DarkSakura steps into The Vault and picks

1657
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,520
a game that she thinks you guys should be playing. It's our classic video game of the

1658
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,480
week. DarkSakura, what video game did you pick for the kiddies tonight?

1659
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,480
River City Ransom.

1660
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,480
Woohoo!

1661
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:14,560
I'm glad the Vault's cold.

1662
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,880
Were you very cold going into The Vault to pick out the game?

1663
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:17,880
Quite.

1664
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:22,520
Actually, even though I love the NES version, I'm picking a specific one and that's the

1665
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:31,280
example that I've given us for our YouTube. It's Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, which is

1666
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:38,880
Downtown Hot-Blooded Story. In the PAL region, it came out as Street Games. And it's one

1667
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:39,880
of the Kunio games.

1668
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:44,000
And you can hear the music is a little different here. In fact, let me play a little clip here.

1669
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I'll have to find this on my main cabinet.

1670
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,800
You can play PC Engine games on your main?

1671
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,040
Yeah, I can play anything I want.

1672
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:02,280
Oh, you've got the emulator set up. But yeah, this is... there are also versions for the

1673
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:09,800
X68000, the Game Boy Advance. It came out on Virtual Console. But basically, since it's

1674
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:20,320
one of the Kunio games, you know, with Nekketsu Koha Kunio-kun, which was Renegade, and Nekketsu

1675
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,600
Koko Dodgeball-bu, which is Super Dodgeball, which I have covered.

1676
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:28,280
Yeah, I think that was a previous game you did, because I love Super Dodgeball.

1677
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:32,360
But basically, you were playing high school kids in the Japanese version. They're Kunio,

1678
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:42,200
Enriki, and over here it's Alex and Ryan as they go to try to rescue the girl. And by

1679
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:47,600
going against different, I guess, you know, delinquent gangs or whatever. And so it's

1680
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:52,120
just a little street brawler. You know, walk down the street, punch some people, and then

1681
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:54,320
he's stopping for, you know, a burger.

1682
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,320
And a free smile.

1683
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:01,600
And a free smile. So the... you also, of course, have passwords so you can start off in different

1684
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:09,560
parts of the game. But I did pick this one in particular. Oh yeah, actually I needed

1685
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:16,160
to mention some differences between the Japanese version. They actually changed the school

1686
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:21,360
uniforms into t-shirts and jeans, you know, that type of stuff.

1687
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,360
Also, now you just noticed?

1688
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,360
Voice acting.

1689
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:29,440
Digitized voices. So there are other times, this is what I was going to mention, you can

1690
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:35,000
go into, like, restaurants and buy stuff to refill your health or do whatever. These are

1691
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:40,640
actually, have voice acting on them, so if you want to skip up to the next part.

1692
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:42,640
Sure, which isn't too far ahead here.

1693
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:55,960
And that's, this is like the little fast food restaurant sequence.

1694
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:56,960
Yeah.

1695
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:03,200
It's super light, you have the hashtag message, you know.

1696
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:07,480
And I love the little, this is such great radio, I know, but I love the little look

1697
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:14,280
on his face after he eats his burger. And the cutesy music.

1698
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:18,520
This game was also famous for having a butt. I remember that. You remember that? In the

1699
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:21,280
sauna sequence, you saw a butt.

1700
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:29,080
Well, it was probably just a public bath or, you know, whatever. But yeah. This is the

1701
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:36,880
other bit. More voice acting.

1702
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,920
So for a little, you know, TurboGrafx-16 style cartridge.

1703
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,920
No.

1704
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:42,920
No?

1705
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,920
This was PCCD. PCCD.

1706
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,920
Oh, okay.

1707
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,920
So...

1708
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:50,040
But still, I mean, that wasn't the most technologically advanced, I mean, at the time it was, but,

1709
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,040
you know, it's pretty impressive.

1710
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:55,760
All the, you had Redbook audio with this, you had voice acting because it had a higher

1711
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:02,280
storage capacity. Well, I mean, you saw, you heard the, you know, vocal intro for Dracula

1712
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:08,160
X on PC Engine, so it could definitely do it. It's, you know, just pre-record it and

1713
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:09,160
have it go up.

1714
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,760
It's just interesting because I never really knew this version was here, even though I

1715
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:15,760
loved Rude for City Ransom as a kid, and I see everybody in chat barf exclamation-blimey.

1716
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,920
Everybody remembers some of the great dialogue that we got over here, which I'm sure was

1717
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:25,640
just raped localization that came out very funny. Like, kind of like the original Engrish,

1718
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,640
if you will.

1719
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:27,640
Well...

1720
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:31,920
Because I highly doubt that's what they were saying in the Japanese thing, was barf.

1721
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:42,440
Well also, the company that localized it was American Technos, which was a subsidiary of

1722
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:48,260
Technos Japan. They actually brought out another Kunio game that came out over here as Crash

1723
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:54,600
and the Boys Street Challenge, although it's more of the same type, but not really super,

1724
01:58:54,600 --> 01:59:04,100
super linked. And yeah, in Japan, that one was Bikuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku Harukanaru

1725
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:13,000
Kin Metal, which was Astonishing Hot-Blooded New Records Distant Gold Medals. So, but yeah.

1726
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,800
I love how they like to butcher names and everything when they come out. But yeah, it

1727
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,960
did come back out on virtual consoles, so those with Wii go get it. However, I will

1728
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:30,520
just say this to this date, the Super CD version is my favorite.

1729
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:35,920
Alright, so your classic video game of the week, River City Ransom, or in this case,

1730
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:42,200
Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari. There it is. The classic game of the week from the archives.

1731
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:48,840
And you know what? A recently released game reminds me, I would actually even consider

1732
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,480
it a spiritual successor, because Dan and I were talking about it, which is how I was

1733
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:59,100
thinking of doing this one, is the, oh crap, now I just forgot the name, where you play

1734
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:05,440
as a delinquent boy beating up other people. Badass something.

1735
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,440
Bully?

1736
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,200
No, Badass Rumble or something.

1737
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:11,440
Kankobancha Badass Rumble.

1738
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,440
That's it.

1739
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,440
Kankobancha.

1740
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,440
That's it.

1741
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,440
Alright, well.

1742
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,800
Because I told Dan we had to get that game, and Dan's like, I want it just because it

1743
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,800
has badass in the name.

1744
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,840
Just because of the name. Alright, well that's going to do it for this part A of our show,

1745
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:29,920
but we're not done yet. We're going to come back for plenty more, which is pretty amazing,

1746
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,720
because part A tonight was two hours. That's one of our longest part A's in a while, but

1747
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:37,400
that's okay. We've obviously had a lot to talk about between this wine flu and gaming

1748
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:40,720
and all that food and all that other fun stuff. But we are going to take a quick break. We

1749
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:45,240
will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around. Stay tuned. We'll

1750
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,720
be right back, because in part B tonight, your Twitter topics, your phone calls, some

1751
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,960
rapid fire news, and of course more chat, including Silent Hill news, One vs. 100 season

1752
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:59,280
2, Gran Turismo 5, Moonwalker, plenty more coming up in part B tonight. We will be right

1753
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:08,040
back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1754
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:11,440
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November

1755
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:18,280
the 15th of 2009, where we are taping the 344th episode of our podcast, as we do every

1756
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:26,040
Sunday night, live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. We tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

1757
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:29,880
Time, right after the conclusion of the Bobby Black Wolf show, every Sunday night on All

1758
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:34,840
Games Radio, when we aren't sick with the flu. And we just came back from a music break.

1759
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,040
We took a really short live break tonight. We only listened to one song, and that was

1760
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:42,080
the new song from Final Fantasy 13. We actually listened to the full version of Leona Lewis

1761
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,680
with My Hands. I'm kind of curious. I'm assuming this is the first time that Dark Soccer and

1762
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:51,160
Loki had heard that song. Would you guys kind of think of that as the Final Fantasy ballad?

1763
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:53,320
Just kind of your typical little power ballad from Final Fantasy.

1764
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:54,320
Yeah, I kind of tuned it out.

1765
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,800
Yeah, I kind of tuned it out a little bit. You know, you just kind of have to imagine,

1766
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,120
you know, that's going to be the big romance scene with lightning and snow and what do

1767
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:03,920
they get partially cloudy and whatever these guys' names are in the game.

1768
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,600
No, it's going to be snow and that red-headed chick and one that's like flying through the

1769
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,600
fire.

1770
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,600
What's her name? Thunder Snow?

1771
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,600
No, it's not Thunder Snow. I don't know.

1772
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:17,080
30% chance of precipitation. Is that her name? It's funnier, though, if you imagine it being

1773
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:22,560
that tough-looking army dude that raises all the chocobos, and he's singing it to a chocobo.

1774
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,560
That is funny.

1775
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:24,560
That is pretty damn funny.

1776
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,560
There you go. See, doesn't that make that song a lot of fun?

1777
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,920
It'll be snow getting it on with his motorcycle, which turns into the twin shivas and yeah.

1778
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,560
All right. Anyhow, there you go. Love it or hate it. It's the ballad from Final Fantasy

1779
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:40,400
13 and those of you that weren't listening live tonight, that's okay. I'm sure that...

1780
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,480
I think her album comes out on Tuesday, so if you really want to hear it, you can check

1781
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,480
it out on iTunes.

1782
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:49,200
Anyhow, we're going to get back into the show tonight. Let's go ahead and go into rapid

1783
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,480
fire news first because I failed to load the Twitter topics during the break.

1784
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:53,480
Fail.

1785
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:56,000
I know. Well, we only had a short break tonight. So while I get that up, we'll go ahead and

1786
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,440
do rapid fire news and then we will do Twitter topics.

1787
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:04,640
Well, Final Fantasy 13 is coming out a lot sooner than it is over here in Japan. Well,

1788
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:10,320
they're going to be getting some extra content as well, including a new camp or a campaign

1789
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:17,120
code, which will be used in Final Fantasy 14. What exactly does that mean? Who knows?

1790
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,360
But it's something that's exclusive if you buy...

1791
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,280
Horse armor.

1792
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,040
Could very well be horse armor or a campaign to get horse armor.

1793
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,300
Or it could be horseshit.

1794
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:28,520
Or how about this? There are no horses in Final Fantasy.

1795
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,520
Oh my God.

1796
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Sorry.

1797
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,520
Chocobo armor.

1798
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:32,520
That'd be cool.

1799
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:33,520
Like tactics.

1800
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,520
It's bird crap.

1801
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,160
Actually, when a lot of folks saw the previews for one of those Final Fantasy games, I think

1802
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:42,480
it was Eleven that first showed it, that a lot of people were like, cool, Chocobos and

1803
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,480
armor. Cool.

1804
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,400
I thought that was tactics to have that.

1805
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:48,600
Oh, maybe it was. Maybe it does go that far back. I wouldn't be surprised.

1806
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,600
Anyways.

1807
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:52,840
Hold on. Can we just have a moment to reflect on what a great fucking game Final Fantasy

1808
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,840
Tactics was?

1809
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,840
I didn't like it.

1810
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,840
What?

1811
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:56,840
Get out.

1812
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,840
I don't like tactics games.

1813
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:58,840
What?

1814
02:03:58,840 --> 02:03:59,840
Oh my God.

1815
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:00,840
Do I really do this show with you guys?

1816
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:01,840
I really don't like tactics games.

1817
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:02,840
Oh my God.

1818
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:03,840
Final Fantasy Tactics is amazing.

1819
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,520
I recognize it as an amazing game.

1820
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,200
I personally do not dig the tactics games.

1821
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:10,200
Fine.

1822
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:16,640
Command & Conquer 4 has been announced to be coming out next year on March 16th.

1823
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:20,560
They call it Tiberian Twilight, and I hate that subtitle because it reminds me of that

1824
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,880
crappy vampire movie series and book series.

1825
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,480
Happy series in general.

1826
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:29,580
Did you know that Burger King Neuros is staying open 24 hours for two days because of the

1827
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,160
stupid Twilight movies?

1828
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,360
That's sad.

1829
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:35,240
Why would Burger King- I mean, I realize they have the whole Twilight promotion.

1830
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:38,600
Yeah, they have a big old Twilight promotion going, it's on the crowns.

1831
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,600
That's blasphemy.

1832
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:40,600
Blasphemy.

1833
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,600
Sorry.

1834
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,880
Anyways, the game will-

1835
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,040
I was so bored this week, Loki, when I was sick.

1836
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:51,620
I was watching the Rachael Ray show, and that right there should tell you something.

1837
02:04:51,620 --> 02:04:57,760
She was giving makeovers to Twilight fans to make them look like Twilight characters.

1838
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,920
And I'm just sitting there going-

1839
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:00,600
Isn't she supposed to cook?

1840
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:03,040
I would rather be at work.

1841
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,520
So she took them the hot topic.

1842
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,520
Alright, just keep-

1843
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,400
I thought she was supposed to cook.

1844
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:08,400
Keep going.

1845
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,400
I'm sorry.

1846
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:13,460
Anyways, the game will conclude the Tiberian storyline, and yeah, it'll be coming out also

1847
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:15,160
March 19th in Europe.

1848
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,160
So that's kinda cool.

1849
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:19,560
And then finally, Wok- or, Wokban.

1850
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:22,560
I'm sorry, no Wokban this- but Rockban, though.

1851
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:31,320
We will be getting some wonderful download content in the form of a pack from AFI, including

1852
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:37,000
songs Beautiful Thieves, End Transmission, Love Like Winter, Medicate, and the Leaving

1853
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,840
Song Part 2.

1854
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,640
I like Love Like Winter, that's a good song.

1855
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:49,400
And that'll be available as a pack for 680 Microsoft points, or $8.50 in real money.

1856
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:54,120
And of course, available individually for $2 each, or 160 Microsoft points, or 200 Wii

1857
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:56,120
points, you know, you can kinda figure that out.

1858
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:59,960
And finally, the individual song for this week, though, is The Bangles, Walk Like an

1859
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:03,880
Egyptian, which also goes over for $2.

1860
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:11,000
And for the PSP, Dead Kennedys, California, Uber Allies, or Uber Alls?

1861
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,920
They spelled allies wrong, stupid.

1862
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,640
Sleater Kinney with You're No Rock and Roll Fun.

1863
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,880
And that's also $2.

1864
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:23,400
Dude, Walk Like an Egyptian I think would actually be kind of a hard song to play.

1865
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,680
I seem to remember it had a very fast guitar and drum part.

1866
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,680
It's a song that people recognize.

1867
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,480
People like songs that people can recognize.

1868
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:30,480
Exactly.

1869
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:35,160
But now I'm trying to think about what the game Walkban would look like.

1870
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:41,760
I can picture just these horrible, horrific stereotypes that really shouldn't be repeated,

1871
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:45,600
but that's just what pops into my mind, I can't help it, but I'm sure it would be a

1872
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,720
hideous, hideously racist game.

1873
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:50,480
50 different renditions of I'm turning Japanese.

1874
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:54,480
All right, anyhow, moving on to another rapid fire news tonight.

1875
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:59,080
The Wireless N network adapter has made its way out to America.

1876
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:02,880
If you want to pay $100 for it, the Wireless N networking adapter is out.

1877
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,840
It's dual band, 5 gigahertz, 2 point...

1878
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,960
You know what?

1879
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,240
I'm not gonna read all the technical specs, because I'm just not that nerdy.

1880
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:14,920
Just trust me, it's out, and if you like your wireless fast, very fast, then this will get

1881
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:15,920
it fast.

1882
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:19,240
But do remember, you need an N router, or this will do no good.

1883
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:20,240
That is one thing you need.

1884
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:21,240
It'll just be no faster.

1885
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:22,240
Yeah, oh well, it'll be no faster.

1886
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:26,240
It'll just revert to B or G or whatever it is you have in your house.

1887
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:32,660
Anyhow, also, Madden NFL Arcade coming out November 24th and 25th, depending on what

1888
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:34,320
platform you're on.

1889
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:40,560
It will come out for $15 on the PlayStation Network, 1200 Microsoft points on their respective

1890
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,400
service.

1891
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,480
This is Madden NFL Arcade.

1892
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,480
I'm assuming...

1893
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:49,160
I don't know a whole lot more about this game, but I'm assuming this just plays a little

1894
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:54,080
more like, not so probably intense with your play picks and so forth.

1895
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:55,080
It's probably just more of a...

1896
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:56,800
It's like 30 yards.

1897
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,800
It's almost like...

1898
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:01,280
Probably like, I would imagine like Tecmo Bowl back in the day or something.

1899
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,280
Was it so...

1900
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:03,280
Yeah, maybe.

1901
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,280
This is actually, to be honest, this looks like the type of football game I could get

1902
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:10,360
into where it's just not overly complicated with all this technical stuff.

1903
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:15,240
It almost reminds me of arena football because, I mean, they are playing on 30 yard fields

1904
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:19,160
and it's really fast and...

1905
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:20,720
I don't know.

1906
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:23,920
It's just another excuse to get you to spend money on this because, hey, they tried it

1907
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:31,120
with NBA and with NHL, so why not try it with Madden, their number one selling sports franchise?

1908
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,120
Why not?

1909
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:33,120
They can make...

1910
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:35,160
I mean, $15 is not exactly...

1911
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,600
It's on the higher end of the arcade games.

1912
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:41,240
I have to read this comment from chat before I get to the last story I have here.

1913
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:45,120
Sj100matt says, Walk band sounds like a parody from South Park.

1914
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:50,440
Like playing Rampart to keep the Mongolians from ripping down my shitty wall.

1915
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:57,120
Lastly, for me for rapid fire news tonight, Criterions developed a need for speed game

1916
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:00,600
is making its way out next year.

1917
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:05,160
That is official, I guess, from Criterion Games website.

1918
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:13,920
I don't know if that is the need for speed online game, but it's another game coming

1919
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,400
out there from Criterion is next year.

1920
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:21,560
So if you like your, you know, explosive car wrecks, there you go.

1921
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:25,720
Well, Star Trek Online, how's this for Gear Switch?

1922
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:32,600
Will be out on February 2nd, 2010, or if you want to go by the star date, uh, 63554.5.

1923
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:38,120
Um, but yeah, I am totally, totally, totally very happy with that because I will be playing

1924
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:39,720
the hell out of it.

1925
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:49,760
And also, um, they were, um, saying that, um, the events that happened in the movie

1926
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,560
affect the game.

1927
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,480
Even though the movie's a parallel universe thing.

1928
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:55,480
Yes.

1929
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,480
Strange.

1930
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,480
Maybe this is a reboot universe game.

1931
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:58,480
Interesting.

1932
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,800
That would be very, very interesting.

1933
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:05,240
I am, I honestly, my gut reaction to hearing this was already like, I seriously thought

1934
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:06,800
it was not going to be till next Christmas.

1935
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,280
And now I'm sitting here going, Holy crap, it's going to be out in February, February

1936
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:11,280
2nd.

1937
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:12,280
Oh my God.

1938
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:13,280
Bye.

1939
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:14,280
Wow.

1940
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,280
Yeah.

1941
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:22,120
Well, um, also, um, new, uh, Beatles right band, uh, download content on November 17th

1942
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:26,000
with a Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.

1943
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,840
So that'll be pretty cool November 17th, not too far to go.

1944
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:40,560
Um, also, um, yeah, that's actually going to be for Xbox 360 and Wii.

1945
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:49,720
And then, um, for the iPhone, there is a Commodore 64 emulator back on the iPhone store.

1946
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:55,120
So I guess they patched out, I remember it was there before and like you could somehow

1947
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:58,800
trick it into running basic, but then that means you could write your own code on the

1948
02:10:58,800 --> 02:10:59,800
iPhone.

1949
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:00,800
That's a big no-no.

1950
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:05,160
Well, right, because it was rejected because of the basic interpreter.

1951
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:10,480
Um, but now they have, um, removed it and then other people figured out how to get back

1952
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:11,880
into it.

1953
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:19,520
And so, um, apparently now it's just on with even further revised code and also has, um,

1954
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,760
a boost in performance and three new games, international basketball, international baseball

1955
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,440
and international tennis.

1956
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:32,600
Also included are Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Arctic Shipwreck, Jack Attack and Jupiter Lander.

1957
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,280
I actually played Le Mans when I was a kid.

1958
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:36,680
I remember that game.

1959
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:38,720
So those aren't totally obscure games.

1960
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:42,240
Some of those, uh, are pretty well known Commodore 64 games.

1961
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:46,040
All right, before we get back into more news, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.

1962
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:50,360
Uh, we always ask before the show for you to send us your topics to twitter.com slash

1963
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:55,800
O-L-R and if you're not following us on Twitter, why not follow us?

1964
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:02,600
Enjoy our twit spam twitter.com slash O-L-R is our username OB Orange Lounge Radio.

1965
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:06,480
Sturlock tweeted us tonight wanting to know, I'm curious what your guys' opinion is on

1966
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:09,480
the visually impaired gamer suing Sony.

1967
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:14,520
As a blind gamer myself, I find it to be a bad move and I had no idea what Sturlock was

1968
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,120
talking about, but I found it interesting.

1969
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:17,120
So I tweeted back.

1970
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,600
I said, give me a link.

1971
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:20,480
And Sturlock gave me a link.

1972
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:24,800
And so we have, I hadn't heard about this, but you know, keep in mind I was a little

1973
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,160
bit out of it for a week.

1974
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:31,640
So here's the story has to do with, um, a visually impaired gamer who has basically

1975
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:33,120
sued Sony.

1976
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:37,800
And a lot of this has to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that quote,

1977
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:41,640
no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and

1978
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:45,760
equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations

1979
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:50,240
of any place of public accommodation by any persons who owns leases or leases to or operates

1980
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:51,760
a place of public accommodation.

1981
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,120
So in other words, you know, you can't discriminate against somebody for a disability, whether

1982
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:01,340
that be blindness, deafness, uh, can't use your legs.

1983
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:05,360
So you're bound to a wheelchair, you know, whatever it is, uh, you have to kind of have

1984
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,900
equal opportunities for everybody.

1985
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:13,080
So anyway, um, according to this lawsuit, Sony has apparently ignored requests through

1986
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:19,640
mail, email, and so forth to make modifications to the games to make them more accessible.

1987
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:25,040
Um, I don't know why though, but I guess this thing actually gets into massively multiplayer

1988
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:30,600
online titles requesting the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations

1989
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:34,360
for gamers with disability impaired visual processing.

1990
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:39,280
Um, so it's kind of interesting to hear this lawsuit comes to light.

1991
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,840
I would have liked to hear more about, and I think Strelok's in chat, I'd kind of like

1992
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:49,640
to hear more about his feelings against the story, um, cause I think that's kind of interesting.

1993
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:52,680
Um, you know, it's, it's tough.

1994
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:59,080
I can imagine it's, it's very tough to have a disability such as blindness or deafness.

1995
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:02,560
And this isn't the first time we've had a listener who has a major disability, it's

1996
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,220
kind of talking about games.

1997
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:08,480
And I think a lot of these things that we take for granted sometimes, like for instance,

1998
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:13,600
have we ever sat here and said, oh man, the graphics in the game were awesome and just

1999
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:17,520
everything looks so real and the water effects were so cool.

2000
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:22,680
And we have to sometimes realize like, not everybody like sees that, you know, I know

2001
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:27,840
what they do in the movie world is that, um, they actually will release movies into theaters.

2002
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:32,380
Um, at particular showings throughout the day or a special, you know, theater time or

2003
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:38,080
whatever where they actually have, or a device that actually describes the scenes to folks

2004
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,320
while they're watching the movie.

2005
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:44,120
You know, because if you can't see what's going on, it might actually say, you know,

2006
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:48,080
Tom Cruise's character is walking into a bar or something, you know, like that type of

2007
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:49,080
thing.

2008
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,560
It'll actually kind of describe the scenes for you, which, you know, makes sense.

2009
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:56,200
Just like we have close captioning for deaf folks, you know, who can't, you know, we'll

2010
02:14:56,200 --> 02:15:00,240
see that and it'll be little musical notes of someone singing or what have you, you know,

2011
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:02,000
there's other little ways they accommodate.

2012
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:05,840
Video games don't really have a lot of that.

2013
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:08,980
Does the ADA really apply here though?

2014
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:10,080
I'm not so sure.

2015
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,880
I think it might be a little bit of extreme to say that.

2016
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:19,800
I think certainly though, there is a statement being said here though, that a game company

2017
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:26,080
that could cater to this could certainly bring in an audience that a lot of folks seem to

2018
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,080
be neglecting.

2019
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:29,080
Does that make sense?

2020
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,080
Well, yeah.

2021
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:37,160
It's just, there's, there's certain things that I think people need to have a reasonable

2022
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:42,000
expectation about that this is for an MMO, right?

2023
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,840
Well, I think in part, but this is about games in general.

2024
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,480
I mean, imagine if you were blind.

2025
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:55,060
There are some, yeah, that it has to do with the type of game with, like, for example,

2026
02:15:55,060 --> 02:16:03,320
if it's, if it's something that as a game requires a number of visual clues, if I personally,

2027
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:07,040
this is just me cause I, you know, for example, okay.

2028
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:12,800
When my hand was hurting, I could not physically play any game except for singing in rock band

2029
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,280
and I don't like to sing, but I sing in rock band so I could play.

2030
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,760
I know that's a weak excuse, but I'm just using it as a personal example.

2031
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:26,160
I think that if, if it's a game that yes, modifications can be made to it so that someone

2032
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:32,560
can participate, there needs to be a release or like a server or some way that you can

2033
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:37,840
enable somebody to do that, but if it is something that requires, you know, visual clues so strongly

2034
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:46,360
that there is no possible way to simulate the same feel of the game through any other

2035
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:50,560
course of action, like if you could do it with sound, that would be great, especially

2036
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:54,240
if you could have a big speaker set up over your monitor that you could use directional

2037
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,520
sound like that.

2038
02:16:55,520 --> 02:17:02,800
That's one thing, but you're talking about, um, this has to do with the bottom line.

2039
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:08,420
The company's main concern is going to be, is your business going to be worth the money

2040
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:12,000
that we're going to spend to keep your business?

2041
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,400
And I don't, I don't really think that it applies, that the ADA is going to apply, apply

2042
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:25,160
to that because I mean, like for example, you know, say that, um, I say that I damaged

2043
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:28,240
my larynx and I really wanted to sing in rock band.

2044
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,320
There's no possible way they can make me able to sing.

2045
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,320
I'm sorry.

2046
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,320
They can't do it.

2047
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:36,720
You know, maybe I can play a keyboard or something with it.

2048
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,720
That's reasonable.

2049
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:43,440
But do you see what my point is is that there are just some things that you cannot compensate

2050
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:44,440
for.

2051
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:47,040
I think the bottom line though, and I think the point that Strelok was trying to make

2052
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,920
with the story is that, you know, the lawsuit's not really the way to go about making your

2053
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:51,920
point.

2054
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:53,160
And I think that's what he disagrees with.

2055
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:57,160
Um, you know, and I, I to some extent say, yeah, you know, a lawsuit's a little silly.

2056
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,200
We have enough frivolous lawsuits in this country.

2057
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:04,720
I think the key is reward the companies that address your needs.

2058
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,720
Exactly.

2059
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:11,320
You know, if there's MMOs out there that give those better audio clues to the things that,

2060
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:16,040
you know, sometimes we take for granted as visual, you know, descriptions or, you know,

2061
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:20,960
giving you more directional type of, you know, sound or clues or whatever it may be, reward

2062
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,680
those companies for their efforts.

2063
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:24,120
Or even a special video mode.

2064
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:28,920
Cause I know that in some cases, certain colors will register in, in different types of blindness

2065
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:33,200
that others won't have, like, you know, a special color filter mode cause you can easily

2066
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:34,200
do that.

2067
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:38,300
And you know, some games do that, like a lot of puzzle games, you can switch from colors

2068
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:39,300
to patterns.

2069
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:42,120
You know, there's little, little things they do.

2070
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:44,640
Some games have had colorblind mode.

2071
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:48,300
Or even, and I think this is kind of funny to joke about it as a disability cause it's

2072
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:50,680
really not, but lefty mode in a lot of games.

2073
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:54,920
Let's face it, there's a lot of things that sometimes the right-handed folks take for

2074
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:55,920
granted that left...

2075
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,080
Changing flashes in DDR for epilepsy.

2076
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,080
Interesting.

2077
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:00,080
Yeah.

2078
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:03,680
So there's, there's lots of very interesting little subtle changes that they, they try

2079
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:07,700
to do in games to make them more accessible and I think, you know, we reward companies

2080
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:08,700
that do that.

2081
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:13,280
Well also the, and I hate to say that this stinks of, of that situation where there's

2082
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,960
a one lawyer, um, wheelchair bound, who was going around to, actually not even going to

2083
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:23,200
some of these places, picking places like, uh, Julian California, they did it there,

2084
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:28,440
um, forcing businesses to either go out of business or spend all this money to make places

2085
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:34,320
accessible when the places were accessible anyway and you're going back and suing places

2086
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,320
that he had never been to.

2087
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:40,560
You know, some people actually seek to, and this is, this is a problem that I have with

2088
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:45,600
the American Disabilities Act is that, and I, I, there's a lot of good that came from

2089
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:46,600
it.

2090
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,600
Don't get me wrong.

2091
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,600
I think there is a lot of good that came from it.

2092
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:54,760
And I think that if a company wants the business, they do need to cater to everybody.

2093
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:57,840
They need to be courteous.

2094
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:00,680
I don't think there should be a law to force people to be courteous, but they should be

2095
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,680
courteous.

2096
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,400
They should be mindful of their clientele.

2097
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:09,920
At the same time, I think that it opened up a lot of doors for abuse, a lot of doors for

2098
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,760
abuse because now, and, and see, and again, I'm actually out of work right now under the

2099
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:18,600
American Disabilities Act because I physically could not use my hand.

2100
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:19,680
I was grateful for it.

2101
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:24,000
It gave me the recovery time I needed, but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to go

2102
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,920
to work and say, you're forcing me to do my job.

2103
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:28,640
I'm suing.

2104
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,200
You know, it's the same thing.

2105
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:40,800
I think that it's actually trying to, trying to take advantage of your disadvantage.

2106
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:41,800
You know what I mean?

2107
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:42,800
Yeah.

2108
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,460
So I don't, I don't want to drag this out for too long, but I think maybe the bottom

2109
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:52,000
line of the story is that don't forget blind people, deaf people, you know, whatever, all

2110
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,660
these different types of disabilities have money too.

2111
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:58,560
And if you're going to cut them out of your game, you're not going to get their money.

2112
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:04,080
So something developers have to be mindful for seriously, just playing the one, the one

2113
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,080
suing.

2114
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,080
Yeah.

2115
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:07,080
Well, play another game.

2116
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,200
If they're going to be bitches, why do you want them to have your money?

2117
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:10,200
All right.

2118
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:13,120
Anyhow, let's move on with some more tweets.

2119
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:16,140
Fernando on the Twitter says Philharmonic band.

2120
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:17,140
Yes or no.

2121
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:20,720
I, I, it's kind of a broad question.

2122
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:24,680
If you're, if you're going to join a Philharmonic band, um, I was a band geek.

2123
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:25,800
Dark soccer was a band geek.

2124
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:27,200
Loki, were you a band geek?

2125
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,200
Nope.

2126
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:29,560
If you're a band geek, one out of three say join the band.

2127
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:33,360
It's a, it's a good experience, but I don't know, it could be talking about like a CD

2128
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:34,360
coming out or something.

2129
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:35,360
I don't know.

2130
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,360
It's kind of broad.

2131
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:43,560
Um, Ray Iannami says, OLR modern warfare two gets a 9.5 from IGN and a 1.5 reader average.

2132
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:47,120
And I actually tweeted back cause I was kind of like, okay, well the sales figures don't

2133
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:48,120
say 1.5.

2134
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:51,720
So I said, Oh, is this people like spamming it with negative reviews?

2135
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:53,880
Cause they're like, they're doing the Amazon thing.

2136
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:57,120
They're spamming negative reviews cause they're pissed about the server lockout.

2137
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,800
And Ray Iannami says, yes, people who bought the PC version claim it's like paint playing

2138
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,440
a console FPS on a PC.

2139
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:10,600
Well don't buy it and don't let us catch you on a steam play in the game and get screenshots

2140
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:11,600
of it.

2141
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,920
Cause that says way more than a silly 1.5 average on some side.

2142
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:18,520
I don't even read anyway, ever will.

2143
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,080
I don't know what else to say about that.

2144
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:26,160
Rhetortainment says, uh, of these three major releases recently, which is the best uncharted

2145
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,240
2, the ballot of gay Tony or modern warfare 2.

2146
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:32,400
See, I haven't played any of those games.

2147
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:34,680
Yeah, it just depends on the person you ask.

2148
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:37,840
Uh, certainly those are all games that are going to be up there and we talk about game

2149
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:41,940
of the year, maybe not so much gay Tony cause it's an expansion last year's game.

2150
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:46,520
But um, if you're talking about which one do I have the most hype for, I really want

2151
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:51,000
to check out uncharted 2 cause that just seems like the game I would enjoy most out of the

2152
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
three.

2153
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
But that's just me.

2154
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,340
You know, I think they're, they're just different games.

2155
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:58,320
It really depends on the type of gamer it is.

2156
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:01,020
Um, blue swim tweets.

2157
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:04,960
What do you think of crush 40 of Sonic adventure fame coming to the rock band network?

2158
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:09,300
I hadn't heard, but I guess it was inevitable that some of these, um, you know, video game

2159
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:11,440
related bands are going to come out through the rock band network.

2160
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:12,440
That's pretty cool.

2161
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:16,240
Also, any thoughts on Steven Tyler leaving Aerosmith?

2162
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,240
He's not going to leave Aerosmith.

2163
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,760
It's all, it's all for show.

2164
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,040
They're fighting like any family does after a while.

2165
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:24,000
He had a diva tantrum.

2166
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
He had a diva tantrum.

2167
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Exactly.

2168
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
He had a diva tantrum.

2169
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
They'll work it out.

2170
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,800
They'll probably be on break for a little while, but they'll bring it out.

2171
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:32,920
Um, they were on a break.

2172
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:37,040
The seg who we had on the show a couple of weeks ago says if you have time, review child's

2173
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:40,720
play charity and mention not only umlaut, of course we had on the show a couple of weeks

2174
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:44,520
ago, that event happening in just a few weeks at this point, God umlaut it's like a month

2175
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:49,740
away and other events like desert bus on events page at child's play.

2176
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:53,160
So yeah, this is the season for child's play, obviously the holiday season.

2177
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,840
So I'm definitely check out some of the stuff they're doing.

2178
02:23:55,840 --> 02:24:01,740
I'm just looking at this desert bus tweet, which is a desert bus D E S E R T bus on Twitter.

2179
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:03,480
It is the desert bus for hope charity.

2180
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:08,240
I wonder if this is the same thing that they did from last year where they actually sat

2181
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:12,760
and played that desert bus game on the feed.

2182
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:16,680
I guess they are desert bus.org and actually go and look at the feed and watch them play

2183
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:20,320
this incredibly boring freaking game, but it's all for a good cause.

2184
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:24,080
Why don't you play a better game for a good cause?

2185
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,080
That's my thing.

2186
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:28,040
I mean, it's like, seriously, if you're going to do it anyways, just play a better game.

2187
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:31,680
Well, I think it goes back to that whole thing, like people like to pay to watch other people

2188
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,680
be tortured.

2189
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:39,660
Well, then they should play was at that, uh, the, uh, it was a, uh, Takashi game.

2190
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:44,440
They had one member Takashi hated, uh, games and so it made it really hard.

2191
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,440
Oh yeah.

2192
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:46,440
I heard about that.

2193
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,220
Um, let's see.

2194
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:51,480
One other thing I want to say, I can't get to all the tweets and there's a lot of stuff

2195
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:53,400
mixed in here.

2196
02:24:53,400 --> 02:25:00,000
Um, Tiger Claw sends us one that says modern war, modern warfare two is banned in Russia

2197
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,200
and actually sent us a link here to a website, uh, that talks about console versions of modern

2198
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:09,780
warfare two have been banned in Russia and it's due to the content of the no Russian

2199
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:13,240
mission and that's the controversial airport massacre level.

2200
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:17,480
And uh, I guess the Russian government didn't like that.

2201
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:22,220
He's the ire of the Russian gaming public as well as some politicians.

2202
02:25:22,220 --> 02:25:27,400
That's the problem when you do games that are like loosely based on faux historical

2203
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:28,400
events.

2204
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:29,400
You know what I mean?

2205
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:30,580
Like you kind of make up these things that happen.

2206
02:25:30,580 --> 02:25:34,880
You're probably going to piss some people off, you know, whether it's fake or not.

2207
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:38,380
So um, hopefully they get all that worked out.

2208
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:41,680
Probably they'll have to release an edited version of the game if they want to release

2209
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:42,680
it there.

2210
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:46,240
Cause if the government wants to ban a game, they can.

2211
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,240
And they will.

2212
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:51,080
In Soviet Russia, I can't play you.

2213
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:54,280
All right, let's move on with some more stories here.

2214
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:57,240
Uh, Loki started us off with a story about Gran Turismo.

2215
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:02,520
Yes, Gran Turismo, the game that will just never come out and now it's just taking even

2216
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:08,440
longer because they're saying that it's being held up for marketing reasons, which is retarded.

2217
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:10,280
Just say development, okay?

2218
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:14,480
Not marketing because then that just says, oh yeah, we could release it, but we're going

2219
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:15,900
to be assholes.

2220
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:21,440
So Gran Turismo 5 will not be coming out now, um, well I guess it will be released in Japan

2221
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:23,440
March 2010.

2222
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,100
Everywhere else is kind of up in the air.

2223
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:31,360
So um, no word on when we're going to get it, but Japan will get it possibly in March

2224
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:35,280
2010 unless there's some more marketing they have to do over there.

2225
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,280
Marketing reasons?

2226
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,280
That's so weird.

2227
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:42,240
Yeah, it says, we will release Gran Turismo 5 March in Japan, but for other regions it

2228
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:45,400
has not been decided yet.

2229
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:49,920
And this is asked by a motoring magazine, what the holdup was in the western release

2230
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,240
of the game.

2231
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:59,980
That's more depending on Sony Computer Entertainment America's marketing decisions.

2232
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:04,800
What is the problem with just releasing a game and then marketing it?

2233
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,200
Like why does it have to be marketed right out the gate?

2234
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,000
Are day one numbers that critical to a game's success?

2235
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,680
Yeah, but also you have to figure that, I'm not positive if it falls with them, but at

2236
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:20,160
the same time, you know, they're going to be having God of War 3 coming out, at least

2237
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,160
in the US.

2238
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:23,600
Um, that's supposed to be sometime in March.

2239
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:30,120
So perhaps they're going to try to, you know, sandbag the next year numbers by releasing

2240
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:35,440
it in the first quarter of their financial 2010 year, or 2011, I don't know how they're

2241
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:39,840
really counting it, but um, and usually a lot of the game companies, their financial

2242
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:43,440
year starts either in April or kind of at the end of March, and that's why you'll see

2243
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:51,320
kind of a second, or I guess the first big push for games, kind of sandbagged into March

2244
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:55,080
because they're trying to pad their numbers to make their years look better, and then

2245
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:59,760
all of a sudden they'll be just a big dead lol for the rest of the summer until the fourth

2246
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,760
quarter.

2247
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:04,360
So, that's kind of probably what they're doing.

2248
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:11,720
Alright, well, uh, moving on to the games that are a lot closer to its release.

2249
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:15,840
One versus 100, of course, had its early first season happen, and then the games kind of

2250
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:18,240
disappeared for a little while, but guess what?

2251
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:22,600
Season 2 is starting November 19th at 5 o'clock Pacific.

2252
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:27,800
One versus 100 extended play begins then to get you all warmed up for season 2.

2253
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:32,440
More than a half a million people competed in the 15 week beta season, and they're trying

2254
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:35,200
to get even more people to show up for round 2.

2255
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:38,840
Extended play, I guess, is now going to have themed trivia every weeknight, although I

2256
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,360
assume they'll still have kind of some general trivia too, and then of course the more extended

2257
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:47,200
play you play, apparently you have a better chance of being picked as one of the mob,

2258
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:53,040
or even the one themselves, and you get to compete for actual prizes, woo!

2259
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:57,000
Two million Microsoft points apparently were given during the first season.

2260
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,060
No you get Microsoft Space Bucks.

2261
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:01,840
It's not really cash, but in Microsoft's world it's cash.

2262
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:04,320
It's not like Smash TV.

2263
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:05,960
So there you go.

2264
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:09,000
More money, more prizes, I love it!

2265
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,720
As much as we're kind of making fun of it now, this actually is, of sorts, kind of like

2266
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:16,840
a groundbreaking game, and I think is one of the huge things that Xbox 360 has going

2267
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:19,240
for it right now that no other system has.

2268
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:22,240
My only wish is that they would do more games.

2269
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:24,560
Like why another season of one versus 100?

2270
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:28,880
How about some like Price is Right or Press Your Luck, or I don't know, I understand

2271
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:29,880
one versus one.

2272
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:30,880
Price is Right would be so awesome.

2273
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:31,880
Amazing.

2274
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:36,000
Amazeballs, as they say.

2275
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,720
But I'll take one versus one hundred season two.

2276
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:39,120
Everybody loves a good trivia game.

2277
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:40,360
It'll be a lot of fun.

2278
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:44,480
So, Dark Sakura, any plans to join in on one versus one hundred season two?

2279
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:45,480
Nope.

2280
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:46,520
Well, fine.

2281
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:47,720
I'll play by myself.

2282
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:49,840
I have other stuff to play.

2283
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:50,840
Like what?

2284
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:55,200
Like a game that's coming out on the 8th of December over here in the US.

2285
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:56,960
Yes.

2286
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:58,840
Silent Hill Shadow Memories.

2287
02:29:58,840 --> 02:29:59,840
Woo hoo!

2288
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:07,800
Which is the Wii-make of the original PlayStation 1 with twists here and there.

2289
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:11,600
It's actually a re-imaging of the first one.

2290
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:20,080
So you can go through it with the Wii mode as a flashlight and, well, there's no combat

2291
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,200
in it.

2292
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:27,120
But the cool thing though that Climax is keeping is all the stuff that Akira Yamaoka did for

2293
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,200
the music, so that's going to be really happy.

2294
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,200
I'm just really, really looking forward to it.

2295
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:35,480
I think it's going to be fantastic.

2296
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:39,240
And it better scare the crap out of me.

2297
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:40,240
Just saying.

2298
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:44,920
It was one of the more fun demos I played at E3, so I'm excited about it.

2299
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:46,200
I saw something.

2300
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:47,520
What are you gasping at over there?

2301
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,720
On an ad for this article that made me just go, ahh!

2302
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:52,720
What?

2303
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,720
A boy and his blob!

2304
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,720
You didn't know that?

2305
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:56,720
Like a few weeks ago.

2306
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:57,720
A few weeks ago.

2307
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:58,720
I didn't know!

2308
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:02,720
And apparently no one else did either because it only sold like 9,000 units.

2309
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,160
Dude, I have to get this!

2310
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,160
9,200 actually.

2311
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:07,160
Wow.

2312
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,160
Well, it's about to be 9,201.

2313
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:11,160
Dark Soccer's very happy.

2314
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:12,160
9,201.

2315
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:13,160
Alright!

2316
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:20,600
But see, seriously though, boy and his blob, no advertising, 9,200 units, I mean we could

2317
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:22,240
easily do that with President Cat.

2318
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:27,320
This is why, again, I heard those stories about President Cat only selling 100 copies

2319
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:30,560
and I know I went off on the last show we had.

2320
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,600
I just don't believe it.

2321
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:32,600
I'm sorry.

2322
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:37,600
Like if a game like boy and his blob sells 9,200 in this country, I can't believe President

2323
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:38,940
Cat only sold 100 units.

2324
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:41,920
And by the way, there was an awesome article on Kotaku.

2325
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:45,720
I don't want to talk about President Cat every week on the show, but Kotaku did an awesome

2326
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:50,600
piece that kind of called out those sites that were showing like the pictures with nobody

2327
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:54,840
in them where you could clearly see there were barricades, so the booth just wasn't

2328
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,840
open yet.

2329
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:00,080
Fucking called those sites out by showing another picture later in the day that had

2330
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,360
a lot of people there.

2331
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:05,200
And like basically kind of saying like, well all these sites are just misrepresenting what's

2332
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:06,200
going on.

2333
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:11,720
Although, granted President Cat probably wasn't in the top 50 sales figures, well, I mean,

2334
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:14,480
I don't think any of us really thought it was going to be.

2335
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:16,920
But see the thing is though- But neither was boy and his blob, that's for

2336
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,920
sure.

2337
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,880
The people who were there, I'm sure, you know, I mean, the fact that they actually had like

2338
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:25,360
a booth and were doing signings or whatever, that's more than you can say that, you know,

2339
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:28,360
big buck hunting or buck fever is going to do.

2340
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:31,720
I mean, buck fever is going to sell a lot because people are like, oh, hunting game

2341
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:32,720
me buy.

2342
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:34,480
You know, I mean, whereas with-

2343
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:37,560
That's exactly what they say too at Walmart.

2344
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,440
Well, with like, you know, President Cat people are going to be like, oh my God, cute cat

2345
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,440
game.

2346
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:42,440
And they're going to buy that.

2347
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:43,440
And that's what's going to happen.

2348
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:49,840
And boy and his blob, they're like, uh, uh, blob, no, boy, I like boy, no, no, I don't

2349
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:50,840
like boys.

2350
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,840
That's wrong.

2351
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:52,840
You know?

2352
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:56,360
Where in the hell were you going with that, Loki?

2353
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,920
I don't even know.

2354
02:32:57,920 --> 02:32:58,920
That's funny.

2355
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:04,640
No, but you know, again, I, I, I love that they called out those sites that like, you

2356
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:07,740
know, what are you, what are you guys trying to start?

2357
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:10,460
Like really know your facts before you report on them.

2358
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:14,680
And there were some pretty big sites that were running this story that, you know, this

2359
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:21,160
big failure of a launch event or whatever, you know what, there's a lot of launch events

2360
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:25,240
that aren't going to cause lines to line up around the block.

2361
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:26,240
You know what I mean?

2362
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:27,240
That doesn't mean it was a failure.

2363
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:31,480
I'm telling you, if that game came out over here at $20, it would sell like hotcakes.

2364
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:32,480
And you know why?

2365
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:34,680
Because people consume those $20 games like nothing.

2366
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:35,680
It doesn't matter.

2367
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:37,000
Everybody fucking loves cats.

2368
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,080
It doesn't matter if it's good or not.

2369
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:41,440
Your average consumer doesn't give a shit.

2370
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:46,240
If it has cats and it looks like it has games in it, they're going to buy it.

2371
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,240
And you know what?

2372
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:52,840
If you just spend some time marketing it, um, just to even blog sites or even just,

2373
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:58,840
you know, in, in store advertisement or something like that, it would sell like hotcakes.

2374
02:33:58,840 --> 02:33:59,840
It's just the effort.

2375
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:04,040
And a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, don't put any effort out there.

2376
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:06,640
They expect everybody else to kind of just sell it for them.

2377
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:10,760
Anyway, I just want to give major props to Kotaku for calling those people out that ran

2378
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:11,940
that story.

2379
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:14,600
Think twice before you dish out your haterade, folks.

2380
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:15,920
Think twice.

2381
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:19,360
Anyhow, uh, Loki, next story.

2382
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:20,360
Yes.

2383
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:25,680
So the iPhone gets all sorts of crazy games, and there's a new one now that has you in

2384
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:29,880
the role of a firefighter called Firefighter 360.

2385
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:33,600
And it's actually kind of an augmented reality game.

2386
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:40,560
It will create fires, um, using the camera, um, on the phone actually creates fires in

2387
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:45,000
real life, but not really real fires, just it makes it look like there's fires in real

2388
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
life, you know.

2389
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,840
And you put them out, and you save, you know, digital people that happen to be, you know,

2390
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:54,840
kind of wandering around in your augmented reality fire.

2391
02:34:54,840 --> 02:35:01,400
But uh, yeah, it's kind of neat, and um, of course, it will, it's um, out already.

2392
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:05,040
And the price, you can't beat the price, 99 cents.

2393
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:09,960
That's a good, that's, the only price that's better is free, but that's, for a game is

2394
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,400
a pretty good price.

2395
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:15,780
Very strange though, so like, if I were to download this game right now, and hold out

2396
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:21,760
my phone like this, like, I would, there would be a fire on Loki, Loki would be on fire and

2397
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:26,320
I would have to put it out with my water gun.

2398
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:30,960
That's kind of strange, but I love that idea of kind of like using the iPhone camera and

2399
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:35,920
making a game out of it, even though this sounds a little cheesy, that's kind of interesting.

2400
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:40,680
I don't, like, it's interesting that more developers are thinking of how to use like,

2401
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:45,360
you know, how can we use some of these devices that are unique to the iPhone to make a game

2402
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:46,360
out of it.

2403
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:50,720
So although this game sounds a little cheesy, I think the whole idea that it exists in the

2404
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,120
first place is kind of cool.

2405
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:56,880
And someone asked, what happens when you point it at real fire, does the fire catch fire?

2406
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:57,880
Nice.

2407
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:01,840
That's crazy deep.

2408
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:06,120
That's kind of like that question about what happens when a tree falls in the woods or

2409
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:07,120
something.

2410
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,040
It goes, ah!

2411
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,680
Is that it that's going on in the iPhone world, Loki?

2412
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:18,640
Well, there's other things, and this is actually something more of Jamie's alley, though.

2413
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:24,080
R-Type is coming to the iPhone, or iPod Touch, I guess.

2414
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:33,600
It's basically, I don't know, it looks kind of neat, and they're basically collaborating

2415
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:41,000
with Irem Software Engineering, I guess the company in there put it out, and they didn't

2416
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,400
say which version it was going to be based off of, but hey, it's R-Type, it's on the

2417
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:45,400
iPhone.

2418
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:46,400
That'd be cool.

2419
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:49,720
Hopefully it doesn't control like shit, because that's a lot of the problem with these console

2420
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:50,720
ports to the iPhone.

2421
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:51,720
Yeah.

2422
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:52,720
They just control like shit.

2423
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:53,720
That is a problem.

2424
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:58,440
They just put a touch screen on the iPhone, iPod Touch, whatever, and that doesn't work

2425
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,440
for a lot of games.

2426
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:03,760
I'm sorry, but the whole like fake joystick thing sucks.

2427
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:09,040
Apple, if they want more games, they should just release something that plugs into the

2428
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,580
bottom that gives you a little controller.

2429
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:12,920
How hard would that be?

2430
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,440
How hard would that be?

2431
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:18,160
Not very, exactly.

2432
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:21,800
But then I guess the whole thought would be, well, not everybody would have one, so then

2433
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:26,400
these games wouldn't be open to everybody, da-da-da-da-da, well, you know, have like

2434
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,760
control scheme choices or something.

2435
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:29,760
I don't know.

2436
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,440
Have a detect if it's there, and use that.

2437
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:33,360
If not, it uses the on-screen thing.

2438
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:36,640
I just think gaming on the iPhone could be so much better if there were like more to

2439
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,880
control with than just the touch screen, because, you know, there's only so much you can do

2440
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:41,640
with your fat thumb.

2441
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:44,200
Trust me, I know from experience.

2442
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:47,700
Here's one game that I don't think I'll see on the iPhone anytime soon, but I just might

2443
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:51,200
see it on the virtual console, Moonwalker.

2444
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:56,040
It's actually coming out for the virtual console if the European rating PEGI site is to be

2445
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:57,040
believed.

2446
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:00,880
Of course, the rating board websites in various countries often seem to spill the beans when

2447
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:05,240
it comes to what games are soon coming out on virtual console or, you know, PlayStation

2448
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:07,200
Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and so forth.

2449
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,080
Remember back in the day when they said that the ESRB wasn't going to do that anymore,

2450
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:12,080
yet they still do?

2451
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:14,640
Now it's just the foreign websites that are doing it instead, because this is from the

2452
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,640
European websites.

2453
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:18,600
Well, anyhow, of course, Moonwalker was a pretty epic game.

2454
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:21,380
It was in the arcade and then, of course, on the Sega Genesis.

2455
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:25,440
I'm imagining that this is the Sega Genesis version that's gonna come over, but, of course,

2456
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:28,820
they do have arcade games emulatable on the Wii.

2457
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:30,280
It's going to be the Genesis version.

2458
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:31,280
Yeah.

2459
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:32,280
Because I don't think they have any Sega games.

2460
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:33,480
No, I guess...

2461
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:34,480
No, they do, actually.

2462
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:37,860
Didn't Golden Axe come out on the emulator thing?

2463
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:39,680
I think you not only can get Golden Axe on the Wii.

2464
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:40,800
I think you can get the arcade board.

2465
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:43,360
I think Golden Axe Arcade came out, on Wii.

2466
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:46,280
So it could be the arcade version, but it's probably the Genesis one.

2467
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:50,520
I think it's the Genesis one, because I think that's the one that they actually, um, had

2468
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:55,980
like it was, I don't know, it was the one that they had on their wet-listed.

2469
02:38:55,980 --> 02:39:00,180
This is gonna go the way of my Excitebike review. You'll download it, play it for ten

2470
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:04,760
minutes and go, God, Moonwalker was pretty fucking awesome, but I'm already bored of

2471
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:07,560
it, and then you'll never play it again, like a lot of virtual console games, but it won't

2472
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:14,840
matter because Nintendo and Sega have your money, haha. But, you know, Moonwalker was

2473
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:19,440
kind of neat, it was different, but I don't know if it's aged well, I think it's probably

2474
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:23,560
more of just cashing in on Michael Jackson's death, which is kind of sad, but, you know,

2475
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:30,200
a lot of people are doing it. There's a lot of money to be made in death. Anyhow, I wish

2476
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:33,780
they would just do a new Michael Jackson game though, seriously, give us like an awesome

2477
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:38,880
new music game that just uses Michael Jackson music, or Michael Jackson and Friends or something.

2478
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:44,120
So, alright, anyhow, uh, let's move on to the mailbag. I don't know if we got any emails

2479
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:47,640
tonight, I'm hoping we got at least one, because it was looking pretty empty earlier, but of

2480
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:50,720
course, then again, you know, it's our own fault, because the shows have been behind,

2481
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:55,280
but we'll go ahead and open up the mailbag anyway at mailbag.orangelauncherator.com and

2482
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,240
see if anything's come in. I did see some tweets about emails, so I imagine there's

2483
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:01,840
got to be at least one or two emails in there. So Dark Soccer's going to dive into the mailbag

2484
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:07,800
head first and read some emails for us. Yep, um, actually just one from Spazinator. Alrighty

2485
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:12,480
then. It's long. Well, it's just one. Hi folks, I was initially going to call in about this

2486
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:17,960
subject tonight, but after seeing your tweet asking for mail, I decided to email you instead.

2487
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:23,120
This email will be a first for me on your show for one single reason. You see, despite

2488
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:27,620
the fact that I've been a fan of Sony Systems since 97, I've decided that it's time to virtually

2489
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:33,280
rip Sony a new one. Suffice to say, based on that last statement, it is safe for everyone

2490
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:38,320
to assume I'm not happy with Sony right now. Not at all. And it's all due to one reason.

2491
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:44,840
Their worthless piece of motherfucking POS DRM on their movies slash video downloads.

2492
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:49,760
See the thing is, I have been sinking good hard money into that service every week for

2493
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:54,640
movies, TV shows, etc. that I had built up a decent collection, backing it all onto an

2494
02:40:54,640 --> 02:41:00,240
external HDD as I buy it all. In all, I had sunk several hundred dollars into the video

2495
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:03,980
service, while as of this past Friday, all that money went down the drain. See, here's

2496
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:08,040
the thing. I was about to launch a game and it had to update before I could play it, but

2497
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:12,840
the system froze while it was updating, requiring a hard reset. That, of course, corrupted the

2498
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:18,280
game, leaving a large unusable file on my HDD. So the kicker was, I couldn't delete

2499
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:22,120
it by highlighting it, pushing triangle, and selecting delete, thus requiring me to reformat

2500
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:27,640
my HDD to get rid of it, which I did. I started redownloading my games as per usual, and tried

2501
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:32,520
putting my video content back onto my internal HDD and watch it. Here's the so-called good

2502
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:35,640
part. I could transfer the videos back, but the DRM was all followed up and the videos

2503
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:39,960
were unplayable. As common sense would suggest, I called Sony and explained to the rep what

2504
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:43,700
happened. Unfortunately, the response I got back was less than optimal, to put it lightly.

2505
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:47,320
To paraphrase, they said I was shit out of luck and had to buy everything all over again.

2506
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:55,920
I have to say it, but this is 100% pure, unadulterated, grade A fucking horseshit. I love that term.

2507
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:59,760
On one hand, I can sympathize with the fact that they want to curtail any kind of piracy,

2508
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:04,040
which is fine, but this could have been handled very differently and in a better manner. I'm

2509
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:07,600
reasonably sure that they kept records of what each customer purchases, at least for

2510
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:12,840
their own bookkeeping purposes. Also, obviously for videos, one can only have one system activated

2511
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:17,000
at one time, so it's not like I could share these videos if I wanted to, not that I would

2512
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:21,080
mind you. Frankly, it kills me that I've been supporting them for so long and sunk so much

2513
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:25,960
money into that, in the end all, I practically get a fuck you from them and get spat in the

2514
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:31,360
face and kicked in the junk. This really is making me seriously consider becoming a rabid

2515
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:36,200
360 fanboy, so in closing, and in the event that Sony is listening to the live broadcast

2516
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:41,360
or the podcast, I have to say this, fuck you and fuck the drama initiative sharks that

2517
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:47,640
you rode in on and subsequently jumped. If Sony wants to keep me as a customer and avoid

2518
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:52,840
some serious negative PR, I seriously suggest they fix this issue ASAP. This email was brought

2519
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:58,040
to you by Sony's borked DRM, thus rendering this email unreadable. I will say one thing,

2520
02:42:58,040 --> 02:43:05,200
it's not with Sony, but with Apple. When I had to completely reboot my iPhone and lost

2521
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:11,560
everything I downloaded since, well let's see, I did it in February and lost everything

2522
02:43:11,560 --> 02:43:16,900
since November, the year before. And when I called in, because they keep a record of

2523
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:20,760
all of my purchases, I explained to them what happened, I said yeah, I was updating my iPhone

2524
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:25,320
for the first time in four months, and I was like, oh okay, well we'll just reauthorize

2525
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:30,840
everything up to the last date of your last update. And they did that, and so it was just

2526
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:35,360
those things that they set up for me to queue to re-download. Why can't Sony do something

2527
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:38,640
like that? It's fucking Sony.

2528
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:43,220
That is interesting, you know, I've not heard a lot like that. I'm kind of sitting here

2529
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:46,960
a little bit in awe because, you know, I was listening to the first half of the email,

2530
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,860
I was kind of sitting here going, well you just need to call Sony, and then they reset

2531
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:53,680
things because I think that's what Microsoft does. Granted, I don't know so much about

2532
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:59,800
the video end of things, I just know that they do that with the games, is that, you

2533
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:03,600
know, they can reset the licenses. Hell, you can do it yourself, I think once a year you

2534
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:09,240
can reset your licenses. Same thing with Apple, does something very similar. Like, you know,

2535
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:14,480
if you have to reinstall Windows or whatever, and you get five plays per account or whatever,

2536
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:18,120
you know, this is, they don't even sell music with DRM anymore anyway, they got rid of it.

2537
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:24,800
For the DRM music that you still have, you get like up to five computers, I don't know.

2538
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:29,040
Regardless, I'm kind of sitting here in shock hearing this story. This is a little bit surprising

2539
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:34,400
to me that I haven't heard this before, but granted, I don't know a lot of people that

2540
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:39,320
use the video marketplace so heavily. You know, I don't think there's a lot of people

2541
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:43,680
that are really into the digital distribution. You know, I know you've called in the show

2542
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:47,200
several times talking about various automates and stuff, so, you know, I know you're a heavy

2543
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:52,280
user of this, so this is kind of surprising to me. So, I think you've done a good first

2544
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:56,920
step by starting to get the word out there that this is going on. The way I see it, you

2545
02:44:56,920 --> 02:45:02,960
have a couple of options from here. You can call Sony back, and if you don't like the

2546
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:08,120
answer that you're getting from the rep, you can ask to speak to a supervisor. Not that

2547
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:14,100
that's probably going to do anything, but you probably want to get clarity on why. What

2548
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:20,740
is the policy? Why is it that you can't, if you legally purchase this, you know, item,

2549
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:25,680
you can't watch it? Why are they unable to reset something from their end? Maybe try

2550
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:30,200
to get a clear answer about what their policy is on it, because, you know, I'm hearing that

2551
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:36,840
the rep told you that you were shit out of luck, but I just, as a consumer activist,

2552
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:40,820
if you will, that has a podcast, I want to know a little more about the why. Why did

2553
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:46,120
they tell you that you were shit out of luck? Your other options, once you've figured that

2554
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:49,760
out, and once you have a really good solid reason and you understand their policy, you

2555
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:55,200
can do one of two things, or you can do both. You go to the Better Business Bureau and file

2556
02:45:55,200 --> 02:46:00,880
a complaint, and quite frankly, I wouldn't usually advise this, but if this is true,

2557
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:06,520
what you're saying, that Sony does say you're shit out of luck for something you legally

2558
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:11,160
purchased yourself when you had to fix something that they broke, right, he said his drive

2559
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:18,420
corrupted, right? Yeah, and he had to do a hard reset and it corrupted his game data,

2560
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:25,640
so he had to, the only way to get rid of it, because it wouldn't delete, was to reformat

2561
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:35,400
it. Or you could, and if you want, you could try to get your story out there a little more,

2562
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:38,860
once you kind of know, understand the policies a little more, email some of your favorite

2563
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:42,160
game blogs, see who might run the story, especially if you do end up sending a complaint to Better

2564
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:46,680
Business Bureau, you could see what happens. Now granted, there's also other things to

2565
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:50,600
check out here, and this is where our chat room's piping up, something very big to consider

2566
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:55,820
here. Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, but why should Sony let them play it again? A

2567
02:46:55,820 --> 02:47:00,800
store does not replace your disc if you lose or scratch it. And certainly that's a valid

2568
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:05,640
devil's advocate argument is that if you just damaged the data, you're shit out of luck

2569
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:09,580
if it were a Blu-ray disc that you dropped on the floor. It was an accident, but you

2570
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:15,520
dropped it, you broke it, you're screwed, right? This is due to their... I know, there's

2571
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:20,900
just something where I totally respect where Brad's coming from with that statement. There's

2572
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:25,840
just something about what Spazinator's saying that just doesn't sound fair to me. Isn't

2573
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:31,840
this part of the reason we do digital distribution? Yeah. Is so that I don't have a physical...

2574
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:36,600
The advantage is supposed to be that I have a digital version of it that doesn't get damaged

2575
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:41,440
the way a physical copy does. We always talk about the pros and cons about why should people

2576
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:44,920
have physical versions instead of digital versions, but we don't often talk about why

2577
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:51,360
should people have digital versions instead of physical ones. And if Sony... And again,

2578
02:47:51,360 --> 02:47:56,420
if Apple and Microsoft have these competitive DRM management schemes, then Sony should be

2579
02:47:56,420 --> 02:48:07,680
taken to task for having one that is less than ideal, I suppose. So, very interesting.

2580
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:11,640
I don't know what else to think of this. I would say call back, talk to a supervisor.

2581
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:18,560
If you can't hear from a supervisor, get their complaint address and write them a letter.

2582
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:24,100
Make sure also when you talk to their people that you document names, what time you called.

2583
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:30,300
You want to know who you spoke to, who their supervisor is. You want to record all of that

2584
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:34,240
because the next step after writing them a letter is if you get nothing from that, go

2585
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:39,960
to the Better Business Bureau. And for the... I just would like to know what is their policy?

2586
02:48:39,960 --> 02:48:43,560
And you know, I could go onto Sony's website and actually read the little blah, blah, blahs

2587
02:48:43,560 --> 02:48:46,360
and probably figure it out for myself. I don't have time to do that while trying to do a

2588
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:49,960
live radio show, but I would kind of like our listeners to try and figure that out for

2589
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:53,640
the next week and maybe we'll see some emails on that. What exactly is their policy when

2590
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:58,460
it comes to this stuff? Just the whole your shit out of luck response. I mean, I'm a customer

2591
02:48:58,460 --> 02:49:01,960
service trainer. That's not the type of thing you tell a customer ever is that you're shit

2592
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:07,520
out of luck. There's always something that you... Even if that something is, here is

2593
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:11,640
our complaint address if you don't like the policy. This is our policy and if you don't

2594
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:15,480
agree with it, here's an address to complain about it. That is better than, well, fuck

2595
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:22,040
you. You know what I mean? Just what I'm hearing, just as the customer service trainer in me

2596
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:23,720
is crying a little bit. So...

2597
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:29,360
Well, no. And keep in mind, you know, I used to take escalated calls at my work. So I used

2598
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:34,360
to talk to all the pissed off people. And I know that there's something that can be

2599
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:38,880
done. If you want to keep someone's business... Because keep in mind, this is... I don't know.

2600
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:42,840
I'm going into a little bit of the world of business and maybe this is something you can

2601
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:49,840
use, Rob. We actually remember going through a couple of training seminars that were called

2602
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:57,460
a complaint as a gift. And was talking about for every eight people who get a bad... No,

2603
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:04,980
for every eight people that have a bad experience, at least two of them will talk about it. Two

2604
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:08,680
of them will talk to eight more people. You know what I mean? And they'll keep passing

2605
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:14,800
it around by word. For every, I think... I've heard the same thing, just not with numbers.

2606
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:17,720
I think the numbers always seem to change. But you know what I mean? That principle.

2607
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:22,200
But you're also going to run into the person who is an activist. The person who's going

2608
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:24,640
to take the initiative and get up and write the letter.

2609
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:31,460
The Jamie. Well, you know, I actually adopted that whole attitude after taking that seminar.

2610
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:38,460
And I'll tell you this, if any place has given me bad service for any reason, if I know specifically

2611
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:43,520
that yeah, they haven't done things that they should do, I will say something about it.

2612
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:48,520
Because if no one says anything about it to the company, how are they going to know to

2613
02:50:48,520 --> 02:50:54,600
fix it? How are they going to know that maybe so-and-so rep screwed up until you call them

2614
02:50:54,600 --> 02:51:00,600
on it? You know? I think there's not enough people who call other people on their bullshit.

2615
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:05,360
And to be fair, if I know we have had people that work for... We have been mentioned on

2616
02:51:05,360 --> 02:51:11,040
the official Sony PlayStation 3 Twitter before. This show. On the official Twitter. Yes. Because

2617
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:17,400
we've had friends that work at Sony. So please, by all means, Sony, the floor is yours. If

2618
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:22,420
we are misrepresenting these facts, if this emailer had a bad experience and needs to

2619
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:27,840
be corrected, please contact us. You know how. There's many different ways to do it.

2620
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:33,440
State your side of the case. If we are misrepresenting you, we want to make it right. But on the

2621
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:36,160
other hand, if your policy sucks, we also want to call you out on it. Sorry, but that's

2622
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:42,800
what we do. So, by all means, let's hear both sides of the story. Okay. That's pretty much

2623
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:49,760
what I was getting to next, is that there's always two sides of the story, but again,

2624
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:53,560
they don't know the situation exists until it's brought to their attention. Right. And

2625
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:58,000
this could, unfortunately, be just a bad experience with the customer service rep. And if that

2626
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:08,360
is their policy, this could be a step to changing it. Who knows. We'll see. But Spaznator, don't

2627
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:11,640
necessarily just stop with this, I think. But if you do write a letter, make sure you

2628
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:16,580
actually write a letter. Don't do it over email. Emails get lost, deleted, and are harder

2629
02:52:16,580 --> 02:52:20,360
to trace. Trust me. You can type it on a computer, but just send it to the good old fashioned

2630
02:52:20,360 --> 02:52:27,680
post office. You'll thank me later. Okay. Anyhow, that was actually a really good email.

2631
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:33,120
So is that it for mailbag, then, for now? That's the one and only. All right. Well,

2632
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:37,360
mailbagorangeonstrader.com. That was a good email. It was a good discussion. So mailbagorangeonstrader.com,

2633
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:41,400
if you want to, and he always gets through on the phone, so I'm sure he's going to call

2634
02:52:41,400 --> 02:52:47,460
in later to talk about it. So it'll come up again later, I'm sure. But it was an interesting

2635
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:53,560
discussion, and I would be very curious to see, and if you run a game blog out there,

2636
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:57,880
I'm too lazy to do this, so here you can take this story and just say it was inspired by

2637
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:02,860
this show, okay? Throw us a bone. I would like to see the DRM policies of the various

2638
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:07,800
companies side by side. I would like someone to make that nice little chart that says,

2639
02:53:07,800 --> 02:53:12,480
here's what it is with Microsoft. Here's what it is with Nintendo for their limited video

2640
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:16,000
service in Japan, which I think they have. Here's what it is for the US. I would like

2641
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,560
to see that kind of side by side so the consumer can be better informed going into this. I

2642
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:27,440
would like to kind of see that. Anyhow. I agree. All right, let's get into the FUs of

2643
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:33,800
the week, and I was supposed to have a story, and I neglected to link it, so I've got to

2644
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:38,280
bring it up real quick. So FU starts to me for not being prepared tonight. You know what,

2645
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:43,080
we'll do this a little bit out of order tonight because I am so terrible and broken tonight.

2646
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:47,080
We'll do our FUs first, and then I'll read the inspiring story tonight.

2647
02:53:47,080 --> 02:54:03,080
This is fun. All this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is... This is fun.

2648
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:15,320
This is soccer. My FU goes to pissy attitudes. That's it. Loki. FU to the stores that think

2649
02:54:15,320 --> 02:54:20,680
that it's necessary to break street to compete with GameStop and other stores. You just suck

2650
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:32,360
and make my job harder. My FU just goes to the swine flu. I mean, really. Need I say

2651
02:54:32,360 --> 02:54:35,160
more? You heard the first 20 minutes of tonight's show.

2652
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:39,960
Finally, we found that story that's supposed to inspire tonight's FUs. You remember this

2653
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:44,440
came from a couple weeks ago. Do you remember hearing about the raid where the police guys

2654
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:48,520
busted into the house and started playing the Nintendo Wii during the raid?

2655
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,520
No.

2656
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,680
Maybe this was the show you weren't here because you did miss a show or two because you had

2657
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:56,500
other things going on. There was actually police that broke into a house and started

2658
02:54:56,500 --> 02:55:02,180
playing the Wii that was there. Just seriously, really? You're professionals and you're sitting

2659
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:08,920
there playing the Wii or whatever on the job. Well, apparently what happens is that as punishment

2660
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:14,360
did these officers get fired? Did they get suspended without pay? No. They're going to

2661
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:19,500
have to go through some retraining. The officers even, those names are being withheld because

2662
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:24,280
they are undercover police and the company is saying they are learning from their mistakes.

2663
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:27,840
So in other words, these officers that were screwing around playing the Wii on the job

2664
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:33,640
got a slap on the wrist and are getting sent back to training. And as a trainer, you know

2665
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:36,800
what, I, you know what? No, for the sake of separating my job from this, I'm not going

2666
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:41,560
to get into it, but there's, there's certain things about that excuse that really strike

2667
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:43,640
a nerve with me and that's all I can say.

2668
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:49,880
Well, I'll put this, well then I will talk about my experience as a person who is required

2669
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:53,760
to take a certain number of training classes a year. I think that they're just going to

2670
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:56,560
be more inconvenienced than anything else to go to a class to learn stuff that they

2671
02:55:56,560 --> 02:56:00,520
already know. Because there's a difference between knowing something and caring enough

2672
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:05,860
to put it into practice. That's my point. It's just going to be, oh, we have to sit

2673
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:12,280
in the class for a day. You know.

2674
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:15,840
There is so much I want to say, but can't. I just can't. I'm sorry.

2675
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:17,420
Say after the show so you can get it out.

2676
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:20,200
After the show, I would love to share it with you personally, but I can't talk about it

2677
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:24,560
on a platform where people, I don't know who has access to it and who could share it with

2678
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:26,600
who, but there's just so much I could say about it.

2679
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:30,880
I will say this though, and I will tell you this out of, because I do know our trainers

2680
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:37,820
and I know the hard work that they put into it. That's why I usually at least pay attention,

2681
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:39,880
but all of them know I already know it.

2682
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:42,160
But do you think these guys are going to sit there and pay attention?

2683
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:43,160
Probably not. They're dicks.

2684
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:47,080
So this is probably a waste of everyone's time, right?

2685
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:48,080
Yeah.

2686
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:51,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some other stories.

2687
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:55,120
I don't think playing a Wii is cause for suspension, but still.

2688
02:56:55,120 --> 02:57:00,280
At the same time though, like really, you're there to do a job.

2689
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:03,680
I think the bad press for the police itself.

2690
02:57:03,680 --> 02:57:04,680
Is punishment enough, I suppose.

2691
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,040
Might be bad enough, yeah.

2692
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:11,080
I suppose. All right, Loki.

2693
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:16,520
All right. Anyways, so this is kind of cool, because of course, you know, huge Grand Theft

2694
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:26,880
Auto fan. Grand Theft Auto IV for the PC just recently got an update to, I believe, live.

2695
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:30,760
The games for Windows Live also kind of got an update as well.

2696
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:36,560
And with that, the download content for The Lost and Damned, the achievements are showing

2697
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:40,320
up now on Game for Windows Live.

2698
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:42,640
So that can only mean one thing.

2699
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:48,060
That the download content that once was exclusive to the Xbox 360 is coming to PC.

2700
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:50,880
And that makes sense, because if you think about it, Microsoft paid to have that download

2701
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:55,000
content made, or at least paid for the exclusivity.

2702
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:01,200
Games for Windows is still Microsoft, so perhaps we will see both episodes eventually released

2703
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:06,280
for the PC, and probably sooner than later.

2704
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:07,280
That's pretty sweet.

2705
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:11,000
Sorry, PC, or PS3 owners, no word on that.

2706
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Interesting.

2707
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Interesting.

2708
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,640
Although, it could open the door to that, possibly?

2709
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:16,640
Not necessarily.

2710
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:19,720
I mean, they could literally port this in a heartbeat.

2711
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:25,880
I mean, everything that's on there, it's a multiplatform anyways.

2712
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:30,400
It could be ported, like, seriously super quick, because they already have the hardware

2713
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:31,400
done.

2714
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:32,400
I mean, the engine's already done.

2715
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:34,720
They don't really have to change too much.

2716
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:37,280
But they're just not gonna, because they're under contract.

2717
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:45,200
And especially if, you know, $50 million does, that kind of buys some time, I should say.

2718
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:47,400
It probably will never make it over to the PS3.

2719
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:51,120
Well, dudes, I got one more story for you.

2720
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:53,120
Dudes, do you like Barbie?

2721
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:58,840
Of course you do, because how else is the Xbox Live Marketplace selling Avatar clothing?

2722
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:00,900
Because that's basically what it is.

2723
02:59:00,900 --> 02:59:03,360
It's Barbie for dudes.

2724
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:05,400
And dudettes, of course, too.

2725
02:59:05,400 --> 02:59:09,000
But hey, some people like to buy these clothes and dress their own little character and buy,

2726
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,160
you know, the Malibu Beach backgrounds and whatever else you can get on Xbox Live Marketplace.

2727
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:17,200
Pretty soon, you're going to be able to get from the Avatar Marketplace Assassin's Creed

2728
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:18,200
2 gear.

2729
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:23,960
That's right, 28 awesome outfits for your Barbie avatar, both girly and boy versions

2730
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:25,740
in Barbie and Ken models.

2731
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:29,540
You can get Renaissance masks, hats, wristbands, and so forth.

2732
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:33,040
But if you want the really great stuff, the guard armor, the Altair outfit, you know,

2733
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:37,120
like the deluxe Barbie evening gown wear, I'm sorry, the Assassin's Creed 2 equivalent

2734
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:40,220
of that, that'll cost you 400 Microsoft points.

2735
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:42,880
That's five bucks, just so you know.

2736
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:48,020
Also of interest, a DaVinci's flying machine, if you want to get that, 240 Microsoft points

2737
02:59:48,020 --> 02:59:49,020
for that.

2738
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:50,020
Well, that's also from Assassin's Creed 2.

2739
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:51,020
I actually kind of want that.

2740
02:59:51,020 --> 02:59:52,800
Yeah, I know.

2741
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:53,800
I don't know.

2742
02:59:53,800 --> 02:59:55,280
I kind of, you know what, I can see...

2743
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:57,520
Also, the DJ Hero stuff.

2744
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:00,440
I can sit here and make fun of this stuff a little bit.

2745
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:02,400
You know, granted, I'm no better.

2746
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:06,880
I spent $10 on a Warcraft pet this week, so I'm really no better.

2747
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:11,640
But I do find this stuff to be a little silly, and even I can admit, what I did was silly

2748
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:16,800
too, but I just think this whole, like, buying for your virtual costume, when a lot of games

2749
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:21,360
don't even really use them, I mean, I guess a few do, like Guitar Hero does and stuff,

2750
03:00:21,360 --> 03:00:25,000
maybe more will next year or what have you, but pretty soon it's all gonna be in a tall,

2751
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,940
so you will be in the game anyway, not your avatar.

2752
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:29,840
So I don't know.

2753
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:34,680
Whatever, though, there you go.

2754
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:42,320
Anyhow, some folks in chat are complaining that the stream has died, but I am seeing...

2755
03:00:42,320 --> 03:00:47,200
Oh, we did drop for a minute, but we're reconnected now and we're good, so I guess the stream

2756
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:48,200
did drop for a minute.

2757
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:50,280
I don't know what happened there.

2758
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:51,280
Technical glitch.

2759
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:52,280
It happens.

2760
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:53,280
Don't know what to do.

2761
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:54,280
I was downloading all that porn.

2762
03:00:54,280 --> 03:00:55,280
Sorry, Rob.

2763
03:00:55,280 --> 03:00:56,280
There you go.

2764
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:57,640
Knew it.

2765
03:00:57,640 --> 03:01:01,920
And again, live folks, keep in mind, there's not a lot we can do when the stream goes down.

2766
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:05,560
It does usually tend to come back right away, so our biggest advice to our live listeners

2767
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:08,640
would be just wait patiently 30 seconds and reload.

2768
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:09,800
You usually won't miss too much.

2769
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:13,880
You just miss me making jokes about how the Xbox Live Marketplace is like Barbie for dudes.

2770
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:14,880
That's all.

2771
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:15,880
All right.

2772
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:16,880
You didn't miss much.

2773
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:17,880
All right.

2774
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:23,040
Let's get into the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can give us a call, username Orange

2775
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,860
Lounge Radio on Skype.

2776
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:25,860
Go ahead and give us a call.

2777
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:30,240
Speaking of technical difficulties, I hate the new Skype.

2778
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:34,280
If you've been listening the past few weeks, Skype got a makeover the last couple of months,

2779
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:35,280
and I hate it.

2780
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:38,320
I miss the old one so, so, so much.

2781
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:41,280
I miss the first version of Skype we used several years ago.

2782
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:45,560
I would see everybody that was calling in, so everybody would have a fair shot of being

2783
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:49,380
on the show, because I could actually pick callers that I didn't recognize were calling

2784
03:01:49,380 --> 03:01:51,480
in, and you'll rotate it a little bit.

2785
03:01:51,480 --> 03:01:53,560
I don't even get that now in Skype.

2786
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:56,320
Now Skype likes to randomly drop calls and do all this stuff.

2787
03:01:56,320 --> 03:01:58,200
I just hate it.

2788
03:01:58,200 --> 03:01:59,200
But we're going to go to the phones anyway.

2789
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:00,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2790
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:01,200
Who's this?

2791
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,200
We all hate it.

2792
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:03,200
Hey.

2793
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:04,200
What up?

2794
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:05,200
This is X-Link calling from Melbourne, Florida.

2795
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:06,200
Hey, X-Link.

2796
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:07,200
How are you doing?

2797
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,200
What's on your mind, buddy?

2798
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:09,200
Oh, I'm doing great.

2799
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,520
Wonderful knowing there are cops spending their time to say catching criminals playing

2800
03:02:10,520 --> 03:02:11,520
Wii bowling.

2801
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,320
Was that in your neck of the woods that that happened?

2802
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:14,320
No.

2803
03:02:14,320 --> 03:02:15,320
It didn't happen around me.

2804
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:18,600
It happened in a different part of town, but it's great to know that these wonderful cops

2805
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:22,640
who get sworn to duty have nothing better to do than raid a house and play Wii.

2806
03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:24,660
And the fix is more training.

2807
03:02:24,660 --> 03:02:25,660
Is the fix.

2808
03:02:25,660 --> 03:02:26,660
Yes.

2809
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:27,660
Yes.

2810
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:29,600
Not suspension, not getting fired, but more training.

2811
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:33,400
Because clearly, they were not trained properly the first time.

2812
03:02:33,400 --> 03:02:34,400
Yes.

2813
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:36,240
This is how you bowl a 300 game in Wii.

2814
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:41,240
So the responsibility falls upon the trainers of the company to do the... Never mind.

2815
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:42,240
Go ahead.

2816
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:43,240
What's on your mind?

2817
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:44,240
Excellent.

2818
03:02:44,240 --> 03:02:46,880
Anyways, I called because I want to call about a PSP game that recently came out, but before

2819
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:50,240
I do that, Spazinator, quick tip.

2820
03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:58,920
I don't know why he couldn't have a copy hooked up his PS3 to the PC or through his PSP and

2821
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:04,500
then copy it onto his PC, because every time when I get something new from the... Downloaded

2822
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:09,440
from the place in the store, I always try to make a copy available on my hard drive

2823
03:03:09,440 --> 03:03:14,840
just in case if something would happen or crash, I would have that backup as a storage

2824
03:03:14,840 --> 03:03:19,560
to go into and re-put on like my game saves and stuff like that, so that way I don't have

2825
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:23,120
to end up starting over and losing a lot of stuff.

2826
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:27,400
Also in the game store, on the top right-hand corner, they have an area where it called

2827
03:03:27,400 --> 03:03:28,400
View Downloads.

2828
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:29,960
It's right next to the checkout.

2829
03:03:29,960 --> 03:03:34,680
You hit it once, and it usually gives a download list of the last few things you have recently

2830
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:36,080
downloaded from the store.

2831
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:39,680
Now, I don't understand why he could go in there and re-download the stuff again.

2832
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:41,680
I think that's what he said he did.

2833
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:42,680
Yeah.

2834
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:45,340
I think in the email, he talked about doing some of that, but for some reason, whenever

2835
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:48,320
it happened, he was still locked out of it.

2836
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:51,120
I think it had something to do with the flush of his hard drive he did.

2837
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:56,840
It's like it reset his console ID or something, which seems very strange.

2838
03:03:56,840 --> 03:03:57,840
That's kind of a weird situation.

2839
03:03:57,840 --> 03:03:58,840
Yeah.

2840
03:03:58,840 --> 03:03:59,840
It's very weird.

2841
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:04,120
That's why I'm kind of sitting here going, whereas I think Spaznator has some very valid

2842
03:04:04,120 --> 03:04:05,120
concerns.

2843
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:06,320
I feel like there's a piece of the puzzle.

2844
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:10,880
I need to hear Sony's policy on this because I feel like that piece is missing, and we

2845
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:14,200
might be misrepresenting their policy a little bit, and I don't want to do that either.

2846
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:17,200
I don't see why he could do it as long as he has his ID and everything.

2847
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:19,240
I don't see whether there would be a problem with it.

2848
03:04:19,240 --> 03:04:21,320
I'm very curious to see how this further develops.

2849
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:22,320
I think he'll do it.

2850
03:04:22,320 --> 03:04:24,120
I think he'll follow up on it and let us know.

2851
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:25,120
I think he will.

2852
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:26,800
Well, I had an interesting situation kind of earlier on.

2853
03:04:26,800 --> 03:04:27,800
I'm trying to make this quick too.

2854
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:28,800
Sure.

2855
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:32,320
I bought Mass Effect a while back for the PC, and unfortunately, I didn't have the CD

2856
03:04:32,320 --> 03:04:37,960
code, though I could have easily gone on a torrent and got a CD, no CD fix and stuff

2857
03:04:37,960 --> 03:04:38,960
like that.

2858
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:41,560
I really wanted to have it legalized.

2859
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:49,560
I actually went through the EA website, talked to somebody through the chat, which was absolutely

2860
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:50,560
horrid.

2861
03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:53,840
The guy told me just to call the manufacturer and get a key from them, which I don't think

2862
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:57,040
he understood that it wasn't a download.

2863
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:03,240
So I ended up calling the long-distance phone number for the tech support, was put on hold

2864
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:05,560
for 20 minutes, got through to a guy.

2865
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:07,920
The guy was very nice, very civilized.

2866
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:13,280
I explained to him very nicely my problem and explained to him about it, and we went

2867
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:14,280
through all the steps.

2868
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:19,320
He told me, he sent me an email, he said on the email, he goes, go to this page, he goes

2869
03:05:19,320 --> 03:05:24,280
with your response, and he goes, send up some photos of the booklet and show the fact that

2870
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:26,840
you didn't get a CD key.

2871
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:31,500
Did it, and the very next day, another person from the tech support sent me a CD key so

2872
03:05:31,500 --> 03:05:34,960
I can actually have a legit version of my game, which was very cool, instead of paying

2873
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:38,880
like 10 or 20 bucks for a CD key for it.

2874
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:41,000
I'm glad to hear this good customer service story.

2875
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,800
You know, it's kind of too bad you had to be on hold for 20 minutes long-distance.

2876
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:49,120
You know who else, though, has great customer service in my experience, Blizzard, because

2877
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:53,840
you know my WoW account got hacked a couple months ago, and that was not a pleasant experience,

2878
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:58,040
but once I finally got through to their freaking customer support, they were very helpful.

2879
03:05:58,040 --> 03:06:00,560
I just need to hire more of them.

2880
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:01,560
Yeah.

2881
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:07,080
But that's good that you had a good experience with EA, you know, sometimes amongst all these

2882
03:06:07,080 --> 03:06:10,920
crappy customer service stories, it's good to hear some good things, and plus, tough

2883
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:11,920
times at EA right now.

2884
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:15,440
I don't know if this affected their customer service division, but they had a huge workforce

2885
03:06:15,440 --> 03:06:16,440
layoff.

2886
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:19,480
I think that happened in the week that we missed, and I know some people that were personally

2887
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:24,360
affected by that, and it's, as always, layoffs are never any fun to talk about, so certainly

2888
03:06:24,360 --> 03:06:28,560
our thoughts go out to those that were affected.

2889
03:06:28,560 --> 03:06:34,800
I'm not at liberty to say specifically people I know that were affected by it, but some

2890
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:40,520
names you might remember from the shows yesterday year, so it's very unfortunate, and we hope

2891
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:41,520
for the best for our fans.

2892
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:42,520
Definitely.

2893
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:46,160
I know one or two from the Tiburon, but like you said too, I'm not going to mention any

2894
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:47,160
names either.

2895
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:48,160
Yeah.

2896
03:06:48,160 --> 03:06:51,280
Obviously, we want to respect their privacy and wish them the best of luck, because layoffs

2897
03:06:51,280 --> 03:06:52,520
are never any fun.

2898
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:53,880
Most definitely.

2899
03:06:53,880 --> 03:06:56,920
I've been playing a game for the pinball.

2900
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,680
It's the Pinball Heroes.

2901
03:06:58,680 --> 03:07:02,400
It's the $3.99 one that recently came out on the PlayStation Network.

2902
03:07:02,400 --> 03:07:03,400
It's a very good game.

2903
03:07:03,400 --> 03:07:04,400
It's $3.99.

2904
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:05,400
Pinball.

2905
03:07:05,400 --> 03:07:06,440
I like it very much.

2906
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:13,200
The only problem I had with it was the fact that for each of the tables, it's $3.99,

2907
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:18,120
but it has a great scoring system.

2908
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:19,360
It keeps a little achievement.

2909
03:07:19,360 --> 03:07:23,680
I think there's trophies you can get for it too if you hook it up to the PS3 through

2910
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:27,720
their trophy system.

2911
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:33,560
It keeps on scoring not only for local when you play the PlayStation, but also you can

2912
03:07:33,560 --> 03:07:37,600
go against other people from around the globe that has the game on the network.

2913
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:43,920
It will upload your score and go against other people's score, which is very awesome.

2914
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:46,640
The only problem I had with it was the multi-ball.

2915
03:07:46,640 --> 03:07:53,160
The screen would zoom outward, and the table would get much smaller.

2916
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:56,940
When it's done, it will zoom back in, but if you're in multi-ball and you really have

2917
03:07:56,940 --> 03:08:01,520
a hard time seeing, I can see that being a part of a problem, seeing the little balls

2918
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:04,320
and the guys that go around and hit stuff.

2919
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:06,600
Other than that, I've been having a lot of fun with it.

2920
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:09,320
For a four-hour game, it's not that bad.

2921
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:14,600
Well, we appreciate the perspective and all that, so I'm going to go ahead and let you

2922
03:08:14,600 --> 03:08:16,120
go though so we can get some more calls.

2923
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:17,120
No, no problem.

2924
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:20,840
You had a hometown buffet of stories tonight, but I like it.

2925
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:25,840
I like hearing all the different stuff, so some reviews and customer service goods and

2926
03:08:25,840 --> 03:08:26,840
bads all rolled into one.

2927
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:27,840
I just thought it was ironic.

2928
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:31,520
It was this whole customer service thing, and then I had the customer service this week,

2929
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:32,520
so.

2930
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:33,520
There you go.

2931
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:34,520
All right.

2932
03:08:34,520 --> 03:08:35,520
Thank you, Gil.

2933
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:36,520
Take care, and hey, have fun on World of War crack.

2934
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:37,520
Thank you.

2935
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:38,520
I appreciate it.

2936
03:08:38,520 --> 03:08:39,520
Thank you for that crack.

2937
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:40,520
Hey, you're welcome.

2938
03:08:40,520 --> 03:08:41,520
You're welcome.

2939
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:42,520
I'm going to win myself out of it.

2940
03:08:42,520 --> 03:08:43,520
Good luck.

2941
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:44,520
All right.

2942
03:08:44,520 --> 03:08:46,560
That was X-Link here on Orange Launch Radio.

2943
03:08:46,560 --> 03:08:48,560
We'll take a couple more calls.

2944
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:54,200
I'm sorry, 1877 Game O-L-R. You think I know our own freaking phone number by now, but

2945
03:08:54,200 --> 03:08:55,200
apparently I don't.

2946
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:57,680
Let's go to the phones and see what's on the line.

2947
03:08:57,680 --> 03:08:58,680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2948
03:08:58,680 --> 03:08:59,680
Who's this?

2949
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:01,680
It's Legend of Zaku right here.

2950
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:02,680
Legend of Zaku.

2951
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:03,680
What's on your mind?

2952
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:04,680
Oh, nothing much.

2953
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:05,680
Just chilling in my new MacBook.

2954
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:09,880
Actually, I wouldn't say new MacBook, but new refurbished MacBook.

2955
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:13,560
Zaku, you're the type of guy that's into modern warfare, right?

2956
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:14,560
Well, yeah.

2957
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:21,520
And I mean, I would play it if they had dedicated servers on the PC, then I would have justification

2958
03:09:21,520 --> 03:09:23,120
to spend money on it.

2959
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:26,840
Oh, so you're one of the protesters that is actually protesting.

2960
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:27,840
Yes.

2961
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:29,720
I mean, I have the money right now.

2962
03:09:29,720 --> 03:09:33,920
Even if I didn't have the money, I wanted to see how this would play out first, just

2963
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:39,040
so I could see how this new matchmaking would work on the PC.

2964
03:09:39,040 --> 03:09:43,640
And lo and behold, it was just like the 360, it was like the console versions.

2965
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:48,160
Well, props to you sticking to your guns and actually meaning it and actually sticking

2966
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:50,100
to the cause.

2967
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:53,520
Can you try to explain to me, though, I don't want to make you go against your protest,

2968
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:56,760
but what is the allure of modern warfare 2?

2969
03:09:56,760 --> 03:10:02,000
Let's assume for a minute, make believe, none of this crap with the servers is going on.

2970
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:07,160
Why is it so big that people line up to get it?

2971
03:10:07,160 --> 03:10:09,160
It's almost like the Halo effect.

2972
03:10:09,160 --> 03:10:15,600
Have you ever seen how the subsequent Halo releases, like Halo 2 and 3, and you see people

2973
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:20,200
lining up for midnight launches, it's kind of that.

2974
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:26,760
When you have a game that manages to develop a big following on the first type of game,

2975
03:10:26,760 --> 03:10:33,240
the first non-World War II game in the Call of Duty franchise, and yet that game managed

2976
03:10:33,240 --> 03:10:42,600
to get Halo numbers for its sequel, which it took a Bungie 3 just to get that amount,

2977
03:10:42,600 --> 03:10:49,480
whereas Infinity War just got it on the second try, because it was a surprise hit.

2978
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:55,560
No one would have thought Modern Warfare would outdo the whole Call of Duty series.

2979
03:10:55,560 --> 03:10:57,200
That was completely unexpected.

2980
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:05,080
I guess I'm understanding a little more, because I actually got Halo 3 the day it was released.

2981
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:08,760
You know I'm not that great at first person shooters, especially Halo, but even I bought

2982
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:09,760
into it a little bit.

2983
03:11:09,760 --> 03:11:11,560
I was a little excited about Halo 3.

2984
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:18,880
I bought Halo 3 just for shits and giggles, because I had my 360 back then, but to be

2985
03:11:18,880 --> 03:11:21,080
honest, I never got into the campaign mode at all.

2986
03:11:21,080 --> 03:11:27,040
I was just trying to do multiplayer, because I don't play shooters on consoles.

2987
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:30,760
I just play it with the keyboard and mouse, a bit old-fashioned.

2988
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:36,240
Alright, but to summarize though, you still say though that folks shouldn't get Modern

2989
03:11:36,240 --> 03:11:41,080
Warfare 2, at least not on the PC, until they address what the fans want.

2990
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:46,560
In other words, basically if they want a good single-player experience with the keyboard

2991
03:11:46,560 --> 03:11:52,240
and mouse, then by all means they should buy it, but you have to really stick to your guns

2992
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:59,960
if you really want to wait out until if any war decides to come to their senses and release

2993
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:07,720
something for the community that it apparently backstabbed when killing off the dedicated

2994
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:08,720
servers.

2995
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:12,180
You know buddy, I'm sure I don't even have to ask, but what about this rumor that they

2996
03:12:12,180 --> 03:12:16,880
might allow the dedicated servers later on for more money?

2997
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:22,120
Well that depends on whether or not that actually comes to fruition, whether or not it's just

2998
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:25,760
a rumor, so you'd rather take it with a grain of salt.

2999
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:29,280
What I heard recently was that the hackers managed to outdo them already.

3000
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:35,320
They already had dedicated server support and the console, the little console that you

3001
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:39,720
hit whenever you press the tilde key on the keyboard, just like any other first-person

3002
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:40,720
shooter.

3003
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:44,880
Now you have the hackers managed, you know, someone managed to hack the game and add console

3004
03:12:44,880 --> 03:12:48,080
support, dedicated server as a proof of concept.

3005
03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:49,080
No surprise, none.

3006
03:12:49,080 --> 03:12:50,080
None.

3007
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:53,520
In the hacker community, when they set out to do something, they fucking do it.

3008
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:55,720
So I have to say I'm not surprised at all.

3009
03:12:55,720 --> 03:13:02,440
But basically, you know, it won't be that long before Vinny Ward gets steamed to add

3010
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:08,400
that in the blacklist for their back, and then all the folks that run the hacked version

3011
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:09,400
get banned.

3012
03:13:09,400 --> 03:13:11,560
Um, Zaku, I know you may not have called in.

3013
03:13:11,560 --> 03:13:13,520
I made you kind of talk about Modern Warfare 2.

3014
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:16,680
I don't know if that's originally why you called in tonight, but before we let you go,

3015
03:13:16,680 --> 03:13:20,120
I wanted to let you get out whatever you wanted to actually call in and talk about tonight.

3016
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:26,840
Oh, man, I'm trying to basically play DJ Hero for the first time last night, under the influence

3017
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,840
of alcohol.

3018
03:13:27,840 --> 03:13:32,480
It was a little bit, you know, it's a little bit of a transition, since I'm more of a 2DX

3019
03:13:32,480 --> 03:13:35,960
kind of guy, but, you know, it's gonna take a while.

3020
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:42,440
I mean, I don't see it as a game I would normally play on my own, just because it has, most

3021
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:45,000
of the songs are of a genre that I don't listen to.

3022
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:51,000
I mean, there are some good ones, you know, the stuff that with Tiesto and Paul Van Dyke,

3023
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:56,920
for example, and even the, you know, Tears for Fears and Pajamas, like, you know, mixed

3024
03:13:56,920 --> 03:13:57,920
up.

3025
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:59,880
But it's really not like 2DX at all, is it?

3026
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:04,480
Of course, it is, of course, I kind of see it that way, because it's basically, in this

3027
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:09,440
game you actually scratch and you actually move a crossfader, so I guess in a sense Activision

3028
03:14:09,440 --> 03:14:10,840
made it more realistic.

3029
03:14:10,840 --> 03:14:12,240
Yeah, it's different.

3030
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:15,760
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the call, as always,

3031
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:16,760
and take care, okay?

3032
03:14:16,760 --> 03:14:17,760
Have a good one.

3033
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:18,760
Later, you too.

3034
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:22,840
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to get in, maybe we'll

3035
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:23,840
take, like, one more call.

3036
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:27,560
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

3037
03:14:27,560 --> 03:14:31,880
Not really, but here's what I got.

3038
03:14:31,880 --> 03:14:35,320
They're gonna be doing possibly, well, there was a possible spinoff they're talking about

3039
03:14:35,320 --> 03:14:40,200
doing for Modern Warfare, starring, and I had to laugh because the character's name

3040
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:45,720
is Ghost, so it'd be like a Modern Warfare ghost, kind of like Starcraft Ghost, but

3041
03:14:45,720 --> 03:14:46,720
not.

3042
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:47,720
But not.

3043
03:14:47,720 --> 03:14:48,720
Anyways.

3044
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:49,720
Hey, we got a phone call.

3045
03:14:49,720 --> 03:14:50,720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3046
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:58,760
Good evening, OU across the ocean, OU in the land of the free, or so we'll just say.

3047
03:14:58,760 --> 03:15:02,000
The state that falls into the ocean in 2012, that's where we are.

3048
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,400
Oh, well, what the hell?

3049
03:15:03,400 --> 03:15:04,400
We're all dead.

3050
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:06,640
Oh, hello there, OLR, this is that one, Aki Ripper.

3051
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:09,920
But John Cusack survives, so the hell with the rest of us.

3052
03:15:09,920 --> 03:15:12,640
Aki Ripper, it's been forever since we've heard from you.

3053
03:15:12,640 --> 03:15:14,640
What is on your mind, buddy?

3054
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:17,600
Ooh, what's on my mind?

3055
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:22,480
Once again, I've given a reason, actually, to buy a Wii, since, well, I saw footage of

3056
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:28,640
that new Super Mario Brothers, and, well, since I still actually haven't bought a Wii,

3057
03:15:28,640 --> 03:15:36,720
even though I actually have, like, four games, four, actually already have four games, so...

3058
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:40,600
Wait, so you already have the games, but you just didn't have the Wii?

3059
03:15:40,600 --> 03:15:41,600
Yeah, exactly.

3060
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:42,600
Wow.

3061
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:46,800
That's kind of the backwards way of doing it, but okay.

3062
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:51,600
It really was, like, I love that point of, like, there was, like, this plenty of games

3063
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:58,820
that I'm really interested in, but I don't have the, I either choose to buy the console

3064
03:15:58,820 --> 03:16:04,920
and have no games, or buy the games or have no console.

3065
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:07,560
That's why you're the crazy Swedish guy, that's no problem.

3066
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:15,520
But oh well, I'm like the, it's, once again, it's quite fun in a way, since I'm the kind

3067
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:17,880
of collector in a way, and...

3068
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:19,200
That's cool, though, that's cool.

3069
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:20,200
Let me ask you, though...

3070
03:16:20,200 --> 03:16:23,040
And having things on my shelf is like a bonus.

3071
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:25,820
Let me ask you, though, about new Super Mario Brothers, because obviously the game just

3072
03:16:25,820 --> 03:16:26,960
came out over here today.

3073
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:30,960
I was actually kind of surprised, I haven't touched the game myself yet outside of my

3074
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:35,840
short experience with it at E3, and, you know, you don't judge a game based off an E3 build,

3075
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:40,600
but I'm kind of surprised, because of course the gaming community did a little bit of backlash

3076
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:45,020
with the game, with the whole easy button, you know, stuff that's going around, although

3077
03:16:45,020 --> 03:16:48,040
we've talked a little more about how that's actually integrated into the game, and it

3078
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:50,460
kind of sounds like it might be interesting.

3079
03:16:50,460 --> 03:16:54,080
But the other thing, I was looking at some of the Metacritic scores for this, the game's

3080
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:55,720
getting glowing reviews.

3081
03:16:55,720 --> 03:16:58,960
The game is probably going to end up on people's top ten lists when all is said and done at

3082
03:16:58,960 --> 03:17:02,720
the end of the year, many critical websites are giving it A-pluses.

3083
03:17:02,720 --> 03:17:10,800
The reason I'm basing, in a way, though, the video I saw was on Giant Bomb, and they were

3084
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:22,160
playing four-player co-op, and that looked hilarious fun, really, so that had me stoked

3085
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:23,720
for it.

3086
03:17:23,720 --> 03:17:27,440
When I actually have three of my friends come over to play video games, it'll be great.

3087
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:31,880
But my only concern is is single-player mode fun, too?

3088
03:17:31,880 --> 03:17:36,880
Because sometimes I have to play video games by myself, in fact, that's most of the time.

3089
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:44,080
Here's another thing, in a way, though, is that the following week, in a way, though,

3090
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:51,200
if I get my Wii, I will still be busy, in a kind of way, with the new Sims 3 expansion.

3091
03:17:51,200 --> 03:17:52,920
I'm right there with you on that.

3092
03:17:52,920 --> 03:17:55,400
You are not alone in this studio with that.

3093
03:17:55,400 --> 03:17:59,520
And now, one question, though, do you have President Cat sitting on your shelf?

3094
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:03,400
No, I don't, unfortunately, not yet.

3095
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:15,320
And speaking of which, since we have a mod-friendly one around your block, so to say, and I was

3096
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:25,720
wondering, is it, since I heard about the 360 bannings and such, well, I own a 360,

3097
03:18:25,720 --> 03:18:31,200
but I have no plans whatsoever on shipping that one, but I was thinking about getting

3098
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:37,240
a shipped, getting a flashed or shipped Wii.

3099
03:18:37,240 --> 03:18:42,040
Is that like any, how does that work out, so to say?

3100
03:18:42,040 --> 03:18:47,320
Loki, do you recommend people do this to their Wiis, or is this a risk you don't want to

3101
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:48,320
take, or what?

3102
03:18:48,320 --> 03:18:54,400
There's mods now that, seriously, it's, you open the Wii up, and you have to have a tri-wing

3103
03:18:54,400 --> 03:18:57,040
screwdriver to do that, but that's easy to get.

3104
03:18:57,040 --> 03:19:00,800
They have it now where you literally unplug the ribbon cable from the CD-ROM drive, plug

3105
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:04,140
that ribbon cable into the mod board, plug the other ribbon cable that's from that mod

3106
03:19:04,140 --> 03:19:07,520
board to the back of the CD drive, put it all back together, and you're done.

3107
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:08,520
Why the old Saturn ones?

3108
03:19:08,520 --> 03:19:11,560
Yeah, I mean, it's, some of them are that easy now.

3109
03:19:11,560 --> 03:19:14,680
But you're still avoiding your warranty, and you still have to open up your Wii, and you

3110
03:19:14,680 --> 03:19:16,000
might break the whole damn thing.

3111
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:17,840
I mean, there is still that little chance.

3112
03:19:17,840 --> 03:19:21,040
It's very unlikely that you will break it up, especially when you're not soldering it.

3113
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:26,640
I have to solder my chip in, and from a person who can't solder for shit, soldering hair-thin

3114
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:30,900
wires on there, I'm surprised it works still.

3115
03:19:30,900 --> 03:19:34,200
But it does, and if I can do it, then anybody can do it.

3116
03:19:34,200 --> 03:19:39,160
So yeah, seriously, a new board, so they have some that literally will just plug in, and...

3117
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:40,160
Was it worth it?

3118
03:19:40,160 --> 03:19:46,080
I mean, you have to step away from the I-did-it-because-I-can mentality for a little bit to, you know,

3119
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:47,080
absolutely.

3120
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:48,080
Absolutely.

3121
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:49,080
Interesting.

3122
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:58,320
Yeah, well, and once again, well, the clarification whatsoever, I'm not really interested in pirating

3123
03:19:58,320 --> 03:19:59,320
games.

3124
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:01,920
Well, it's still, you can do it for like, you know, playing Regent Freestyle.

3125
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:03,640
I couldn't play President Cap.

3126
03:20:03,640 --> 03:20:10,360
When you do such a thing, from my point of view, is to buy imports.

3127
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:13,480
Yeah, like I said, I played President Cat on it.

3128
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:16,840
I also, back in the day, I imported, you know, Smash Brothers before it came out.

3129
03:20:16,840 --> 03:20:18,160
Sorry, you had the Japanese Smash Brothers.

3130
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:19,160
You had, uh...

3131
03:20:19,160 --> 03:20:23,560
Yeah, I remember that when you premiered that on, what was it, Uprade?

3132
03:20:23,560 --> 03:20:26,000
No, it wasn't Uprade, it was Justintv or something.

3133
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:29,160
It was either our Ustream at the time, or no, I'm sorry, we've never been on Ustream.

3134
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:32,080
We actually have a Ustream channel, we just never used it.

3135
03:20:32,080 --> 03:20:34,160
It's Justintv, or what was before that?

3136
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:35,160
It was...

3137
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:36,160
Op11.

3138
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:37,160
Op11.

3139
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:38,160
That's the one.

3140
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:40,040
All Games was all up on that channel for a while.

3141
03:20:40,040 --> 03:20:43,960
We, you know, being the supportive affiliate we are, got in on that too for a little while,

3142
03:20:43,960 --> 03:20:45,840
but then I guess they just kind of disappeared.

3143
03:20:45,840 --> 03:20:49,120
I haven't heard anything about Op11 in forever, so.

3144
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:53,480
I did hear something that came out, speaking of All Games, just like completely randomly

3145
03:20:53,480 --> 03:20:54,480
off the cusp.

3146
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:57,520
I don't know how many of you guys follow Scott on Twitter, but I saw like a random tweet

3147
03:20:57,520 --> 03:21:02,760
this week that they've got some facility again in Southern California.

3148
03:21:02,760 --> 03:21:04,840
That's exciting.

3149
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:07,780
I wonder, I don't know what plans that is for the network.

3150
03:21:07,780 --> 03:21:13,280
We usually find out about that stuff after it's already set in motion, but certainly

3151
03:21:13,280 --> 03:21:16,240
when I read that tweet, I was like, oh, that's pretty exciting for them, because I kind of

3152
03:21:16,240 --> 03:21:24,360
miss having that spot to, you know, just the best E3 I still think was the year that we

3153
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:26,480
had the arena and that whole thing going on.

3154
03:21:26,480 --> 03:21:30,520
I don't know about you guys, that was my favorite E3, was just getting, I mean, it was also

3155
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:33,360
the one where we probably worked the hardest and were the most tired afterwards, but just

3156
03:21:33,360 --> 03:21:37,680
getting to kind of all convene afterwards with the other podcasters, very much like

3157
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:42,960
us in that really fun, almost frat house kind of place that I'm sure just lost somebody

3158
03:21:42,960 --> 03:21:49,360
a shitload of money, poor Ron, but God damn, it was fun while it lasted.

3159
03:21:49,360 --> 03:21:54,520
So anyway, sorry, got a little off the tangent there, but it was worth mentioning.

3160
03:21:54,520 --> 03:22:01,600
Well, what more, well, what more, um, well, it's been released like more than a few games

3161
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:08,480
around and I'm still haven't, I have barely in a way though installed Dragon Age and played

3162
03:22:08,480 --> 03:22:11,800
it for like two minutes in a kind of way.

3163
03:22:11,800 --> 03:22:15,720
I don't know how it did make the show roll tonight, but I heard about the gay sex in

3164
03:22:15,720 --> 03:22:19,980
Dragon Age and the lesbian sex and all this stuff and I saw the sex with an animal or

3165
03:22:19,980 --> 03:22:20,980
something in that.

3166
03:22:20,980 --> 03:22:28,080
What, what, no, seriously, no, no, no, no, no, what, what, not follow up my big story

3167
03:22:28,080 --> 03:22:33,120
about gay sex in a video game that's not completely tacky with, Oh, by the way, you can also have

3168
03:22:33,120 --> 03:22:34,320
sex with an animal.

3169
03:22:34,320 --> 03:22:37,360
You sound like a prop eight supporter right now.

3170
03:22:37,360 --> 03:22:38,840
You sound like, sorry, go ahead.

3171
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:39,840
Sorry.

3172
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:40,840
No, I'm kidding.

3173
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:41,840
I'm just, I don't have anything else.

3174
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:45,720
Let me, let me finish up with AKA Ripper, then we'll talk about Dragon Age.

3175
03:22:45,720 --> 03:22:48,200
What were your thoughts before I brought sex into it?

3176
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:49,960
What were your thoughts on Dragon Age?

3177
03:22:49,960 --> 03:22:55,840
Uh, it looks really nice and, uh, well, you don't need a super computer to actually run

3178
03:22:55,840 --> 03:23:02,560
it since, well, uh, I run it on mine and that one isn't, that one is all a bit, actually

3179
03:23:02,560 --> 03:23:09,320
a bit old, so, but well, but in a way also, uh, my other computer actually being in a

3180
03:23:09,320 --> 03:23:16,560
kind of, or my primary gaming rig blew up the other, the other, the other month, and

3181
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:21,080
uh, well, I had to replace it and well, I'm up and running once again, so, oh well.

3182
03:23:21,080 --> 03:23:24,720
I have heard glowing reviews on Dragon Age though, a lot of people really into this game.

3183
03:23:24,720 --> 03:23:26,840
In fact, I've almost wanted to pick it up.

3184
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:34,840
Once I get the time to play it, it will probably be good, but the, but for, for the, for, uh,

3185
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:39,720
I was being stupid actually the other day, the other week also, since I actually bought

3186
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:41,480
Borderlands 2.

3187
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:47,000
So I have, so I now have plenty of games and in a way though, I'm not playing anything

3188
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:48,160
kind of.

3189
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:49,160
You sound like Loki.

3190
03:23:49,160 --> 03:23:50,160
That's me.

3191
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:51,160
All right.

3192
03:23:51,160 --> 03:23:52,160
Okay, River, we got to let you go.

3193
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:56,040
So we wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling in as always and best of luck

3194
03:23:56,040 --> 03:24:00,320
with obtaining the Wii and, uh, getting, getting your gaming rig up and going again.

3195
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:01,320
Okay.

3196
03:24:01,320 --> 03:24:02,320
Yeah.

3197
03:24:02,320 --> 03:24:03,320
Thank you.

3198
03:24:03,320 --> 03:24:04,320
All right.

3199
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:05,320
Later, dude.

3200
03:24:05,320 --> 03:24:06,320
All right.

3201
03:24:06,320 --> 03:24:07,320
We're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.

3202
03:24:07,320 --> 03:24:08,320
Sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but, um, of course you can always send us

3203
03:24:08,320 --> 03:24:11,520
an email if you didn't get through mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or of course we're

3204
03:24:11,520 --> 03:24:16,360
on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash O L R. Um, real quickly with last minute stories,

3205
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:19,440
I don't know if you had anything else, Loki, but I just want to say about dragon age, I,

3206
03:24:19,440 --> 03:24:24,920
I did see the scene on YouTube and you know, I like, I like what they do, not just the

3207
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:26,240
man on man, but the woman on woman.

3208
03:24:26,240 --> 03:24:28,840
I saw them both or whatever and I just liked it.

3209
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:33,480
It's just kind of there and it's a little bit cheesy, but then again, sex and video

3210
03:24:33,480 --> 03:24:34,480
games is cheesy.

3211
03:24:34,480 --> 03:24:35,480
Well, I'm not positive about the animal.

3212
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:38,720
I read that a long time ago when they're covering it and I'm like, what?

3213
03:24:38,720 --> 03:24:40,400
I haven't seen a YouTube on that.

3214
03:24:40,400 --> 03:24:41,400
I have like fable.

3215
03:24:41,400 --> 03:24:43,920
That sounds like some fable would do.

3216
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:44,920
Yeah.

3217
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:45,920
Anyhow.

3218
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:47,720
No, I just, it was funny anyway.

3219
03:24:47,720 --> 03:24:52,440
Um, but in, in the end I'm not going to buy a game just because it has gay sex in it.

3220
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:54,080
I want to buy like a good game.

3221
03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:59,240
So, um, it looks like it might actually be, I'm hearing really good things on it.

3222
03:24:59,240 --> 03:25:03,000
It's a good game that has gay sex.

3223
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:04,000
It's win win.

3224
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:05,000
All right.

3225
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:06,640
Do you have any of the last minute stories for us?

3226
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:07,640
No, not really.

3227
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:08,640
Not anything I ever want to cover.

3228
03:25:08,640 --> 03:25:13,800
Um, I got a text message from a buddy of mine that I guess would qualify as the last minute

3229
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:17,880
story who went and saw 2012 yet again, all these people going to see 2012.

3230
03:25:17,880 --> 03:25:19,280
I know I don't get it either, Jamie.

3231
03:25:19,280 --> 03:25:20,520
I don't get it either.

3232
03:25:20,520 --> 03:25:26,480
But um, Prince of Persia movie trailer from Disney looks fantastic, even better than 2012

3233
03:25:26,480 --> 03:25:27,480
itself.

3234
03:25:27,480 --> 03:25:30,000
Full theater cheered for it.

3235
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:31,100
That's stupid.

3236
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:36,240
No one cheers for 20 or for Prince of Persia.

3237
03:25:36,240 --> 03:25:39,640
I would cheer if they actually are making a decent video game related movie of which

3238
03:25:39,640 --> 03:25:44,240
I hear Prince of Persia just might be for it might be seen that, that just struck me

3239
03:25:44,240 --> 03:25:46,840
as interesting though, that, that the theater would cheer for a trailer.

3240
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:47,840
You're right.

3241
03:25:47,840 --> 03:25:52,520
You don't hear about that a lot when it's not Harry Potter or um, you know, one of those.

3242
03:25:52,520 --> 03:25:53,520
So sure.

3243
03:25:53,520 --> 03:25:56,680
They weren't cheering for like the new moon trailer or something like that.

3244
03:25:56,680 --> 03:25:57,680
Maybe they were cheering.

3245
03:25:57,680 --> 03:25:59,380
Maybe it was Jake Gyllenhaal fans.

3246
03:25:59,380 --> 03:26:00,380
Maybe that's what it was.

3247
03:26:00,380 --> 03:26:03,720
You know, I don't write the news.

3248
03:26:03,720 --> 03:26:04,760
I just report it.

3249
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:05,760
There you go.

3250
03:26:05,760 --> 03:26:06,760
All right.

3251
03:26:06,760 --> 03:26:07,760
Yeah.

3252
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:12,520
And we have folks in chat that agree Prince of Persia does look awesome.

3253
03:26:12,520 --> 03:26:13,960
I I'm interested in the movie.

3254
03:26:13,960 --> 03:26:14,960
Of course.

3255
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:17,600
I, I like Jake Gyllenhaal, but you know, I'm also interested in the movie.

3256
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:19,400
It just looks like it might be pretty good.

3257
03:26:19,400 --> 03:26:20,400
So we'll see.

3258
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:21,400
All right.

3259
03:26:21,400 --> 03:26:22,400
All right.

3260
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:23,400
All right.

3261
03:26:23,400 --> 03:26:24,400
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, I guess.

3262
03:26:24,400 --> 03:26:25,400
Start to wrap things up.

3263
03:26:25,400 --> 03:26:28,760
I'm assuming Dar Sakura doesn't have any, uh, last minute stories, but I will give her

3264
03:26:28,760 --> 03:26:36,040
her chance to make the final thought blue and what a deep final thought that was.

3265
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:37,040
Yeah.

3266
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:43,400
Loki, your final thought tonight, um, shopping around, shopping around, what are you shopping

3267
03:26:43,400 --> 03:26:44,400
for?

3268
03:26:44,400 --> 03:26:51,720
Just looking at stuff, stuff, porn, porn, all right, and we'll have to 300 and nine

3269
03:26:51,720 --> 03:26:53,400
and one jam a card.

3270
03:26:53,400 --> 03:26:55,280
He's trying to find you a burger time, Rob.

3271
03:26:55,280 --> 03:26:56,920
No, it's all right.

3272
03:26:56,920 --> 03:27:00,640
And my final thought for the night is I do want a main cabinet.

3273
03:27:00,640 --> 03:27:01,640
I think.

3274
03:27:01,640 --> 03:27:02,640
I think, I think I want one.

3275
03:27:02,640 --> 03:27:03,640
So I can play this.

3276
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:07,560
I want to play miss world, new 96 and my own convenience, whatever.

3277
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:09,240
That would be the game I would play too.

3278
03:27:09,240 --> 03:27:10,240
You know it.

3279
03:27:10,240 --> 03:27:11,440
That's going to be the first game I fire up on that.

3280
03:27:11,440 --> 03:27:16,120
The 309 and one card has miss world, new 96 on there.

3281
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,120
Amazing.

3282
03:27:17,120 --> 03:27:18,400
I'm surprised it's even included on there.

3283
03:27:18,400 --> 03:27:19,400
What is that?

3284
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:21,120
Is that a, it's a, it's a card.

3285
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:22,120
Is that a super gun?

3286
03:27:22,120 --> 03:27:23,120
No, no, no.

3287
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:27,920
I was thinking about building a super gun out of it or building a bar top out of it.

3288
03:27:27,920 --> 03:27:34,040
It's basically a, um, Shamma card that has like four gigs worth of games on there.

3289
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:37,840
Um, like including all the fighting games and all the beat them ups and stuff like that.

3290
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:43,280
But for some reason they also have miss, miss nude world 96 on there and I'm not sure why,

3291
03:27:43,280 --> 03:27:45,280
but everybody move your body.

3292
03:27:45,280 --> 03:27:47,680
I'm just like, Oh, Rob would like that.

3293
03:27:47,680 --> 03:27:48,680
But yeah.

3294
03:27:48,680 --> 03:27:49,680
All right.

3295
03:27:49,680 --> 03:27:50,680
Anyhow, that's it.

3296
03:27:50,680 --> 03:27:52,120
That's going to do it for another week here at orange launch radio.

3297
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:54,320
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.

3298
03:27:54,320 --> 03:27:58,960
Even when we are not always punctual with either the podcast or just being here because

3299
03:27:58,960 --> 03:28:02,320
we get sick or what have you, but we do appreciate the support of our fans.

3300
03:28:02,320 --> 03:28:04,880
I was actually checking out the listener accounts tonight.

3301
03:28:04,880 --> 03:28:08,000
We actually had a lot of people listening earlier on in the first hour, you know, before

3302
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:09,360
people start to go to bed and so forth.

3303
03:28:09,360 --> 03:28:13,040
So, um, thank you guys so much for that and for your continued support of our show.

3304
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:14,040
We really appreciate it.

3305
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:16,000
We'll continue to be here for you guys and be free.

3306
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:21,140
All we always ask is, um, just tell somebody you know about the show, help spread the word.

3307
03:28:21,140 --> 03:28:22,140
It's word of mouth.

3308
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:24,020
That's what helps an independent podcast survive.

3309
03:28:24,020 --> 03:28:28,200
We don't have marketing dollars or, um, you know, advertisements in magazines or billboards

3310
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:30,360
or any of that fun stuff or E3 booths.

3311
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:34,680
So please, please continue to tell friends and spread the word about not only what we're

3312
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:37,760
doing here on orange launch radio, but what the all games network is doing.

3313
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:40,880
Because if you hate our show, you might like one of the other ones on the network might

3314
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:43,480
be talking about the games that you're interested in hearing.

3315
03:28:43,480 --> 03:28:44,800
It's a win-win situation though.

3316
03:28:44,800 --> 03:28:48,660
I'm continuing to grow independent podcasting because we tell it like it is.

3317
03:28:48,660 --> 03:28:54,460
So we'll be back to do it all again next week, barring any outbreaks of, um, malaria or something

3318
03:28:54,460 --> 03:28:55,460
here in studio.

3319
03:28:55,460 --> 03:28:57,840
So, uh, we'll see you guys next week.

3320
03:28:57,840 --> 03:29:27,800
Until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.

3321
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:28,880
Probably right.

3322
03:29:28,880 --> 03:29:29,880
Anyway.

3323
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:58,880
See you next week.
