0	19820	Tonight, November 1, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth
19820	24220	version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video
24220	25220	game?
25220	35440	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35440	36440	Radio.
36440	41320	We are that video game show dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture
41320	43520	and the gamer lifestyle.
43520	48240	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me for the next few hours with my lovely co-host, Dark
48240	49640	Sakura Jamie Summers.
49640	50640	Hi.
50640	51640	How are you Jamie?
51640	53320	I'm the voiceless wonder.
53320	58680	Yes, for those not aware from last week, because the podcast is a little bit behind right now,
58680	62360	Dark Sakura is a little bit sickly with sinus infection, right?
62360	68680	I'm getting over sinus infection and also, what the hell?
68680	71360	I know, I hear video gaming noises coming out of the front row.
71360	78080	Oh, yeah, it's Dan's playing GTA, whatever, and I also sprained my ankle last night.
78080	79080	Dope.
79080	80280	It has not been a lucky day.
80280	82240	Well, I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.
82240	84280	Yeah, it was cookies.
84280	85840	Yay, cookies.
85840	86840	And now you're here.
86840	90080	So hopefully, remember, the last time you were feeling like shit was the night the President
90080	92040	Cat thing happened, huge.
92040	93040	So you never know.
93040	94560	It might be a good night.
94560	97320	Yeah, that was, oh, you were in a bad mood before that show started.
97320	99840	No, I was, I was, I had a bad headache.
99840	102160	Yeah, but see, President Cat made it all better.
102160	103160	Yeah.
103160	104160	All right.
104160	105960	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.
105960	106960	Hello.
106960	107960	How you doing, Loki?
107960	108960	Doing good.
108960	109960	Good to hear it.
109960	110960	How was your Halloween?
110960	116280	Yeah, I was going home and passed out candy to children coming to our door, mostly older
116280	118320	kids that really shouldn't be trick or treating.
118320	126000	I mean, like, people that look like they were 16 to 19, you know, it's like, dude, seriously?
126000	128120	And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.
128120	131320	It's like, where's this country coming to?
131320	137240	I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.
137240	146160	This is, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.
146160	147160	Nice.
147160	152640	Well, it sounds like, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.
152640	155680	Like I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and
155680	158440	live journals and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.
158440	161440	You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick or treating anymore.
161440	165780	And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know, like, I even know when I was growing
165780	169200	up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor.
169200	172880	And before we were allowed to eat it, we had to sift through it to make sure there were
172880	173880	no needles in it.
173880	178040	Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but nevermind.
178040	183800	I think that I want to make chocolate molds that look like razor blades.
183800	184800	You're sick.
184800	185800	But funny.
185800	186800	I know.
186800	187800	I am very...
187800	190240	Because, really, who puts razor blades in chocolate anyway?
190240	194040	I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill Haunted House, which I know we
194040	196000	were talking about at length on the show previously.
196000	198560	You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to...
198560	202160	Well, I mean, I'm just saying that the Haunted House is probably crap.
202160	207080	Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've
207080	211160	talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.
211160	215760	They went to the Haunted House, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay, if
215760	217120	this thing is back...
217120	220800	I would play the voicemail on air if I could, if I could figure out how to wire up my iPhone,
220800	222080	but she wouldn't care.
222080	227320	But she basically said, okay, Rob, if this thing comes back next year, I will pay for
227320	232120	you to go and go through this Haunted House just to see your reaction.
232120	236600	Because if Mel almost crapped himself, I can't wait to see what your reaction is.
236600	240060	I'm kind of abridging what she said there, but that's essentially what she said.
240060	242640	So apparently, it was pretty scary.
242640	243640	So and...
243640	244640	YouTube.
244640	246280	I bet there are clips on YouTube.
246280	249080	You should check that out, Dark Soccer, see if you can find some clips of the Haunted
249080	250560	House on YouTube.
250560	253760	And maybe if the YouTube makes me scream like a little girl, I can only imagine what the
253760	255320	real Haunted House would do.
255320	256320	So...
256320	260500	Anyhow, we also are always joined by our chat room, chat.orangelaundrator.com.
260500	263960	If you're listening live for the first time or what have you, please join our chat room.
263960	266240	And we have a comment from Tiger Claw.
266240	267240	I was a kid.
267240	270800	I used to be into Halloween, but as I got older, I started questioning the legitimacy
270800	271800	of the holiday.
271800	272800	And I try...
272800	277060	You know, personally, I try not to look into Halloween too much as to like, I realize it
277060	281880	has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in, but I'm just like,
281880	282880	it's just kind of a...
282880	285200	Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.
285200	288760	Like, I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.
288760	291680	But you know, it's just a day to be silly and have fun.
291680	293720	You know, wear a costume, have fun.
293720	297840	What are they letting these like pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.
297840	303480	It's like, whoa, hey, what, did you decide to go with slut?
303480	305280	I mean, it's just...
305280	306280	It's ridiculous.
306280	308080	Well, also, I don't know.
308080	311720	I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think like it's a way that you
311720	316560	can actually do cosplay like legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.
316560	320240	Like that's kind of what Halloween is, right?
320240	327000	My last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.
327000	328960	Awesome.
328960	332000	Last night I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show because of course that is like the holy
332000	333480	holiday for Rocky Horror.
333480	337600	I wore a Snuggie as my costume and it was actually very well received.
337600	339560	So that's all I wore, was a Snuggie.
339560	343480	I wore a Snuggie and no pants and I got cheers from ladies in the front couple rows.
343480	344480	It was great.
344480	345480	Awesome.
345480	346480	Yeah, I had a good time.
346480	347480	Anyhow.
347480	350140	Oh, did you find some YouTubes?
350140	353280	That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called
353280	355200	a fag as well.
355200	356200	This is true.
356200	362880	In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually like came home from Target and I actually
362880	363880	showed my roommate.
363880	367200	And by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the
367200	370120	Snuggie to my roommate and I'm like, look, look what I got, look what I got.
370120	371120	He's like, you fag.
371120	374760	No, he didn't really say that, but that was like his reaction pretty much.
374760	381400	So anyhow, also we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube it looks like.
381400	383240	So you find the good stuff.
383240	386160	I can't, I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.
386160	388160	You should find the camera's too shaky.
388160	391240	See if there's a motion sick, see if there's a scary pyramid head or something.
391240	392960	If you manage to make it that far in.
392960	393960	All right.
393960	398080	Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with How Was Your Gaming Week?
398080	401320	We always like to start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
401320	405720	And Dark Sakura, I know you're trying to watch the movie there, but real quickly, did you
405720	408360	play anything this week you want to share?
408360	414080	I played Loom and then I remembered how long it was and I stopped playing and I downloaded
414080	417640	Team Fortress 2 for three bucks.
417640	419800	I guess a lot of people got in on that sale.
419800	421560	Too bad I was out of town.
421560	424120	I was mad.
424120	432720	And I actually didn't play any Sims and I watched Dan play some of the Palette of Gay
432720	433720	Tony.
433720	437480	It was interesting.
437480	440360	I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto IV sitting at home.
440360	441360	How depressing is that?
441360	442360	You dork.
442360	443960	I know.
443960	446600	Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years and I just kind of like,
446600	447760	eh, I'm too busy playing WoW.
447760	448760	Oh, oh, oh.
448760	449760	Yes?
449760	453840	Um, I actually played some Rock Band last night.
453840	455120	Good times.
455120	456120	I miss Rock Band.
456120	458960	It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end
458960	459960	of the year.
459960	460960	Promise.
460960	462440	Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.
462440	463440	So.
463440	464440	Uh, Loki.
464440	465440	I can bring over my Rock Band.
465440	468440	No, don't encourage me because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need
468440	469440	to get mine fixed.
469440	470440	Loki will bring Rock Band.
470440	471440	He's an enabler.
471440	472440	All right, yes, you're an enabler.
472440	473440	Well, Loki, the enabler.
473440	474440	How was your gaming week?
474440	479520	Speaking of which, I was actually, um, well, it looks neat.
479520	483060	I mean, cause it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted
483060	485800	set or something.
485800	489000	Oh, they're getting scared.
489000	491200	I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.
491200	493720	That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.
493720	494720	What is that?
494720	497360	Oh, it's, I think it's a fan.
497360	499960	This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.
499960	501240	I think he fell.
501240	502240	Oh, whatever.
502240	504240	Yeah, this is crap.
504240	507320	If, if Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.
507320	508960	Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?
508960	514040	All right, so I picked up Lego Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock
514040	516000	Band 2.
516000	517520	The track list is pretty cool on it.
517520	522160	I like a lot of stuff that's in there, so it's gonna be fun to actually be able to put
522160	523920	it all into Rock Band 2.
523920	528960	And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you
528960	532760	know, Lego stuff running around and the story modes kind of need to have little cut scenes
532760	536280	and stuff that you expect from like another Lego Telltale game.
536280	541080	I don't know, it's just pretty much what you expect.
541080	546640	But the track list is awesome, so I'd say pick it up for that reason only.
546640	553840	Then, of course, you know, because this week we had the Ballad of the Gay Tony come out,
553840	558600	of course I picked up Episodes of Delivery City.
558600	562880	And the game's pretty sweet.
562880	565720	I like a lot of the stuff they added in there that's really over the top.
565720	568360	The new weapons are pretty nice.
568360	574480	But Rockstar has this thing that they like to do where they take something that was working
574480	578120	absolutely perfectly and then they go and fuck it up.
578120	582800	They did this with, you know, Lost and Dan where they took out the helicopters in free
582800	583800	mode.
583800	588280	Well, they decided, hey, you know what, multiplayer's kind of fun, let's go ahead and fuck with
588280	589440	that some more.
589440	590440	So what did they do?
590440	595320	They went ahead and they took all the multiplayer maps, which used to be pretty wide open.
595320	600480	I mean, you'd get to pick different parts of the island, you can drive around, I mean,
600480	601480	it's really overworld.
601480	605120	It's kind of what, you know, Grand Theft Auto's known for.
605120	609760	And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it
609760	615120	where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know,
615120	621040	big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections
621040	623700	of the map that weapons will spawn now.
623700	628480	So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your death
628480	629480	matches in.
629480	634360	Which, it's great if they wanted to add that in if you were looking for, you know, some
634360	636560	tighter places to play at.
636560	641980	But give the option to the buyer, to the consumer, instead of just replacing all the perfectly
641980	644720	good spots with these really small areas.
644720	648440	Now we've gotten, like, one area that we're kind of used to now that's at the bottom of
648440	654360	the map and, like, construction area, but it still pisses me off, though, because that
654360	657400	was one of the things we were really looking forward to is driving around, you know, in
657400	662760	the new APC, you know, possibly using new helicopters in Deathmatch, you know, parachutes,
662760	663920	all that fun stuff.
663920	668900	But you can't because you're stuck in these really small little confined areas instead.
668900	674280	And that's really the only downside I see to the whole Lost in Dam- or not Lost in Dam,
674280	679920	the Ballad of Gay Tony, is that they really fucked up, you know, Deathmatch for that stuff.
679920	684020	But hey, if you like more confined area and you don't really want to use vehicles because
684020	689000	you sure as hell can't in these sections of the map, it'd be really hard to get a vehicle
689000	692360	in there, then that's going to be something that you'll look forward to.
692360	696680	But you know, personally for me, I like more of the open world stuff, I like driving around,
696680	700320	shooting people from cars, and that kind of stuff, but you can't really do that with this
700320	701540	new expansion.
701540	705680	So if you are looking for better multiplayer experience, go Lost in Dam, they're the original
705680	706680	game.
706680	710680	Other than that though, it's pretty sweet, all the new weapons are awesome, they even
710680	716460	add some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super
716460	720080	punch which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.
720080	721080	Falcon Punch?
721080	722580	Something like that.
722580	725060	But it's great with the super punch that you can kick people in the nuts and they kind
725060	730380	of fly into the air, so that's pretty sweet.
730380	736020	And then yes, people have already started modding the game and stuff, and hopefully
736020	741760	if I know, or if I figure it out, I will fix multiplayer so that I can actually, you know,
741760	743760	spawn where I want to and whatnot.
743760	746880	But it's a lot of work, and right now we're just kind of making do.
746880	749520	But seriously, why do they have to go and fuck that shit over?
749520	750520	They always do this.
750520	753120	They don't fix the stuff that needs to be fixed, and then they fix stuff that doesn't
753120	754120	need to be fixed.
754120	759920	So that's it, that's, oh and DJ Hero, I played a little DJ Hero this week.
759920	764400	Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene though,
764400	765400	lol.
765400	768800	Is that, and that's from chat.orangetonstrator.com if you're just joining us tonight.
768800	771260	Join us in our chat room.
771260	774720	Is there controversial something something going on in the new expansion, or are we just
774720	775720	all desensitized to it now?
775720	777880	No, I think, I don't think it's anything new.
777880	782920	I mean, it's a way I think he's talking about, there's, you can, if you dance well enough
782920	786360	I guess in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them
786360	787360	in the bathroom.
787360	788400	It doesn't show anything.
788400	790300	Just like real life, amazing.
790300	791300	Just like real life, yes.
791300	792300	Only if you're a politician.
792300	793300	It doesn't really show anything.
793300	796980	It's just as censored as, say, the original game.
796980	802960	It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all, but it's just something funny.
802960	804860	And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.
804860	809500	You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.
809500	815740	That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex, but I think
815740	820120	if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.
820120	822560	Just saying.
822560	824760	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
824760	827640	Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.
827640	831400	Yeah, I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.
831400	832400	No, I'm just kidding.
832400	834440	They're all like 30 years old.
834440	837360	How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?
837360	838360	I don't know.
838360	839360	All right.
839360	840360	I'm not going to go buy them.
840360	841360	I mean, come on.
841360	844000	Although you were trying to tell me to buy a cabinet earlier this week.
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	846000	It's burger time.
846000	847000	Yeah, I know.
847000	849800	It's a burger time cabinet, but I don't like it when there's no price on it.
849800	850800	It makes it very...
850800	851800	I guess I could always go check it out.
851800	855240	Well, you just ask them to see how much you want for it, or you offer them like, okay,
855240	857960	I'll give you two hundred for it, and they can just say...
857960	858960	And they laugh at my face.
858960	859960	Well, then whatever.
859960	860960	It's the internet.
860960	864080	They're not really going to laugh at your face.
864080	865080	It's just the internet.
865080	866400	I'll use a fake email.
866400	869600	My gaming week, pretty much, I was out of town most of the weekend, so I didn't get
869600	874600	a lot of time to play a whole lot of new stuff, although my Paladin did hit level 60 in World
874600	875600	of Warcraft.
875600	876600	Thank you very much.
876600	878600	This is the character I rolled the first week of September.
878600	883660	So I got to 60 in two months, so thank you to the Quest Helper add-on, which really made
883660	886640	me blaze through the quest very quickly, and so forth.
886640	890120	One new game I did play this week, though, outside of World of Warcraft, DJ Hero.
890120	891600	I finally got my hands on this game.
891600	894200	Obviously, Loki's brought it to the show the past couple of times.
894200	896600	You've gotten to hear the game through his experience.
896600	900760	I did not put my hands on this game, really, until this week when I bought the game.
900760	904280	I chose to pick up the PlayStation 3 version of the game.
904280	908520	So I bought the game, and I love it.
908520	913120	The number one thing I can say about it is that it truly feels refreshing.
913120	918440	I think the problem I'm starting to have with a lot of these rock band and guitar hero and
918440	922800	the knock-offs, like Rock Revolution and so forth, is that the whole guitar drum thing
922800	924920	is starting to feel a little stale.
924920	927960	Granted, there are some bright lights within that whole genre.
927960	933520	For instance, the Beatles rock band was something truly special to that particular genre, I
933520	938200	guess if you want to just call the Beatles a genre, which they kind of are.
938200	939720	And some of these other little highlights.
939720	942320	But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.
942320	946280	And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.
946280	953520	I mean, really, to take the idea of mash-ups and making a game out of it is really cool.
953520	957800	Because every time I play a song, I feel like, wow, this really isn't something I've heard
957800	959040	before.
959040	963280	And that's a feeling I haven't had since the days I was really hardcore into the Japanese
963280	966020	music games, like Beatmania 2DX.
966020	970960	Speaking of Beatmania, this game has zero in common with Beatmania.
970960	975240	So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the
975240	979720	eye and you tell them, you're a fucking fool, or a sheep or something.
979720	986420	Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.
986420	989440	The games both have falling notes.
989440	991520	But it's like comparing apples to oranges.
991520	993320	Sure, they're both fruit.
993320	994320	But you know what?
994320	996160	They're completely different tastes.
996160	999800	And for that reason, there's going to be some people that don't care for DJ Hero who might
999800	1003440	be really into Beatmania 2DX and vice versa.
1003440	1006800	And if you're into 2DX, then that's when you go and buy Scratch, or whenever the hell that
1006800	1007800	comes out.
1007800	1010040	Well, even then, though, that's a completely different genre of music.
1010040	1013600	And as we were kind of talking about a little bit with Bobby on the tease call tonight,
1013600	1017720	because Bobby is right before us here on the lovely All Games Radio, where we do our show
1017720	1021480	every week, he was kind of talking about, you know, I'm not so interested in DJ Hero
1021480	1023800	because I didn't really care for the song list.
1023800	1024800	There's not a lot of...
1024800	1026980	I'm not really feeling the mashup thing.
1026980	1027980	You know what?
1027980	1030680	The song list is a really important part of a music game.
1030680	1031680	If you're not going to...
1031680	1035640	Like, for instance, I don't think I would ever be interested in buying Karaoke Revolution
1035640	1039920	Country unless the song list was suddenly all Dolly Parton songs, okay?
1039920	1044960	It's just not a genre of music that I'm particularly interested in, you know, spending that kind
1044960	1045960	of money.
1045960	1048960	You know, obviously, the music taste is the number one thing.
1048960	1053800	So for that reason, although I think Scratch and Beatmania are going to play a lot more
1053800	1058400	closely similar than Beatmania and DJ Hero do, I don't think they're going to attract
1058400	1059900	the same audience at all.
1059900	1065080	The funny thing is, I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there
1065080	1067720	is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.
1067720	1068720	But you know what?
1068720	1071840	I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.
1071840	1074320	I don't really care for Jay-Z.
1074320	1075840	I can't stand Eminem.
1075840	1082240	I think he's the biggest, like, overexposed artist I can think of in the past, like, 50
1082240	1083240	years.
1083240	1084240	Cool.
1084240	1085240	I just...
1085240	1086240	I don't like him.
1086240	1087240	I don't like his personality.
1087240	1088240	I don't like his songs.
1088240	1089240	I hate him.
1089240	1093120	But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed
1093120	1095440	the songs together are actually kind of cool.
1095440	1096440	Yeah, some of them are not bad.
1096440	1100480	Like, that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny, like,
1100480	1101520	and I dug it.
1101520	1103880	And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.
1103880	1106480	It felt like this whole new, different song I never really heard before.
1106480	1109480	And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.
1109480	1116360	Like, the whole, like, the Jacksons and Semi-Charm Life by Third Eye Blind, I frickin' love that
1116360	1117360	song.
1117360	1121040	And I gotta say, I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show,
1121040	1124960	but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is, like, my favorite song in
1124960	1125960	the game right now.
1125960	1128920	And it gets stuck in my head during the day, like, the little back and forth.
1128920	1133600	So, you know, I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long
1133600	1134600	time.
1134600	1138880	And I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it.
1138880	1140160	You have the three buttons.
1140160	1141440	You have the scratching.
1141440	1143520	You have certain direction scratching.
1143520	1144800	You have cross-fading.
1144800	1146220	You have the euphoria button.
1146220	1149400	You have the sampling that you change with the little knob.
1149400	1151960	You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.
1151960	1154280	Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.
1154280	1157360	Of course, granted, I jumped right in and started playing in hard mode after, you know,
1157360	1160560	acing the tutorial, but dammit, I'm having fun.
1160560	1162560	Now, is the game perfect?
1162560	1163560	No.
1163560	1166920	The core game itself is a heck of a lot of fun.
1166920	1171720	But the shell around that core game is, like, not even there.
1171720	1174180	Like the icing on the cake, not there.
1174180	1175640	This is like an angel food cake.
1175640	1176640	It's good.
1176640	1177640	It's yummy.
1177640	1181160	But it's not, it doesn't have, like, that frosting that makes it extra awesome.
1181160	1186200	And what I mean is, there's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool and even
1186200	1189420	Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up
1189420	1193840	to 11, or like in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that
1193840	1195600	all the stages were set around.
1195600	1199440	And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the
1199440	1201640	game, something to tie everything together.
1201640	1204420	DJ Hero doesn't really have that.
1204420	1208720	It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.
1208720	1211700	And the game never really walks you through the menus.
1211700	1215740	You don't really know, like, am I supposed to play these custom set lists, or can I just
1215740	1217200	do my own thing?
1217200	1219080	And I can't really do my own thing anyway.
1219080	1223480	I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song.
1223480	1225520	It's a little weird.
1225520	1227240	It doesn't ruin the game by any means.
1227240	1228800	It's just a little odd.
1228800	1230760	The interface is strange.
1230760	1234800	I don't like that the leaderboards are in, like, the menu.
1234800	1239240	I have to be honest, I feel like the game was rushed in that regard.
1239240	1243280	Like, they probably took a long time building the shell of the game, you know, the main
1243280	1248140	game itself, and the song list, and making that all perfect, and they did a kickass job.
1248140	1251960	But the rest of it feels just kind of, like, tacked on, like everything that kind of streams
1251960	1252960	it all together.
1252960	1256120	So, for that reason, I can't say it's a perfect game.
1256120	1260380	Oh, and online is just kind of there.
1260380	1262100	You know, there's really nothing to it.
1262100	1265680	You and somebody else play the song at the same time, whichever one of you gets the high
1265680	1266680	score wins.
1266680	1267680	Whoopee!
1267680	1272520	You know, there's no real, like, special modifiers, or you can't even use rewind in online mode,
1272520	1273520	which makes sense.
1273520	1277680	There's a lot of stuff that just kind of could be there that's not.
1277680	1281320	But is this a real kickass first entry in a future franchise?
1281320	1283040	Yes, yes, yes.
1283040	1284040	It's a great first game.
1284040	1288660	You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that, too, where there wasn't really
1288660	1290640	a lot of glue holding it together.
1290640	1294160	I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.
1294160	1299080	But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.
1299080	1300320	And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.
1300320	1303600	It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.
1303600	1307880	Tigerclaw says, so there's no battle of the DJs mode?
1307880	1308880	Not really.
1308880	1312120	I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy I guess
1312120	1317760	you say, frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.
1317760	1323120	I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.
1323120	1324540	In fact, it's kind of funny.
1324540	1328880	I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3,
1328880	1333240	or I really am better than I give myself credit for, because I'm in like the top 100 on a
1333240	1334480	bunch of songs right now.
1334480	1338160	Of course the game just came out last week, I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick
1338160	1340640	out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.
1340640	1346680	I'm trying to look at some more chat comments, chat.orangelaunchmedia.com.
1346680	1351560	Vanice Luxe, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when
1351560	1354560	they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.
1354560	1362840	And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment, it's a $120 investment.
1362840	1370360	So, you know, try this out at the store, try this out at a friend's house, don't drop $120
1370360	1375880	on a game just because I said to, check it out first, because the game's not for everyone.
1375880	1378480	You know, the scratching and all that stuff kind of puts some people off.
1378480	1381960	I have a lot of fun with it, I think Loki feels very similar to how I reviewed the game,
1381960	1385000	I don't know if Jamie's really played it or how she feels, I know she likes the songs
1385000	1391280	at least, from what she said on a previous show, but, you know, again, it's $120 is a
1391280	1395240	big investment, until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it
1395240	1401080	will, but, not, yeah, I mean, as the chatter said there, not for about a year.
1401080	1402080	So.
1402080	1406320	Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?
1406320	1408320	I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.
1408320	1411680	No, I think that's about it.
1411680	1415520	Tigercolonchat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music
1415520	1418680	for DJ Hero, imagine if they released a trance pack.
1418680	1423120	You know what's funny, one of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind
1423120	1428600	of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but it wouldn't,
1428600	1433160	there, there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.
1433160	1435160	I like the, um, Yo-Yo Girl.
1435160	1439240	I mean, there's tons and tons of different types of songs, and the mashups is a whole
1439240	1440680	new genre altogether.
1440680	1447760	You know, you have everything from Queen, to Gwen Stefani, to Third Eye Blind, to Jay-Z,
1447760	1453800	to Paula Abdul, but the interesting thing about it is that they do use a lot of songs
1453800	1458280	a lot, and that is one place the song list could improve, is that did I really need four
1458280	1463120	different mixes of Hollaback Girl, but when you have like 93 songs to choose from, it's,
1463120	1467600	you know, it doesn't really bother me at all.
1467600	1474480	And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the Gamestop code, and
1474480	1475480	they're both great.
1475480	1479000	So, but we'll talk more about that later in the show.
1479000	1485360	Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.
1485360	1488460	Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.
1488460	1492320	This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, AlphaKananagram, and it's running
1492320	1497680	on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country, but
1497680	1505160	I had to say this because the article is called, We's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.
1505160	1508800	The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the
1508800	1514880	worst selling Wii title ever, Sukiban Satchourena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership
1514880	1517180	of a talking female cat, Rina.
1517180	1521300	It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies, then they linked
1521300	1522800	to a couple of YouTubes.
1522800	1526720	Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on
1526720	1533240	Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity,
1533240	1537880	creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.
1537880	1539480	Fuck you.
1539480	1544220	Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup,
1544220	1551040	and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debuggles, some might wonder if perhaps
1551040	1555280	some kind of quality seal system might be useful.
1555280	1558960	Now obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got
1558960	1563840	so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even
1563840	1566080	cite what source they're using.
1566080	1567080	You know what's funny?
1567080	1570880	I bet it's 100 copies imported to the US.
1570880	1572680	It's probably more like it.
1572680	1575040	Yeah, 1% of their sales.
1575040	1580600	I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter
1580600	1582920	has 200 some odd followers alone.
1582920	1584800	I mean, really?
1584800	1587000	Like give me a source of some sort, please.
1587000	1590600	I think they also published something that says it has sold more.
1590600	1594880	Yeah, so I don't know how I feel about that, but that was linked by a chatter, and if in
1594880	1600140	case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from
1600140	1605040	foreign countries such as that one, you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangeorangereader.com.
1605040	1610040	I just wanted to let you know, please source or GTFO.
1610040	1612120	So there you go.
1612120	1615520	And Loki, you're going on to VG charts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?
1615520	1616520	Of course.
1616520	1617520	Of course you are.
1617520	1621120	I don't know if they'll actually have, you know, it just came out.
1621120	1623400	I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.
1623400	1624960	Well, they're pretty quick.
1624960	1633200	Of course, this is loading very slowly, and I don't even know if this is on here.
1633200	1634200	I don't know.
1634200	1636960	Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only
1636960	1638260	sold 100 copies.
1638260	1639260	Please deny.
1639260	1641880	Okay, well, let me put it this way.
1641880	1645440	It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.
1645440	1650760	Easy, easy, easy.
1650760	1651760	I know.
1651760	1652760	I know.
1652760	1653760	It's just, I don't know.
1653760	1656520	There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to, just wants to kick
1656520	1658320	President Cat while they're down.
1658320	1660480	This site is like the Glenn Best of gaming.
1660480	1662480	I'll ask them on Twitter.
1662480	1663480	What?
1663480	1664480	I'll ask them on Twitter.
1664480	1665480	Yeah, ask them on Twitter.
1665480	1667480	All right.
1667480	1668480	I know.
1668480	1669480	I agree with Gamer Girl in chat.
1669480	1672080	How can you not like Pres Cat?
1672080	1676160	Game Guru says, quality seal, dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game
1676160	1677600	worked on the system.
1677600	1678600	True enough.
1678600	1683480	Game Guru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.
1683480	1688160	And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played
1688160	1692280	the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the
1692280	1695120	game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.
1695120	1701840	They don't have any sort of anything.
1701840	1706320	There's no sales figures yet.
1706320	1710200	And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room, chat.orangeonstrader.com says, it was former
1710200	1712560	President Dog spreading the rumors.
1712560	1713560	I bet.
1713560	1716360	I'm President Dog.
1716360	1717360	Prime Minister Dog.
1717360	1718800	All right.
1718800	1720520	Let's move on.
1720520	1723040	Let's move on, actually get to some real gaming stories.
1723040	1727920	I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean and
1727920	1728920	you're a douche.
1728920	1729920	No, I'm just kidding.
1729920	1730920	I understand.
1730920	1734360	You can also follow us on Facebook.
1734360	1737560	We have a club there, the OL Army and all that fun stuff.
1737560	1738560	Awesome.
1738560	1739560	Yes, DarkSakura.
1739560	1741280	I just finished the most amazing French toast.
1741280	1742280	Congratulations.
1742280	1743600	Where was your French toast from?
1743600	1745700	It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli.
1745700	1747320	Will it give you a magic voice back?
1747320	1748600	Will it give you your voice back?
1748600	1753960	Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi because
1753960	1758040	remember I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop.
1758040	1759880	Would you like one?
1759880	1761320	Actually, I would love that.
1761320	1762600	I'm a little hot in here.
1762600	1766240	I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because you're diseased, but...
1766240	1767240	My disease.
1767240	1768240	Thank you.
1768240	1769240	No.
1769240	1770240	Your affliction.
1770240	1771240	No.
1771240	1774680	As I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm and actually I wear
1774680	1782040	a scarf to work is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start
1782040	1784840	coughing.
1784840	1787120	The warm is keeping the mucus flowing.
1787120	1791440	Well, certainly a lot of our listeners in chat are noticing the coughing and sending
1791440	1792840	well wishes your way tonight.
1792840	1797600	Also, for the record though, it makes it a lot easier for me to do this.
1797600	1799480	Oh, stop it.
1799480	1800480	All right.
1800480	1803360	Anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.
1803360	1806160	Loki, start us off if you would tonight.
1806160	1814240	Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service
1814240	1815240	to the PS3.
1815240	1818840	Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox
1818840	1823720	360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from
1823720	1831920	Netflix and basically using this disc, it'll launch a program that'll allow you to stream
1831920	1838360	content much like you would through the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1838360	1844700	They said that they are working on a new integrated version of it, however, for whatever reason,
1844700	1851840	the solution's not expected to arrive until late 2010, whether that may be because they're
1851840	1859760	under contract with, say, the Xbox 360, Microsoft and whatnot, probably has something to do
1859760	1862600	with that.
1862600	1865120	That's kind of neat though that they're finally allowing people to do that.
1865120	1872680	I know it's something that they've been remembering for a while now with a lot of the surveys,
1872680	1873680	stuff like that.
1873680	1876960	It's possible to come into the Wii at some point.
1876960	1878800	It's neat.
1878800	1884240	Would you use this now since your 360's out of commission?
1884240	1885240	Definitely.
1885240	1886760	I was kind of excited to hear this news.
1886760	1893520	My 360 will be replaced slash fixed by the time this thing comes out, but I'm going to
1893520	1894520	be honest.
1894520	1896680	I've just been super lazy in getting my 360 fixed.
1896680	1901640	My gaming need has been satiated by World of Warcraft and the stuff I've been playing
1901640	1905000	on my PS3, so I haven't felt that urgency to get my 360 fixed.
1905000	1909480	This certainly doesn't get me in any rush, but what I find fascinating about this is
1909480	1913040	that just last week on the show, I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke
1913040	1914400	while we were live last week.
1914400	1920220	We just didn't catch it, but I was just talking about, like, hey, if Microsoft wants to compete
1920220	1922400	with Sony, because what's Sony's big thing right now?
1922400	1924480	It does everything.
1924480	1929560	To be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP, and to some extent,
1929560	1930560	the PS3.
1930560	1936080	It does a lot of stuff very well, but Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system, which
1936080	1942120	includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix, and streaming Netflix could kind of compete
1942120	1943680	with Blu-ray in a way.
1943680	1944680	Oops.
1944680	1946160	Now the PS3 has Netflix too.
1946160	1952280	Yeah, but you have to order it, and mainly they were saying, like I said before, one
1952280	1957440	of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around
1957440	1964480	a clause that they had for their contract with Microsoft, saying that basically this
1964480	1969520	cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something
1969520	1970520	like that.
1970520	1972520	So it's not appearing on a dashboard.
1972520	1974520	It's actually a program now that someone else is running.
1974520	1980360	So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.
1980360	1981360	I don't know.
1981360	1983120	What do you think this means for the whole console wars?
1983120	1985960	Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground, or is it just...
1985960	1987600	No, I don't think it means anything.
1987600	1991920	Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.
1991920	1993680	It's just it's good for Netflix.
1993680	2000920	That's basically it, because I think it's not going to sell any systems.
2000920	2003880	I don't really think it's a really big point.
2003880	2007560	It'd be hard for them to kind of advertise it, I guess, as a feature of the system, seeing
2007560	2012680	as you have to order it, that'd be like, this system plays Uncharted 2 or something like
2012680	2013680	that.
2013680	2017400	I can't really advertise that, but I don't know.
2017400	2021400	It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works, if it works as well as it does
2021400	2027440	on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard.
2027440	2030880	It's just a Blu-ray disc.
2030880	2031880	So it'll be interesting.
2031880	2036000	Well, the Microsoft interface is very bare bones, so I'm wondering if it won't be a little
2036000	2040520	more... I can't imagine the look is going to be the same, because on Netflix 360, the
2040520	2043560	look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.
2043560	2048160	So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all, so I'm kind of curious
2048160	2050920	if it's going to be maybe better.
2050920	2051920	I don't know.
2051920	2052920	Maybe.
2052920	2053920	It could be worse, too.
2053920	2054920	It could go either way.
2054920	2058400	It could be interesting if it uses a crossbar style interface, where all your genres maybe
2058400	2059400	are in the crossbar.
2059400	2065960	It'll probably be their video marketplace, or even just the normal marketplace where
2065960	2068680	you've got rows of stuff on there.
2068680	2069680	I don't know.
2069680	2073520	Good question from Derek H in chat, who hosts another show here on the network, Dead Pixel
2073520	2074800	Live, on weekdays.
2074800	2078620	If it uses BD Live, like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray
2078620	2080480	player that is BD Live capable?
2080480	2084000	Well, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.
2084000	2088560	I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this smart Blu-ray Live thing,
2088560	2090560	and the Wii sometime as well.
2090560	2095680	This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.
2095680	2098360	This is about Netflix getting what they want.
2098360	2100880	So I don't know about this particular update.
2100880	2107000	I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that I would just have a
2107000	2113540	hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player, because they don't really have strong
2113540	2115840	processors in them.
2115840	2120360	I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would
2120360	2123560	be difficult, I would think, to stream...
2123560	2130900	Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video and having
2130900	2134840	it look good, it does require some processing power.
2134840	2140120	I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's BD Live capable would be capable of
2140120	2141120	that.
2141120	2147000	I could be wrong, but I would think it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does
2147000	2149360	streaming video.
2149360	2154720	Ionotropic in our chat room wants to remind us, too, the disk-based Netflix for PS3 is
2154720	2156680	supposed to be a temporary solution.
2156680	2160900	They said the disk won't always be required, and you were talking about the contractual
2160900	2164160	stuff maybe until 2010, so it makes sense.
2164160	2168560	But I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.
2168560	2173600	Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value, and it's a win for Netflix, and
2173600	2175960	it's a small win for Sony.
2175960	2180320	But also, Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room, isn't it a little late to put this into
2180320	2182600	the console wars concept?
2182600	2186780	Most everyone that will ever get this gen's systems already have one.
2186780	2188480	I'm not so inclined to agree.
2188480	2192760	I don't think Blu-rays really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.
2192760	2197180	I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right, but remember,
2197180	2202040	we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which Wii is kicking butt at right
2202040	2203040	now.
2203040	2210600	The problem is, the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step
2210600	2211600	now.
2211600	2218960	DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick, and people are kind of hesitant like, well, if I convert
2218960	2225500	my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray, how soon is the next thing going to be that
2225500	2226500	comes along?
2226500	2227500	I don't want to do that.
2227500	2230840	I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and save some money that way
2230840	2235240	because it's not really that big a difference, or hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case
2235240	2237340	there is no difference.
2237340	2238340	I don't know.
2238340	2245280	It's just not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.
2245280	2251120	Fifth Dream in the chat, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current gen
2251120	2252120	stuff.
2252120	2253660	Certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.
2253660	2257600	If Fifth Dream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.
2257600	2260240	They don't own a current gen system yet.
2260240	2267640	Let's not forget, current gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.
2267640	2272400	Whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for a college kid trying
2272400	2278920	to pay for books and work at a part-time job, $200 is still an assload of money.
2278920	2282620	That's like ramen for a year.
2282620	2284820	Not everybody's jumped on board with this yet.
2284820	2290280	It's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at.
2290280	2292160	The PS2 got down to $99 finally, right?
2292160	2294160	Yeah, that was back in March.
2294160	2295160	There you go.
2295160	2299080	All right, we're going to get into the next story here, but first I'm actually going to
2299080	2303200	take a little detour from the show role we had.
2303200	2306080	I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in
2306080	2311740	the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting
2311740	2315000	someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute
2315000	2316000	ago.
2316000	2319080	So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.
2319080	2321080	Hello.
2321080	2330560	Hey, is this Mel B?
2330560	2331560	The one and only.
2331560	2332560	How are you doing, Mel?
2332560	2335120	Long time, no talks since we've had you on the show.
2335120	2337000	Oh gosh, yeah.
2337000	2341600	It's been quite a while since we've actually... I mean, I've been in the chat a few times
2341600	2346000	here and there, but yeah, actually being a caller in, it's... Oh yeah, it's been a good
2346000	2347000	while.
2347000	2348000	You know, it's up to you.
2348000	2351000	Hey, it's Dr. Sakura and Loki.
2351000	2356240	Well, we're always happy to have you here on the show, and of course, just for folks
2356240	2361760	who are just now listening for the first time, Mel B goes kind of way back on this show because
2361760	2365560	he used to be very big in the freestyle scene with Dance Dance Revolution, so when our show
2365560	2370680	was kind of exclusively about that whole scene, obviously Mel was a friend of the show through
2370680	2374840	that, and we've kept touch over the years, and Mel's a good friend of mine, and Jamie
2374840	2377400	and Matt's as well, so we've kept in touch.
2377400	2380600	Now, I got to tell you what's going on tonight, Mel.
2380600	2384080	We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House because I don't
2384080	2387840	even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how... Well,
2387840	2393380	eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago,
2393380	2398800	and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have
2398800	2400320	got to come down here.
2400320	2403040	I will even pay for your ticket to go.
2403040	2407200	It was that good, so I was like, okay... Because we were talking about the Silent Hill Haunted
2407200	2408200	House on the show.
2408200	2412400	I'm like, I got to call them and hear about what this was all about, so Mel, I know you're
2412400	2413880	a fan of Silent Hill.
2413880	2415680	Tell us about the Haunted House and what it was like.
2415680	2416760	Walk us through it a little bit.
2416760	2417760	Oh, wow.
2417760	2423760	I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around
2423760	2427960	at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing
2427960	2434400	a maze over in prayer, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.
2434400	2440040	And they were doing essentially the equivalent to a human maze, or that was based on Silent
2440040	2441040	Hill.
2441040	2443960	And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into
2443960	2446160	the game of Warthog and stuff and all that.
2446160	2449400	Well, like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?
2449400	2454240	So we got to do it on a Halloween night, but that was just last night.
2454240	2459200	And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like, essentially, the maze was created
2459200	2464840	inside what would have been a banded movie theater or something like that, because there's
2464840	2470280	actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human
2470280	2475400	maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and have
2475400	2476400	all those types of things.
2476400	2478400	You're more scared of scary stuff.
2478400	2479400	Yeah.
2479400	2484320	And you get in for, you know, like, say, take a picture, just sort of like for those souvenir-type
2484320	2485320	things.
2485320	2488880	Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust of hair right
2488880	2492480	behind you, like, to get your shocked reaction, obviously.
2492480	2496840	So you can tell these people are about to get you pre-fertile pretty bad.
2496840	2501440	And once you're going in, once you're actually under the maze, it's like indoors, it's really
2501440	2507440	not dimly lit with, like, a lot of crimson lighting and, like, just real darkened stuff.
2507440	2512320	And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people
2512320	2513320	top.
2513320	2514320	So you're pretty narrow.
2514320	2516560	You have a very claustrophobic feel.
2516560	2521440	So already, it's just, you know, kind of creeping yourself out that you can play the game.
2521440	2525640	You know, a lot of it's just, it's not so much, you see, it's creeping things everywhere.
2525640	2528920	You know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know, something's going to happen.
2528920	2530520	You don't know when it will.
2530520	2533720	And that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can take, like, you know, one turn
2533720	2534720	to the second turn.
2534720	2537680	You didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off
2537680	2538680	of the flight.
2538680	2542480	The first monster, you know, just jumped out at you and, you know, scared you, like, stopped
2542480	2544280	and like, ah!
2544280	2550960	And for me, because I get pretty jumpy just on about anything, it was like, well, you
2550960	2551960	know, you jump.
2551960	2555440	But you could tell the monster, you know, coming after you, but the good thing, the
2555440	2559640	way they said it about this, you don't, you know, like, you can't touch them, they can't
2559640	2560640	touch you.
2560640	2563160	It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.
2563160	2564840	It's like a strip club.
2564840	2565840	Strip club rules.
2565840	2566840	It's like what?
2566840	2567840	It's like strip club rules.
2567840	2568840	Yeah, strip club.
2568840	2569840	For lack of a better term.
2569840	2573560	Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll
2573560	2577560	sort of just sort of bang on the door, walls, and start kind of following you.
2577560	2581520	That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know,
2581520	2583200	corridor or whatever.
2583200	2587360	And when I first heard that, I was amazed, you know, like, one of the things they mentioned
2587360	2590200	on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?
2590200	2595560	They said it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed, but, um, cool
2595560	2598360	thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.
2598360	2600320	There is sort of, like, a message while they're bad.
2600320	2603520	If they're, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.
2603520	2609000	Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like,
2609000	2614520	Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites
2614520	2618160	were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you
2618160	2620560	know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.
2620560	2624040	And then occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll feel, like, those faces, like,
2624040	2628400	when the evil spirits start coming out, they'll just come out through the wall and start chasing
2628400	2629400	you.
2629400	2630400	Oh, weird.
2630400	2634880	You'll see, like, um, there's those, um, evil dogs that you normally see, I think they're,
2634880	2640240	like, in Part 4 and, um, Homecoming, like, the one where you fall on the porch, you see,
2640240	2643960	like, occasionally, a dog, you know, in a cage, trying to come after you.
2643960	2648200	Um, they do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3, like, there's this one setup that
2648200	2652000	they have, like, on the slide room, it's, like, at the bottom, there's a television
2652000	2657040	screen, and you can see, sort of, like, the rollercoaster, kind of, like, going through,
2657040	2660120	sort of, like, the rollercoaster going on its path, and they decorate it, like, the
2660120	2665480	abandoned, um, yeah, amusement park and such, and it's gonna take, like, the Silent Hill
2665480	2666480	music throughout.
2666480	2670680	Like, yeah, just everything, like, every corner, you just don't know when things are going
2670680	2671680	to happen.
2671680	2676680	And, like, even sometimes, you'll just see things that are, like, you know, everything
2676680	2680080	is standing still, and you're thinking, hmm, because one room I remember going through
2680080	2685840	was, like, a hospital, and there were literally, like, six nurses that just, sort of, like,
2685840	2688760	you know, when you're going, like, to a Soul Train line or something, you have to go right
2688760	2690760	through them, and you know something's gonna happen.
2690760	2691760	That's like the scene in the movie.
2691760	2694160	Okay, I know something's gonna jump me, I don't know what, take, like, one cautious
2694160	2698720	step forward, okay, two, three, and then you realize four of them were, like, mannequins,
2698720	2702560	the two of them were live, so it's just, like, totally screwed with your head.
2702560	2703560	Wow.
2703560	2707080	Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear the pens just to get through the photo shoot.
2707080	2711920	But our chat room is dying to know, how was their pyramid head, did they have a pyramid
2711920	2712920	head?
2712920	2713920	Oh, please say they had pyramid head.
2713920	2716360	Oh, yeah, pyramid head was the payoff.
2716360	2719880	I mean, anyone who, you know, the pyramid head always knows pyramid head is what you
2719880	2721080	came here for.
2721080	2724520	So that was, that was actually the last thing that you see.
2724520	2728320	So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right
2728320	2734600	after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming, they have that part, and it's funny, as you
2734600	2739120	leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill, uh, Shattered
2739120	2740120	Memories.
2740120	2742520	So it's, like, kind of, you know, interesting.
2742520	2745440	So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's, like, this, sort
2745440	2750160	of, kind of, like, shrine over there, at the top you see a, uh, figurine, like, a, uh,
2750160	2753120	big busted pyramid head, which is, like, really well done, it's, like, wow, that's kind of
2753120	2754120	cool.
2754120	2756800	And so you're still fixated on looking at that, just trying to internalize that, then
2756800	2761440	out of a gate popped out, Pyramid Head, huge, you know, Pyramid Head has, like, the big
2761440	2766120	sword, you know, that goes, supposed to be at least five feet long, so he starts coming
2766120	2769320	after you, he starts, like, you know, pretending to stab, he'll push you to get back a little
2769320	2770320	bit.
2770320	2771320	I would have broke down and cried.
2771320	2774040	I would have broke down and cried that you had to carry me out.
2774040	2777640	Yeah, luckily, Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the
2777640	2778640	building.
2778640	2779640	I would have cried.
2779640	2786600	Yeah, but yeah, I mean, for me, it was just, like, I mean, it's funny, because, uh, Melody
2786600	2790040	would be, like, she'd go, I mean, after she'd gone through, she said, wow, that was, I wasn't
2790040	2791040	really scared.
2791040	2794720	And I was like, how could you not be, because then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled
2794720	2798760	or doesn't invest herself in the game, because when she's going through, like, all the bathrooms
2798760	2803560	and stuff, we see all the details of how they're busted, you see, like, the blood, blood, tears,
2803560	2808600	and all that, it's almost like, I guess, I put myself in that situation, thinking, damn,
2808600	2812800	you know, I don't have no access to spare, I ain't got no radio or nothing, like, I just
2812800	2813800	gotta deal with this.
2813800	2819760	So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they
2819760	2820760	do a good job?
2820760	2825880	I think, I thought they did a really, really good job.
2825880	2831480	I like that they, they really got you inside, you know, they, they created the things, usually
2831480	2835160	they did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who
2835160	2839840	plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you, so, like,
2839840	2843840	you always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner, or, you know, in some places
2843840	2847200	when you're going to the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain, and so, you know,
2847200	2851280	it's like the black curtain, you gotta, like, peek through it, you just don't know, so,
2851280	2855840	you know, fear is in there, but it's, overall, tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you
2855840	2859920	know, just experience, going to, like, you know, anything that's haunted, it was really
2859920	2861440	well done.
2861440	2865440	And just to clarify, some folks in the chat room wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape
2865440	2868040	you?
2868040	2870760	No bodies were defiled, uh, during the, uh, haunt.
2870760	2871760	Oh, that's right, they can't touch it.
2871760	2875280	But he had, like, his small little room, he had his, you know, gate on the side, and,
2875280	2879360	you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but, for all we know,
2879360	2883440	you know, they, they might be adding something, you know, they made it with something I didn't
2883440	2887160	catch, maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.
2887160	2889240	Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.
2889240	2893920	All right, uh, Mel, thank you so much, I really appreciate you coming on the show, I know
2893920	2897400	you guys are, like, driving home right now, you're calling us literally from the road,
2897400	2901240	probably driving up I-5 or something, so, um, have a safe drive back, thank you guys
2901240	2904880	so much for, um, coming on the show, and, uh, we'll hope to see you in studio in the
2904880	2907880	near future, okay?
2907880	2912880	Okay, take care, I think we might have just lost him at that point.
2912880	2919960	I was, uh, the 10th draft jersey since Jefferson touched Bimani, which was October 30th, 99th
2919960	2924640	and 8th, so, you know, 10 years, what a crazy ride, where we are, you know?
2924640	2926240	Wow, I didn't even think of that.
2926240	2928880	People that used, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for
2928880	2929880	a little bit.
2929880	2931320	October 30th, 99 was what?
2931320	2932320	The first time you played Bimani?
2932320	2933320	First time I played DTR.
2933320	2941160	10 years later, look, you know, how everything's gone, and still fans still doing it, and,
2941160	2942480	you know, look what's taking us.
2942480	2945000	Wow, yeah, it's pretty, pretty crazy looking back.
2945000	2946000	Boy, do I feel old.
2946000	2948000	Thanks for making me feel old, Mel, no, I'm kidding.
2948000	2952200	You know, it's, like, it's, I could go on for an hour or so, but it looks like I'm breaking
2952200	2955760	up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe, uh, maybe we'll talk about it more
2955760	2956760	next week.
2956760	2957760	Sounds good.
2957760	2958760	Take care, Mel.
2958760	2959760	Have a safe drive back.
2959760	2960760	All right.
2960760	2961760	Thanks, man.
2961760	2962760	Y'all be good.
2962760	2963760	Later.
2963760	2964760	All right.
2964760	2967820	Thank you, uh, very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message
2967820	2968820	notice.
2968820	2969820	I appreciate that.
2969820	2970820	All right.
2970820	2971820	That was fun.
2971820	2972820	I don't know.
2972820	2973820	It sounded pretty good.
2973820	2974820	I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so, Jamie, if it comes back next year, I,
2974820	2978240	I think we're gonna road trip, but make sure I bring diapers.
2978240	2985120	All right, we'll be, we'll, um, bring you, uh, or make sure I at least void myself before
2985120	2986720	we go into the haunted house.
2986720	2987720	Yeah.
2987720	2988720	Okay.
2988720	2993680	We'll, we'll just get you a big pack, pack of, uh, oops, I crap my pants.
2993680	2994680	Sounds good.
2994680	2995680	All right.
2995680	2998080	Hey, I'm moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.
2998080	3001640	In fact, if the only thing that was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing, there's
3001640	3003680	another DSI coming out.
3003680	3004680	That's right.
3004680	3006460	This would be the fourth version of the DSI coming out.
3006460	3007720	It's coming out in Japan very soon.
3007720	3014760	The DSIL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and yes, America as the DSIXL, uh,
3014760	3018360	the DSIs, uh, LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.
3018360	3022780	Uh, basically the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with four inch screens,
3022780	3027760	so it's going to get a size increase because size matters.
3027760	3030000	The DSI Leonardo Leonardo.
3030000	3033620	No, it's, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.
3033620	3035880	It's, it's, it's also the DSIXL over there.
3035880	3036960	It's just in their language.
3036960	3037960	It's LL.
3037960	3040800	So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.
3040800	3044880	Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.
3044880	3048320	It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until
3048320	3049320	next year.
3049320	3053480	It has been confirmed for all the regions and I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay,
3053480	3059080	well to be fair, I never bought the DSI, but if I did buy the DSI, I might feel a little
3059080	3063240	bit irritated because like if I bought stuff on the DSI store, it's not like there's a
3063240	3065720	cable that's going to connect my two things.
3065720	3070200	It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP, there'd be no slot for
3070200	3072280	me to put the discs in.
3072280	3075880	At least I could still play the games, but yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people
3075880	3080400	who didn't jump on board with the DSI the first time, like me.
3080400	3081400	I don't know.
3081400	3084200	Loki, how has the DSI been selling?
3084200	3085460	Is there a need for this?
3085460	3086600	What was your take on all this?
3086600	3094780	Well, this is just for old people and basically they've said it's for so other people can
3094780	3096480	watch you play the games.
3096480	3102600	And so basically you're advertising for Nintendo now, sort of, and the screen, you know, it's
3102600	3106160	a little bit bigger, but the system's also a little bit more expensive.
3106160	3109440	So are they going to be putting this out with the DSI?
3109440	3114680	I mean, it's kind of backwards as far as it becoming smaller and more compact.
3114680	3118080	By the way, a lot of our chat room is making the joke that a four inches is actually a
3118080	3120200	big improvement, but I'm bummed.
3120200	3121200	Get it?
3121200	3124520	And you know, if they're making the system so much bigger, why couldn't they throw the
3124520	3129920	Game Boy Advance slot back in there, since, you know, now size isn't a matter and...
3129920	3132440	Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?
3132440	3137520	I understand that, but you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance slot
3137520	3139000	and, you know, other games have...
3139000	3144520	Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...
3144520	3146720	Yes, that's true, but...
3146720	3147720	Ha, I win.
3147720	3152720	I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down
3152720	3157360	the system to make it smaller and, you know, it couldn't fit... they couldn't fit that
3157360	3158360	in there.
3158360	3163200	Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore, then...
3163200	3166200	So in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.
3166200	3167200	Yup.
3167200	3168200	Hmm.
3168200	3170320	I don't know how I feel about this.
3170320	3175560	Well, and also too, I mean, you're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're
3175560	3179760	making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.
3179760	3181760	I mean, I don't know.
3181760	3185120	Do I really need a four-inch screen, or at least two four-inch screens?
3185120	3186560	I can see it just fine.
3186560	3188920	I don't need, you know...
3188920	3192780	I don't need glasses to, you know, read the text on that screen.
3192780	3195760	If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me
3195760	3196760	put it on my television.
3196760	3201020	Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device
3201020	3203760	that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.
3203760	3206120	Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
3206120	3207120	TV Tuner.
3207120	3208120	Something...
3208120	3209120	Yeah, something along those lines.
3209120	3210120	Or like the dev kits.
3210120	3211120	Yeah, bingo.
3211120	3212120	Bingo.
3212120	3213120	Thank you.
3213120	3214120	So...
3214120	3215120	Um...
3215120	3217440	And then actdeftinchat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld, now, thanks.
3217440	3218440	Yeah, that's right.
3218440	3222080	We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn
3222080	3224200	well it could play them if it wanted to.
3224200	3225200	Yeah.
3225200	3229320	Because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were
3229320	3234520	all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.
3234520	3239320	Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a
3239320	3242200	free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?
3242200	3243200	Remember that?
3243200	3244200	Good times.
3244200	3248600	And also remember how you could get, you know, free Nintendo games streamed to your Game
3248600	3251200	Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?
3251200	3255200	And there was like, you know, 30-some games in there?
3255200	3256960	Oh, but you don't get that anymore.
3256960	3260920	In fact, we're just gonna keep Animal Crossing the same.
3260920	3262200	I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.
3262200	3263400	I just want you to know that.
3263400	3264440	I don't care what they do.
3264440	3267560	I don't care if, you know, it's the greatest thing on Earth.
3267560	3269400	I'm not buying it.
3269400	3270400	I don't know.
3270400	3274440	This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 as unnecessary handhelds.
3274440	3275440	I don't know.
3275440	3278400	I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need
3278400	3279400	it.
3279400	3280400	You know?
3280400	3281400	How's the PSP Go selling?
3281400	3282440	That's what I want to know.
3282440	3283440	That's a good question.
3283440	3285080	I'd be curious about that.
3285080	3286240	Well anyhow, there you go.
3286240	3288480	There's the information on the new DS.
3288480	3289480	Take it or leave it.
3289480	3290860	I'm sure there's some folks that are gonna be excited about it.
3290860	3296240	I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi, I think will be more into this.
3296240	3299440	Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that'll be all over this no matter what.
3299440	3301920	It's also more expensive, remember.
3301920	3305640	Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.
3305640	3311160	I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.
3311160	3316120	Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS
3316120	3317120	Lite.
3317120	3321160	I never got on board with the DSi, but right now I'm not feeling it.
3321160	3322160	That's where I'm at.
3322160	3325720	If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.
3325720	3328040	But for now, I'll pass.
3328040	3331240	Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.
3331240	3333760	For very similar reasons, oddly enough.
3333760	3334760	There you go.
3334760	3336120	PSP Go is just ridiculous.
3336120	3339200	It's redonkulous, if you will.
3339200	3340200	There you go.
3340200	3341200	Fine.
3341200	3346600	Something else that's redonkulous is apparently a PlayStation Network, or I should say ex-PlayStation
3346600	3357640	Network member, who of course tried to sue Sony for $55,000 for banning him from the
3357640	3358640	PlayStation Network.
3358640	3365680	Apparently he was throwing a fit in the PlayStation forums, and I believe since your account is
3365680	3369720	linked through that, if you get banned from the forums, you get banned off the network.
3369720	3375280	Which most people might say, who cares, I can create another membership.
3375280	3378760	Can I make a quick O-L-R-N joke that only like five people will get?
3378760	3379760	Sure.
3379760	3383120	Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online.
3383120	3384520	We ban you!
3384520	3385520	Yes.
3385520	3395760	So, anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?
3395760	3398280	God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit.
3398280	3400880	I'm going to sue you again.
3400880	3407840	So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.
3407840	3419400	And on top of all that, this is just awesome, he is also not going to have a lawyer.
3419400	3421560	Once again, he's going to be representing himself.
3421560	3425000	Because only a fool represents himself.
3425000	3426520	Yes.
3426520	3429440	He will once again opt out of using a lawyer.
3429440	3435840	And the best part about it was, he said before that his first amendment rights were basically
3435840	3440560	being trampled on, and that's why he should get $55,000.
3440560	3445280	The judge says no and dismisses the case, and so now he's trying it again.
3445280	3449520	But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.
3449520	3451680	It doesn't cost anything.
3451680	3453420	Free.
3453420	3455960	It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.
3455960	3456960	It's free.
3456960	3461560	Okay, devil's advocate, what about all the purchases you made on your old account that
3461560	3465280	are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?
3465280	3468680	Well then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the terms of service.
3468680	3473680	That's true, I think Sony's covered in their terms of service, hence why the constitution
3473680	3475060	does not apply.
3475060	3479520	You agree to be signing up for a club and exclusive network where the first amendment
3479520	3481040	rules don't apply.
3481040	3486480	If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you
3486480	3491080	can't complain and say, wham wham wham, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.
3491080	3492160	They have every right to do that.
3492160	3493160	It's private.
3493160	3494160	It's private.
3494160	3496760	Same goes with any kind of web forum.
3496760	3501520	So this guy's just kind of a douche.
3501520	3505280	I like how we all said a different word in tandem there, that was great.
3505280	3507280	No Ron.
3507280	3511440	There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system
3511440	3512840	just look stupid.
3512840	3519400	I mean, I understand, in this case, cause they're going to have to throw it out again.
3519400	3524600	I mean the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally at least setting a precedent
3524600	3527600	is that this is stupid.
3527600	3534440	Well and at least he's not wasting money on, well I guess he's being smart and not wasting
3534440	3536320	money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.
3536320	3541560	The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I
3541560	3545600	could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
3545600	3550360	However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff, you knew what, you know, and if
3550360	3555000	you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well, it's hard for me to
3555000	3556460	feel a lot of pity for you.
3556460	3559640	Cause what you said probably would have offended me.
3559640	3560640	Just guessing.
3560640	3561640	Probably would have.
3561640	3564640	And I don't get offended very easily by the way.
3564640	3567940	But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.
3567940	3570960	One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the Playstation
3570960	3577800	3 has lost them quite a bit of money, 4.7 billion dollars to be exact.
3577800	3578800	That's coming from...
3578800	3579800	Billion dollars.
3579800	3582200	Billion dollars.
3582200	3586720	Apparently this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that
3586720	3589760	Sony came out with this week.
3589760	3593980	The PS3 has lost Sony 4.695 billion dollars.
3593980	3598640	Keep in mind, game companies really lose money, like every time they sell a system, you know,
3598640	3600960	they're losing money on parts and so forth.
3600960	3606880	So you know, game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later
3606880	3612840	with things like, let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-rays, so they get money back with every
3612840	3614120	Blu-rays that are sold.
3614120	3617680	They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.
3617680	3619360	You know, they make the money back in other ways.
3619360	3622420	If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.
3622420	3627000	So hold on a minute, before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger
3627000	3631080	and say, Sony's losing money because they're stupid.
3631080	3632080	Well hold on.
3632080	3633080	Keep in mind, because guess what?
3633080	3638820	When Microsoft released the original Xbox, they lost 4.2 billion over a four year period.
3638820	3644160	That is a little less than 4.7, but also that was, you know, 10 years ago ish, you know,
3644160	3646040	eight, seven years ago, whatever.
3646040	3653140	But you know, these game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.
3653140	3658280	So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet, or anytime soon really.
3658280	3662880	I think if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.
3662880	3669040	I think this money could possibly turn around by, you know, next year or the year after.
3669040	3672620	And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial
3672620	3678620	officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce,
3678620	3683920	saying the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20%.
3683920	3687000	Within the year, it could be in the single digits.
3687000	3691320	We'll be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term.
3691320	3697440	It should also be noted that the PlayStation 3 has jumped 800,000 in sales from the year
3697440	3700320	to year figures ever since the slim launched.
3700320	3704980	So definitely the price point was the sticking point for a heck of a lot of people.
3704980	3708480	And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting
3708480	3712760	cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later
3712760	3713760	on.
3713760	3718360	As we've been trying to tell them since the launch, $600, you crazy?
3718360	3721800	Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.
3721800	3725800	They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they
3725800	3726800	won.
3726800	3727960	HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.
3727960	3730960	So they won that gamble.
3730960	3734440	So maybe this really truly was, you know, when they were talking about this 10 year
3734440	3739380	plan and all that, that's when this is probably going to end up really, really paying off
3739380	3743040	for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants Blu-rays and so
3743040	3744040	forth.
3744040	3745040	So we shall see.
3745040	3747320	Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3747320	3748400	We're already an hour into the show.
3748400	3750760	We haven't even gotten to release dates.
3750760	3758480	Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool and I would like to see more of
3758480	3766200	this going on is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.
3766200	3774120	He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game.
3774120	3780840	He shouldn't have to take, take out any of the, you know, sex and anything that goes
3780840	3786840	on in it for the sake of any kind of, you know, quote decency because it's intended
3786840	3788840	for a mature audience.
3788840	3794400	You know, it's not his fault if, if it, you know, ends up in a kid's hand.
3794400	3799480	It's who's ever, you know, in charge of that kid's fault.
3799480	3803200	In fact, he's quoted as saying, as a game creator, I have one very simple rule.
3803200	3806280	Everything is allowed, no limits, as long as it makes sense in the story and is not
3806280	3808920	gratuitous.
3808920	3811040	Why is he having to defend himself?
3811040	3812040	Why?
3812040	3815120	Well, this is even more.
3815120	3822360	He's saying that because it's an 18 plus title, it should exclude him from, and I quote, ridiculous
3822360	3823360	situation.
3823360	3828120	So, I'm like, good, thank you for saying something.
3828120	3830360	Why is this so loud?
3830360	3836760	It just seems loud because you're, anyway, I don't, I don't understand why the guy is
3836760	3842640	being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.
3842640	3844120	Like it's, it's ridiculous.
3844120	3847240	Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?
3847240	3852560	Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things,
3852560	3859540	but like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now, why did you decide to
3859540	3863360	show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?
3863360	3865360	Did you really have to show her boobs?
3865360	3869140	No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.
3869140	3872720	Why is this guy having to defend his game or any creator having to defend their games
3872720	3874480	and the artistic choices they make?
3874480	3878240	Oh, I see, because games aren't really art according to some people.
3878240	3880280	Well, get over it.
3880280	3887880	I hate this, and I'm sure you all do as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard
3887880	3891320	with video games versus movies.
3891320	3893440	It's all the same kind of thing.
3893440	3898240	You know, well, a lot of us, you know, who were anime fans back in the day, you know,
3898240	3900120	got into the same thing.
3900120	3903160	I'm going, oh, these cartoons, it doesn't matter to me.
3903160	3909880	Well, like, no, it's just another way of, uh, of, uh, communication.
3909880	3914640	It's another, just another medium, and video games are the same thing.
3914640	3920000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.
3920000	3921400	I want my eight bucks back.
3921400	3922400	I'm the plaintiff.
3922400	3923400	I'm a plaintiff.
3923400	3924400	I'm a plaintiff.
3924400	3929400	Damn, that was a great show.
3929400	3930400	That was.
3930400	3931400	Oh, man.
3931400	3933600	He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.
3933600	3935880	He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.
3935880	3936880	Oh, really?
3936880	3937880	Sweet.
3937880	3938880	That might be fun.
3938880	3941880	It might actually be a good movie from him for, for once in the past, like, 10 years.
3941880	3943600	Big American Party.
3943600	3945880	I would like to dogma.
3945880	3952240	All right, um, moving on, a few more stories in release dates, and of course, the classic
3952240	3954080	game of the week before too long.
3954080	3961680	Yes, apparently, piracy on, um, handheld systems is not limited to the, uh, say, on the PSP.
3961680	3968600	Apparently, also very, quite rampant on, uh, the iPhone, or at least the App Store.
3968600	3975680	Um, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even, like, 95 percent.
3975680	3982960	Uh, one, I love their developer's name too, one iPhone developer smells like donkey, says
3982960	3987960	about 80 percent of all downloads of Tap Fu were illegally downloaded, and they have a
3987960	3997880	way, I guess, of, um, telling that, and apparently, um, you know, the game, uh, was marked down
3997880	4005540	to 199 and still didn't, you know, affect the piracy rate, which is interesting.
4005540	4009260	You know what this story, do you know, honestly, what my gut reaction was to this story when
4009260	4011040	I read it?
4011040	4014080	I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?
4014080	4015080	How?
4015080	4019460	Um, actually, I have a lot of them open, uh, cause I have a few friends who have jailbroken
4019460	4020460	iPhones.
4020460	4022760	Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?
4022760	4027400	Um, well, he says that he did, but there's other places that, um, I think they do have
4027400	4028560	to be jailbroken to-
4028560	4030640	Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear, huh?
4030640	4033080	Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.
4033080	4037320	I mean, I haven't, I've, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.
4037320	4038800	I was never going to.
4038800	4039800	Me neither.
4039800	4047560	I have a first-gen iPhone, and, um, they're supposed to be, like, super easy on that one.
4047560	4048560	Hmm.
4048560	4052560	That'd be something to do with, like, an iPod touch, I would think.
4052560	4056440	Is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures, though?
4056440	4059980	Because like, if the game didn't sell that much in the first place, and, you know, this
4059980	4064120	handful of people pirated your game, well, then you say a certain percentage has pirated
4064120	4066760	your game when not that many people bought it to begin with?
4066760	4071240	Because maybe the App Store is just too flooded with crap right now, and yours isn't sticking
4071240	4072240	out?
4072240	4075960	Well, they claim, like, for example, this other, um, iPhone developer, Fish Labs, they
4075960	4083400	said their, uh, game Rally Master Pro 3D, um, received a 95% piracy rate on its first
4083400	4089960	day of release, and they said that that equates to about many, a few thousand copies.
4089960	4091280	So.
4091280	4092440	Hmm.
4092440	4094120	Um.
4094120	4095440	I could see that.
4095440	4099280	You know, if we're only talking a couple thousand, I could see that there's a couple thousand
4099280	4105440	people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games, and a lot of pirates, especially with
4105440	4108080	something as little as an iPhone game, because it's not like any of those games are that
4108080	4110040	big, probably just download them to download them.
4110040	4111320	Play them once and throw them away.
4111320	4113480	I would bet you that's what most of those people do.
4113480	4114480	Yeah, probably.
4114480	4119720	That's, well, remember when the, um, uh, Dreamcast piracy was a big thing, that's really, a lot
4119720	4122280	of them was like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.
4122280	4126080	Or, or here's a great example, um, something that came up earlier in the show.
4126080	4127520	Maim ROMs.
4127520	4129040	How many people pirate Maim ROMs?
4129040	4132560	Like, I think that's one of those things, kind of like, everybody does, but no one really
4132560	4133560	talks about it.
4133560	4134560	I do it!
4134560	4136840	Tons of people download the Maim stuff in the 80s.
4136840	4137840	There's a lot of stuff.
4137840	4138840	Those games aren't making money anymore!
4138840	4139840	Who cares?
4139840	4141160	And there's a lot of stuff too, I mean, it's like.
4141160	4145120	I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent, it doesn't matter, I
4145120	4146120	feel justified.
4146120	4148400	There's some games in there, I don't even know what the hell they are, and I'm probably
4148400	4149400	gonna try them.
4149400	4151840	And you play them once, and you delete them.
4151840	4153000	That's still piracy!
4153000	4155360	You're still pirating a game!
4155360	4160880	Well if you tell me where I can find a legit copy of Ms. Nude World 96.
4160880	4162120	Exactly!
4162120	4163600	A lot of these games you get.
4163600	4167980	And that game's not even legitimate anyways, I mean, come on, that's just a hacked piece
4167980	4168980	of crap.
4168980	4170200	God damn, I missed Ms. Nude World 96.
4170200	4171200	I downloaded that just for you!
4171200	4173200	Did you really do have her in the cabinet?
4173200	4174600	I'm putting it in the cabinet.
4174600	4176160	Oh man.
4176160	4177360	Seriously?
4177360	4181780	If you've never played this on Maim, it's the one Maim ROM everybody has to play.
4181780	4185800	Is Ms. Nude World 96.
4185800	4188140	It's so bad.
4188140	4189140	It's awful.
4189140	4192620	I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.
4192620	4198280	Basically it's the game, like, kicks, but it's with naked ladies and then random pictures
4198280	4201060	of demon spawn in there.
4201060	4207660	The front end I'm using is called Hyper Spin, and it has little flash and video previews
4207660	4208780	of each game.
4208780	4212680	So I'm going to get that, you know, song to play over everything when you're selecting
4212680	4214800	the game, which will be pretty funny.
4214800	4218960	Everybody, move your body!
4218960	4219960	It's awesome.
4219960	4223860	But yeah, there's a lot of hacked stuff out there, and it's not practical for people to
4223860	4230260	buy arcade cabinets and stuff, and even still, I mean, a lot of the stuff you're buying second
4230260	4234280	hand anyways, the developers already made their money off that stuff.
4234280	4235380	I don't know.
4235380	4241060	It's not like they're making new Ms. Nude World 96 boards out there.
4241060	4243660	I don't know.
4243660	4248980	Vanus Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new,
4248980	4250780	there's nothing wrong with downloading it.
4250780	4257060	Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.
4257060	4260340	To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.
4260340	4264060	I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to
4264060	4268020	just pirate it, which yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite
4268020	4271380	extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.
4271380	4275620	I don't want to pay like $100 to import a game just because the company doesn't feel
4275620	4276860	like releasing it here.
4276860	4278580	You know what I mean?
4278580	4283980	But that's not to say I really rarely pirate games, like if ever.
4283980	4285180	I actually buy it.
4285180	4286180	Even music anymore.
4286180	4288140	I pretty much buy everything on iTunes.
4288140	4290380	I'm pretty boring.
4290380	4295220	I will say this, it's better to buy them on Amazon, because number one, they're usually
4295220	4299820	cheaper, and number two, they are DRM-free MP3s.
4299820	4305780	Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes, but I don't know, it's just what I use.
4305780	4306780	Convenient.
4306780	4313020	Well, yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.
4313020	4318620	You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.
4318620	4324060	Anyhow, let's move on to another story here, and then we'll get to release dates.
4324060	4326100	Was that all to say about the piracy story?
4326100	4327100	Yeah.
4327100	4328100	It's just crazy.
4328100	4330000	That's really what it is.
4330000	4339900	Going into an article here about Rock Band, apparently there's kind of talk going around
4339900	4345300	that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had
4345300	4347460	with Rock Band The Beatles.
4347460	4350820	Roger Daltrey, who of course is lead singer of The Who, was speaking to the Republican
4350820	4356400	recently saying, quote, the game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.
4356400	4357400	There's one planned.
4357400	4358860	The idea is fabulous.
4358860	4362180	Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.
4362180	4368300	Now, of course, sometimes these old rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.
4368300	4371920	He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made
4371920	4373460	a similar mistake earlier this year.
4373460	4376460	They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.
4376460	4380060	I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge
4380060	4381940	download pack before.
4381940	4386900	And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack that there's
4386900	4391860	so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.
4391860	4392860	I don't know.
4392860	4396380	Do you think The Who would warrant a whole new game?
4396380	4401660	I got to admit, and I'm going to get hate mail over this, but hear me out.
4401660	4405020	I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.
4405020	4410980	I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.
4410980	4411980	I know.
4411980	4412980	Hate me if you want.
4412980	4413980	But let's face it.
4413980	4415900	When was the last time they had a big song?
4415900	4419340	Okay, I know what you're going to say, but what about The Beatles' rock band, Rob?
4419340	4420340	Hold on.
4420340	4421340	Beatles?
4421340	4422340	Whole other stratosphere.
4422340	4425100	There is nothing like The Beatles, okay?
4425100	4426260	Back down to Earth.
4426260	4427260	The Who.
4427260	4428860	When was the last time they had a big hit?
4428860	4429860	Oh, yeah.
4429860	4433100	Before, most of our listeners and the people buying games today were born.
4433100	4435700	Now, will there be an audience for this?
4435700	4439860	Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.
4439860	4440940	Don't agree with me?
4440940	4442100	Then release the damn game.
4442100	4443540	Prove me wrong.
4443540	4445220	It's niche.
4445220	4450380	There could be a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but you know
4450380	4454500	how they do those disc releases of, say, 20-some songs or whatever.
4454500	4460740	I could see that happening, maybe, instead of the metal country track pack.
4460740	4466700	I could see something like the ACDC game that came out a while ago, maybe a live thing that
4466700	4467780	comes out.
4467780	4473320	I could see something like that, but not something like The Beatles' game.
4473320	4480900	The work that was put into that game and everything that went into that, only The Beatles, and
4480900	4483740	only The Beatles, I think, can justify.
4483740	4487020	I honestly can't think, and I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different
4487020	4492420	bands in chat right now and all this, but I really don't think there's any band I can
4492420	4494840	think of that justifies that.
4494840	4500420	Some of the Guitar Hero games, like Metallica, yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.
4500420	4502340	Aerosmith, I can see where they're getting a game.
4502340	4507500	Van Halen, I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license
4507500	4513860	anything after 1984, because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff, but
4513860	4515180	hey, that's just me.
4515180	4519620	Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.
4519620	4524420	Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means
4524420	4528660	the last song in there was 25 years ago, when most of the people buying these games are
4528660	4532620	probably in their young 20s and teens.
4532620	4536620	A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.
4536620	4539140	Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.
4539140	4542980	He's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.
4542980	4546940	So there you go.
4546940	4551860	But again, it's so interesting because every argument I'm saying here against this game,
4551860	4552980	you could say, well, what about the Beatles?
4552980	4553980	What about the Beatles?
4553980	4556180	But the Beatles are the Beatles.
4556180	4558180	There is no comparison.
4558180	4560060	Seriously, try it.
4560060	4561060	There's no comparison.
4561060	4563060	No, I agree with you.
4563060	4566980	So anyhow, that was my little rant.
4566980	4567980	So I'm cool.
4567980	4570700	Hey, you know, I realized, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right
4570700	4572080	now, Rob, how dare you?
4572080	4574740	You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there.
4574740	4577740	And you know, especially like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger
4577740	4583100	group who just has an appreciation for classic rock, you go, Pinball Wizard is an awesome
4583100	4584100	song.
4584100	4587700	There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new 50, $60 game?
4587700	4594900	Oh, no, only for, you know, fans that I don't think are enough in numbers to justify it.
4594900	4602140	But a track pack or a budget game or, you know, something like a re-skinning of, you
4602140	4603140	know, yeah, yeah.
4603140	4604140	The Who justifies that.
4604140	4612220	There is certainly a huge classic rock band, but just not relevant enough in 2009.
4612220	4613220	Hate me all you want.
4613220	4615660	Just tell me how it is.
4615660	4616660	How about some release dates?
4616660	4618660	Haters going to hate.
4618660	4621060	Haters going to hate, exactly.
4621060	4622460	And I'm hating.
4622460	4624380	All right.
4624380	4628860	This guy in chat says, Lady Gaga rock band will be incredible, putting the Beatles to
4628860	4629860	shame.
4629860	4633260	I didn't see it, but I heard about this week's episode of South Park, where apparently they're
4633260	4636820	doing Poker Face and rock band.
4636820	4637820	Hilarious.
4637820	4641460	Did you see Christopher Walken?
4641460	4642460	Yes.
4642460	4643460	Doing Poker Face.
4643460	4644460	Good stuff.
4644460	4647100	I actually think Lady Gaga should get some type of game.
4647100	4650140	Like maybe not now, but maybe after her next album.
4650140	4652820	But and again, you're probably going to, Rob, what the fuck?
4652820	4655660	You just say the Who shouldn't get a game, but Lady Gaga should.
4655660	4658260	But the Lady Gaga game would be like on the Wii.
4658260	4661160	Does that make sense where I'm going with that?
4661160	4663520	It would be on the Wii and in a pink box.
4663520	4664520	You know?
4664520	4665520	It would be a different kind of game.
4665520	4666520	P.S., Rob.
4666520	4667520	What?
4667520	4668520	You're a dork.
4668520	4669520	I know.
4669520	4671420	But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.
4671420	4672940	People bought Britney's dance beat, damn it.
4672940	4674700	Lady Gaga can have a game.
4674700	4675700	All right.
4675700	4676700	Anyhow, sorry.
4676700	4677700	Release dates.
4677700	4678700	Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?
4678700	4679700	No.
4679700	4680700	Not this week, I'm afraid.
4680700	4681700	All right.
4681700	4683180	This week actually started- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4683180	4684620	Tiger Claw chat.
4684620	4685820	Just made me lol.
4685820	4690320	It would be called Lady Gaga game.
4690320	4693820	That's so stupid, yet so funny.
4693820	4694820	Lady Gaga game.
4694820	4698980	Or would that be Lady Gaga me?
4698980	4701160	Anyhow, sorry.
4701160	4702160	I promise.
4702160	4703660	I'm putting the mic down, so I won't interrupt.
4703660	4704660	All right.
4704660	4709060	Starting today, Rabbids Go Home is available on DS and the Wii.
4709060	4714420	Also later this week, Need for Speed Nitro will be out on the DS and the Wii.
4714420	4716860	Coming from Nintendo, Style Savvy.
4716860	4725180	It's a style sim for the DS, which I'm sure is gonna sell millions of copies, except not.

4728020	4732420	My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.
4732420	4739380	This week, Lego Rock Band out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

4744460	4752040	Band Hero also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, as well as
4752040	4753940	the full band bundle as well.
4753940	4758560	If you feel like dropping $200 for that one, you can just get a world tour bundle for about
4758560	4761620	half the price.
4761620	4763580	Imagine Baby's fashion.
4763580	4765860	Imagine me not carrying him at this game.
4765860	4768060	That's available on the DS.

4805500	4806500	Wii Cheer got a sequel?
4806500	4807500	Yes.
4807500	4812460	I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the cat game, President Cat, is
4812460	4814980	the worst Wii game ever made, yet Wii Cheer gets a sequel.
4814980	4816780	I'm just saying.
4816780	4822420	Trust me, anything made by Destineer is the worst Wii game ever.
4822420	4823740	Not President Cat.
4823740	4826740	President Cat's awesome.
4826740	4831680	Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves is making its way out, game only, on the Wii.
4831680	4835100	Of course it's been released before, but now they're kind of re-releasing it, because that's
4835100	4836940	what Konami does.
4836940	4840900	Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

4849980	4851940	Cop the Recruit out on the DS.
4851940	4857500	This one's kind of like what the Grand Theft Auto on the DS should have been.
4857500	4860980	It's like the PSP Grand Theft Autos.
4860980	4866460	And seriously, Konami, what are you doing?
4866460	4871700	Ultimate Party Challenge Bundle with, uh...
4871700	4876220	All right.
4876220	4893380	Sorry, I was looking up preview information on Band Hero.
4893380	4897140	Let's see here, a couple more.
4897140	4903220	Academy of Champions Soccer out on the Wii this week, also featuring the Rabbids.
4903220	4907820	And Hooked Again with the fishing rod, it's your fishing sim.
4907820	4915940	And then also becoming not a Walmart exclusive anymore, Rock Band ACDC Track Pack available
4915940	4921380	on all four systems for now the new low price of $20.
4921380	4929220	And let me tell you this, Munchy probably could get it way cheaper than that.
4929220	4931500	And let's see here, oh, some more random stuff.
4931500	4935700	Team Elimination Games from the Wii, yet another generic party game.
4935700	4940100	Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime
4940100	4941100	a dozen.
4941100	4943260	Or hey, how about this another deer hunting game?
4943260	4950340	Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer, Buck Futter.
4950340	4956620	Oh, and then, how should we forget, but guess what?
4956620	4961460	We Wish You a Merry Christmas, yes, once again, another quality game from Destineer coming
4961460	4969260	out on the Wii, because hey, what Christmas, what would Christmas be without a Christmas
4969260	4971780	themed party game that you'll probably throw away after, you know.
4971780	4977340	We Wish You a Merry Buck Futter.
4977340	4979820	That's the game I'd like to see, Buck Futter.
4979820	4981620	Did you ever see that Celebrity Jeopardy sketch?
4981620	4983140	Oh, forget it.
4983140	4986980	And then lastly, a week from today, Shaun White, Snowboarding World stage of the week coming
4986980	4987980	out on the Wii.
4987980	4989940	And that's it.
4989940	4994140	Moving over to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.
4994140	4997220	Now I want a game called Buck Futter, just to say I have it.
4997220	4999420	Can we get that on like the indie games marketplace?
4999420	5003580	Xbox 360 in Japan, we get Fallout 3, gets a price reduction over there, Dirt 2 gets
5003580	5008420	its release in Japan, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out, I'm assuming that's very
5008420	5013780	similar to collection what we got over here before, NBA Live 10 comes out, and Taiyutama
5013780	5017340	Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.
5017340	5018540	That sounds dirty.
5018540	5022660	It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DD, like it's something that, you know, like kiss
5022660	5023660	my grits.
5023660	5028140	But no, I believe this is actually based on an anime, it's another adventure game based
5028140	5029620	on an anime.
5029620	5033580	Taiyutama I think is an anime, so there you go.
5033580	5037420	Also coming out, World Soccer winning 11 2010, of course soccer games are always huge releases
5037420	5041860	in every country but the US, and they sell decent here I'm sure too.
5041860	5046740	And there's also an Xbox 360 Elite Bundle, if you are doubting how big this game is,
5046740	5050260	it's getting bundled over there in Japan, if you are curious about that.
5050260	5052160	That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
5052160	5055900	On the Playstation 3, a game we're going to talk about a little bit later on, 3D Dot Game
5055900	5056900	Heroes comes out.
5056900	5061780	I just want to point out, region free, if you want to import it, but we'll talk a little
5061780	5063740	more later about why you might not want to.
5063740	5067900	Dirt 2 comes out as well on Playstation 3, Infamous gets its release in Japan this week
5067900	5069940	as well as NBA Live 10.
5069940	5075180	And of course World Soccer winning 11 2010, also a Playstation 3 Bundle.
5075180	5078580	Have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles?
5078580	5079580	That's kind of interesting.
5079580	5086520	I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten, warranted the two different
5086520	5088020	systems being bundled with it.
5088020	5089020	Interesting.
5089020	5090020	Lego Batman.
5090020	5091020	Oh, good call.
5091020	5093020	That's Playstation 2 on the Xbox 360.
5093020	5095900	Nintendo Wii gets a few releases in Japan as well.
5095900	5100100	Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo, I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.
5100100	5103180	But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario and Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.
5103180	5106180	Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.
5106180	5108780	And Mario and Sonic at the Olympics actually sold pretty well.
5108780	5113140	Like I know a lot of gamer enthusiasts kind of poo-poo those games, but they actually
5113140	5115620	sold pretty well, right?
5115620	5119660	So the sequel now, I guess you could say, the Vancouver Olympics is coming out just
5119660	5124100	in time for the Olympics over in Japan as well.
5124100	5126860	Playstation 2 is really slowing down with their releases in Japan as well.
5126860	5130940	They only have a price reduction to look forward to in Metal Gear Solid 3 this week on the
5130940	5131940	Playstation 2.
5131940	5135340	Nintendo DS has a handful of releases, it's getting pretty busy over there in Japan.
5135340	5140020	Wire Way comes out as well as Tamagotchi, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
5140020	5145100	No Nari-kiri Shaniru, I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.
5145100	5150980	Lemon Knight X Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS, and Sakura Note, Imanitsu
5150980	5155580	Nagaru Mirai comes out from Marvelous Entertainment on the Nintendo DS.
5155580	5158500	Lastly, onto the PSP and the releases they have there.
5158500	5165260	Dirt 2 gets a release on the PSP as well, as well as Suikoden 1 and 2 gets a price reduction.
5165260	5168980	They released that in Japan, bundled and redone for the PSP, it's getting a price reduction
5168980	5169980	this week.
5169980	5175620	Nintendo NBA Live 10, Naruto, another one of those games, moves into the price reduction.
5175620	5181500	Also getting a price reduction, Valhalla Knights 2 gets a price reduction this week.
5181500	5184580	Let's move over to Europe.
5184580	5186860	We have a number of releases.
5186860	5194260	We have on the 4th, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the 6th, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins,
5194260	5203700	Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues, Need for Speed Nitro
5203700	5211420	Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala Wii Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront League Squadron.
5211420	5213620	Very cool.
5213620	5214620	Yep.
5214620	5216620	Pretty interesting stuff I think.
5216620	5217620	Yep.
5217620	5228540	Alright, well many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween
5228540	5232660	morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.
5232660	5238700	Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning, mainly targeting
5238700	5242660	people that were downloading certain games.
5242660	5247300	If you may remember, I think we talked about it last week, they were cracking down on people
5247300	5254500	downloading Forza 3 and Borderlands early, of course it makes it a lot easier for them
5254500	5259860	to track that kind of stuff when the game's not out yet, and so because of that they've
5259860	5266340	taken action against some people, and of course with each update that the console gets with
5266340	5272300	each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles, so it's kind
5272300	5273860	of interesting though.
5273860	5279020	You know, myself, I have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on
5279020	5280020	Live, so.
5280020	5282660	Yeah, but you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online, right?
5282660	5286060	We played modded Grand Theft Auto's online all the time.
5286060	5287060	Really?
5287060	5288060	Yeah, no problem.
5288060	5294380	But see, here's my theory on that though, is that they have ways of individually checking
5294380	5300140	consoles to see if the game is modded, like the console's modded, but it doesn't, for
5300140	5305300	them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess would be impossible for
5305300	5309060	them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.
5309060	5315180	So what they are doing is waiting for these high profile games like Call of Duty, Modern
5315180	5320620	Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that
5320620	5325940	are playing it online, okay now we have a list of a hundred people to check on, versus
5325940	5329500	a list of two million.
5329500	5333780	I was wondering how they could tell the difference between somebody who just happened to get
5333780	5336260	the game early at a store, and somebody who pirated it.
5336260	5337580	So I get it now, so that's how customers are called.
5337580	5342620	They probably have a way to check while you're playing online, because there's no way, I
5342620	5347580	don't think there's a way for them to check if you're playing offline, but it's harder,
5347580	5351340	that's why a lot of the, you know, if you're downloading stuff, they'll recommend that
5351340	5355900	you play it offline until the game streets, and you know, I'm sure that there's going
5355900	5361060	to be a way that they're going to eventually figure out that hey, you know, if you've burned
5361060	5366400	something or you're playing a backup disc that they're going to find you, but once again
5366400	5370100	also they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives, they just release the
5370100	5374660	new firmware to support what they call the wave 4 discs, because basically each disc
5374660	5379220	that comes out they have the current update in there, there's also a video track that
5379220	5383260	if you're a dumb idiot that puts your 360 in a DVD player that says hey stupid, this
5383260	5395620	is a 360 game, not a video, so you know, and they check the sizes of those to make sure
5395620	5401940	that it's consistent with a good burn of the disc, and also there's a security sector that's
5401940	5409140	on each disc that they verify based on a retail copy and whatnot, so that's how they have
5409140	5416940	all these backup plans to make sure that you have a legit burned copy or a copy that is
5416940	5423580	pretty much undetectable as far as the differences and whatnot, but yeah, basically each side,
5423580	5431620	you know, both Microsoft and the pirates, they keep updating their tactics, so it'll
5431620	5433620	never end.
5433620	5439300	Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs, and honestly if
5439300	5442900	you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what,
5442900	5447620	you kind of deserve it, so there it is.
5447620	5453700	By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, IkumaJP,
5453700	5457860	one of our listeners in Japan who has really been just a great listener for us because
5457860	5461580	he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes
5461580	5465620	because we're so far away, he actually linked us to a news article talking about how only
5465620	5469940	30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go, and you know how sometimes like in Japan,
5469940	5475120	line, line, line, line, only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go, you never found those sales
5475120	5476120	figures, huh?
5476120	5478020	Oh, I didn't even look, it probably gives you a good idea.
5478020	5480300	Well, I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.
5480300	5481300	That's alright.
5481300	5485020	Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, it's
5485020	5488720	where DarkSakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you
5488720	5494380	guys should really check out, it's called the Classic Game of the Week.
5494380	5500420	Oh DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?
5500420	5503260	Apparently an incomplete link.
5503260	5504260	There we go.
5504260	5516340	Um, the game that I picked was, um, Seaman, not to be confused with sperm, so, um, hello?
5516340	5523580	So what month is your- Because, as I neglected to put on the little
5523580	5529580	thing, there's no background music in this game, so what I put up is an actual example
5529580	5534580	of conversation in the game that I found in Tesly Hilarious from some guy's YouTube.
5534580	5537260	Okay, so wait, shall I play this again then?
5537260	5538260	In a minute.
5538260	5539260	Okay, go ahead.
5539260	5542700	Well then you get the cutesy music this week.
5542700	5552540	Um, anyway, um, the game Seaman is actually for the US version, it was narrated by Leonard
5552540	5559020	Nimoy, which is pretty freaking cool, and it uses a microphone, it came out on the Dreamcast,
5559020	5568140	and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them, and they turn into these fish
5568140	5573260	with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something.
5573260	5581700	And they talk to you, and, um, you can have conversations with them, and as they go you
5581700	5586940	have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff, as well
5586940	5595460	as prepare a terrarium, because, um, you're going to, um, eventually, uh, let them evolve
5595460	5598460	into a fog and then they're going to run away.
5598460	5599460	So...
5599460	5600460	Jesus Christ!
5600460	5602540	They're so needy and then they just dump ya?
5602540	5603540	Kinda.
5603540	5604900	Kick those seamen to the curb.
5604900	5611140	But you, but you can, um, uh, they breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just
5611140	5612780	kinda weird.
5612780	5621580	Um, but your first stage is a mushroomer, which is, um, what they, uh, originally look
5621580	5627740	like, and then you have Gillman, and there's the ones that go mar mar mar, that's all I
5627740	5628740	remember them saying.
5628740	5637180	Um, and you get Podfish, and then after they mate the male Podfish dies, and then you get
5637180	5650060	Tadman, and Frogman, and, um, it's a very weird little game, but very fun, um, I remember
5650060	5657300	watching Dan talk to his fish for, uh, a long time, and it also had, uh, Crispus Seaman
5657300	5663380	that came out in Japan, it also had a Red Translucent Greek Dreamcast with it, and then
5663380	5671860	there was a PS2, um, uh, version that got released later on, and, um, then there was
5671860	5678140	a sequel that came out, which is a lot more, uh, evolution involved, you know, so, it is
5678140	5679740	a fun little game.
5679740	5683740	Now even though you were making, like, fish and frogs, you never, like, ate them, so you
5683740	5691140	weren't, like, swallowing the Seaman, right?
5691140	5692140	Just checking.
5692140	5697580	Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue, so you can hear some dude interact with his
5697580	5698580	...
5698580	5699580	This is intensely hilarious.
5699580	5700580	Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his Seaman.
5700580	5701580	Your birthday in...
5701580	5704460	October.
5704460	5706340	You were born in October?
5706340	5707340	Ye-yes.
5707340	5710740	Let's try that again.
5710740	5715300	In what month were you born?
5715300	5717620	October.
5717620	5720060	You were born in October?
5720060	5721340	Yes.
5721340	5727100	I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?
5727100	5729500	Treat.
5729500	5732300	Like the spice?
5732300	5733900	Yes.
5733900	5737540	Well, you can look, but don't touch.
5737540	5739660	This makes no fucking sense.
5739660	5740660	I know, it's great.
5740660	5742140	Just keep going, because I like the part where you're so much the fuck off.
5742140	5746860	I don't want to touch you.
5746860	5748580	What do you want?
5748580	5750780	To touch you.
5750780	5752580	I don't know that word.
5752580	5754860	You just said it.
5754860	5758660	So, what day is your birthday on?
5758660	5760020	Second.
5760020	5762140	The second?
5762140	5764660	Yes, bitch.
5764660	5768900	Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
5768900	5771900	I hope you are as peaceful as he.
5771900	5778460	I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
5778460	5779460	By the way, this is from...
5779460	5780460	Fuck you.
5780460	5788780	Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.
5788780	5792100	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
5792100	5795100	Fuck them.
5795100	5797460	I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.
5797460	5802700	Ebola World is the name of the E-B-O-L-A World, okay, just before I play the rest of this.
5802700	5803700	Fuck them.
5803700	5808420	Hey, why all the noise?
5808420	5809420	Your mama.
5809420	5810420	What?
5810420	5811420	Your mama.
5811420	5812420	Mama.
5812420	5813420	Nope.
5813420	5814420	I'm just fine.
5814420	5815420	Wait.
5815420	5824940	Sorry, I'm busy.
5824940	5826780	You don't look busy.
5826780	5833980	I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
5833980	5837900	I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
5837900	5840740	Just don't get any ideas about me.
5840740	5846740	Let's just be friends, for now.
5846740	5849700	I'll friend your butt.
5849700	5852620	Are you coming on to me?
5852620	5854620	Yes.
5854620	5856620	Yes.
5856620	5863740	Put this tongue in that mouth, dream on.
5863740	5864740	No food for you.
5864740	5878180	Now, go think about what I've said, and we'll talk again later.
5878180	5883020	Rob is red in the case, this is fantastic.
5883020	5884660	We need to get this game immediately.
5884660	5885660	I haven't.
5885660	5886660	Do you really?
5886660	5887660	Hold on.
5887660	5891340	Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the
5891340	5893540	games we play for an hour.
5893540	5897220	That was awesome.
5897220	5903220	Oh, there you go.
5903220	5907820	That's why this is a classic game.
5907820	5912500	Oh, she just brought out the game.
5912500	5913500	See, man?
5913500	5914500	There it is on the Dreamcast.
5914500	5918960	They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.
5918960	5922140	I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.
5922140	5925060	Big thanks to the YouTube user Ebola World for the lulls there.
5925060	5930580	That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.
5930580	5935460	Pictures going up on the site.
5935460	5938100	Gameguru in chat says, C-Man 3 for the Wii.
5938100	5941100	I agree.
5941100	5942340	Then they could call it Butt Friends.
5942340	5944660	I don't know what they're going to call it.
5944660	5949660	All right, anyhow, clearly, we need to take a break here in studio.
5949660	5952540	We'll be right back, though, with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news
5952540	5957940	stories tonight, including some rapid-fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on
5957940	5962100	the N-Gage, probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.
5962100	5967860	All right, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5967860	5969860	Stay tuned.
5969860	5978340	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the
5978340	5979740	1st of 2009.
5979740	5982540	Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.
5982540	5990780	For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
5990780	5993780	every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
5993780	5998860	I hope nobody missed it tonight because of the whole Daylight Savings thing, but if you
5998860	6004780	don't live in an area that celebrates or recognizes Daylight Savings Time, just know this is the
6004780	6006780	good month for Daylight Savings Time.
6006780	6012380	This is what they call fall back, when we get to gain an hour of sleep at night.
6012380	6016220	The other one that happens in the spring when you spring forward, that one sucks because
6016220	6022700	you lose an hour of sleep, but everybody hopefully is well rested after a hopefully happy Halloween.
6022700	6025740	So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and
6025740	6026740	safe Halloween.
6026740	6030860	Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from
6030860	6032620	the classic game of the week.
6032620	6035940	We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll
6035940	6037740	get into Twitter topics after that.
6037740	6040940	So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.
6040940	6047220	Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this would be the classic Doom.
6047220	6053900	The original, well, not the original first person shooter, but second or third.
6053900	6054900	Pretty close.
6054900	6059540	Anyways, that'll be coming out quite soon, and actually, it's kind of funny, I read that
6059540	6065780	the guy that designed the logo and, I guess, title screen for Doom died.
6065780	6072780	So I guess that sort of ties in there.
6072780	6078660	Majesco is publishing a new DSi game, I guess it's a DSiWare game, actually.
6078660	6084560	It's going to be called Ghostwire, and it's what you would call an augmented reality game.
6084560	6093020	You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts,
6093020	6101460	in which case, then you capture them, I guess, sort of like, I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort
6101460	6102460	of.
6102460	6106140	You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame, I don't really know if that's capturing.
6106140	6109780	Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.
6109780	6112380	Hopefully it's not too expensive.
6112380	6118220	And then, finally, Frogger is returning, because, God forbid, Frogger should leave.
6118220	6125180	Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the Playstation Network, and it's a brand
6125180	6131220	new game with the classic Frogger gameplay, and rats that are absolutely huge.
6131220	6136540	In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway
6136540	6138340	car, so we should be concerned.
6138340	6143340	Must be in New York.
6143340	6147320	Interesting that Frogger is being done yet again, but I guess those games are popular,
6147320	6148820	that they aren't popular enough.
6148820	6152540	I remember when it came out on the Playstation a little while ago, well, I guess more than
6152540	6156220	a little while ago, when it came out on the very first Playstation, it was kind of cool,
6156220	6161780	the reimagining of it, but then it got really repetitive.
6161780	6165740	The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was
6165740	6166740	12.
6166740	6171000	Alright, anyhow, I've got a bunch of music game-based news for you guys tonight, starting
6171000	6176580	off with ACDC Rock Band, as Loki kind of mentioned a little bit before, it is now not only available
6176580	6180700	at Walmart, it is actually available everywhere now, including places like Gamestop and so
6180700	6181700	forth.
6181700	6183860	It is available right now.
6183860	6190260	It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.
6190260	6192540	It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.
6192540	6195100	And that's just when the game stops charging for it.
6195100	6199300	Not necessarily what the price will have to be.
6199300	6203980	So maybe other retailers might be charging like $15 for it if you know where to look.
6203980	6205340	Probably go as low as $9.
6205340	6206340	Wow.
6206340	6207340	That might be exciting.
6207340	6211140	Well, if ACDC doesn't interest you, maybe some of the other bands coming to Rock Band
6211140	6212140	will.
6212140	6214820	Of course, these are download songs that are coming out, and this is what's coming out
6214820	6215820	next week.
6215820	6217020	It's a Foo Fighters pack.
6217020	6220580	It's the third pack of Foo Fighters songs coming out with Best of You, The Pretender,
6220580	6222140	Wheels, and Word Forward.
6222140	6226580	Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out, including About a Girl, Blue,
6226580	6229340	and School, and a Joan Jett song coming out.
6229340	6233660	Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week.
6233660	6237340	Of course, if you're playing on PSP, there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and
6237340	6242580	System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged.
6242580	6247680	And lastly from me tonight, Guitar Hero is also getting some download content.
6247680	6252140	They are getting a variety of things throughout November.
6252140	6256540	Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.
6256540	6261220	Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so
6261220	6263140	this should be fun to jam to.
6263140	6265260	Those are going to be out on November 12th.
6265260	6270140	November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from KISS, Modern Day Delilah, Lick
6270140	6272580	It Up, and I Was Made for Lovin' You.
6272580	6276020	Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.
6276020	6281940	It's free, but it's bands that feature Neversoft employees, so definitely indie bands, and
6281940	6285140	these are songs that you probably have never heard of.
6285140	6288740	But hey, sometimes playing songs by bands you've never heard of is how you find your
6288740	6290800	new favorite song, so that'll be free.
6290800	6294220	You certainly don't have any excuse not to check that out.
6294220	6296680	DarkSakura?
6296680	6302980	For anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content, there actually will be some stuff
6302980	6312580	out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live, or at least if you're in Europe, it'll be
6312580	6316380	497 pounds on PSN.
6316380	6326380	There is a 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga, which is pretty funny.
6326380	6336300	There will be Gorillaz and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool, and then on the 24th
6336300	6349300	we get the David Guetta mix pack, which is one called When Love Takes Over, and Sexy
6349300	6354140	Chick, and On the Dance Floor, and a few other things.
6354140	6357220	Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge
6357220	6359620	club song.
6359620	6361140	It's a big, big dance song.
6361140	6364500	Like Energy 927, Before They Win Under, that was their number one song on the station,
6364500	6369700	so that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.
6369700	6373300	And those songs that came out this last week, both very good.
6373300	6378180	The Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing.
6378180	6380060	I like the other one better.
6380060	6381060	It's good too.
6381060	6383060	That's the Gorillaz and Dare.
6383060	6389340	That was with Public Enemy.
6389340	6393160	I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillaz
6393160	6398180	in it, there's like four or five Gorillaz mashup things in it.
6398180	6410780	Keep in mind, their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his
6410780	6416180	big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey Album, which got him in a lot
6416180	6417180	of trouble.
6417180	6418180	Oh, I remember that.
6418180	6419180	Okay.
6419180	6424340	So it makes me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.
6424340	6425340	Never thought of it that way.
6425340	6426340	All right.
6426340	6428340	Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.
6428340	6432900	We don't have a whole lot making the cut tonight, but I do want to acknowledge a couple of tweets
6432900	6433900	that we got here.
6433900	6437740	And of course, part of that's my fault because I didn't put up the request for Twitter topics
6437740	6438740	until like an hour ago.
6438740	6441100	But anyhow, Spazinator PSN on Twitter.
6441100	6446060	Again, you can always follow us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Spazinator PSN
6446060	6452060	wants to know, not so much a topic, but a debate, the pros and cons of both Sony's and
6452060	6457700	Microsoft's video marketplaces, i.e. compare and contrast, et cetera.
6457700	6458700	Hmm.
6458700	6460100	Well, I've used both.
6460100	6462740	I've downloaded stuff on both of them.
6462740	6469740	I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.
6469740	6473700	Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture
6473700	6479140	studio, so, you know, they get movies there, but I find that there's a better selection
6479140	6480140	on Microsoft.
6480140	6482700	I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like there's more stuff available on Microsoft,
6482700	6485100	but honestly, neither one really has the stuff I really want.
6485100	6487540	I have to go to Netflix for all the good stuff.
6487540	6489180	And I wish both of them had more HD.
6489180	6490180	I don't know.
6490180	6492180	Loki, you ever played around with this stuff?
6492180	6493180	Nope.
6493180	6494180	You don't ever really use a video marketplace?
6494180	6495180	Actually, I take that back.
6495180	6502700	One time we rented Dark City on the Xbox 360 video marketplace.
6502700	6503700	And got what you paid for?
6503700	6504700	All that good stuff?
6504700	6505700	Yep.
6505700	6506700	It was Dark City.
6506700	6507980	I like that movie.
6507980	6511260	I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.
6511260	6513860	I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.
6513860	6519340	So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's
6519340	6522740	not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.
6522740	6525620	Well now, though, with the new, what is it, when they're going to be converting it to
6525620	6529300	the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer
6529300	6531740	it to your Zune HD or something like that.
6531740	6532740	That's true.
6532740	6535500	So Spassinator, you might want to ask that question again in like two weeks when that
6535500	6540100	new little patch comes out, which obviously my 360 is broken, so I'm not in the preview
6540100	6541100	program.
6541100	6542780	I'm really excited about the Last.fm support.
6542780	6543780	I think that's kind of cool.
6543780	6545620	I still haven't played with it.
6545620	6549660	I prefer Last.fm Pandora, personally, because it makes a lot of recommendations based off
6549660	6550940	your own plays.
6550940	6553620	Don't use either one, but whatever.
6553620	6561580	Anyhow, ActDept sent us a link that's called The 10 Biggest WTF Games of All Time.
6561580	6566220	This is from a site, bravenewgamer.com, so let me run down this list that ActDept sent
6566220	6569240	us from bravenewgamer.com.
6569240	6571020	Number 10, Jet Set Radio Future.
6571020	6572340	Isn't that weird?
6572340	6576160	For a game, it was really different.
6576160	6580180	Number 9, Space Giraffe, also known as Tempest on Acid.
6580180	6581780	That game was just a huge disappointment.
6581780	6585760	I didn't like Space Giraffe one bit, and I loved Tempest 2000.
6585760	6590500	Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.
6590500	6591500	It's not a WTF game.
6591500	6593500	I don't think it's a WTF game, either.
6593500	6596860	I think the writers put that there for shock value.
6596860	6597860	Number 7, Shaq-Fu.
6597860	6599740	Now, there's a good WTF game.
6599740	6600740	That's a good one.
6600740	6602740	But wasn't that kind of decent?
6602740	6605180	No, Shaq-Fu is ridiculous.
6605180	6607540	But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.
6607540	6609620	They had a fan sequel, too, that's even better.
6609620	6610620	Are you feeling okay?
6610620	6611620	Yeah.
6611620	6614500	Number 6, Big Rigs Over the Road Racing.
6614500	6617980	It's just a horribly bad...
6617980	6620300	It's not even really deserving of attention.
6620300	6623700	I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.
6623700	6625660	Actually, it's quite boring.
6625660	6628620	Number 5 is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which...
6628620	6629620	I don't know if...
6629620	6630620	That's like some tie-in.
6630620	6631620	I don't think that's really strange.
6631620	6634820	That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.
6634820	6640420	I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but...
6640420	6642700	It's Sega, and Sega loves Michael Jackson.
6642700	6644580	And the game actually was pretty awesome.
6644580	6647620	I don't know if I can really consider that a WTF game.
6647620	6654660	It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.
6654660	6655980	Number 4, Monster Party.
6655980	6657860	I don't even remember this game.
6657860	6658860	I don't even know what that is.
6658860	6659860	It was on the NES.
6659860	6662320	I don't even know what the hell that game was.
6662320	6664860	Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.
6664860	6666660	Okay, I give credit.
6666660	6668260	That's a WTF game.
6668260	6670580	Number 2, Custer's Revenge.
6670580	6675260	You can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.
6675260	6681380	This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.
6681380	6685740	Number 1, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but
6685740	6686740	again, a lot of effing fun.
6686740	6687740	You know what game is missing from that list?
6687740	6688740	That list sucked.
6688740	6689740	What's that?
6689740	6690740	You know what game is missing from that list?
6690740	6691740	What game is missing from that list?
6691740	6692740	WTF.
6692740	6693740	That's right.
6693740	6695420	There was a game called WTF.
6695420	6701620	Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which
6701620	6703260	is definitely a WTF game.
6703260	6704260	Choaniki is...
6704260	6705260	Yeah.
6705260	6706260	And Noby Noby Boy.
6706260	6709260	I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.
6709260	6713580	But thank you anyway to ACT-F for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion
6713580	6714580	on that list.
6714580	6715580	That was a horrible list.
6715580	6716580	Yeah, it wasn't that great.
6716580	6717580	No, seriously.
6717580	6721580	I mean, I can think of a couple already, I mean, Oonga Boonga.
6721580	6724660	Yeah, Oonga Boonga is definitely a WTF game.
6724660	6727380	There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.
6727380	6730540	It's another arcade game that's really weird.
6730540	6733220	XLink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.
6733220	6734660	There was the Spice Girls game.
6734660	6735980	That was kind of strange.
6735980	6737880	It was hilarious, though.
6737880	6742020	There was another game where you played a UFO, or not a UFO, an alien or something.
6742020	6744140	It was a Sega game where you scared people.
6744140	6745540	I don't remember what that was called.
6745540	6746540	Incredible Crisis.
6746540	6751060	I'm not, that's the game, I mean, that would be a good...
6751060	6753380	That is a good WTF game.
6753380	6756140	Irritating Stick.
6756140	6759780	Somebody in chat, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible
6759780	6760780	game?
6760780	6764900	I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.
6764900	6769220	Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.
6769220	6773860	Zombies versus, or was it, Ambulance versus Zombies.
6773860	6778380	Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.
6778380	6782260	Or they had, I'm trying to think if there's some other weird ones.
6782260	6786380	There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.
6786380	6789220	Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.
6789220	6792740	That was a great entry too, good job.
6792740	6795280	So there you go.
6795280	6798580	We just already came up with 10 games, I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.
6798580	6801860	Here's another weird one, Goo Goo Soundy.
6801860	6803660	Which I think I have this somewhere.
6803660	6806540	And who could forget, President Cat is a little bit WTF.
6806540	6814820	No, no, apart from that, also, Vibribin, C-Man.
6814820	6817420	C-Man's a little bit WTF.
6817420	6821020	That guy right there, he probably like, his editor or whatever said, listen, you gotta
6821020	6822380	write an article for this guy.
6822380	6826760	Gotta get something that's gonna get on Dig, and Dig loves top 10 lists.
6826760	6830980	So think of a top 10 list that you haven't seen on Dig yet, and just throw some games
6830980	6832460	out there that'll get people talking.
6832460	6837580	Go even weirder, MojiBribin, which was even more bizarre than Vibribin.
6837580	6843860	Anyhow, Act F wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since RenoE is kind of like
6843860	6847880	a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet
6847880	6849820	President Cat, nowhere to be seen?
6849820	6850820	Hmm.
6850820	6852340	Who wants to be President Kitty?
6852340	6856060	Perhaps, uh, they need to bring it over to my house.
6856060	6860740	They need to give out copies of that game, you know, with like, purchases at say, PetSmart
6860740	6864700	or something like that, you know, go the whole sneak king route.
6864700	6865700	That's a good idea.
6865700	6868100	Alright, let's move on with some more long form news.
6868100	6872460	Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.
6872460	6880020	Um, well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on, that would
6880020	6881340	be the Nokia N-Gage.
6881340	6889740	Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage, um, honestly, to me this seems
6889740	6895720	like one of those situations where like you're, you know, the N-Gage is your like, grandparent
6895720	6901260	or something that was, had died in their apartment months ago and they just now went to visit
6901260	6903300	them and found them lying there rotting.
6903300	6905940	I mean, this is pretty much, you know, the N-Gage.
6905940	6911360	I think it was dead a long time ago, and we just now are kind of acknowledging the fact
6911360	6914380	that we haven't heard from the N-Gage in a while, maybe better check and see if they're
6914380	6917660	still alive.
6917660	6920140	God bless them for trying.
6920140	6921140	They were dedicated.
6921140	6923500	God bless them for not trying that hard, though.
6923500	6928380	That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled
6928380	6931460	the sounds of decaying in her cats.
6931460	6932460	Which is a true story.
6932460	6933460	Ew!
6933460	6934460	That's what I think of.
6934460	6935460	Gross.
6935460	6940420	It's not a show if I don't gross out Rob at least once.
6940420	6943700	Which goes to show you that cats are popular.
6943700	6948500	Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying Game Boy is for kids,
6948500	6952740	and that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage, and I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.
6952740	6956940	So um, Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.
6956940	6962340	They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because
6962340	6963860	the N-Gage didn't work.
6963860	6967580	And this little thing called the iPhone came out, whoops!
6967580	6971220	Just didn't know how to do it right, you just don't make your system look like a taco.
6971220	6972220	No side taco.
6972220	6973220	Ooh, I want a taco.
6973220	6974220	You know what sounds good right now?
6974220	6975220	Jim Boys.
6975220	6976220	Mmm, taco.
6976220	6977860	Don't make that face start talking.
6977860	6980980	No, Jim Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.
6980980	6981980	Really?
6981980	6982980	Yes.
6982980	6985980	That's like, that's like me and Chipotle.
6985980	6988300	Does it make you bleed out of your head?
6988300	6989300	Don't be disgusting.
6989300	6995820	All right, moving into uh, if the show could distance itself from South Park.
6995820	7001460	Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man, or Explosion Man of course is a game
7001460	7005160	on the Xbox 360, it got an update this week.
7005160	7009500	Now there are some Avatar awards, you know, you can actually get clothes for your Avatar
7009500	7013500	now, and they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game, which is pretty
7013500	7014500	cool.
7014500	7019580	Also, what's very interesting about this is that the um, developers Twisted Pixel has
7019580	7027620	teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in, it wants mood, hundreds
7027620	7030600	of top quality steak fillets.
7030600	7036160	You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pic, and then if you play
7036160	7043380	some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak for playing Splosion Man.
7043380	7047540	Yeah, they keep trying to get me to buy their steaks because I bought steaks for like some
7047540	7053980	of our game publishers a while back, and they will not stop hounding me to buy more steaks,
7053980	7060100	and I'm like, listen, that was a one time thing man, I don't want to buy more steak
7060100	7067540	from you, it's expensive and your steak, well, it is steak, and you know, I'd rather go to
7067540	7070340	the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.
7070340	7075060	I own a Tropic in chat, I knew somebody was going to say it, it says, I'm a vegetarian.
7075060	7077020	So yeah, what do the vegetarians get?
7077020	7078020	Tofu.
7078020	7079020	Nothing.
7079020	7080580	I guess, can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?
7080580	7081580	They have cake.
7081580	7082580	They sell cake.
7082580	7083580	Do they?
7083580	7084580	Oh, the steak people sell cake?
7084580	7085580	Yeah.
7085580	7089420	And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.
7089420	7093900	I guess that might work, if the place is giving you a gift certificate I guess you could do
7093900	7094900	that.
7094900	7095900	Or baked potatoes.
7095900	7096900	They have baked potatoes.
7096900	7097900	You know a lot about this company.
7097900	7098900	They've obviously given you a sales pitch.
7098900	7100580	I bought me steaks from there.
7100580	7101860	What did you buy steak for?
7101860	7106700	I was buttering up some of my publishers.
7106700	7107700	And I also bought it for my...
7107700	7109140	Wait, so you bought the game publisher's steak?
7109140	7110140	Yeah, they're reps.
7110140	7112620	Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?
7112620	7114260	Maybe that's where they got the idea from.
7114260	7115260	No.
7115260	7116260	Maybe they were like...
7116260	7117260	They're a developer, not a publisher.
7117260	7119500	Oh yeah, duh, my bad.
7119500	7123660	I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.
7123660	7129060	No, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.
7129060	7132020	I don't remember if it was last year or the year before last.
7132020	7134620	That just seems weird though, because they would have to FedEx them to you or something?
7134620	7135620	Yeah, they FedEx them.
7135620	7136620	It comes in a...
7136620	7139420	Actually, I had my dad send it to me.
7139420	7146300	It comes in a big old styrofoam cooler with dry ice in it, and they put steaks and burgers
7146300	7148140	and whatnot.
7148140	7155260	You can get crab, lobster, it's just it's not worth it buying.
7155260	7156660	There's plenty of other places.
7156660	7161860	And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me
7161860	7162860	that's...
7162860	7164460	I'll just go buy from there.
7164460	7168900	All right, well, we're going to get into our mailbag segment.
7168900	7172620	And every week you guys send in emails, and Dark Soccer likes to pick a few of her favorites
7172620	7175020	and read them live on air for all of you to hear.
7175020	7177480	I'm going to ask Dark Soccer though, are you okay to do this tonight, or do you want me
7177480	7178480	to do it?
7178480	7179480	With your voice and everything?
7179480	7180480	I can try.
7180480	7182020	All right, Dark Soccer is going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.
7182020	7185900	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com and read some emails for you guys right now.
7185900	7189220	I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had any to do.
7189220	7190220	There's just two.
7190220	7191220	All right, then let's read them.
7191220	7195220	So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery
7195220	7196940	because I'm an impatient bastard.
7196940	7200060	Anyway, the game is weird, but fun kind of.
7200060	7203420	I can't figure out half of the mini games because my Japanese isn't that good, and some
7203420	7205180	of the games may just be broken.
7205180	7209980	But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear
7209980	7212900	playing one of the exercise mini games from the game.
7212900	7217060	It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.
7217060	7220460	If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.
7220460	7224660	Cheers AZHP.
7224660	7226020	I can open that up right now.
7226020	7227700	I'll go dig it in the mailbag.
7227700	7228700	It's only 40 seconds?
7228700	7229700	Yeah.
7229700	7230700	Oh, that's not that bad.
7230700	7233180	Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.
7233180	7234740	I'll fringe your butt.
7234740	7237220	I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.
7237220	7238220	Go for it.
7238220	7239220	Hey guys.
7239220	7240220	Happy hallows end.
7240220	7244280	I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with
7244280	7248060	a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a tingle costume handing out
7248060	7249140	candy.
7249140	7250140	Just a thought.
7250140	7251140	And that's from cheeseburger.
7251140	7252980	Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?
7252980	7254980	Just a tingle.
7254980	7257020	Shut up.
7257020	7258020	I don't know.
7258020	7261580	It didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.
7261580	7264660	Have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Lawn's radio?
7264660	7265660	This will be a first.
7265660	7266660	I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.
7266660	7267660	What's that?
7267660	7269660	I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.
7269660	7270660	Let me double check.
7270660	7274060	Wouldn't you think that would be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something?
7274060	7275060	I would think.
7275060	7276060	I guess it kind of depends on what's going on.
7276060	7277060	It is indeed on a Sunday.
7277060	7278060	I guess it depends.
7278060	7279060	Well, it's a year away.
7279060	7280060	We'll see.
7280060	7282980	Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?
7282980	7284540	Remind us in a year.
7284540	7290340	Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas, so.
7290340	7293660	Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.
7293660	7294660	Or with one of the C-Man.
7294660	7297060	You can just sit here and do the show.
7297060	7298060	I'll be your friend.
7298060	7299060	Anyhow.
7299060	7301060	I'll friend your butt.
7301060	7305460	I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the
7305460	7306460	C-Man.
7306460	7309980	Oh, so like when one of our serial callers calls in, like the people they get on every
7309980	7310980	week.
7310980	7311980	Like the spasinator calls in.
7311980	7312980	I could wire that up.
7312980	7315380	Have it be a segment talk to C-Man.
7315380	7317100	You could wire that up.
7317100	7318100	The word.
7318100	7322860	Yeah, but keep in mind you have to check them every day because it runs on the Dreamcast
7322860	7323860	timer.
7323860	7331620	I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the C-Man fish.
7331620	7333780	But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.
7333780	7334780	That's what we've done.
7334780	7336580	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
7336580	7338580	Are you a Libra?
7338580	7345020	Alright, here's the video that AZ- Besides, what would the neighbors think?
7345020	7348660	Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary
7348660	7349660	on.
7349660	7354700	Well, that's definitely spandex.
7354700	7356100	This is the official channel.
7356100	7358340	That's the cat-punch exercise.
7358340	7359340	Is it?
7359340	7360780	And his corgi's like, what the fuck.
7360780	7363740	I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever because they have a bunch of people
7363740	7364740	doing that.
7364740	7371940	It is.
7371940	7373620	He just looks like he's kind of dancing.
7373620	7376260	It looks like he could be holding the wiimote doing that.
7376260	7379740	This dog seems entirely amused.
7379740	7382900	I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.
7382900	7385300	No, this isn't from the game.
7385300	7387900	This is a contest they have there on their website.
7387900	7391020	It's some dance or something that the cat does.
7391020	7392020	Gotcha.
7392020	7397260	But seriously, if they have contests like this on their website, I don't believe that
7397260	7399420	it hasn't sold 100 copies.
7399420	7406220	On top of that, they actually, yesterday they had an event in a cabaret to promote the game.
7406220	7412940	I actually posted on Twitter if any of our Japanese listeners attended that I'd like
7412940	7417580	to know how it went, but seriously, I think that they had to have sold more than 100.
7417580	7421020	Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.
7421020	7425380	But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before,
7425380	7434020	I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil and I think it
7434020	7438420	translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.
7438420	7443740	Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan who listens to our show on Monday
7443740	7450100	afternoon live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise, like company exercises in the morning.
7450100	7451260	That's what the dude's doing.
7451260	7456980	It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting
7456980	7458580	the air like little kittens.
7458580	7461700	That's what the cat does.
7461700	7463020	That's what they really need to do here.
7463020	7464380	They need to implement that kind of thing here.
7464380	7467100	I could really use like a 10 a.m. stretch at work sometimes.
7467100	7468100	I know.
7468100	7470100	You know what I mean?
7470100	7471100	All right.
7471100	7472100	Anyhow.
7472100	7474900	Dear Congress, make it so.
7474900	7478140	I just want to point out, because some of our chat room is still hung up on the whole
7478140	7483380	I'll fringe your butt comment, and in fact, we have some folks saying, let's see, togak
7483380	7486380	in chat says, going to use that tomorrow at school.
7486380	7490540	Okay, look, have fun, freedom of speech, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7490540	7494460	You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you
7494460	7495460	heard a comment like that.
7495460	7496460	Okay, just saying.
7496460	7497460	You didn't hear it here.
7497460	7501100	But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.
7501100	7503340	Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?
7503340	7505340	That's all you have to do.
7505340	7506340	All right.
7506340	7507340	Moving on.
7507340	7510420	No one would believe you, because no one watches that garbage.
7510420	7513740	Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.
7513740	7514740	Yes.
7514740	7520700	So, I don't know, I didn't really play too much of the original game, a little bit on,
7520700	7523100	actually I think I played some of it during the show one time.
7523100	7526500	What, sorry, togak says, got it, I learned it from Oprah.
7526500	7532780	Okay, there you go, excellent, that wins.
7532780	7540220	I guess the Flash version of Line Rider has been tweaked a little bit.
7540220	7543700	They've added some new support to the game.
7543700	7550220	Now you can actually play as two different riders, or torture two different riders.
7550220	7555540	It's a brand new dual rider mode, and they've added a new, you can select the starting point
7555540	7561820	for the second rider, as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually
7561820	7564580	decelerate the rider as well.
7564580	7569740	I guess you could use this to do races, or some sort of synchronized run, or something
7569740	7570860	like that.
7570860	7577460	And the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for, I guess the iPhone, they're
7577460	7582260	also going to do like a Line Racer game or something, so that's kind of neat.
7582260	7585900	I don't know, a free update.
7585900	7586900	I like free.
7586900	7592940	And the game is popular, and they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for
7592940	7593940	it.
7593940	7598400	Well, this next game isn't free, but it's certainly a popular game, in fact one that
7598400	7603460	seemed to disappear for quite some time, and then suddenly is now coming back.
7603460	7606740	Excite Bike is getting a new version.
7606740	7612540	That's right, this is not Excite Truck, this is not Excite Bots, this is Excite Bike, the
7612540	7614360	original 8-bit game.
7614360	7619140	It was announced this week on the show Nintendo Week, let me come back to that in a minute,
7619140	7623640	that Excite Bike World Rally is coming out on November 9th.
7623640	7627500	It's like a new souped up version of the 8-bit Excite Bike, like they have now, it's like
7627500	7634260	3D, I don't want to say 3D, but like that 2.5D, like Street Fighter 4 has 3D elements,
7634260	7637500	but it's still like a 2D game, but that's what they're doing with this Excite Bike.
7637500	7639380	It's a 3D game on a 2D plane.
7639380	7645240	And an online multiplayer, and, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game
7645240	7648100	had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?
7648100	7649100	Track Editor?
7649100	7653420	Track Editor, with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in
7653420	7658260	America because that's how lazy the translation was, because it was originally a Famicom disc
7658260	7659260	game overseas.
7659260	7663180	You know what's awesome too that no one seemed to notice in any of the previews and stuff?
7663180	7668500	It also has the icons like in Excite Truck, where you hit them and then the landscape
7668500	7673340	changes so ramps appear out of thin air.
7673340	7674340	That sounds awesome.
7674340	7677220	Yeah, you can kind of see that in the little video too that was there.
7677220	7682460	So Track Editor, online multiplayer, Excite Bike World Rally is coming out November 9th,
7682460	7683740	and I'm pretty excited.
7683740	7687700	Like I wish Nintendo would do this with more of their old school franchises, but I do want
7687700	7691140	to say the show they chose to debut it on, Nintendo Week, I guess this is a little thing
7691140	7693380	they do on the Nintendo channel.
7693380	7697960	I watched it, and wow, have you ever watched that show?
7697960	7703560	Like I think it must be written for a 7-year-old or something like that because it was really
7703560	7704900	difficult to watch.
7704900	7709580	Like it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo, and when I say
7709580	7715180	really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.
7715180	7718580	In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.
7718580	7722260	I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excite Bike trailer.
7722260	7727060	I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.
7727060	7729860	It's that bad.
7729860	7735700	Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's
7735700	7741340	time for us to get into the FUs of the Week, but we have a little bit of a story to inspire
7741340	7744020	the FUs of the Week.
7744020	7749380	Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.
7749380	7750380	There we go.
7750380	7769740	Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the Week tonight.
7769740	7777220	A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.
7777220	7783500	Silent Hill is not often always seen as like the thing that the games made me do it.
7783500	7790140	Somehow this game tends to escape that, but apparently there was a 35-year-old man that
7790140	7796260	said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.
7796260	7800220	His name was Jan H. At least that's all they're calling him right now.
7800220	7803940	Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.
7803940	7804940	So what did he do?
7804940	7809500	He broke into Sophia Hospital in the Netherlands in April, I guess maybe now it's just going
7809500	7810500	to trial.
7810500	7813420	He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.
7813420	7818260	People were trapped in elevators, doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.
7818260	7820100	Thank God nobody died.
7820100	7823780	By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.
7823780	7824780	Why?
7824780	7830740	The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.
7830740	7836700	I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head.
7836700	7841080	I don't know, but that story is just all kinds of strange.
7841080	7842700	So F you to strange things.
7842700	7843700	That's ridiculous.
7843700	7847380	You're always trying to restore power and never shut it off in Silent Hill.
7847380	7851540	Dark Sakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?
7851540	7856260	I want my voice back and I want my foot to stop hurting.
7856260	7858260	That's about it.
7858260	7859260	Loki?
7859260	7865380	F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.
7865380	7870500	Not one handful, one candy that we ran out because there wasn't that many people.
7870500	7875540	But seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this and you're too greedy.
7875540	7877620	F you to the Bay Bridge.
7877620	7882080	Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you
7882080	7883080	know what?
7883080	7884340	Let me put it this way.
7884340	7890180	I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend
7890180	7893540	Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.
7893540	7895300	So I bought an audio book to keep me company.
7895300	7897420	I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.
7897420	7898420	I highly recommend it.
7898420	7899420	It wasn't funny.
7899420	7900940	It was just good.
7900940	7903020	It's six and a half hours.
7903020	7906320	I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.
7906320	7913100	That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge and terrible.
7913100	7916860	So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causes the damn thing
7916860	7918540	to break.
7918540	7921420	And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.
7921420	7922780	Oh, it's going to be open Friday.
7922780	7923780	Oh, you know what?
7923780	7924780	Fuck it.
7924780	7925780	It'll be open Monday.
7925780	7926940	And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.
7926940	7931660	And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first
7931660	7935180	time, stop teasing me.
7935180	7939820	And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place
7939820	7944020	for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.
7944020	7945020	I don't know.
7945020	7948220	You don't really pay us enough to do it.
7948220	7949220	Fucking Bart.
7949220	7950220	Fucking Bay Bridge.
7950220	7951220	Lame.
7951220	7952220	Fucking all.
7952220	7953220	Exactly.
7953220	7957500	Who decided to build a major city over there anyway?
7957500	7958500	Seriously.
7958500	7962100	Like you have to go around a Bay to get there.
7962100	7966460	I guess it made sense back in the days of more ship and all that stuff.
7966460	7967460	Forget it.
7967460	7969500	I'm done at being angsty.
7969500	7970500	More news.
7970500	7971500	Then Skype.
7971500	7974220	Then the end of the show.
7974220	7976980	Alright.
7976980	7982120	So unfortunately this has nothing to do with the Bay Bridge.
7982120	7990220	But a game we were talking about for a while now, 3D Dot Game Heroes, which is kind of
7990220	7997260	an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.
7997260	7999700	Pretty much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.
7999700	8006140	Well thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.
8006140	8013020	It's not seeing who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from
8013020	8019860	software because how they bring games over here sometimes, but at some point it is going
8019860	8024580	to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter, no need to import 3D
8024580	8031820	Game Heroes for PS3, it's definitely coming to an A. Spread the word, more to come.
8031820	8033500	So awesome.
8033500	8036260	And have you seen the loading screens for this game?
8036260	8038620	I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.
8038620	8041980	I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh that looks kind of neat, but I just
8041980	8045300	don't really know, I haven't really done my research on that game I guess.
8045300	8050900	The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games
8050900	8058720	like Mega Man Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different
8058720	8062860	things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.
8062860	8064060	But they're just inspired, right?
8064060	8066380	Because you couldn't rip those things off, or they didn't get busted.
8066380	8070580	Well, they look very similar, they're just done in this art style or whatever.
8070580	8071580	Interesting.
8071580	8079340	It's similar enough, so you kind of get the homage, but the game looks awesome.
8079340	8084420	Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation,
8084420	8088900	or the PS3 I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things
8088900	8089900	up like that.
8089900	8090900	Like, I love it.
8090900	8095260	I wish all the consoles had been region-free, but whatever.
8095260	8096260	Stupid laws.
8096260	8103900	Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import, are Blu-rays region protected?
8103900	8110580	Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays, we're the same region as Japan.
8110580	8111580	Interesting.
8111580	8116220	Well, maybe Japan might want to import this, or who knows, but there's a Blu-ray release
8116220	8120700	of District 9 coming out, that was obviously a big movie over here in the US, and it's
8120700	8122460	coming out on Blu-ray very soon.
8122460	8123460	Guess what it's coming with?
8123460	8125420	It's coming with a video game demo.
8125420	8127660	That game, God of War 3.
8127660	8131460	Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th, I guess it's going to
8131460	8135900	cash in on the gift cards after the holidays, and that's, by the way, after the God of War
8135900	8140460	collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo, but some folks that already had
8140460	8144100	the first two games may not want to re-buy them, I don't know.
8144100	8145560	So this will be another option.
8145560	8150700	If you get District 9, you'll actually get the God of War 3 demo with District 9.
8150700	8155900	Also, what's kind of interesting, if you play through the demo, a making of featurette will
8155900	8158540	be unlocked for the game.
8158540	8162660	Strange, because that really has nothing to do with District 9, except the fact that maybe
8162660	8166380	it's the same target audience, and they're both from Sony.
8166380	8171580	It's very similar that, I mean, very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like
8171580	8175340	that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.
8175340	8180500	Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of the games
8180500	8181500	based on movies.
8181500	8186280	They had one, and you're going to have to think way back here.
8186280	8191900	There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where
8191900	8193820	you can play as a stealth plane.
8193820	8195200	Oh wow.
8195200	8197460	I wouldn't have even thought of that.
8197460	8201500	Also, just recently, the Watchmen, one of the animated movies came out with a game,
8201500	8205320	like they did a combo thing there, but this is different, because really, what do God
8205320	8206940	of War and District 9 have in common?
8206940	8209440	Not a damn thing, you know?
8209440	8213380	Except maybe it's the same target audience.
8213380	8216900	I never did see District 9, though.
8216900	8221060	I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though, even though I was never really into
8221060	8222060	the first two games.
8222060	8224420	I think I'm going to pick up that collection, because everybody tells me, you gotta play
8224420	8225420	God of War.
8225420	8226420	You gotta play God of War.
8226420	8230060	So, I'm kind of glad I waited, now I can play him in high def.
8230060	8233740	Anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype
8233740	8239520	line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, as always, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one
8239520	8244040	more story for you guys first.
8244040	8245660	This is kind of interesting.
8245660	8252100	Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.
8252100	8259220	They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament
8259220	8265700	decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.
8265700	8273660	They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers, yes, using women
8273660	8278340	that are topless and rubbing themselves all over the players.
8278340	8285580	Thankfully, though, and this is, I guess, a testament of their dedication to the game,
8285580	8291980	they were unable to drag those gamers away from Counter-Strike.
8291980	8300180	A quote here from English Russia reported, it was impossible to put an intention of those
8300180	8303740	hopeless men off the game.
8303740	8310100	It was drawing too close, and the ladies were sweating as much as they could, but the eyes
8310100	8313300	of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.
8313300	8318100	And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it, and man, they tried everything.
8318100	8326340	Huh, it's just two things that you think would go together naturally, or what I like to call
8326340	8328860	the coolest gaming tournament ever.
8328860	8334660	Maybe they should do a gaming, do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that
8334660	8335660	here in the US?
8335660	8340380	Oh, everyone would complain, but it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever.
8340380	8341940	What if a strip club did it?
8341940	8344820	What if a place of sin did it anyway?
8344820	8350420	Can you imagine if Centerfolds did, you know what we need to do?
8350420	8353180	I have a great idea.
8353180	8359700	We need to approach Centerfolds about having an orange lounge radio gaming tournament at
8359700	8360700	Centerfolds.
8360700	8361820	Wouldn't that be amazing?
8361820	8368860	Or I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I
8368860	8370500	drive by all the time.
8370500	8373460	There's Showgirls and City Limits and a lot of these other clubs too.
8373460	8378540	We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.
8378540	8380180	Wouldn't that be fun?
8380180	8381900	That would be funny.
8381900	8383300	The wife would go?
8383300	8386260	That would be funny.
8386260	8397940	I don't know if that would work, or be feasible, or even make money, but it's a funny idea.
8397940	8400720	I think it's funnier though because they had no idea it was coming.
8400720	8406980	If you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.
8406980	8412940	But I'm just saying, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before, that just games
8412940	8414780	and strippers together in one roof.
8414780	8415780	It would have to be something that-
8415780	8417580	As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.
8417580	8422140	Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.
8422140	8425180	It's like, holy shit, nah.
8425180	8428940	Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.
8428940	8429940	I don't know.
8429940	8430940	That would be tough.
8430940	8431940	I don't know.
8431940	8438820	If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't
8438820	8439820	you give us a call?
8439820	8443980	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
8443980	8446340	The Skype line is now open for business.
8446340	8447700	We've already got a call coming in.
8447700	8448700	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8448700	8449700	Who's this?
8449700	8450700	Hello.
8450700	8451700	It's Ray Iyanami.
8451700	8453580	Well, hello, Ray Iyanami.
8453580	8454580	How are you?
8454580	8455580	What's on your mind tonight?
8455580	8456580	Okay.
8456580	8458580	I just came back from YaoiCon.
8458580	8459580	YaoiCon?
8459580	8460580	Yeah.
8460580	8461580	Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?
8461580	8463580	San Mateo specifically.
8463580	8469340	Oh, so I was a little ways away because I was thinking as I was driving through Japantown
8469340	8473300	because the theater I do Rocky Horror at is right near Japantown in San Francisco, and
8473300	8476420	I was thinking like, I wonder if this is where YaoiCon is going on right now.
8476420	8479900	I should like swing by and say hello even though I had no ticket.
8479900	8483420	I was like, try to use my media poll or lack thereof.
8483420	8489900	Well, I believe this is the third year during holding it in San Mateo.
8489900	8490900	Apparently I missed the boat.
8490900	8491900	Well, okay.
8491900	8494400	So you went to YaoiCon.
8494400	8495520	That must have been interesting.
8495520	8496520	How was that?
8496520	8497520	It's all right.
8497520	8504980	Like, the other thing is you couldn't tell it was a ton specifically for living in Yaoi.
8504980	8510220	If you're like looking inside the hotel lobby, you have to go like the tiles or all the interesting
8510220	8516340	activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.
8516340	8520460	Now I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question
8520460	8525820	and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?
8525820	8526820	Mostly straight.
8526820	8527820	So, okay.
8527820	8528820	So what were you doing going to YaoiCon?
8528820	8531820	Just because that's where all the horny women are?
8531820	8532820	On the television.
8532820	8533820	Oh, okay.
8533820	8534820	For fun.
8534820	8535820	There you go.
8535820	8542940	But I feel mostly straight, I feel like real life guys make me go, man.
8542940	8549900	It's mostly like anime and video game guys that make me say I'm only mostly straight.
8549900	8550900	Interesting.
8550900	8551900	Okay.
8551900	8553820	Well, then Yaoi kind of taps into that whole thing, I guess.
8553820	8555060	So hey, cool.
8555060	8558220	I'm just kind of curious because I actually know, like, it's interesting because like
8558220	8561420	I know a lot of straight guys that like to go to these types of things like YaoiCon.
8561420	8564580	Like it seems like a lot of the reports I read are from straight guys and I'm kind of
8564580	8568340	like, okay, well, that kind of reminds me of like when all the straight people started
8568340	8569380	coming into the gay bar.
8569380	8574780	Like obviously, you know, there's, be who you want to be, just, you know, don't infringe
8574780	8575780	on other people's rights.
8575780	8576980	It doesn't really matter.
8576980	8581700	But at the same time, when all the straight people started showing up at the gay bar,
8581700	8585620	wasn't really a gay bar anymore and everybody went somewhere else.
8585620	8586620	But whatever.
8586620	8588620	Love who you want to love.
8588620	8596740	I went to a few panels and stuff like the Bishon auction, where things start to really
8596740	8597740	get interesting.
8597740	8604260	Like their bids are doing as high as like $500 and guys sitting at their clothes, like
8604260	8610540	the guys on auction doing sitting at their clothes left and right among other things.
8610540	8614300	I just realized some of our chatters don't know what Yaoi is and sometimes we take that
8614300	8617380	kind of stuff for granted that we just assume everybody knows what it is, but of course
8617380	8618700	not everybody knows what it is.
8618700	8619700	Yeah.
8619700	8621980	What do you, would you like to explain it?
8621980	8622980	Okay.
8622980	8623980	Go for it.
8623980	8624980	Okay.
8624980	8631460	Basically Yaoi is like male on male erotic anime or manga.
8631460	8634140	But it's not, but, but this is important to also state.
8634140	8635140	It's not porn.
8635140	8640900	Like, it's just like, yeah, I have some, the focus.
8640900	8641900	Anyways.
8641900	8642900	Yeah.
8642900	8647980	What I've noticed from what you guys have seen is mostly focused on the romance, like
8647980	8655300	if I walk into a random room showing Yaoi, there's a very low chance I'll walk into a
8655300	8656300	sex scene.
8656300	8657300	Interesting.
8657300	8663900	Like I'll just walk into them having a converse, a pretty deep conversation or whatever.
8663900	8664900	All right.
8664900	8667340	Now I started a whole little argument on whether it's porn or not.
8667340	8673180	I think that it gets though to the, the disturbing point though, when it's Shota, which is little
8673180	8675620	boys, that's disgusting.
8675620	8676620	That's not okay.
8676620	8679260	That's not okay.
8679260	8682140	Do what you want to do as long as they're 18 or over.
8682140	8683140	Okay.
8683140	8684140	That's the key thing.
8684140	8685140	All right.
8685140	8686140	Anyway, we are digressing completely.
8686140	8688780	Did they have gaming or anything going on at Yaoi Con?
8688780	8692460	They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.
8692460	8698340	Perfect product on an PS2 on an HDTV, which translates to, yay lag.
8698340	8705060	And there's a lot of Rockland and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.
8705060	8706060	This is a great description.
8706060	8707060	I'm sorry.
8707060	8710860	This is a great description from SSJ100 Matt in chat room saying it's Brokeback Mountain
8710860	8715700	romantic type manga, but even Brokeback Mountain, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain
8715700	8716700	had a sex scene.
8716700	8723740	There was a scene where Heath Ledger friended James Villanelle's butt.
8723740	8727540	What else about the gaming did you want to say?
8727540	8733900	But yeah, I tried playing Para Para Paradise on their set up there, and it was on HDTV,
8733900	8742100	and it was played on San Diego Girlfriend's 3DS machine between 2004 and no, 2003, 2007,
8742100	8747820	and knows how bad rhythm games are on an HDTV with no upscaling.
8747820	8753900	Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where
8753900	8758420	you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, it was, if your TV lags, then it sucks
8758420	8759420	to be you.
8759420	8764620	Yeah, I normally don't feel it's also a Para Para Paradise, but I was feeling songs that
8764620	8770540	in the arcade, I could clearly pass with no problem, just mainly rage quit.
8770540	8771540	Alright.
8771540	8773620	Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.
8773620	8776380	Do you think you're going to go back next year?
8776380	8778660	Hopefully.
8778660	8779900	One of these years I'll go.
8779900	8783020	I always say I'm going to go to YALIcon, but then it's just like, it's always just at a
8783020	8786100	bad time for me, but one of these years I'll get there, hopefully next year.
8786100	8787980	I liked it the one time I went.
8787980	8789900	Yeah, I at least want to make a cameo.
8789900	8793460	Alright, well anyway, we're going to let you go, Ray, so we can get some more calls, but
8793460	8796220	thank you very much, and we'll talk to you again soon, okay?
8796220	8798140	Okay, I'll see you later.
8798140	8803220	1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype, orange lounger radio, if you want to give us a call.
8803220	8810140	While we wait for some calls, although I saw the, oh, here, it's ringing again.
8810140	8812140	I hate, can I just say this?
8812140	8814900	I hate the new Skype.
8814900	8817060	I cannot stand it.
8817060	8821580	Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing, it's like, if
8821580	8824140	I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.
8824140	8825140	I can't answer it.
8825140	8828220	It's just, I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.
8828220	8831100	I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay, we got another one.
8831100	8833100	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8833100	8835100	Hey, this is X-Link.
8835100	8836940	Hi, X-Link, how are you, buddy?
8836940	8837940	What's on your mind?
8837940	8838940	Hey, doing good.
8838940	8843620	Just celebrated my birthday yesterday, had a lot of fun doing that, but...
8843620	8844620	Well, happy birthday.
8844620	8845620	Wait, you were at Halloween?
8845620	8846620	No, I was calling in.
8846620	8847620	You were at Halloween, baby?
8847620	8848620	Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.
8848620	8849620	Alright.
8849620	8852460	Yes, yes, unfortunately I was one of the two.
8852460	8854820	You're probably sick of people commenting on that, so...
8854820	8858660	I was calling in because...
8858660	8859660	Go ahead, you're calling in because...
8859660	8860660	I'm sorry.
8860660	8866780	I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having
8866780	8872460	a lot of fun with, was Press Your Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before
8872460	8878060	and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon, and it was released on Tuesday.
8878060	8879520	I didn't even realize this.
8879520	8883140	What system is this for, the Wii?
8883140	8884140	It was for the Wii.
8884140	8890860	I picked up the PC version because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then
8890860	8894460	they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.
8894460	8897180	Well, this is like game show heaven going on right now.
8897180	8901300	Well, briefly describe for our listeners Press Your Luck and your impressions on it, if you
8901300	8902300	would.
8902300	8905260	Oh, I loved it.
8905260	8907740	It was exactly like it would play on the game show.
8907740	8913180	The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they'll give out a question,
8913180	8919740	you have the buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally
8919740	8926740	you would say on the game show, they'll give you four choices based on the selection.
8926740	8931100	If you have the answer for the question right and you're the first one to buzz in, you would
8931100	8936720	get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for
8936720	8938220	having the right answer.
8938220	8941020	They do four questions per round.
8941020	8945540	Once you do the four questions, then they turn around and you face the board and then
8945540	8949420	you would do the spinning for the money and prizes.
8949420	8953900	Of course, the infamous no whammies, no whammies, stop.
8953900	8959780	Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.
8959780	8963900	If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.
8963900	8970740	If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.
8970740	8975700	That's how it's more strategic if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,
8975700	8980100	oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player to have an extra spin.
8980100	8984740	You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money
8984740	8987460	to overpass you in the amount.
8987460	8989020	Does the game have the cool whammy animations?
8989020	8991020	I love it.
8991020	8993020	Yes, it does.
8993020	8997380	In the fact of loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy
8997380	9001620	thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.
9001620	9003620	It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.
9003620	9006460	You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck and that sounds
9006460	9008460	like it could be a lot of fun.
9008460	9011940	Yes, definitely.
9011940	9017620	If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel
9017620	9022100	spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii remote, so it's a lot better than it is on the PC.
9022100	9024900	These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of
9024900	9026380	fun.
9026380	9031820	Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games, it's like shovelware.
9031820	9035620	I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those
9035620	9036900	that don't regularly play games.
9036900	9037900	It is.
9037900	9038900	Everybody knows Press Your Luck.
9038900	9044020	Yes, it's a lot of fun and for 20 bucks, you can't really beat that price for some lenses
9044020	9045020	too.
9045020	9046020	It's very cheap.
9046020	9047020	That's a really good price.
9047020	9048940	Well, thank you very much for the ReviewX link.
9048940	9050700	I might just have to pick that up.
9050700	9054860	Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?
9054860	9059580	No, I just can't believe that guy didn't get into trouble for the hospital bed.
9059580	9061380	You would think for sure he would get into some kind of trouble.
9061380	9065620	That would be like me going out, shooting somebody in cold blood and going, oh, well,
9065620	9070100	I seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot
9070100	9072100	somebody for real or GTA.
9072100	9074860	Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.
9074860	9080140	No, no, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.
9080140	9084780	Still, though, it's a darn good thing no one died.
9084780	9089020	All right, X-Link, we're going to let you go, but have a great week, okay?
9089020	9090020	Yeah.
9090020	9091020	Later.
9091020	9092020	Definitely, you too.
9092020	9093020	Thanks.
9093020	9095260	All right, we're going to try to take some more calls here.
9095260	9098180	I just want to stress, I really hate the new Skype.
9098180	9102780	In fact, I want to find the old version and download that instead, if I can.
9102780	9104780	We'll try to do at least one more call here tonight.
9104780	9107260	1877 game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeOnsRadio.
9107260	9108580	Hi, you're on OrangeOnsRadio.
9108580	9109580	Who's this?
9109580	9111580	Hi, this is Spaz here.
9111580	9112580	Hi, Spaznator.
9112580	9114860	What's on your mind?
9114860	9116860	Yeah, a couple things.
9116860	9126820	First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I get news about home.
9126820	9128700	Yeah, what's that?
9128700	9129700	What's...
9129700	9136900	Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought it would be a match because
9136900	9142660	of the little turn the show took earlier on.
9142660	9144420	Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex in home?
9144420	9145420	Is that the update?
9145420	9146420	Well, not really.
9146420	9157400	I don't know if we checked the mall lately or not, but if you go to the furniture store
9157400	9169940	on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there, quite literally, they got
9169940	9171460	toilets in there now.
9171460	9174300	Wait, like, you can buy poop?
9174300	9182020	Well, I think you have to fly the poop yourself, but they got toilets in there now, and we're
9182020	9183020	with two of them.
9183020	9192540	In fact, in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them, there's a golden toilet, and they're
9192540	9199660	calling it the golden throne, and they're selling it for, damn it, I got the error for
9199660	9200660	price.
9200660	9207560	It's kind of expensive, last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.
9207560	9212060	So I can pay three bucks to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.
9212060	9213060	That's amazing.
9213060	9218180	Yeah, and they got a second one there, it looks like a porcelain toilet, and they're
9218180	9223740	calling it take a load off the chair, and they're charging $0.99 for it.
9223740	9226740	Maybe I should buy one of those.
9226740	9231100	I need to buy one of those for the oil army clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.
9231100	9241780	Yeah, and in fact, it's a perfect transition for the second topic, you know, they mentioned
9241780	9242780	a tweet.
9242780	9246900	Yeah, since you guys were plugging Twitter and Facebook and all that earlier, you guys
9246900	9254020	just kind of forgot to mention the oil, the army club within Home.
9254020	9256900	That's true, we do have the oil army club with Home, but the reason why we don't mention
9256900	9260140	it is because we actually do things with the Twitter and stuff, but it's really hard to
9260140	9262340	do things with the clubhouse.
9262340	9268700	One reason we bought that is so that when Sony starts letting us use the TV for a purpose,
9268700	9274040	or maybe we can stream clips of our show somehow, or just kind of let us put our own custom
9274040	9279980	touch somehow and make it an Orange Lawns Radio experience, then we'll be right on it
9279980	9284260	and ready to go and already have people in there to go see it, but right now, the way
9284260	9291620	Home is, there's not a lot I can do with it, which is unfortunate.
9291620	9298860	The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but other listeners out there, is
9298860	9306660	that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club, you know,
9306660	9314220	the least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation, you use club that
9314220	9316940	you shell out the money for, you know?
9316940	9322540	It seems like John Dole one day ever shows up in there, and every time I show up there,
9322540	9326300	there's no one there, so I'm conveniently missing.
9326300	9330780	Maybe one of these nights, we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something,
9330780	9334620	we'll have like a Sony Home night at seven o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck
9334620	9338160	dance party in the, because I don't know what else you do in Home, but dance, hopefully
9338160	9344620	somebody will show up in a hamster outfit, we'll do a dance party in Sony Home.
9344620	9349220	What's great is that Jamie's, hold on, Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.
9349220	9351220	Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.
9351220	9353020	I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.
9353020	9355020	Well, it wasn't the hamster thing, it was the whole Sony Home.
9355020	9357020	Oh, the whole Sony Home thing, oh, I'm sorry.
9357020	9358020	All right, sorry, Spaz in the air.
9358020	9360020	Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?
9360020	9367060	You know, I did have something, oh yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to,
9367060	9370540	you know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.
9370540	9371540	Yes.
9371540	9378340	Yeah, and one thing in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio
9378340	9384780	simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software
9384780	9391100	doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call
9391100	9394340	I have, you know, slight speech impediment.
9394340	9396940	You know what, dude, it wouldn't just be you.
9396940	9404100	Those programs always stink at recognizing speech, whether it be an accent or just impediment
9404100	9409540	or just the way you talk, just depending on how you were raised, those games never accurately
9409540	9410540	can gauge you.
9410540	9412220	Like, look at a game like brain training.
9412220	9416620	Like if you want brain training to recognize that you're saying blue, you have to literally
9416620	9422100	sit there and say, brew, brew, and that's the only way you can get it to recognize it.
9422100	9427340	And I'm not trying to sound, you know, rude or anything, but that's just the way the game
9427340	9428340	works.
9428340	9429340	It doesn't work otherwise.
9429340	9430340	I can't even get right on his by that game.
9430340	9432860	Anyways, Spaznator, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show, but
9432860	9437740	thanks so much as always for your call and I can't promise the Seaman things never going
9437740	9438740	to happen.
9438740	9439740	So just so you know.
9439740	9440740	All right.
9440740	9441740	Later.
9441740	9442740	All right.
9442740	9444720	Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.
9444720	9447620	We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with
9447620	9449560	Skype tonight and it's not the callers.
9449560	9450560	Not at all.
9450560	9451560	Callers are great.
9451560	9452560	The program itself.
9452560	9456020	I'm a little mad at, I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.
9456020	9457020	I don't know.
9457020	9458020	It's just, I don't know.
9458020	9459020	We do have that extra.
9459020	9460020	I didn't they send us.
9460020	9461020	Yeah, we got that extra thing.
9461020	9462180	What's, where's, where's that computer?
9462180	9463180	We got it.
9463180	9465060	It's still in my room.
9465060	9468260	Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this
9468260	9469260	beast into that thing.
9469260	9470900	Let's play jigsaw puzzle with the new computer.
9470900	9473900	Because if not, then the new computer can be used for video because I know we were going
9473900	9476100	to, we were saving that to use for a video and then it didn't happen.
9476100	9479660	So listen, we got to get use out of that, but Skype is annoying the shit out of me on
9479660	9480660	this thing.
9480660	9482660	But this, this computer is getting old.
9482660	9488580	So we definitely have to invest in extra box of oops, I crapped my pants because like,
9488580	9489940	you know, they bought that months ago.
9489940	9490940	We'd never used it.
9490940	9492840	And it's, you know, not trying to be disrespectful.
9492840	9496020	We had, we were going to use it for something they didn't take off.
9496020	9503100	So we'll, we'll, we'll find another way to use it anyhow.
9503100	9505780	I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.
9505780	9507340	I have some final story.
9507340	9508340	Oh my gosh.
9508340	9509340	I'm so sorry.
9509340	9510340	I forgot we didn't do those yet.
9510340	9511940	I did mine for the FU.
9511940	9512940	I'm sorry.
9512940	9515140	I thought you were going to talk about this movie.
9515140	9516140	Yeah.
9516140	9520620	Um, the silent Hill movie is, uh, going to start filming next year.
9520620	9521620	Silent Hill 2.
9521620	9522620	I didn't take your story.
9522620	9529180	And a dude, uh, was in a, uh, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
9529180	9530180	What did?
9530180	9531180	Oh, the rider?
9531180	9532180	Yeah.
9532180	9533180	Oh yeah.
9533180	9534180	I heard about that one.
9534180	9535180	What a mess.
9535180	9536180	Don't drive drunk.
9536180	9537180	Loki.
9537180	9538180	Last minute stories.
9538180	9539180	Yes.
9539180	9546700	So Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3g internet, um, with its next gen DS system
9546700	9548660	might be something that they're working on.
9548660	9555100	Um, apparently a water is, um, quoted saying that, uh, I'm interested because it's a new
9555100	9559960	business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications costs.
9559960	9565620	Only the people who can pay thousands of yen a month can be iPhone customers.
9565620	9570940	That doesn't fit Nintendo's customers because we make amusement products.
9570940	9576180	In reality, if we did this, it would, um, increase the cost of hardware and the consumers
9576180	9582420	would complain about Nintendo putting prices up, but it's, uh, it is one option for the
9582420	9583420	future.
9583420	9588220	Um, that would be pretty awesome if you can get unlimited 3g internet through like a DS
9588220	9589380	or something.
9589380	9596980	But the problem is one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.
9596980	9603740	They haven't embraced online yet, so, um, all the free online, you know, thrown into
9603740	9610620	your next gen console doesn't mean shit to me since you haven't really embraced online.
9610620	9611620	I mean, okay.
9611620	9616300	Yeah, we wear in, you know, DSI wear, but your infrastructure infrastructure sucks and
9616300	9619620	your friend's code sucks even more, so.
9619620	9620620	Yeah.
9620620	9626420	Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment and I know
9626420	9630300	I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.
9630300	9638180	It's a game called Baby and Me, but I was completely unaware of this brand new, um,
9638180	9639180	bundle I guess they have.
9639180	9641420	It's a special edition.
9641420	9645060	Um, this is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.
9645060	9652620	Basically it has a remote holster for a baby doll, but, but that's not all.
9652620	9658580	Apparently, um, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition and what
9658580	9661140	does this special edition include?
9661140	9665700	But a baby doll attachment for your Wii remote.
9665700	9667160	Yes.
9667160	9672780	Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii remote into that baby.
9672780	9681520	But that's, wow, that's kind of crazy.
9681520	9690900	And then, um, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.
9690900	9695780	The Return of Alice, um, it's going to be the next, um, game that he's doing.
9695780	9701380	He's got a nice little teaser trailer online and it looks creepy, so I'm sure that it's
9701380	9708020	going to be coming to the PC later on, but, uh, Return of Alice coming from American McGee.
9708020	9711220	Wasn't there supposed to be like a movie tie-in to this a long time ago?
9711220	9714740	There was supposed to be an American McGee Alice movie, uh, it was like with Wino or
9714740	9719140	Ryder at one time, so I don't know if that's still, I don't think that's happening anymore.
9719140	9722860	Well, now there's the, um, Tim Burton one.
9722860	9726100	Oh yeah, that's true and I think that's kind of it.
9726100	9729700	Like I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the
9729700	9731500	American McGee one because you'll get your dark.
9731500	9735980	American McGee's going to be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like,
9735980	9740980	you know, bubblegum dark, you know, he's like, he's like hot topic dark, okay.
9740980	9744300	I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend, um, for Halloween.
9744300	9748500	We, um, they're, they're my friends that I play Warcraft with now and, um, we watched
9748500	9749500	some, uh, movies.
9749500	9750500	This was Halloween.
9750500	9753300	We watched Showgirls because, you know, we have to watch something scary, but then we
9753300	9757580	started, um, Starling, except I love Showgirls.
9757580	9758580	Don't get me started.
9758580	9759580	That's one of my favorite movies.
9759580	9760580	It's so bad.
9760580	9761580	It's good.
9761580	9764500	We need to watch that again, but the other thing about this, it's not coming back until
9764500	9765500	2011.
9765500	9766500	Oh, well yeah.
9766500	9767500	Games take time to develop.
9767500	9771620	But anyway, what I wanted to say also, we watched Sleepy Hollow, which is a Tim Burton
9771620	9772620	movie.
9772620	9773620	That movie's pretty dark.
9773620	9774620	That's not bubblegum dark.
9774620	9776180	That's, that's legitimately dark.
9776180	9777580	Just saying.
9777580	9782020	We watched on fast forward the original Wicker Man.
9782020	9784020	Wow.
9784020	9788980	We almost watched Sleepaway Camp two and three.
9788980	9789980	None of them are good.
9789980	9790980	I know.
9790980	9791980	We knew that.
9791980	9792980	The original Sleepaway Camp.
9792980	9796140	We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was, you know, similar to the remake.
9796140	9801860	Which by the way, to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie,
9801860	9806900	next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.
9806900	9809980	It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.
9809980	9814500	And if you've never seen it and you don't know anything about it, good.
9814500	9816580	Keep it that way until you watch the movie.
9816580	9823420	Because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever, ever.
9823420	9825060	That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?
9825060	9827360	And it's very, it's a very like little quotable movie too.
9827360	9829820	It's so bad it's funny.
9829820	9830820	So there you go.
9830820	9835780	They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.
9835780	9836780	Ridiculous.
9836780	9839980	Tigerclaw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.
9839980	9842780	And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.
9842780	9845220	Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.
9845220	9846220	What?
9846220	9850380	That's supposed to center around hope, which was, do you remember like there was like kind
9850380	9854420	of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and
9854420	9858580	was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?
9858580	9862500	Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her, but I got, I'll one up
9862500	9863500	you with this.
9863500	9867840	The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody
9867840	9874220	because this movie was supposed to be huge, was supposed to take place in LA or Hollywood.
9874220	9878220	That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away, OMG spoilers, they're
9878220	9882500	going to LA because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have
9882500	9883500	been awesome.
9883500	9884500	Why would they do that?
9884500	9885500	She's not doing anything.
9885500	9888540	I mean, she hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?
9888540	9890380	She doesn't do anything.
9890380	9894140	She's just, she's unemployed right now.
9894140	9895540	I mean, come on.
9895540	9896540	I love it.
9896540	9897680	We've already seen her breasts.
9897680	9899900	It's not even that big a deal anymore.
9899900	9903860	Salacious pop and chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote
9903860	9904860	there.
9904860	9905860	No one wants to fuck a penny.
9905860	9909260	They want to fuck a heather or a hope.
9909260	9910260	Forget it.
9910260	9915260	And the estimated Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.
9915260	9922500	It's like, just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR
9922500	9923500	live event.
9923500	9927180	Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.
9927180	9929580	Go around and give everybody, I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?
9929580	9930580	That was it.
9930580	9931580	Okay.
9931580	9933060	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9933060	9934220	Um, Loki, I'll start with you.
9934220	9935220	Your final thought.
9935220	9939360	Final thought is I need the fine steering wheel for my main cabinet.
9939360	9944260	My final thought is I really want a taco from gym boys, even if Jamie hates it.
9944260	9949540	Uh, Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?
9949540	9951340	Did you watch the grudge for Halloween?
9951340	9952340	No.
9952340	9953340	Oh.
9953340	9957100	Um, I remember when you were like really into the ring and those books and all that.
9957100	9958740	I don't know if you, or ringoo and all that.
9958740	9961860	This gal at my work dressed up as Samara and she did a really good job.
9961860	9963860	This is such a really good costume.
9963860	9964860	That's cool.
9964860	9965860	Yeah.
9965860	9966860	Just made me think of you.
9966860	9967860	Cause I know you like used to really be into that whole series.
9967860	9968860	It's still into it.
9968860	9969860	Actually.
9969860	9977340	I need to find my copy of a, um, uh, loop again so I can read it cause that was my favorite
9977340	9978340	of those books.
9978340	9979340	All right.
9979340	9982860	Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next
9982860	9983860	week.
9983860	9984860	Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.
9984860	9985860	Oh, wait, wait.
9985860	9986860	I've been challenged.
9986860	9987860	To what?
9987860	9990460	Um, ionotropic says extended death rattle.
9990460	9991860	What?
9991860	9995260	Knock it off.
9995260	9996980	No, stop.
9996980	9997980	I'm gonna unplug.
9997980	9998980	Where's she on the mixing board here.
9998980	9999980	Stop it.
9999980	10000980	I need to get my thing.
10000980	10001980	Then you can death rattle us out.
10001980	10002980	Oh my God.
10002980	10003980	That's annoying.
10003980	10004980	Shut up.
10004980	10005980	All right.
10005980	10011820	Um, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio after that.
10011820	10015380	I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others
10015380	10020440	about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game
10020440	10021440	company behind us.
10021440	10025060	We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.
10025060	10026060	All right.
10026060	10027060	Okay.
10027060	10028060	Excellent.
10028060	10029060	Set again again.
10029060	10030060	Cause the things that come out of that are filthy.
10030060	10031060	So until then.
10031060	10032060	And full of phlegm.
10032060	10033060	Have a great week.
10033060	10034060	We'll see you next time.
10034060	10035060	Here on orange launch radio.
10035060	10036060	Oh my God.
10036060	10037060	Her noise made the dolls fall over.
