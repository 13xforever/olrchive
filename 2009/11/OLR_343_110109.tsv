14005	24573	Tonight, November 1st, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video game?
31923	32544	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
51841	53923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
68764	70065	I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.
82990	84851	I stayed home and passed out candy to
113510	114191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
125950	128172	And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.
128872	131174	It's like, where's this country coming to?
131435	136459	I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.
137219	145146	It says, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.
146067	146307	Nice.
147648	147728	Um...
148889	152431	Well, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.
152552	157955	Like, I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and LiveJournal and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.
158415	161097	You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick-or-treating anymore.
161397	163779	And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know.
163879	173786	Like, I even know when I was growing up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor, and before we were allowed to eat it, we had to, you know, sift through it to make sure there were no needles in it.
173826	177448	Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but never mind.
178314	179336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
190345	196091	I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill haunted house, which I know we were talking about at length on the show previously.
196111	201796	You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to... Well, I mean, I'm just saying the haunted house is probably crap.
202357	210124	Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.
211145	214648	They went to the haunted house, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay...
215669	216129	YouTube YouTube
244700	245641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
272103	276426	I try not to look into Halloween too much.
276506	280188	I realize it has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in.
280528	284870	But I'm just like, it's just kind of a... Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.
285811	288072	I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.
288532	291814	But it's just a day to be silly and have fun.
291834	293115	Wear a costume, have fun.
293635	297778	What are they letting these pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.
297818	298118	It's like...
298778	303442	Whoa, hey, uh, what, you decided to go with slut?
303562	306184	I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
306224	315812	Well, also, I don't know, and I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think, like, it's a way that you can actually do cosplay, like, legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.
316432	318193	Like, that's kind of what Halloween is, right?
318674	325940	Well, my last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.
326820	327180	Awesome.
328733	330155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
348956	349877	Oh, did you find some YouTubes?
349977	354360	That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called a fag as well.
355101	355881	This is true.
356402	368791	In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually came home from Target, and I actually showed my roommate, and by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the Snuggie to my roommate, and I'm like, look!
369011	369512	Look what I got!
369532	370032	Look what I got!
370072	370933	He's like, you fag.
371894	374376	No, he didn't really say that, but that was his reaction, pretty much.
374696	375857	So, anyhow...
377657	381202	Oh, so we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube, it looks like.
382284	383245	You find the good stuff.
383286	386010	I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.
386230	389214	The camera's too shaky.
389435	392719	See if there's a scary pyramid head or something if you manage to make it that far in.
393120	395642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
422605	423145	I was mad.
423966	427968	And I actually didn't play any Sims.
429829	433231	And I watched Dan play some of the palette of Gay Tony.
435152	436233	It was interesting.
437543	440286	I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting at home.
440326	441267	How depressing is that?
441407	441927	You dork.
442648	442948	I know.
443869	447512	Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years, and I just kind of like, I'm too busy playing WoW.
447813	448273	Oh, oh, oh.
448634	448794	Yes?
450635	452898	I actually played some Rock Band last night.
453758	454259	Good times.
455200	455820	I miss Rock Band.
455840	459864	It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end of the year, promise.
459884	462046	Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.
462346	462507	Yeah.
464027	473715	I can bring over my Rock Band No, don't encourage me, because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need to get mine fixed, Loki will bring Rock Band He's an enabler Alright, yes, you're an enabler Well, Loki, the enabler, how was your gaming week?
474235	484463	Speaking of which, I was actually, um Well, it looks neat, I mean, because it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted set, or something
487961	488823	Oh, they're getting scared.
488924	491289	Oh, I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.
491309	493595	That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.
493635	494156	What is that?
496704	499786	This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.
500086	501087	I think he fell.
502187	502487	Whatever.
502808	503588	This is crap.
504569	507230	If Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.
507270	509592	Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?
509612	514695	I picked up LEGO Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock Band 2.
516055	517456	The track list is pretty cool on it.
517636	519037	I like a lot of stuff that's in there.
520618	523420	It's going to be fun to actually be able to put it all into Rock Band 2.
524633	530515	And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you know, LEGO stuff running around.
530575	536117	And the story modes kind of need to have little cutscenes and stuff that you expect from, like, another LEGO Telltale game.
538477	538758	I don't know.
539038	540778	It's just pretty much what you expect.
540958	543039	But the track list is awesome.
543099	546060	So I'd say pick it up for that reason only.
547314	555860	Um, then of course, you know, because this week we had the, um, Ballad of Gay Tony come out, of course I picked up Episodes of Liberty City.
556801	560023	Um, and the game's pretty sweet.
561584	565727	Um, the, I like a lot of the stuff they add in there that's really over the top.
565747	566888	The new weapons are pretty nice.
568289	569630	But Rockstar has this...
570563	571864	Thanks for watching!
584178	585198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
605091	623115	And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know, big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections of the map that weapons will spawn now.
623675	629317	So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your deathmatches in, which...
630356	630796	DarkSakura.com
651363	653084	Deathmatch, Parachutes
675775	678497	Deathmatch Deathmatch Deathmatch
704191	705732	Go Lost and Damned are the original game.
706693	708214	Other than that, though, it's pretty sweet.
708334	710435	All the new weapons are awesome.
710455	720021	They even added some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super punch, which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.
720041	720601	Falcon Punch?
721622	722162	Something like that.
722523	725905	But it's great with the super punch so you can kick people in the nuts and they kind of fly into the air.
725965	727005	So that's pretty sweet.
730396	732076	DJ Hero I played a little DJ Hero this week
760578	764161	Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene, though.
764461	765022	LOL.
765182	768084	And that's from chat.orangesoundtrader.com if you're just joining us tonight.
768725	769385	Join us in our chat room.
771286	776209	Is there controversial something-something going on in the new expansion, or are we just all desensitized to it now?
776429	777630	I don't think it's anything new.
777971	781433	I mean, it's the way I think he's talking about it.
781933	787057	If you dance well enough, I guess, in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them in the bathroom.
787417	788217	It doesn't show anything.
788277	789318	Just like real life.
789438	790039	Amazing.
790179	791039	Just like real life, yes.
791680	793141	Only if you're a politician.
793261	796523	It's just as censored as, say, the original game.
796943	800225	It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all.
801846	802747	It's just something funny.
802947	804548	And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.
804869	809052	You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.
809392	813875	That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex.
814375	819419	But I think if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.
820000	820540	Just saying.
822421	823722	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
824703	827405	Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.
828918	831383	I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.
831483	832325	No, I'm just kidding.
832546	834089	They're all like 30 years old.
834470	837337	How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?
837638	837918	I don't know.
839400	841061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
860698	864579	One new game I did play this week though outside of World of Warcraft DJ Hero
890208	891089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
908524	909324	Thank you for watching!
937811	939555	and some of these other little highlights.
939655	942040	But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.
942321	945968	And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.
946489	947692	I mean, really, to take...
948564	949605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
968857	970658	Zero in common with Beatmania.
970959	979564	So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the eye and you tell them you're a fucking fool or a sheep or something.
979604	986109	Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.
986469	988811	The games both have falling notes.
989451	990052	and DarkSakura.com
1007469	1007629	DJ Hero
1022571	1022972	Thanks for watching!
1039255	1040816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1061352	1067636	I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.
1067896	1068476	But you know what?
1068656	1071518	I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.
1072058	1073959	I don't really care for Jay-Z.
1074419	1075660	I can't stand Eminem.
1075920	1081443	I think he's the biggest overexposed artist I can think of in the past 50 years.
1081463	1081543	Cool.
1083064	1084445	I don't like him.
1084525	1085865	I don't like his personality.
1085925	1087046	I don't like his songs.
1087526	1088467	I hate him.
1088847	1095470	But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed the songs together are actually kind of cool.
1095770	1100272	Like that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny.
1100413	1101113	And I dug it.
1101373	1103794	And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.
1103834	1106095	It felt like this whole new different song I never really heard before.
1106415	1109357	And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.
1109797	1110578	Like the whole like...
1111658	1138517	The Jacksons and Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind I freaking love that song and I gotta say I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is like my favorite song in the game right now and it gets stuck in my head during the day like the little back and forth so you know I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long time and I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it
1138877	1139898	You have the three buttons.
1140158	1141199	You have the scratching.
1141439	1143321	You have certain direction scratching.
1143541	1144602	You have cross fading.
1144822	1146003	You have the euphoria button.
1146223	1149165	You have the sampling that you change with a little knob.
1149405	1151887	You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.
1152087	1153749	Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.
1154229	1154970	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1182768	1189613	There's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool, and even Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up to 11.
1190594	1195277	Or, like, in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that all the stages were set around.
1195537	1201262	And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the game, something to tie everything together.
1201602	1203904	DJ Hero doesn't really have that.
1204344	1207947	It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.
1208607	1224640	and the game never really walks you through the menus you don't really know like am I supposed to play these custom set lists or can I just do my own thing and I can't really do my own thing anyway I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song it's a little weird
1225601	1226021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1244546	1257442	and the song list and making that all perfect and they did a kick-ass job but the rest of it feels just kind of like tacked on like everything that kind of streams it all together so for that reason I can't say it's a perfect game oh and online
1258902	1259623	Thank you for watching!
1276089	1277089	could be there that's not.
1277510	1281231	But is this a real kick-ass first entry in a future franchise?
1281711	1282851	Yes, yes, yes.
1282992	1284012	It's a great first game.
1284472	1290354	You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that too, where there wasn't really a lot of glue holding it together.
1290894	1293675	I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.
1294136	1298497	But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.
1299077	1300278	And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.
1300318	1302719	It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.
1304659	1307282	TigerClaw says, so there's no Battle of the DJs mode?
1307822	1308243	Not really.
1308343	1317733	I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy, I guess you say, a frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.
1317913	1322297	I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.
1323138	1324119	In fact, it's kind of funny.
1324640	1334269	I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3 or I really am better than I give myself credit for because I'm in like the top 100 on a bunch of songs right now.
1334289	1336451	Of course, the game just came out last week.
1336491	1340195	I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.
1340655	1340755	So...
1341927	1343628	I'm trying to look at some more chat comments.
1343948	1353912	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Vanis Lux, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.
1354532	1360895	And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment.
1360955	1361335	It's a $120 investment.
1361355	1361395	So...
1364312	1364732	and DarkSakura.com.
1389071	1391933	But, you know, again, $120 is a big investment.
1392374	1400240	Until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it will, but as the chatter said there, not for about a year.
1401081	1406405	Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?
1406726	1407786	I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.
1411719	1416343	TigerClaw on chat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music for DJ Hero.
1416643	1418345	Imagine if they released a trance pack.
1418665	1419306	You know what's funny?
1419406	1433197	One of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.
1433357	1434959	I like the Yo-Yo Girl song.
1435453	1436954	Thanks for watching!
1460566	1467052	But when you have 93 songs to choose from, it doesn't really bother me at all.
1467613	1472377	And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the GameStop code.
1473618	1475140	And they're both great.
1476121	1477442	But we'll talk more about that later in the show.
1478945	1484429	Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.
1485250	1488092	Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.
1488392	1496879	This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, Alpha Cananogram, and it's running on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country.
1497500	1503344	But I had to say this because the article is called, Wii's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.
1505131	1516583	The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the worst-selling Wii title ever, Tsukiban Sachao Rena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership of a talking female cat, Rina.
1517144	1520608	It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies.
1520928	1522490	Then they linked to a couple of YouTubes.
1523030	1538522	Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity, creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.
1539422	1547788	Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup, and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debacles,
1549889	1554111	Some might wonder if perhaps some kind of quality seal system might be useful.
1555271	1565654	Now, obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even cite what source they're using.
1566095	1566775	You know what's funny?
1567235	1570116	I bet it's 100 copies imported to the U.S.
1570876	1572457	is probably more like it.
1572638	1574840	Yeah, 1% of their sales!
1575220	1583007	I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter has 200 some odd followers alone.
1583387	1584308	I mean, really?
1584748	1586930	Like, give me a source of some sort, please.
1587130	1590093	I think they also published something that said it sold more.
1590876	1610633	yeah so I don't know how I feel about that but that was linked by a chatter and if in case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from foreign countries such as that one you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangelandreda.com I just wanted to let you know please source or GTFO so there you go
1612085	1615087	And Loki, you're going on to VGCharts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?
1615568	1616028	Of course!
1616268	1616889	Of course you are.
1617269	1621072	I don't know if they'll actually have... It just came out.
1621132	1623173	I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.
1623414	1624614	Well, they're pretty quick.
1625195	1628197	Of course, this is downloading very slowly.
1629958	1632100	And... I don't even know if this is on here.
1633441	1633741	I don't know.
1633841	1637984	Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only sold 100 copies.
1638084	1639045	Please deny.
1639085	1640366	Okay, well, let me put it this way.
1640726	1641027	We would...
1641829	1644190	It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.
1645151	1645551	Easy.
1646891	1647352	Easy.
1650873	1651093	I know.
1651293	1651493	I know.
1651553	1653034	I don't know.
1653054	1657956	There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to kick President Cat while they're down.
1658216	1660197	This site is like the Glenn Beck of gaming.
1660257	1660798	I'll ask them on Twitter.
1661018	1661218	What?
1662698	1663559	I'll ask them on Twitter.
1663579	1664359	Yeah, ask them on Twitter.
1666540	1666800	Alright.
1667581	1667801	I know.
1667821	1669301	I agree with GamerGirl in chat.
1669341	1670622	How can you not like Prez Cat?
1671916	1673477	GameGuru says, quality seal.
1673557	1677079	Dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game worked on the system.
1677459	1677939	True enough.
1678360	1682942	GameGuru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.
1683422	1695068	And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.
1695108	1697890	They don't have any sort of...
1700589	1700949	Anything.
1701710	1705732	There's no sales figures yet.
1706233	1712056	And Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom, chat.orangeentradio.com says, It was former president Dogg spreading the rumors.
1712677	1713077	I bet.
1714383	1715263	I'm President Dog.
1716204	1717164	Prime Minister Dog.
1717324	1717644	Alright.
1718624	1719445	Let's move on.
1720345	1721085	Let's move on.
1721345	1723026	Actually get to some real gaming stories.
1723066	1726947	I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean.
1727768	1728388	And you're a douche.
1728408	1728968	No, I'm just kidding.
1729248	1729748	I understand.
1729788	1732629	But our Twitter is twitter.com slash OLR.
1732889	1734310	You can also follow us on Facebook.
1734350	1737131	We have a club there, the OL Army, and all that fun stuff.
1737651	1738011	Awesome.
1738271	1738931	Yes, DarkSakura.
1738991	1741112	I just finished the most amazing French toast.
1741552	1742193	Congratulations.
1742213	1743153	Where was your French toast from?
1743604	1747186	It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli Will it give you a magic voice back?
1747286	1748667	Will it give you your voice back?
1748727	1759513	Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi Because remember, I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop Would you like one?
1760340	1761160	Actually, I would love that.
1761721	1762601	I'm a little hot in here.
1762621	1767283	I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because of your disease, but... My disease, thank you.
1768043	1769163	Your affliction.
1769544	1783109	No, it's like I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm, and actually I wear a scarf to work, is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start coughing, so...
1784509	1785551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1799932	1802934	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.
1803174	1804975	Loki, start us off if you would tonight.
1805555	1814920	So, Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service to the PS3.
1814980	1825406	Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox 360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from Netflix.
1826627	1828348	Basically, using this disc, it'll
1829108	1829688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1851522	1852162	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1877875	1878815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1907302	1914349	But what I find fascinating about this is that just last week on the show I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke while we were live last week.
1914369	1915129	We just didn't catch it.
1915590	1922256	But I was just talking about, like, hey, you know, if Microsoft wants to compete with Sony... Because what's Sony's big thing right now?
1922396	1923297	It does everything.
1923477	1927981	You know, and to be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP.
1928382	1930123	And to some extent the PS3.
1930143	1931665	It really does a lot of stuff very well.
1932205	1932425	But...
1933410	1938931	Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system which includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix.
1939372	1943213	And, you know, streaming Netflix could kind of compete with Blu-ray in a way.
1943713	1943993	Oops!
1944573	1945933	Now the PS3 has Netflix too!
1946974	1947794	Yeah, but you have to order it.
1948154	1959317	And mainly they were saying, like I said before, one of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around a clause that they had...
1961239	1969966	for their contract with Microsoft saying that basically this cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something like that.
1970106	1972408	So it's not appearing on a dashboard.
1972468	1974409	It's actually a program now that someone else is running.
1974489	1976451	So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.
1980567	1983051	I don't know, what do you think this means for the whole console wars?
1983091	1985514	Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground?
1986015	1987297	No, I don't think it means anything.
1987477	1990842	Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.
1991182	1993505	It's just it's good for Netflix.
1993545	1994467	That's basically it.
1994567	1996990	I mean, because I think...
1998317	1999258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2017341	2019884	It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works.
2019945	2029237	If it works as well as it does on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard, it's just a Blu-ray disc.
2030871	2031852	So it'll be interesting.
2031872	2034154	The Microsoft interface is very bare bones.
2034374	2036596	So I'm wondering if it won't be a little more flat.
2036636	2043141	I can't imagine the look is going to be the same because on Netflix 360, the look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.
2043562	2047065	So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all.
2047365	2050548	So I'm kind of curious if it's going to be maybe better.
2051108	2051469	I don't know.
2051489	2052509	I mean, it could be worse too.
2052529	2053610	It could go either way.
2053630	2059335	It could be interesting if it uses like a crossbar style interface where all your genres maybe are in the crossbar.
2059515	2060116	It'll probably be like...
2060316	2061417	DeadPixel Live on weekdays.
2062218	2067103	If it uses BD Live like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray player that is BD Live capable?
2080997	2083378	Well, you know, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.
2084138	2088459	I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this Blu-ray Live thing.
2088499	2090100	And the Wii sometime as well.
2090480	2095581	This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.
2095601	2097422	This is about Netflix getting what they want.
2098342	2100243	So I don't know about this particular update.
2100323	2104404	I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that...
2106457	2114679	I would just have a hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player... I mean, because they don't really have strong processors in them.
2115340	2129284	I mean, I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would be difficult, I would think, to stream... Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video...
2130589	2134414	And having it look good, you know, it does require some processing power.
2134955	2140422	I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's beating live cable would be, you know, capable of that.
2140522	2147571	I could be wrong, but I would think it, you know, it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does, you know, streaming video.
2149494	2149814	I don't know.
2149834	2156336	Tropic in our chat room, chat.org.com wants to remind us, too, the disc-based Netflix for PS3 is supposed to be a temporary solution.
2156676	2158557	They said the disc won't always be required.
2158617	2162378	And you were talking about the contractual stuff maybe until 2010.
2162818	2163578	So it makes sense.
2164058	2168420	But, I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.
2168560	2171481	Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value.
2171581	2172581	And it's a win for Netflix.
2172641	2174662	And it's a small win for Sony.
2175942	2178283	But also Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room.
2179003	2182083	Isn't it a little late to put this into the console wars concept?
2182463	2186284	Most everyone that will ever get this gen systems already have one.
2186924	2188205	I'm not so inclined to agree.
2188625	2192506	I don't think Blu-ray has really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.
2192926	2196047	I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right.
2196147	2202208	But remember, we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which we is kicking butt at right now.
2203134	2210479	The problem is the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step.
2210579	2214001	Now, DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick.
2214862	2216743	And people are kind of hesitant.
2216783	2217683	Like, well, if I...
2218744	2222445	Convert my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray.
2223125	2225946	How soon is the next thing going to be that comes along?
2226366	2226966	I don't want to do that.
2226986	2232487	I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and just save some money that way because it's not really that big a difference.
2232767	2236288	Or, hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case there is no difference.
2237428	2237788	I don't know.
2238288	2240149	It's just not as...
2241349	2245170	Not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.
2245390	2251271	5thDream in our chatroom at chat.org.com comments, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current-gen stuff.
2251552	2253332	So certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.
2253372	2257033	I mean, if 5thDream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.
2257573	2259613	They don't own a current-gen system yet.
2259974	2264155	And let's not forget, current-gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.
2266395	2295160	and you know whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for like a college kid trying to pay for books and working a part-time job $200 is still an ass load of money you know that's like ramen for a year so you know not everybody's jumped on board with this yet you know it's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at right the PS2 got down to $99 finally right yeah that was back in March so there you go
2295965	2315144	We're going to get into the next story here, but first, I'm actually going to take a little detour because from the show roll we had, I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute ago.
2315885	2317647	So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.
2326837	2328618	Hello Hey, is this Mel B?
2330540	2332542	The one and only How are you doing, Mel?
2332602	2349796	Long time no talk since we've had you on the show Oh gosh, yeah, it's been quite a while since, you know, we've actually, you know, I mean, I've been chatting a few times here and there But yeah, actually, being a caller in, it's, oh yeah, it's been a good while, you know, it's up to you, hey, to, you know, DarkSakura and Loki
2351968	2354729	We're always happy to have you here on the show.
2380537	2400255	We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House, because I don't even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how, well, eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago, and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have got to come down here.
2400395	2402577	I will even pay for your ticket to go.
2403037	2403998	It was that good.
2404338	2405039	So I was like, okay, I
2405479	2405779	Oh, wow.
2405819	2415182	I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing a maze over in Brea, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.
2434267	2440269	and they were doing like essentially the equivalent to a human maze that was based on Silent Hill.
2440309	2446011	And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into the game, I've worked on some stuff and all that.
2446271	2448812	We're like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?
2449332	2451813	So we got to do it on a Halloween night.
2451893	2453333	So that was, yeah, just last night.
2454133	2459715	And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like essentially the maze was created inside
2460461	2476146	What I thought it would have been a abandoned movie theater or something like that, because there's actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and all those types of things.
2476206	2477526	You're more standard scary stuff.
2478387	2479147	Yeah.
2479167	2484508	When you get in, the first thing you do is, like, say, take a picture just sort of like for a bit of a souvenir type thing.
2484849	2489510	Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust up there right behind you, like,
2490775	2492276	Get your shock reaction, obviously.
2492376	2496378	So you can tell these people are about to get you pretty startled pretty bad.
2496738	2507084	And once you're going in, once you actually enter the maze, it's like indoors, it's really dimly lit with a lot of crimson lighting and just real dark and stuff.
2507364	2512807	And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people tops.
2513127	2513988	So it's pretty narrow.
2514008	2515889	It has a very claustrophobic feel.
2516469	2517830	So already it's just
2518346	2520788	You know, kind of creeping yourself out, especially if you play the game.
2521308	2545728	You know, a lot of it is just, it's not so much, you see creepy things everywhere, you know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know something's going to happen, you don't know when it will, and that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can make, like, you know, one turn, then the second turn, you didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off in the side, first monster, you know, just jumps out at you and, you know, scares you, like, stops and like, ahhh, and for me, because
2546437	2548698	I get pretty jumpy just on about anything.
2548958	2552019	It was like, whoa, you know, you jump.
2552240	2560163	But you can tell the monsters are coming after you, but the good thing the way they set it up is you can't touch them, they can't touch you.
2560503	2563164	It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.
2563304	2564525	It's like a strip club.
2564705	2565405	Strip club rules.
2565805	2566245	It's like what?
2566566	2567606	It's like strip club rules.
2568386	2569607	For lack of a better term.
2570300	2577602	Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll sort of just sort of bang on the door, well, walls, and start kind of following you.
2577642	2582483	That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know, corridor or whatever.
2583083	2585904	And when I first heard that, I was amazed.
2586204	2590005	So, like, one of the things they mentioned on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?
2590325	2593946	They said, it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed.
2594741	2598424	But, um, cool thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.
2598444	2600386	There is sort of, like, a mess to all their madness.
2600406	2603348	There are, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.
2604049	2620482	Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like, Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.
2620802	2624245	Then, occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll see, like, those faces, like, the, when the
2624907	2626248	Evil Spirits start coming out.
2626668	2628569	They'll just come out through the wall and start chasing you.
2628629	2629749	Oh, weird.
2630029	2634411	You'll see, like, those evil dogs that you normally see.
2634431	2637532	I think they're, like, in Part 4 and Homecoming.
2638533	2639633	Yeah, you saw them before.
2639873	2643375	You'd see, like, occasionally a dog, you know, in a cage trying to come after you.
2644835	2646456	They do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3.
2646756	2649837	Like, there was this one setup that they have, like, on the side room.
2650217	2653679	It's, like, at the bottom there's a television screen and you can see sort of, like, the
2654864	2655504	Rollercoaster
2685154	2686355	That's like the scene out of the movie.
2686375	2686495	Wow.
2686515	2689836	Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear Depends just to get through the photo shoot.
2689857	2691998	But our chat room is dying to know, how was their Pyramid Head?
2692018	2693478	Did they have a Pyramid Head?
2693518	2695239	Oh, please say they had Pyramid Head.
2714764	2716245	Oh, yeah, Pyramid Head was the payoff.
2716465	2720627	I mean, anyone who, you know, the fan always knows Pyramid Head is what you came here for.
2721047	2724548	So that was, um, that was actually the last thing that you see.
2724568	2731491	So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming.
2732432	2733872	Like, they have that part there.
2733892	2739675	It's funny, as you leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2740475	2742036	So it was like, hmm, kind of, you know, interesting.
2742506	2747187	So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's like this sort of kind of like shrine over there.
2747247	2752089	At the top, you see a figurine, like a big busted pyramid head, which is like really well done.
2752109	2753449	It's like, wow, that's kind of cool.
2753729	2756390	And so you still fixate on looking at that, just trying to internalize that.
2756710	2765072	Then out of a gate, popped out pyramid head, huge, you know, pyramid head, like the big sword, you know, that just must be at least five feet long.
2765132	2767913	So he starts coming after you, starts like, you know, pretending to stab.
2768213	2769594	It'll push you back a little bit.
2769734	2770754	I would have broke down and cried.
2771175	2772195	I would have broke down and cried.
2772275	2774916	You would have had to carry me out.
2775136	2777957	Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the building.
2778778	2779258	I would have cried.
2780098	2790702	But yeah, I mean, for me, it was just like, I mean, it's funny because Melody, I mean, after she's gone through, she said, wow, I wasn't really scared.
2791022	2792262	And I was like, how could you not be?
2792282	2799945	But then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled or doesn't invest herself in the game because when we're going through, like, all the bathrooms and stuff, we see all the
2800629	2801029	Oh my gosh.
2801049	2804372	So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they do a good job?
2804392	2806534	I thought they did a really, really good job.
2806554	2807495	They really got you inside.
2807555	2807935	They created...
2830646	2838910	The Vs, especially if you did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you.
2839330	2842752	So, like, you all always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner.
2843072	2846293	You know, in some places, when you go into the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain.
2846874	2848174	And so, you know, it's like the black curtain.
2848194	2849275	You gotta, like, peek through it.
2849295	2850155	You just don't know.
2850315	2852756	So, you know, fear is in there.
2852836	2856478	So it's overall tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you know, just experiencing
2858370	2867917	And just to clarify, some folks in the chatroom wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape you?
2867998	2870760	No bodies were defiled during the haunt.
2871340	2872581	Oh, that's right, they can't touch you.
2872601	2883589	He had his, you know, gate on the side, and you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but for all we know, you know, they might be adding something, you know, they're made over something I didn't catch.
2883710	2886652	Maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.
2886980	2888880	Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.
2889441	2891941	Alright, Mel, thank you so much.
2892141	2893701	I really appreciate you coming on the show.
2893801	2895562	I know you guys are driving home right now.
2895602	2898863	You're calling us literally from the road, probably driving up I-5 or something.
2899663	2900743	Have a safe drive back.
2900863	2902603	Thank you guys so much for coming on the show.
2903744	2905664	We'll hope to see you in studio in the near future, okay?
2910365	2911045	Okay, take care.
2911085	2912726	I think we might have just lost him at that point.
2915407	2916308	Wow, I didn't even think of that.
2916328	2919511	Hold on, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for a little bit.
2919531	2921393	October 30th, 1999 was what, the first time you played Bimani?
2921413	2923775	Ten years later, look at how everything's gone and
2939653	2946118	Still fans, still doing it, and look where it's taking us.
2946458	2947759	Thanks for making me feel old, Mel.
2947779	2948300	No, I'm kidding.
2948320	2953824	It looks like I'm breaking up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe we'll talk about it more next week.
2953844	2955105	All right, thanks, man.
2955125	2955605	Y'all be good.
2963280	2968384	Alright, thank you very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message notice.
2968544	2969245	I appreciate that.
2969725	2970306	Alright, that was fun.
2970366	2971327	I don't know, it sounded pretty good.
2971507	2975990	I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so Jamie, if it comes back next year, I think we're gonna road trip.
2976571	2977832	But make sure I bring diapers.
2978933	2979193	Alright.
2979493	2986459	We'll bring you... Or make sure I at least void myself before we go into the haunted house.
2986939	2987300	Yeah.
2987460	2987780	Okay.
2989221	2992324	We'll just get you a big pack of oops, I crapped my pants.
2993439	2993919	Sounds good.
2994440	2997982	Alright, hey, moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.
2998062	3000984	In fact, the only thing it was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing.
3001464	3003505	There's another DSi coming out.
3003545	3005967	That's right, this will be the fourth version of the DSi coming out.
3006387	3013912	It's coming out in Japan very soon, the DSi LL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and, yes, America, as the DSi XL.
3014752	3018114	The DSi LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.
3018695	3022417	Basically, the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with 4-inch screens.
3022717	3023339	TSI, Leonardo Leonardo
3030501	3033684	No, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.
3033824	3035846	It's also the DSI XL over there.
3035866	3037307	It's just in their language, it's LL.
3037888	3040610	So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.
3041711	3044174	Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.
3044894	3048778	It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until next year.
3048818	3050359	It has been confirmed for all the regions.
3051060	3052902	And I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay.
3053442	3056263	Well, to be fair, I never bought the DSi.
3056943	3060243	But if I did buy the DSi, I might feel a little bit irritated.
3060263	3065224	Because if I bought stuff on the DSi store, it's not like there's a cable that's going to connect my two things.
3065684	3069125	It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP.
3069205	3071305	There'd be no slot for me to put the discs in.
3072286	3073666	At least I could still play the games.
3073786	3079147	But yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people who didn't jump on board with the DSi the first time, like me.
3080527	3081008	I don't know.
3081148	3083209	Loki, how has the DSi been selling?
3084190	3085250	Is there a need for this?
3085390	3086471	What was your take on all this?
3086771	3088552	Well, this is just for old people.
3089853	3095837	Basically, they've said it's for so other people can watch you play the games.
3096517	3099319	So basically, you're advertising for Nintendo now.
3100179	3100500	Sort of.
3101411	3102812	Game Boy Advance slot back in there.
3127372	3129114	Since, you know, now size isn't the matter.
3129955	3132617	Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?
3132637	3142307	I understand that, but, you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance a lot, and, you know, other games have... Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...
3145376	3147717	Yes, that's true, but... Ha, I win.
3147757	3157719	I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down the system to make it smaller, and, you know, it couldn't fit, they couldn't fit that in there.
3158099	3162801	Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore.
3163701	3165901	So, in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.
3167062	3167322	Yup.
3167582	3167862	Hmm.
3167882	3170123	I don't know how I feel about this.
3170503	3171503	Well, and also, too, I mean...
3172628	3178893	You're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.
3179853	3180654	I mean, I don't know.
3181675	3185097	And do I really need a 4-inch screen, or at least two 4-inch screens?
3185237	3186538	I can see it just fine.
3186638	3191682	I don't need glasses to read the text on that screen.
3192782	3196825	If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me put it on my television.
3197286	3203651	Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.
3204071	3207474	Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
3207534	3208695	Yeah, something along those lines.
3208835	3209776	Or like the dev kits.
3210819	3211580	Yeah, bingo.
3211760	3212080	Thank you.
3214401	3217023	And then Actdeft in chat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld.
3217103	3217704	Now, thanks.
3217764	3218204	Yeah, that's right.
3218224	3223387	We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn well it could play them if it wanted to.
3224288	3224428	Yeah.
3225097	3233820	because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.
3234201	3242084	Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?
3242604	3243004	Remember that?
3243104	3243384	Good times.
3243424	3250967	And also remember how you could get free Nintendo games streamed to your Game Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?
3251127	3251788	And there was like...
3252808	3254871	You know, 30 some games in there.
3255692	3257014	Oh, but you don't get that anymore.
3257234	3259377	In fact, we're just going to keep Animal Crossing the same.
3260920	3262422	I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.
3262442	3263403	I just want you to know that.
3263423	3264365	I don't care what they do.
3264445	3267409	I don't care if it's the greatest thing on Earth.
3267629	3268350	I'm not buying it.
3269457	3269778	I don't know.
3269798	3273643	This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 is unnecessary handhelds.
3274484	3274784	I don't know.
3274804	3278590	I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need it.
3278790	3282054	How's the PSP Go selling is what I want to know.
3282254	3283276	That's a good question.
3283316	3284337	I'd be curious about that.
3284357	3284838	Yeah.
3284938	3285938	Well, anyhow, there you go.
3286018	3287779	There's the information on the new DS.
3288319	3288919	Take it or leave it.
3288979	3290820	I'm sure there's some folks that are going to be excited about it.
3290920	3295501	I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi I think will be more into this.
3296201	3298842	Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that will be all over this no matter what.
3299362	3300663	It's also more expensive, remember.
3301832	3304834	Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.
3305775	3310998	I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.
3311058	3316222	Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS Lite.
3316262	3317663	I never got on board with the DSi.
3318063	3319704	But right now, I'm not feeling it.
3320985	3321505	That's where I'm at.
3321545	3325308	If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.
3325568	3327349	But for now, I'll pass.
3327950	3329431	Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.
3329751	3329911	Yeah.
3331257	3333179	For very similar reasons, oddly enough.
3355157	3358219	Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online
3383134	3383634	We ban you!
3384494	3386915	Yes.
3388055	3394577	Anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?
3395677	3400698	God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit, I'm going to sue you again!
3400878	3405660	So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.
3405700	3406260	And on top of all that, um,
3414586	3416109	This is just awesome.
3417773	3419135	He is also not going to have a lawyer.
3419376	3421440	Once again, he's going to be representing himself.
3422101	3424045	Because only a fool represents himself.
3425492	3428675	Yes, he will once again opt out of using a lawyer.
3429375	3439403	And the best part about it was he said before that his First Amendment rights were basically being trampled on and that's why he should get $55,000.
3440644	3443346	The judge says no and dismissed the case.
3443787	3444868	And so now he's trying it again.
3445288	3449551	But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.
3449591	3451173	It doesn't cost anything.
3452543	3452984	Free!
3453404	3455306	It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.
3455907	3457168	It's free!
3457528	3458890	Okay, Devil's Advocate.
3459510	3464035	What about all the purchases you made on your old account that are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?
3465165	3468566	Well, then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the Terms of Service.
3469346	3469706	That's right.
3469726	3474648	I think Sony's covered in their Terms of Service, hence why the Constitution does not apply.
3475008	3480509	You agree to be signing up for a club, an exclusive network, where the First Amendment rules don't apply.
3481010	3490592	If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you can't complain and say, wah, wah, wah, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.
3491053	3492093	They have every right to do that.
3492133	3492633	It's private.
3492913	3493413	It's private.
3494054	3495895	Same goes with any kind of web forum.
3496716	3500638	So, this guy's just kind of a douche.
3501659	3503660	I like how we all said a different word in tandem there.
3503680	3504180	That was great.
3504741	3506042	Mo-ran.
3507162	3512566	There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system just look stupid.
3513066	3513967	I mean, I understand.
3514327	3514907	In this case?
3515388	3515548	Mm-hmm.
3517045	3518867	Because they're going to have to throw it out again.
3519528	3525835	I mean, the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally setting a precedent that this is stupid.
3527523	3536106	Well, and at least he's not wasting money on... Well, I guess he's being smart and not wasting money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.
3536306	3545030	The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
3545430	3548671	However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff.
3550032	3553033	And if you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well...
3554403	3556045	It's hard for me to feel a lot of pity for you.
3556285	3558869	Because what you said probably would have offended me.
3559490	3560070	Just guessing.
3560531	3561172	Probably would have.
3561372	3562914	And I don't get offended very easily, by the way.
3564576	3565978	But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.
3567887	3573609	One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the PlayStation 3 has lost them quite a bit of money.
3574349	3578031	$4.7 billion to be exact.
3579611	3580592	Billion dollars.
3582172	3589115	Apparently, this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that Sony came out with this week.
3589735	3591176	The PS3 has lost Sony $4.695 billion.
3591196	3591836	Keep in mind...
3594797	3598520	Game companies really lose money every time they sell a system.
3598540	3601121	They're losing money on parts and so forth.
3603423	3608866	Game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later with things like...
3609907	3613768	Let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-ray, so they get money back with every Blu-rays that are sold.
3614028	3617769	They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.
3617789	3619210	They make the money back in other ways.
3619310	3621910	If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.
3622330	3623731	So, hold on a minute.
3623771	3627672	Before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger and say, Aha!
3627912	3628452	Thanks for watching!
3648764	3653010	These game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.
3653090	3657096	So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet.
3657216	3658257	Or anytime soon, really.
3658297	3661422	I think, if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.
3662363	3662524	Yeah.
3663264	3668105	I think this money could possibly turn around by next year or the year after.
3668705	3683308	And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce, saying, "...the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20 percent.
3683648	3686029	Within the year, it could be in the single digits."
3686869	3691192	will be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term
3704901	3712787	And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later on.
3713007	3715249	As we've been trying to tell them since the launch.
3716129	3715249	$600?
3716209	3717430	Are you crazy?
3718931	3721633	Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.
3721733	3725836	They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they won.
3726157	3727738	HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.
3727898	3729939	So they won that gamble.
3730891	3749605	so maybe this really truly was you know when they were talking about this 10 year plan and all that that's when this is probably going to end up really really paying off for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants blu-rays and so forth so we shall see anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're already an hour into the show we haven't even gotten to release dates
3751656	3766041	Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool, and I would like to see more of this going on, is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.
3766941	3778845	He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game, he shouldn't have to take out any of the, you know,
3779645	3784807	I have one very simple rule everything is allowed no limits as long as it makes sense in the story and is not gratuitous
3808888	3810688	Why is he having to defend himself?
3811229	3811529	Why?
3811869	3813169	Why is this allowed?
3830327	3842430	It just seems loud because you're... Anyway, I don't understand why the guy is being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.
3842510	3843950	Like, it's ridiculous.
3844011	3846791	Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?
3847231	3856994	Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things, but, like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now...
3857814	3862576	Why did you decide to show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?
3863277	3865318	Did you really have to show her boobs?
3865638	3868579	No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.
3869059	3874222	Why is this guy having to defend his game, or any creator having to defend their games and the artistic choices they make?
3874882	3878164	Oh, I see, because games aren't really art, according to some people.
3878204	3878864	Well, get over it.
3880405	3886748	I hate this, and I'm sure you all do, as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard
3887990	3890312	with video games versus movies.
3891153	3893215	It's all the same kind of thing.
3893955	3899440	Well, a lot of us who were anime fans back in the day got into the same thing.
3899961	3901462	People go, oh, it's cartoons.
3901542	3902623	It doesn't matter to me.
3903183	3909709	Well, no, it's just another way of communication.
3909789	3911231	It's just another medium.
3912492	3913573	Video games are the same thing.
3914637	3918919	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.
3920000	3921201	I want my eight bucks back.
3921481	3922401	I'm a plaintiff.
3924202	3924623	Plaintiff?
3925583	3926384	I'm a plaintiff!
3927724	3928945	Damn, that was a great show.
3929305	3930866	Yeah, it was.
3931126	3933708	He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.
3934226	3935807	He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.
3936247	3936687	Oh, really?
3936707	3937067	Sweet.
3937107	3937728	That might be fun.
3938028	3941870	It might actually be a good movie from him for once in the past, like, ten years.
3941890	3942770	Big American Party.
3943810	3944791	I liked Dogma.
3947552	3948653	All right.
3949413	3949913	Moving on.
3949953	3951434	A few more stories in release dates.
3951474	3953395	And, of course, the classic game of the week before too long.
3954298	3960500	Yes, apparently piracy on handheld systems is not limited to the DS and the PSP.
3961001	3974006	Apparently, also quite rampant on the iPhone, or at least the App Store, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even like 95%.
3974166	3974246	One...
3977563	3979003	I love their developer's name too.
3979484	3986586	One iPhone developer, SmellsLikeDonkey, says about 80% of all downloads of TapFu were illegally downloaded.
3987166	3989967	And they have a way, I guess, of telling that.
3990647	4002130	And apparently, the game was marked down to $1.99 and it still didn't affect the piracy rate.
4004275	4004995	Which is interesting.
4005515	4009736	You know what this story, do you know honestly what my gut reaction was to this story when I read it?
4011137	4013778	I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?
4013898	4014298	How?
4015778	4020059	Actually, I have a lot of them open because I have a few friends who have jailbroken iPhones.
4020079	4022400	Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?
4023200	4025501	Well, he says that he did, but there's other places.
4026781	4028261	I think they do have to be jailbroken.
4028581	4030262	Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear.
4030462	4030662	Huh.
4030862	4032524	Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.
4033184	4037288	I mean, I haven't, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.
4037428	4038609	I was never going to.
4039310	4039610	Me neither.
4039630	4047318	But I have a first-gen iPhone, and they're supposed to be super easy on that one.
4047338	4051742	That'd be something to do with an iPod Touch, I would think.
4052518	4066777	is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures though because like if the game didn't sell that much in the first place and you know this handful of people pirated your game well then you say a certain percentage has pirated your game when not that many people bought it to begin with because
4067478	4070399	Maybe the app store is just too flooded with crap right now?
4070419	4071479	Yours isn't sticking out?
4071639	4089083	They claim, like, for example, this other iPhone developer, Fishlabs, they said their game, Rallymaster Pro 3D, received a 95% piracy rate on its first day of release, and they said that that equates to about a few thousand copies.
4091063	4092084	So... Hmm...
4094326	4113112	I could see that you know if we're only talking a couple thousand I could see it there's a couple thousand people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games and a lot of pirates especially with something as little as an iPhone game because it's not like any of those games are that big probably just download them to download them play them once and throw them away I would bet you that's what most of those people do
4114952	4118814	Remember when the Dreamcast piracy was a big thing?
4118914	4120054	That's really a lot of them.
4120074	4122055	It's like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.
4122475	4125336	Or here's a great example, something that came up earlier in the show.
4125876	4126597	Mame ROMs.
4127457	4129218	How many people pirate Mame ROMs?
4129238	4133259	I think that's one of those things kind of like everybody does, but no one really talks about it.
4133519	4133899	I do it.
4134120	4136902	Tons of people download the main stuff from the 80s.
4136922	4139043	Those games aren't making money anymore.
4139064	4140605	Who cares?
4140825	4144348	I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent.
4144388	4144908	It doesn't matter.
4144948	4145689	I feel justified.
4145709	4146630	There's some games in there.
4146650	4148871	I don't even know what the hell they are and I'm probably going to try them.
4148911	4151273	And you play them once and you delete them.
4151694	4152835	That's still piracy.
4152915	4154256	You're still pirating a game.
4155282	4155802	Thanks for watching!
4174751	4176832	Oh man, seriously?
4177312	4182734	If you've never played this on MAME, it's the one MAME ROM everybody has to play, is Miss Nude World 96.
4182874	4186995	It's just, it's so bad.
4188076	4188676	It's awful.
4189016	4191857	I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.
4192197	4194218	Basically, it's the game, like, Kicks.
4194778	4195439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4215307	4241464	everybody move your body oh it's it's awesome but yeah I mean there's a lot of hack stuff out there and it's not practical for people to buy arcade cabinets and stuff and even still I mean a lot of the stuff you're buying secondhand anyways the developers already made their money off that stuff I don't know it's not like they're making new Miss Nude World 96 you know boards out there I don't know
4243603	4250648	Vanis Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new, there's nothing wrong with downloading it.
4250788	4255632	Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.
4257032	4260275	To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.
4260415	4264678	I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to just pirate it.
4265078	4271002	Which, yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.
4271462	4271883	I don't
4272563	4272803	DRM Free MB3
4301405	4303327	Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes.
4303427	4304087	They are not.
4304748	4305929	Just what I use.
4305969	4306369	Convenient.
4307630	4311894	Yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.
4312934	4317258	You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.
4319880	4323543	Anyhow, let's move on to another story here and then we'll get to release dates.
4324044	4325625	Was that all to say about the piracy story?
4325990	4327774	Yeah, it's just crazy.
4328155	4329779	That's really what it is.
4329839	4334469	Going into an article here about Rock Band...
4336607	4346775	Apparently, there's kind of talk going around that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had with Rock Band The Beatles.
4347436	4355882	Roger Daltrey, who of course is the lead singer of The Who, was speaking to The Republican recently, saying, quote, The game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.
4356283	4357183	There's one planned.
4357304	4358384	The idea is fabulous.
4358805	4361607	Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.
4362728	4364890	Now, of course, you know, sometimes these...
4365510	4367871	Old Rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.
4368271	4373452	He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made a similar mistake earlier this year.
4373732	4376013	They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.
4376753	4381174	I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge download pack before.
4381914	4391777	And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack, that there's so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.
4391937	4392897	I don't know, do you think The Who's...
4394244	4396045	Do you think that would warrant a whole new game?
4396465	4401248	I gotta admit, and I'm gonna get hate mail over this, but hear me out.
4401808	4404830	I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.
4405150	4410733	I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.
4411093	4412174	I know, hate me if you want.
4412654	4413354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4435640	4439161	Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.
4439701	4440422	Don't agree with me?
4440842	4442002	Then release the damn game.
4442062	4442702	Prove me wrong.
4443463	4443883	It's niche.
4445143	4454086	There could be like a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but like, you know how they do those disc releases of like, say, 20-some songs or whatever?
4454586	4455967	I could see that happening.
4457748	4458969	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4480774	4482675	And only the Beatles, I think, can justify.
4483696	4485197	I honestly can't think.
4485217	4489239	And I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different bands in chat right now and all this.
4489379	4494002	But I really don't think there's any band I can think of that justifies that.
4494702	4496303	Some of the Guitar Hero games.
4496823	4497884	Like, okay, Metallica.
4498084	4498544	Yeah, okay.
4498824	4500065	Yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.
4500505	4501046	Aerosmith.
4501106	4502106	I can see where they're getting a game.
4502446	4503067	Van Halen.
4504727	4508050	I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license anything after 1984.
4508210	4513514	Because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff.
4513774	4514515	But hey, that's just me.
4515296	4518818	Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.
4519539	4526625	Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means the last song in there was 25 years ago.
4527145	4530208	When most of the people buying these games are probably in their young 20s and teens.
4531989	4536596	A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.
4536636	4538719	Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.
4540181	4542885	It's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.
4544828	4545349	So there you go.
4546892	4562001	but again it's like it's so interesting because like then every argument I'm saying here against this game you could say well what about the Beatles what about the Beatles but the Beatles are the Beatles there's just there is no comparison seriously try it there's no comparison no I agree with you
4563021	4566644	So, anyhow, that was my little rant.
4566924	4568085	So, you know, and I'm cool.
4568105	4571467	Hey, you know, I realize, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right now, Rob, how dare you?
4572048	4579934	You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there, and, you know, especially, like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger group who just has an appreciation for classic rock.
4580034	4580634	Pinball Wizard.
4580874	4581555	You go!
4582035	4583136	Pinball Wizard's an awesome song.
4583156	4587239	There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new $50, $60 game?
4587359	4588100	Hell no!
4588780	4590802	Only for, you know, fans that...
4591522	4592243	The Who Justifies That
4612099	4614200	Hater's Gonna Hate Lady Gaga
4638732	4638792	P.S.
4638852	4639693	Rob, you're a dork.
4668786	4670447	But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.
4671187	4672608	People bought Britney's dance beat.
4672648	4673968	Damn it, Lady Gaga can have a game.
4675509	4676129	Alright, anyhow.
4676189	4676989	Sorry, release dates.
4677209	4678370	Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?
4678770	4680391	No, not this week, I'm afraid.
4681291	4682972	This week actually starting... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4683232	4684132	TigerClaw on chat.
4684512	4685193	Just made me lol.
4685813	4687373	It would be called Lady Gaga Game.
4690175	4692255	That's so stupid yet so funny.
4693656	4694456	Lady Gaga Game.
4696057	4698058	Or that'd be Lady Gaga Me.
4701250	4703051	I'm putting the mic down so I won't interrupt.
4728007	4731249	My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.
4732350	4737493	This week, LEGO Rock Band out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
4739334	4743577	Of course, the DS version is very similar to the PSP version of Rock Band.
4744237	4744818	Band Hero.
4745698	4751080	Also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
4751500	4754041	As well as the full band bundle as well.
4754101	4759422	If you feel like dropping $200 for that one, you can just get a World Tour bundle for about half the price.

4806659	4813542	I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the Cat game, President Cat, is the worst Wii game ever made.
4813582	4814782	Yet WeChair gets a sequel.
4815122	4815783	I'm just saying.
4816763	4817143	Trust me.
4817563	4821105	Anything made by Destiny is the worst Wii game ever.
4822265	4823366	Not President Cat.
4823486	4824426	President Cat's awesome.

4854622	4857167	What Grand Theft Auto on the DS should have been.
4857488	4858951	It's like the PSP Grand Theft Autos.
4860815	4861035	And...
4863895	4865896	Seriously, Konami, what are you doing?
4866656	4870017	Ultimate Party Challenge Bundle with... Alright.

4931297	4933598	Team elimination games from the Wii.
4933658	4935258	Yet another generic party game.
4935619	4940621	Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime a dozen.
4940861	4941781	Or hey, how about this?
4941821	4943042	Another deer hunting game.
4943162	4947243	Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer.

4994147	4996429	Now I want a game called Buckfutter, just to say I have it.
4997170	4998851	Can we get that on the indie games marketplace?
4999451	5000793	Xbox 360 in Japan.
5000853	5003014	We get Fallout 3, gets a price reduction over there.
5003074	5004536	Dirt 2 gets its release in Japan.
5004916	5006938	Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out.
5007058	5010260	I'm assuming that's very similar to a collection of what we got over here before.
5011081	5012322	NBA Live 10 comes out.
5012502	5017446	And Tayutama Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.
5017466	5018367	That sounds dirty.
5018587	5020249	It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DT.
5020891	5021652	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5048775	5072508	If you are curious about that, that is coming on the Xbox 360 this week On the PlayStation 3, a game we're going to talk about a little bit later on 3D.GameHeroes comes out I just want to point out, region free If you want to import it, but we'll talk a little more later about why you might not want to Dirt 2 comes out as well on the PlayStation 3 Infamous gets its release in Japan this week As well as NBA Live 10 And of course, World Soccer Winning 11 2010 Also a PlayStation 3 bundle
5075190	5079280	have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles that's kind of interesting
5082039	5087641	I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten warranted the two different systems being bundled with it.
5087801	5088121	Interesting.
5089121	5089662	Lego Batman.
5090542	5091142	Oh, good call.
5091162	5092923	That's PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360.
5093123	5095504	Nintendo Wii gets a few releases in Japan as well.
5095884	5097465	Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo.
5097765	5099746	I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.
5100026	5103307	But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario & Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.
5103447	5105708	Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.
5106128	5108589	And Mario & Sonic at the Olympics actually sold pretty well.
5108749	5110050	I know a lot of gamer...
5110811	5111211	and DarkSakura.
5131534	5133376	Nintendo DS has a handful of releases.
5133416	5134797	It's getting pretty busy over there in Japan.
5135237	5137679	Wireway comes out as well as Tamagotchi.
5137999	5139360	That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
5139941	5141762	No, Narikiri Shaniru.
5141782	5143764	I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.
5144945	5148488	Summon Night X, Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.
5148828	5149689	And Sakura Note.
5150189	5152030	Imanitsu Nagaru Mirai
5181332	5182815	Let's move over to Europe!
5184577	5186677	We have a number of releases.
5186837	5210862	We have on the fourth, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the sixth, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins, Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues, Need for Speed Nitro, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala We Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron.
5212662	5213142	Very cool.
5213598	5215979	Yep, pretty interesting stuff, I think.
5216499	5216719	Yep.
5217760	5218100	All right.
5218880	5232506	Well, many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.
5232866	5237588	Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning.
5238055	5238796	Thanks for watching!
5258131	5281547	and so because of that they've taken action against um you know some people and of course you know with each update that the console gets with each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles so um it's kind of interesting though you know myself i have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on live so yeah you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online right
5282622	5285765	We played modded Grand Theft Autos online all the time.
5285805	5286105	Really?
5286285	5286946	Yeah.
5287206	5287546	No problem.
5287726	5308464	But see, here's my theory on that, though, is that they have ways of individually checking consoles to see if the game is modded or, like, the console's modded, but it doesn't... For them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess, would be impossible for them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.
5309005	5309305	So...
5311324	5321596	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that are playing it online.
5321896	5326561	Okay, now we have a list of 100 people to check on versus a list of...
5327122	5328583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5345643	5346364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5365854	5369395	You know, once again, also, they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives.
5369415	5377438	They just released a new firmware to, you know, support what they call the Wave 4 disks, because basically each disk that comes out, they have, you know, the current update in there.
5377758	5386801	There's also a video track that if you're a dumb idiot and it puts your 360 in a DVD player, it says, hey, stupid, this is a 360 game, not a video, so, you know.
5387601	5388262	Did it really say that?
5388322	5388963	Hey, stupid!
5389564	5390245	No, it should, though.
5391006	5395954	And basically, they check the sizes of those to make sure that...
5397366	5397906	Thanks for watching!
5422004	5429797	Basically, each side, both Microsoft and the Pirates, they keep updating their tactics.
5431500	5432161	It'll never end.
5434724	5434944	Huh.
5435144	5438685	Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs.
5438805	5442486	And honestly, if you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what?
5442846	5443746	You kind of deserve it.
5444446	5446046	So, there it is.
5447607	5462530	By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, Ikuma JP, one of our listeners in Japan, who has really been just a great listener for us because he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes because we're so far away.
5463070	5467512	He actually linked us to a news article talking about how only 30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go.
5468373	5471094	And you know how sometimes, like in Japan, line, line, line, line.
5471875	5473435	Only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go.
5474356	5475636	You never found those sales figures, huh?
5476557	5477277	Oh, I didn't even look.
5477317	5479839	I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.
5480179	5480519	That's all right.
5481479	5484941	Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5484981	5490164	It's where Dark Sakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you guys should really check out.
5490224	5492305	It's called the Classic Game of the Week.
5494600	5499825	DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?
5516253	5525738	So, what month is... Because, as I neglected to put on the little thing, there's no background music in this game.
5526578	5534302	So what I put up is an actual example of conversation in the game that I found intensely hilarious from some guy's YouTube.
5534875	5535856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5558879	5579713	and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them and they turn into these fish with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something and they talk to you and you can have conversations with them and
5580673	5597255	As they go, you have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff as well as prepare a terrarium because you're going to eventually let them evolve into a frog and then they're going to run away.
5598371	5599772	So... Jesus Christ!
5599792	5601853	Because they're so needy and then they just dump ya?
5602473	5602914	Kinda.
5603414	5604795	Kick those semen to the curb.
5605155	5612860	But you can... They breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just kinda weird.
5614781	5621785	But your first stage is a Mushroomer, which is what they originally looked like.
5621825	5623066	And then you have Gilman.
5624326	5626628	And there's the ones that go, Mar-Mar-Mar.
5627408	5628589	That's all I remember them saying.
5629630	5635536	You get Podfish, and then after they mate, the male Podfish dies.
5636857	5640840	And you get Tadman, and Frogman.
5643042	5647186	And it's a very weird little game, but very fun.
5649288	5651790	I remember watching Dan talk to his fish.
5653431	5679442	for a long time and it also had Christmas Seaman that came out in Japan it also had a Red Translucent Dreamcast with it and then there was a PS2 version that got released later on and then there was a sequel that came out which is a lot more evolution involved but it was a fun little game
5679713	5685859	Now, even though you were making fish and frogs, you never ate them, so you weren't swallowing the semen, right?
5690983	5691564	Just checking.
5693165	5696668	Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue so you can hear some dude interact.
5696688	5698530	This is intensely hilarious.
5698570	5700172	Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his semen.
5700512	5703014	Your birthday in... October.
5704435	5705997	You were born in October.
5708240	5709680	Let's try that again.
5710661	5714662	In what month were you born?
5715503	5716283	October.
5717563	5719164	You were born in October?
5719524	5719824	Yes.
5721485	5725467	I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?
5726948	5727268	Treat.
5729329	5730489	Like the spice?
5732270	5732530	Yes.
5734560	5737421	Well, you can look, but don't touch.
5738141	5739641	This makes no fucking sense.
5739781	5740541	I know, it's great.
5740581	5743322	Just keep going, because I like the part where you suck the fish to fuck off.
5746723	5747543	What do you want?
5748503	5749083	To touch you.
5750923	5752284	I don't know that word.
5753364	5754124	You just said it.
5754184	5757665	So, what day is your birthday on?
5759025	5759385	Second.
5760846	5761566	The second?
5762266	5762866	Yes, bitch.
5764591	5767994	Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
5769075	5770976	I hope you are as peaceful as he.
5771997	5776581	I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
5778402	5779243	By the way, this is from... Fuck you!
5781425	5787790	Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.
5789131	5791093	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
5791954	5792414	Fuck them!
5795171	5797353	I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.
5797553	5799054	Ebola World is the name of it.
5799214	5800815	E-B-O-L-A World, okay?
5800835	5802016	Just before I play the rest of this.
5802477	5803157	Fuck them!
5804819	5806400	Hey, why all the noise?
5808381	5808822	Your mama.
5811164	5811524	What?
5812264	5813365	Your mama.
5815667	5816007	Mama.
5818129	5819530	Nope, I'm just fine.
5820571	5820851	Wait.
5823013	5824234	Sorry, I'm busy.
5824932	5825873	You don't look busy.
5826914	5833019	I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
5834040	5836962	I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
5837743	5839644	Just don't get any ideas about me.
5840565	5841926	Let's just be friends.
5842867	5843528	For now.
5846750	5847651	I'll friend your butt.
5849693	5851094	Are you coming on to me?
5851855	5852075	Yes.
5854471	5854791	Yes!
5858473	5860754	Put this tongue in that mouth.
5861534	5862194	Dream on.
5863695	5864516	No food for you.
5864696	5868677	Now go think about what I've said and we'll talk again later.
5878262	5879562	Rob is red in the face.
5879702	5881103	This is fantastic.
5882950	5884391	We need to get this game immediately.
5884411	5885332	I have it.
5885573	5886113	Do you really?
5886133	5886493	Hold on.
5887654	5892879	Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the games we play for an hour.
5893520	5900086	That was awesome.
5902308	5902989	Well, there you go.
5903069	5903469	That's right.
5903530	5904791	This is a classic.
5911056	5912317	Oh, she just brought out the game.
5912397	5914218	See, man, there it is on the Dreamcast.
5914859	5918141	They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.
5919001	5921162	I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.
5922023	5924905	Big thanks to the YouTube user, Ebola World, for the lols there.
5924945	5929208	That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.
5930288	5931489	Pictures going up on the site.
5935251	5936712	GameGuru in chat says, I agree.
5941158	5943939	I don't know what they're going to call it.
5944600	5949022	Alright, anyhow, clearly we need to take a break here in studio.
5949542	5958706	We'll be right back though with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news stories tonight, including some rapid fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on the N-Gage.
5959266	5962487	Probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.
5963868	5967730	Alright, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5967770	5968290	Stay tuned.
5974548	5978790	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the 1st of 2009.
5978970	5982052	Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.
5982432	5993739	For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
5993779	5994059	I hope...
5994699	5995059	DarkSakura.com
6022609	6026350	So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and safe Halloween.
6027011	6031833	Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from the classic game of the week.
6032513	6037255	We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll get into Twitter topics after that.
6037675	6040556	So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.
6041076	6046578	Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this will be the classic Doom.
6047178	6050520	The original, well, not the original first-person shooter, but...
6068238	6069900	Sort of kind of ties in there.
6069920	6072362	I don't know.
6072722	6075224	Majesco is publishing a new DSi game.
6076185	6077746	I guess it's a DSiWare game.
6078006	6080728	Actually, it's going to be called Ghostwire.
6081209	6083711	And it's what you would call an augmented reality game.
6084472	6092358	You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts.
6092998	6094520	In which case, then you capture them.
6094560	6095440	I guess sort of like...
6097523	6101570	I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort of.
6102071	6103995	You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame.
6104015	6105277	I don't really know if that's capturing.
6106359	6108984	Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.
6109705	6110827	Hopefully it's not too expensive.
6112465	6123753	Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the PlayStation Network.
6124354	6131198	It's a brand new game with the classic Frogger gameplay and rats that are absolutely huge.
6131279	6138003	In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway car, so we should be concerned.
6138263	6138964	Must be in New York.
6142881	6143121	FROGGER
6161779	6165741	The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was 12.
6185070	6189815	It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.
6190176	6192238	It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.
6192278	6194580	And that's just what GameStop's charging for it.
6194980	6198104	Not necessarily what the price will have to be.
6198826	6199787	Thanks for watching!
6222142	6250157	Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out including About a Girl, Blue, and School and a Joan Jett song coming out Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week of course if you're playing on PSP there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged and lastly from me tonight Guitar Hero is also getting some download content they are getting a variety of things throughout November
6251958	6256481	Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.
6256501	6262524	Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so this should be fun to jam to.
6263024	6264885	Those are going to be out on November 12th.
6265206	6271889	November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from Kiss, Modern Day Delilah, Lick It Up, and I Was Made For Loving You.
6272630	6275571	Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.
6275831	6276372	That's free.
6276792	6277132	DarkSakura?
6296579	6325209	for anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content there actually will be some stuff out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live or at least if you're in Europe it'll be 497 pounds on PSN there is a 50 cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga which is pretty funny
6326069	6332615	Um, there will be, um, uh, Gorillas and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool.
6333576	6343885	And then, um, on the 24th, um, we get the, uh, um, David Guetta Mix Pack, which is, um, some, uh,
6345837	6352163	One called When Love Takes Over and Sexy Chick and On the Dance Floor.
6352203	6358009	Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge club song.
6359571	6360712	It's a big, big dance song.
6361072	6364415	Like Energy 92.7, Before They Went Under, that was their number one song on the station.
6364455	6366257	So that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.
6367018	6367238	Okay.
6369635	6377088	and those songs that came out this last week both very good, the Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing
6378243	6379143	I like the other one better.
6380004	6380784	It's good too.
6380804	6386927	That's the Gorillas and Dare.
6387267	6387747	Public Enemy.
6389468	6393470	I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillas in it.
6393970	6397471	There's like four or five Gorillas mashup things in it.
6397571	6397951	Keep in mind...
6399772	6416616	Their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey album, which got him in a lot of trouble.
6418356	6423517	So it seems to me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.
6424104	6424784	Spazinator PSN wants to know...
6447845	6454502	not so much a topic, but a debate the pros and cons of both Sony's and Microsoft's video marketplaces i.e.
6454602	6455765	compare and contrast, etc.
6458395	6460116	Well, I've used both.
6460176	6461717	I've downloaded stuff on both of them.
6462917	6468841	I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.
6469801	6477266	Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture studio, so they get movies there, but I find that...
6478146	6478626	Dark City Dark City
6508129	6511252	I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.
6511573	6513715	I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.
6513835	6522003	So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.
6522704	6531333	Well, now, though, with the new, when they're going to be converting it to the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer it to your Zune HD or something like that.
6531564	6532265	ActDeft sent us a link...
6557537	6558097	10.
6557557	6558097	Jet Set Radio Future 9.
6558137	6558897	Space Giraffe 10.
6559478	6560538	Space Giraffe
6585638	6589643	Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.
6590364	6591305	That's not a WTF game.
6591325	6592887	I don't think that's a WTF game either.
6593068	6596111	I think the writers put that there for shock value.
6596752	6598134	Number 7, Shaq Fu.
6598174	6599496	Now there's a good WTF game.
6599616	6601719	But wasn't that kind of decent?
6602873	6604614	No, Shaq Fu is ridiculous.
6605054	6606695	But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.
6607555	6608796	They had a fan sequel, too.
6608816	6609556	That's even better.
6609637	6610437	Are you feeling okay?
6610657	6611538	Yeah.
6611578	6614399	Number six, Big Rigs, Over the Road Racing.
6616140	6620142	It's just a horribly bad... It's not even really deserving of attention.
6620462	6623484	I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.
6624386	6625226	Actually, it's quite boring.
6625566	6630287	Number five is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which I don't know if it's a tie-in.
6630508	6631848	I don't think that's really strange.
6631948	6634789	That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.
6634969	6642590	I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but... Sega and Sega loves Michael Jackson.
6642691	6644631	And the game actually was pretty awesome.
6644671	6647072	I don't know if I could really consider that a WTF game.
6647252	6651833	It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.
6654590	6656231	Number 4, Monster Party.
6656691	6658172	I don't even remember this game.
6658252	6659233	It was on the NES.
6660594	6661735	I don't even know what the hell that game was.
6662255	6664917	Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.
6666418	6667679	Now that's a WTF game.
6668199	6669980	Number 2, Custer's Revenge.
6670000	6674864	Of course, you can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.
6675244	6679307	This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.
6681249	6686677	Number one, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but again, a lot of effing fun.
6686697	6688499	You know what game is missing from that list?
6689080	6689381	What's that?
6689561	6690662	You know what game is missing?
6690682	6691684	What game is missing from that list?
6691944	6692285	WTF?
6693171	6694832	That's right, there was a game called WTF.
6695412	6703175	Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which is definitely a WTF game.
6703255	6705016	Choaniki is, yeah.
6705256	6706076	And Noby Noby Boy.
6706457	6708597	I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.
6709218	6714180	But thank you anyway to Actdeft for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion on that list.
6714200	6715160	That was a horrible list.
6715400	6716221	Yeah, wasn't that great?
6716561	6720202	No, seriously, I mean, I can think of a couple already.
6720262	6721363	I mean, Oonga Boonga.
6722276	6724497	Unka Bunga is definitely a WTF game.
6724517	6727299	There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.
6727359	6729380	It's another arcade game that's really weird.
6730541	6733163	Xlink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.
6733203	6734463	There was the Spice Girls game.
6734583	6735864	That was kind of strange.
6736004	6736965	It was hilarious though.
6737825	6742188	There was another game where you played a UFO or not a UFO, an alien or something.
6742268	6744109	It was a Sega game where you scared people.
6744129	6745370	I don't remember what that was called.
6745530	6746370	Incredible Crisis.
6747991	6749192	I'm not that that's the game.
6749272	6750793	I mean that that would be a good
6751007	6753269	That is a good WTF game.
6753429	6754349	Irritating Stick.
6755991	6760114	Somebody in chatroom, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible game?
6760614	6764837	I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.
6764897	6768320	Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.
6768700	6771022	Zombies vs... or what was it?
6772503	6773884	Ambulance vs. Zombies.
6774384	6777667	Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.
6778387	6778928	Or they had...
6780674	6782155	I'm trying to think if there are some other weird ones.
6782175	6786039	There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.
6786699	6788721	Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.
6789101	6791023	That was a great entry too.
6791083	6791543	Good job.
6792668	6793388	So there you go.
6795229	6796669	We just already came up with 10 games.
6796709	6798410	I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.
6798470	6799250	Here's another weird one.
6799290	6800051	Goo Goo Soundy.
6801751	6803652	Which I think I have this somewhere.
6803672	6804312	And who could forget?
6804352	6806233	President Cat is a little bit WTF.
6806393	6806793	No, no.
6806893	6811054	Apart from that, also... Seaman?
6811134	6811534	The Ribbon.
6813795	6816196	Seaman's a little bit WTF.
6817363	6817844	Thank you for watching!
6840106	6849372	Actdeft wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since Reno We is kind of like a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet President Cat, nowhere to be seen?
6850793	6852294	I want to be President Kitty.
6852594	6861961	Perhaps they need to give out copies of that game with purchases at, say, PetSmart or something like that.
6862021	6863482	Go the whole Sneak King route.
6864562	6865223	That's a good idea.
6865814	6867634	Alright, let's move on with some more long-form news.
6868235	6870775	Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.
6871135	6871735	Exactly.
6873856	6879757	Well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on.
6879797	6881638	That would be the Nokia N-Gage.
6882178	6886279	Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage.
6887139	6891400	Honestly, to me, this seems like one of those situations where you're...
6892267	6894448	God bless them for trying God bless them for trying
6920131	6920871	They were dedicated.
6920891	6923252	God bless them for not trying that hard, though.
6923312	6930135	That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled the sounds of decaying in her cats.
6931415	6932155	Which is a true story.
6932655	6932735	Ew.
6932755	6933196	Gross.
6933216	6938578	Which goes to show you that cats are popular.
6943670	6947773	Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying, Game Boy is for kids.
6948453	6950074	And that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage.
6950114	6952015	And I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.
6954777	6956738	Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.
6956858	6957839	The N-Gage was kind of ridiculous.
6957879	6963602	They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because the N-Gage didn't work.
6963803	6965644	And this little thing called the iPhone came out.
6965724	6966204	Whoops.
6967405	6968726	Just didn't know how to do it right.
6968746	6970467	You just don't make your system look like a taco.
6971178	6971898	No side tacos.
6971918	6972658	Ooh, I want a taco.
6972678	6973759	You know what sounds good right now?
6974239	6974699	Gym Boys.
6975599	6976159	Mmm, taco.
6976819	6977860	Don't make that face, DarkSakura.
6977880	6980360	No, Gym Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.
6980540	6980820	Really?
6981360	6981581	Yes.
6982021	6983881	That's like me and Chipotle.
6985081	6986802	Does it make you bleed?
6988162	6988962	Don't be disgusting.
6989402	6990963	Alright, moving into...
6993462	6996223	If the show could distance itself from South Park.
6996243	6999203	Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man.
6999763	7002144	Explosion Man, of course, is a game on the Xbox 360.
7002484	7004364	It got an update this week.
7005124	7007345	Now there are some Avatar awards.
7007405	7009685	You can actually get clothes for your Avatar now.
7010185	7012406	And they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game.
7013046	7013726	Which is pretty cool.
7013986	7016807	But also what's very interesting about this is that the...
7018007	7029751	Developers TwistedPixel has teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in it wants mood, hundreds of top quality steak fillets.
7030531	7040854	You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pick and then if you play some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak.
7041960	7043301	for playing Explosion Man.
7066949	7070011	I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.
7070692	7071752	I own a Tropic in chat.
7071972	7072933	I knew somebody was going to say it.
7072953	7074354	It says, I'm a vegetarian.
7075035	7076756	So, yeah, what do vegetarians get?
7076936	7077276	Tofu.
7077316	7078097	Nothing.
7078597	7080518	Can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?
7080538	7080999	They have cake.
7081379	7081959	They sell cake.
7082500	7084001	Oh, the steak people sell cake?
7084281	7084801	Yeah.
7084921	7087383	And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.
7089565	7091326	I guess that might work.
7091346	7093647	If the place is giving you a gift certificate, I guess you could do that.
7093667	7094208	Or baked potatoes.
7094308	7095389	They have baked potatoes or...
7096496	7097797	You know a lot about this company.
7097877	7100159	I had to buy steak from there.
7100499	7101540	What did you buy steak for?
7102120	7104061	I was buttering up some of my publishers.
7104822	7109045	Wait, so you bought the game publishers steak?
7109325	7109845	Yeah, the reps.
7110366	7111787	Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?
7112507	7113748	Maybe that's where they got the idea from.
7114268	7114949	No.
7114969	7116490	They're a developer, not a publisher.
7116530	7117971	Oh yeah, my bad.
7119611	7123513	I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.
7123593	7127816	No, no, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.
7128396	7130778	I remember it was last year or the year before last.
7131926	7132726	Thanks for watching!
7153630	7155091	It's just it's not worth it buying.
7155131	7156332	There's like plenty other places.
7156612	7163998	And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me that's, you know, I'll just go buy from there.
7165421	7174810	Alright, well we're going to get into our mailbag segment and every week you guys send in emails and DarkSakura likes to pick a few of her favorites and read them live on air for all of you to hear.
7175190	7179014	I'm going to ask DarkSakura though, are you okay to do this tonight or do you want me to do it with your voice and everything?
7179074	7179555	I can try.
7179755	7181877	Alright, DarkSakura's going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.
7181937	7185901	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and read some emails for you guys right now.
7186181	7189004	I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had anything.
7189344	7190065	Alright, then let's read them.
7191056	7196558	So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery because I'm an impatient bastard.
7197238	7200000	Anyway, the game is weird but fun kind of.
7200120	7205161	I can't figure out half of the minigames because my Japanese isn't that good and some of the games may just be broken.
7205722	7212724	But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear playing one of the exercise minigames from the game.
7213145	7216226	It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.
7217047	7220379	If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.
7220499	7221563	Cheers, IzzyHP
7224764	7225965	I can open that up right now.
7226025	7227286	I'll go dig it in the mailbag.
7227626	7228587	It's only 40 seconds?
7228747	7229027	Yeah.
7229147	7229968	Oh, that's not that bad.
7230548	7233450	Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.
7233470	7237152	I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.
7237192	7237573	Go for it.
7238053	7239974	Hey guys, happy Halloween's end.
7240455	7248520	I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a Tingle costume handing out candy.
7248980	7249561	Just a thought.
7249621	7250461	And that's from Cheeseburger.
7250642	7252263	Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?
7252783	7253824	Just a Tingle.
7253844	7254124	Shut up.
7255661	7260266	Um, I don't know, it didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.
7260626	7264470	Um, I don't know, have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Launch Radio?
7264590	7265631	This'll be a first.
7265671	7267813	I don't know if we'd do anything on... What's that?
7267833	7269995	I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday, you know.
7270015	7270596	Let me double check.
7270796	7274019	Wouldn't you think that'd be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something like that?
7274139	7274579	I would think.
7274619	7276000	I guess it kind of depends what's going on.
7276020	7276781	It is indeed on a Sunday.
7277081	7277881	I guess it depends.
7277981	7278902	Well, it's a year away.
7279182	7279562	We'll see.
7280263	7282764	Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?
7282924	7283905	Remind us in a year.
7284345	7288648	Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas.
7290208	7292730	Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.
7293641	7294602	or with one of the Seaman.
7295443	7297024	You can just sit here and do the show.
7297124	7297825	I'll be your friend.
7299546	7300587	I'll friend your butt.
7300607	7305872	I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the Seaman.
7306192	7308514	Oh, so one of our serial callers calls in?
7309035	7310096	The people they get on every week?
7311076	7312698	I could wire that up.
7313018	7315220	Have it be a segment, talk to Seaman.
7316141	7318523	I could wire that up.
7318603	7320325	Keep in mind, you have to check them every day.
7322969	7329230	I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the Seaman Fish.
7331551	7333752	But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.
7333772	7335152	That's what we've done.
7336573	7340714	Are you a Libra?
7340734	7343655	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
7344615	7348756	Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary on.
7349637	7350857	Well, that's definitely Spandex.
7354622	7355822	This is the official channel.
7355922	7357483	That's the cat punch exercise.
7358343	7358603	Is it?
7359083	7360663	And his corgi's like, what the fuck?
7360803	7364184	I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever, because they have a bunch of people doing that.
7364524	7364864	It is.
7371906	7373546	He just looks like he's kind of dancing.
7373586	7376026	It looks like he could be holding the Wiimote doing that.
7376167	7378307	His dog seems entirely amused.
7379758	7383821	I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.
7383861	7385222	No, this isn't from the game.
7385242	7387443	This is a contest they have on their website.
7388344	7390305	It's some dance or something that the cat does.
7390925	7391266	Gotcha.
7393066	7393887	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7418157	7419318	Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.
7419998	7425382	But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before.
7425442	7431107	I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil.
7433028	7438312	And I think it translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.
7439185	7447847	Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan, who listens to our show on Monday afternoon, live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise.
7448087	7449968	You know, like company exercise in the morning?
7450008	7450928	That's what dude's doing.
7451208	7458430	It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting the air like little kittens.
7458510	7459670	That's what the cat does.
7459890	7460150	Yeah.
7461650	7462891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7487836	7488436	Have fun.
7488536	7489256	Freedom of speech.
7489357	7490057	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7490477	7495619	You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you heard a comment like that, okay?
7495679	7496059	Just saying.
7496119	7496679	You didn't hear it here.
7496719	7500020	But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.
7500520	7503101	Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?
7503201	7503841	That's all you have to do.
7504241	7504581	All right.
7505542	7506042	Moving on.
7508321	7510321	No one would believe you because no one watches that garbage.
7510381	7512722	Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.
7513642	7513882	Yes.
7514742	7517023	I don't know.
7517043	7519283	I didn't really play too much of the original game.
7519303	7522864	Actually, I think I played some of it during the show one time.
7523384	7524424	Sorry.
7525044	7525364	Got it.
7525464	7526364	I learned it from Oprah.
7526584	7526804	Okay.
7526924	7527304	There you go.
7527844	7528184	Excellent.
7529185	7529665	That wins.
7533025	7535966	I guess the Flash version of Line Rider...
7537998	7539498	has been tweaked a little bit.
7539998	7543479	They've added some new support to the game.
7543639	7549260	Now you can actually play as two different riders or torture two different riders.
7550120	7563402	It's a brand new dual rider mode and they've added a new, you can select the starting point for the second rider as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually decelerate the rider as well.
7564603	7566543	I guess you could use this to say dual
7566983	7570105	Races or some sort of synchronized run or something like that.
7570665	7577289	But the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for I guess the iPhone.
7577329	7579931	They're also going to do like a Line Racer game or something.
7580411	7581012	So that's kind of neat.
7581032	7582572	I don't know.
7583373	7584073	A free update.
7585895	7586455	I like free.
7586835	7592939	And the game is popular and it's pretty they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for it.
7594178	7594819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7618937	7619978	Thanks for watching!
7642248	7647533	And, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?
7647894	7648574	Track editor?
7648594	7659265	A track editor with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in America because that's how lazy the translation was because it was originally a Famicom disc game overseas.
7659585	7660226	Thanks for watching!
7673226	7674567	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7696087	7697608	Wow, have you ever watched that show?
7697889	7704734	Like, I think it must be written for a seven-year-old or something like that because it was really difficult to watch.
7704834	7709198	Like, it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo.
7709238	7714602	And when I say really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.
7715183	7718526	In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.
7718646	7722068	I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excitebike trailer.
7722449	7724891	I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.
7726983	7727543	It's that bad.
7729664	7738586	Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week.
7739106	7742387	But we have a little bit of a story to inspire the FUs of the week.
7744027	7748649	Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.
7749289	7749689	There we go.
7766189	7768390	Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the week tonight.
7769830	7775573	A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.
7777173	7783356	Silent Hill is not often always seen as the thing that the games made me do it.
7783396	7786737	Somehow this game tends to escape that.
7787498	7795481	But apparently there was a 35-year-old man that said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.
7796201	7799463	His name was Jan H, at least that's all they're calling him right now.
7799923	7803585	Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.
7803885	7804545	So what did he do?
7804625	7808127	He broke into Sofia Hospital in the Netherlands in April.
7808367	7809948	I guess maybe now it's just going to trial.
7810248	7813149	He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.
7813209	7814610	People were trapped in elevators.
7815050	7818054	Doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.
7818394	7819716	Thank God nobody died.
7820076	7823460	By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.
7823681	7824001	Why?
7824382	7829728	The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.
7830782	7836505	I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head?
7836745	7837166	I don't know.
7837746	7840687	But that story is just all kinds of strange.
7841028	7842528	So F you to strange things.
7842548	7843189	That's ridiculous.
7843209	7846090	You're always trying to restore power, never shut it off in Silent Hill.
7847211	7849452	DarkSakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?
7850593	7854595	Um, I want my voice back, and I want my foot to stop hurting.
7856136	7856636	That's about it.
7857477	7857797	Loki...
7859764	7864748	F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.
7865308	7867550	Not one handful, one candy.
7868190	7873935	Not that we ran out because there wasn't that many people, but seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this, and you're too greedy.
7875590	7877412	F you to the Bay Bridge.
7877813	7882659	Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you know what?
7883339	7884020	Let me put it this way.
7884461	7893151	I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.
7893491	7895293	So I bought an audio book to keep me company.
7895313	7897435	I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.
7897455	7898076	I highly recommend it.
7898096	7898956	It wasn't funny.
7899397	7900017	It was just good.
7900858	7902260	It's six and a half hours.
7903140	7905843	I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.
7906163	7910327	That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge.
7912129	7912509	Terrible.
7913070	7917294	So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causing the damn thing to break.
7918496	7921158	And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.
7921538	7922818	Oh, it's going to be open Friday.
7923199	7923679	Oh, you know what?
7923719	7924079	Fuck it.
7924099	7925000	It'll be open Monday.
7925060	7926841	And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.
7927101	7934665	And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first time, stop teasing me.
7935125	7943730	And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.
7944110	7944551	I don't know.
7945011	7946472	You don't really pay us enough to do it.
7947950	7949091	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7973952	7976934	3D Dot Game Heroes
7989062	7996227	Which is kind of an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.
7997087	7999029	Very much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.
7999549	8005233	Well, thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.
8006114	8015840	It's not seen who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from software, because how they bring games over here sometimes.
8016460	8017021	But, um...
8018695	8030175	at some point it is going to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter no need to import 3D Dot Game Heroes for PS3 it's definitely coming to NA spread the word, more to come
8031792	8033113	So, awesome.
8033433	8035355	And have you seen the loading screens for this game?
8036396	8038257	I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.
8038698	8042621	I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh, that looks kind of neat, but I just don't really know.
8042641	8045183	I haven't really done my research on that game, I guess.
8045323	8061376	The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games, including Mega Man, Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.
8062835	8064116	But they're just inspired, right?
8064136	8065898	Because you couldn't rip those things off.
8066078	8067579	Well, they look very similar.
8067659	8070521	They're just done in this art style or whatever.
8070581	8072623	So it's similar enough.
8072923	8076145	So you kind of get the homage.
8076225	8077506	But the game looks awesome.
8079301	8089546	Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation or the PS3, I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things up like that.
8089827	8090547	I love it.
8090647	8092488	I wish all the consoles had been region-free.
8093246	8093466	Oh yeah.
8093646	8094987	But whatever.
8095227	8096127	Stupid like laws.
8097328	8100089	Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import.
8100189	8103330	Are Blu-rays region protected?
8104290	8110252	Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays were the same region as Japan.
8110553	8111033	Interesting.
8111393	8113834	Well, maybe Japan might want to import this or...
8114634	8114994	Who knows?
8115074	8117995	But there's a Blu-ray release of District 9 coming out.
8118015	8119915	That was obviously a big movie over here in the U.S.
8120536	8121996	And it's coming out on Blu-ray very soon.
8122316	8123196	Guess what it's coming with?
8123256	8124877	It's coming with a video game demo.
8125257	8127017	That game, God of War 3.
8128158	8130558	Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th.
8130738	8133199	I guess it's going to cash in on the gift cards after the holidays.
8133939	8138761	And that's, by the way, after the God of War collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo.
8139101	8143022	But some folks that already had the first two games may not want to re-buy them.
8143162	8143442	I don't know.
8143922	8144463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8166303	8175149	It's very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.
8175189	8181233	Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of games based on movies.
8181273	8184535	You're going to have to think way back here.
8186156	8193541	There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where you can play as a stealth plane.
8193922	8194242	Oh, wow.
8195273	8197896	I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though.
8220157	8222818	Even though I was never really into the first two games, I think I'm going to pick up that collection.
8223399	8224779	Because everybody tells me, you've got to play God of War.
8224799	8225620	You've got to play God of War.
8226180	8227581	So I'm kind of glad I waited.
8227621	8228561	Now I can play them in high def.
8229862	8230102	Anyhow.
8231042	8237426	One more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.
8237466	8239327	As always, Orange Lounge Radio.
8239367	8240627	But one more story for you guys first.
8241768	8241968	Yes.
8243947	8245127	This is kind of interesting.
8245147	8249929	Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.
8252070	8264135	They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.
8265656	8270478	They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers.
8271365	8272746	Thank you for watching!
8293001	8301866	English Russia reported it was impossible to put an attention of those hopeless men off the game.
8303747	8309070	It was drawing too close and the ladies were sweating as much as they could.
8309590	8312792	But the eyes of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.
8313232	8315153	And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it.
8315394	8316694	And man, they tried everything.
8316714	8319176	Huh.
8320831	8323112	It's just two things that you think would go together naturally.
8323192	8328514	That's just, you know, now we're... Or what I like to call the coolest gaming tournament ever.
8331655	8335356	Maybe they should do a gaming... Do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that here in the US?
8335716	8337637	Oh, it would... Everyone would complain.
8337957	8340118	But it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever!
8340318	8341678	What if a strip club did it?
8341878	8344259	What if a place of sin did it anyway?
8344579	8347200	Like, can you imagine if Centerfolds did... You know what we need to do?
8350640	8351380	I have a great idea!
8353121	8360102	We need to approach Centerfolds about having an Orange Lounge Radio gaming tournament at Centerfolds.
8360562	8361462	Wouldn't that be amazing?
8361882	8364003	That would be expensive.
8364143	8369944	I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I drive by all the time.
8370324	8372905	There's Showgirls and City Limit and a lot of these other clubs too.
8373405	8376226	We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.
8379360	8379940	Wouldn't that be fun?
8380601	8381322	That would be funny.
8381842	8382603	The wife would go?
8383764	8384544	That would be funny.
8386426	8395153	I don't know if that would work or be feasible or even make money, but it's a funny idea.
8396434	8400238	Well, I mean, I think it's funnier, though, because I had no idea it was coming.
8400278	8404021	I mean, if you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.
8406872	8411235	But I'm just saying, you know, like, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before.
8411315	8414758	That, like, you know, just games and strippers, like, together in one room.
8414778	8417200	It would have to be, like, something that... As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.
8417340	8421663	Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.
8421744	8424386	It's like, holy shit, nah.
8425106	8428749	Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.
8430190	8430450	I don't know.
8430470	8433152	That would be tough, you know.
8433272	8433653	I don't know.
8436185	8439268	If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't you give us a call?
8439288	8443931	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8443951	8445772	The Skype line is now open for business.
8446293	8447434	We've already got a call coming in.
8447754	8448675	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8448695	8449015	Who's this?
8449835	8452017	Hello, it's Ray Iannami.
8452317	8453478	Well, hello, Ray Iannami.
8453518	8453938	How are you?
8453978	8454739	What's on your mind tonight?
8455800	8457841	Okay, I just came back from YowieCon.
8458942	8459583	YowieCon!
8459623	8461244	Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?
8461264	8461304	No.
8462998	8464459	Um, San Mateo specifically.
8485342	8489024	I believe this is the third year they're holding it in San Mateo.
8489564	8490744	Apparently I missed the boat.
8491044	8493305	Well, okay, so you went to YaoiCon.
8494306	8495426	That must have been interesting.
8495486	8496006	How was that?
8498908	8499468	It was alright.
8499628	8505090	The other thing is you couldn't tell it was a con specifically for Yaoi.
8505150	8514814	If you were to look inside the hotel lobby, you have to go to the panels or all the interesting activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.
8516317	8523922	Now, I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question, and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?
8525563	8526223	Mostly straight.
8526423	8528745	So, okay, so what were you doing going to YaoiCon?
8528805	8531846	Just, uh... Because that's where all the horny women are?
8531866	8532727	For the hell of it.
8532787	8533387	Oh, okay, for fun.
8534188	8535589	There you go.
8535629	8536469	Also... Yeah.
8536549	8542693	Also, it's like... But I think mostly straight, it's just like... We lost guys, and made me go, meh.
8542853	8545114	It's mostly, like, anime and video game guys that...
8547093	8548173	Make me say I'm only mostly straight.
8548433	8549174	Be who you want to be.
8549194	8550254	Just, you know, don't...
8574521	8583446	I went to a few panels and stuff like the Shonen Auction which where things started to really get interesting like their bids for this thing is high like $500 and guys can have their clothes on
8603700	8606702	Like, the guys on auction doing 1500 quotes left and right, some other things.
8606722	8607303	Can we explain what it is?
8607323	8607783	Okay, go for it.
8607803	8611166	Okay, basically, Yaoi is like male-on-male erotic anime or manga.
8631414	8660699	but it's not but this is important to also state it's not porn like it's just like yeah I have some anyway yeah what I've noticed from what few Yaya have seen is mostly focused on the romance like like if I walk into a random room showing Yali there's a very low chance I'll walk into a sex scene interesting like I'll just walk into them having a conversation
8661516	8663057	A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.
8663077	8665700	A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.
8689537	8692120	They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.
8692420	8698006	Parasite Paradise on PS2 on HGTV, which translates to, yay, lag!
8698247	8702131	And they also had Rockman and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.
8703713	8703893	Mm-hmm.
8704286	8712429	I have to, this is a great description, I'm sorry, this is a great description from SSJ100Matt in chatroom, saying, it's Brokeback Mountain romantic type manga.
8712829	8716571	But even Brokeback, you know, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain had a sex scene.
8716591	8720052	Like, there was a scene where Heath Ledger, like, friended Jake Gyllenhaal's butt.
8720553	8720953	Uh, anyway.
8722793	8725014	Um, what else about the gaming did you want to say?
8727495	8733958	But, yeah, like, I tried playing Paradise on their dev there, and it was on AGTV, and
8734679	8746388	Anyone who's played on Sunnyvale Girlfriend's 3DX machine between 2003 and 2007 knows how bad rhythm games are on HDTV with no upscaling.
8748490	8758798	Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, if your TV lags, then sucks to be you.
8760735	8762257	I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.
8762277	8765522	Do you think you're going to go back next year?
8777544	8795342	hopefully one of these years I'll go I always say I'm going to go to YaliCon but then it's just like it's always just at a bad time for me but one of these years I'll get there hopefully next year I liked it the one time I went I at least want to make a cameo alright well anyway we're going to let you go Ray so we can get some more calls but thank you very much and we'll talk to you again soon okay
8796704	8798546	I'll see you later.
8798566	8802870	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8803511	8806694	While we wait for some calls, although I saw the... Oh, here, it's ringing again.
8807875	8807955	Oh!
8810353	8811834	I hate, can I just say this?
8812394	8814735	I hate the new Skype.
8815035	8816275	I cannot stand it.
8816976	8820517	Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing.
8821057	8824138	If I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.
8824158	8824878	I can't answer it.
8824978	8827799	I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.
8828299	8830160	I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay.
8830180	8830740	We got another one.
8831080	8832400	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8834561	8835341	This is X-Link.
8835481	8836182	Hi, X-Link.
8836202	8836822	How are you, buddy?
8836862	8837362	What's on your mind?
8838778	8840059	Hey, doing good.
8840439	8841759	Just celebrating my birthday yesterday.
8841799	8843000	Had a lot of fun doing that.
8843540	8845160	Well, happy birthday.
8845180	8845861	Wait, you were on Halloween?
8845881	8846321	I was calling in.
8846561	8847461	You were on Halloween, baby?
8847481	8849042	Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.
8849302	8849582	All right.
8849722	8850662	Yes, yes.
8850742	8851763	Unfortunately, I was one of the few.
8852383	8854624	You're probably sick of people commenting on that.
8854664	8855704	I was calling in because...
8860273	8877405	I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having a lot of fun with, was Precious Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon and it was released on Tuesday.
8878185	8879386	I didn't even realize this.
8879446	8880267	What system is this for?
8880327	8880707	The Wii?
8883149	8883949	It was for the Wii.
8884069	8885270	I picked up the PC version.
8885748	8891409	because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.
8891429	8892149	Oh, I loved it.
8892169	8893530	It was exactly like it would play on the game show.
8893550	8896991	The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they will give out a question,
8913117	8924300	You have to buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally you would say on the damn show, they'll give you four choices.
8924920	8926661	It's based on the selection.
8926721	8937784	If you have the answer for the question right, and you're the first one to buzz in, you would get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for having the right answer.
8938844	8940765	They do four questions per round.
8941653	8942334	No whammies, no whammies, stop
8953911	8959673	Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.
8960194	8962615	If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.
8963835	8968957	If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.
8970638	8975380	That's how it's more strategic, if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,
8976020	8979443	Oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player and I have an extra spin.
8980023	8987128	You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money to overpass you in the amount.
8987368	8989109	Does the game have the cool whammy animations?
8989149	8991271	But I love it.
8991291	8992111	Yes, it does.
8992712	9000457	And in fact, the loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.
9001596	9003497	It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.
9003537	9005757	You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck.
9005817	9007398	It sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
9009778	9011399	Yes, definitely.
9011899	9019581	If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii Remote.
9019721	9020981	It's a lot better than it is on the PC.
9022025	9025829	These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of fun.
9026210	9031156	Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games as shovelware.
9032037	9036822	I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those that don't regularly play games.
9036882	9038224	Everybody knows Pressure Lock.
9039986	9044252	Yeah, it's a lot of fun, and for $20, you can't really beat that price for something like this, too.
9044413	9045835	Oh, that's a very cheap price.
9046055	9046916	That's a really good price.
9047357	9048919	Well, thank you very much for the review, X-Link.
9048959	9050261	I might just have to pick that up.
9050662	9053386	Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?
9056281	9059502	I just can't believe that guy didn't get in trouble for the hospital bit.
9059522	9061303	You would think for sure he would get in some kind of trouble.
9061323	9071948	That would be like me going out shooting somebody in cold blood and going, Oh, well, I've seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot somebody for real or GTA.
9071988	9075529	Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.
9075549	9079371	No, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.
9081626	9108815	still though it's a darn good thing no one died darn good thing no one died actually we're going to let you go but have a great week later definitely you too we're going to try to take some more calls here I just want to stress I really hate the new Skype in fact I want to find the old version and download that instead if I can we'll try to do at least one more call here tonight 1-877-GAME-OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9110436	9111817	Hi, this is Spazz here.
9112377	9113477	Hi Spazzinator, what's on your mind?
9114918	9116658	Oh yeah, a couple things.
9118939	9126462	First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I had some news about home.
9127482	9128222	Yeah, what's up?
9128443	9134365	Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought I would...
9135943	9144368	Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex at home?
9144408	9145068	Is that the update?
9145088	9148890	Well, not really.
9149911	9165019	I don't know if you check the mall weekly or not, but if you go to the furniture store on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there.
9166677	9169138	Yeah, quite literally.
9169639	9170919	They've got toilets in there now.
9171479	9173540	Wait, like, you can buy poop?
9175941	9181564	Well, I think you have to supply the poop yourself, but they've got toilets in there now.
9181904	9183725	We're with two of them.
9183845	9187746	In fact, I'm in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them.
9187766	9194049	There's a golden toilet, and they're calling it the Golden Throne.
9194841	9200165	and they're selling it for, oh, damn it, I got the error for price.
9202446	9203927	It's kind of expensive.
9204307	9207329	Last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.
9207489	9211032	So I can pay $3 to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.
9211852	9212493	That's amazing.
9213834	9215655	Yeah, and they got a second one there.
9215795	9222539	It looks like a porcelain toy and they're calling it, you know, take a load off the chair and they're charging $0.99 for it.
9224884	9225905	Maybe I should buy one of those.
9226806	9230389	I need to buy one of those for the Oil Army Clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.
9233452	9240319	Yeah, in fact, that's a perfect transition for the second topic.
9240639	9242181	They mentioned a tweet.
9242699	9243760	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9265120	9265740	Yeah, yeah.
9291588	9307377	The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but to other listeners out there, is that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club.
9307637	9315861	The least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation and use the club that you shell out the money for, you know?
9316917	9323722	It seems like John Doley one day ever shows up in there and every time I show up there, there's no one there.
9326104	9330707	Maybe one of these nights we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something.
9330747	9335270	We'll have like a Sony home night at 7 o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck dance party.
9335310	9337631	Because I don't know what else you do at home but dance.
9337972	9339593	Hopefully somebody will show up in a hamster outfit.
9339933	9342775	We'll do a dance party in Sony home.
9344502	9346543	What's great is that Jamie's... Hold on.
9346723	9348885	Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.
9349065	9350806	Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.
9351306	9353088	I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.
9353108	9353908	It wasn't the hamster thing.
9353968	9354849	It was the whole Sony Home thing.
9355249	9356070	Oh, the whole Sony Home thing.
9356090	9356450	Oh, I'm sorry.
9356470	9357731	All right, sorry I was passing you.
9357771	9359432	Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?
9359452	9370459	Uh, you know, I did have something... Oh, yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to... You know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.
9370659	9370919	Yes.
9371059	9371220	Uh...
9372236	9384921	Yeah, at least in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software,
9386722	9394286	It doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call I have a slight speech impediment.
9408072	9408792	Thanks for watching!
9425250	9427113	I can't promise the semen thing is never going to happen.
9427133	9427713	So just so you know.
9427753	9428114	Alright, later.
9442992	9444673	Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.
9444693	9448236	We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with Skype tonight.
9448296	9449197	And it's not the callers.
9449437	9449978	Not at all.
9450238	9450978	The callers are great.
9451339	9453260	The program itself, I'm a little mad at.
9454081	9455982	I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.
9456062	9456423	I don't know.
9456483	9458484	It's just... I don't know.
9458504	9460846	We do have that extra... Yeah, we got that extra thing.
9460866	9462067	Where's that computer?
9462127	9464709	It's still in my room.
9464909	9468953	Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this beast into that thing.
9468973	9470534	Let's play Jigsaw Puzzle with the new computer.
9470674	9471334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9503087	9505588	I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.
9505868	9507269	I have some final stories.
9507329	9508490	Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
9508550	9510011	I forgot we didn't do those yet.
9510151	9511591	Rob did mine for the FU.
9512012	9512572	I'm sorry.
9512972	9514793	I thought you were going to talk about this movie.
9515894	9520536	Yeah, the Silent Hill movie is going to start filming next year.
9520876	9521737	Well, there you go.
9521857	9522577	I didn't take your story.
9522657	9528180	And a dude was pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
9529081	9529501	What dude?
9530481	9531001	Oh, the writer?
9531582	9532563	Oh yeah, I heard about that one.
9532583	9533023	What a mess.
9533944	9534684	Don't drive drunk.
9536846	9537827	Loki, last minute stories.
9538227	9548095	Yes, Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3G internet with its next-gen DS system might be something that they're working on.
9549296	9559304	Apparently, Iwata is quoted saying that, "...I'm interested because it's a new business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications cost."
9559844	9561225	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
9584422	9588625	That would be pretty awesome if you could get unlimited 3G internet through a DS or something.
9589345	9595348	But the problem is, one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.
9596949	9607715	They haven't embraced online yet, so all the free online thrown into your next-gen console doesn't mean shit to me since...
9609380	9610601	You haven't really braced online.
9610641	9618166	I mean, okay, yeah, WiiWare and DSiWare, but your infrastructure sucks, and your friend's code sucks even more.
9620128	9620308	Yeah.
9620888	9629575	Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment, and I know I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.
9630275	9631996	It's a game called Baby and Me.
9632757	9635899	But I was completely unaware of this brand new...
9638525	9639085	I guess they have.
9639145	9640706	It's a special edition.
9642146	9644846	This is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.
9645126	9649107	Basically, it has a remote holster for a baby doll.
9649507	9649787	But!
9650587	9650847	But!
9651087	9651807	That's not all.
9652168	9657669	Apparently, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition.
9658309	9660069	And what does this special edition include?
9661049	9664730	But a baby doll attachment for your Wii Remote.
9665330	9665570	Yes.
9667120	9670841	Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii Remote into that baby.
9675863	9676223	Wow.
9676903	9677703	That's kind of crazy.
9681485	9688707	And then, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.
9690916	9691777	The Return of Alice.
9693540	9695763	It's going to be the next game that he's doing.
9695803	9698087	He's got a nice little teaser trailer online.
9698888	9700110	And it looks creepy.
9700430	9703976	So I'm sure that's going to come on the PC later on.
9705646	9707927	Return of Alice, American McGee
9723562	9725845	Oh yeah, that's true, and I think that's kind of it.
9726045	9731211	Like, I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the American McGee one, because you'll get your Dark Tim.
9731231	9738059	But American McGee's gonna be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like, you know, bubblegum dark, you know?
9738320	9740202	He's like, he's like Hot Topic dark, okay?
9740622	9744205	I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend for Halloween.
9745266	9747048	They're my friends that I play Warcraft with now.
9747548	9749690	And we watched some movies.
9749850	9750511	This was Halloween.
9750551	9752812	We watched Showgirls because you have to watch something scary.
9753133	9755315	But then we started... Darling.
9755595	9757356	Except I love Showgirls.
9757536	9758077	Don't get me started.
9758097	9759098	That's one of my favorite movies.
9759458	9760799	It's so bad, it's good.
9760839	9761680	We need to watch that again.
9761860	9762481	Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3
9788878	9791323	None of them are good as good as we knew that.
9791944	9795911	We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was similar to the remake.
9796031	9796773	Which, by the way...
9797765	9800587	to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie.
9801647	9806630	Next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.
9806890	9809311	It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.
9809931	9813874	And if you've never seen it, and you don't know anything about it, good.
9814334	9820277	Keep it that way until you watch the movie, because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever.
9821578	9821818	Ever.
9823348	9824950	That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?
9824990	9827173	And it's a very little quotable movie, too.
9827273	9828995	It's so bad, it's funny.
9829776	9830137	So there you go.
9830157	9834743	They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.
9836072	9836532	Ridiculous.
9837173	9839976	Tiger Claw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.
9839996	9842438	And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.
9842478	9845040	Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.
9845541	9845761	What?
9846142	9858533	Yeah, it's supposed to center around Hope, which was – do you remember there was kind of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?
9858834	9860635	Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her.
9861756	9863016	I'll one-up you with this.
9863437	9872560	The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody because this movie was supposed to be huge was supposed to take place in L.A.
9873080	9873740	or Hollywood.
9874020	9879082	That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away – OMG, spoilers – they're going to L.A.
9879162	9882743	because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have been –
9883163	9884164	Why don't they do that?
9884224	9885745	She's not doing anything.
9885765	9887786	She hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?
9887906	9890148	No, she doesn't do anything.
9891308	9894030	She's unemployed right now.
9894050	9895051	I mean, come on.
9895611	9896131	I love it.
9896151	9897532	We've already seen her breasts.
9897572	9899454	It's not even that big a deal anymore.
9899814	9903956	Salacious Pop in chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote there.
9904277	9905337	No one wants to fuck a penny.
9906238	9907679	They want to fuck a heather or a hope.
9909040	9909380	Forget it.
9911243	9915725	And he estimates Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.
9915785	9922829	Just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR live event.
9923249	9927071	Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.
9927151	9929552	Go around and get everybody's... I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?
9929632	9930293	That was it.
9931053	9932974	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9933354	9934115	Loki, I'll start with you.
9934155	9934695	Your final thought.
9934895	9938197	Final thought is I need to find a steering wheel for my main cabinet.
9939304	9943887	My final thought is, I really want a taco from Gym Boys, even if Jamie hates it.
9944528	9945509	Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?
9949472	9950733	Did you watch The Grudge for Halloween?
9951833	9952134	No.
9953855	9961841	I remember when you were really into The Ring and those books and all that, or Ringu and all that, this gal at my work dressed up as Samara, and she did a really good job.
9962161	9963142	It was such a really good costume.
9963649	9964330	That's cool.
9964570	9964750	Yeah.
9964970	9967932	Just made me think of you because I know you used to really be into that whole series.
9967952	9969414	I'm still into it.
9969474	9977920	Actually, I need to find my copy of Loop again so I can read it because that was my favorite of those books.
9978741	9979001	All right.
9979281	9983064	Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next week.
9983364	9984765	Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.
9984785	9985186	Oh, wait, wait.
9985466	9986166	I've been challenged.
9986667	9986987	To what?
9987908	9989729	Ionotropic says extended death rattle.
9991431	9991631	What?
9995089	9995630	No, knock it off.
9996171	9996732	No, stop.
9997093	9997694	I'm going to unplug.
9997714	9998956	Where is she on the mixing board here?
10000198	10000599	Stop it.
10001180	10002182	I need to get my thing.
10002382	10003825	Then you can death rattle us out.
10004646	10005808	Oh my god, that's annoying.
10005888	10006229	Shut up.
10006710	10007010	Alright.
10009144	10011045	Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10011185	10021329	After that, I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game company behind us.
10021389	10024591	We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.
10025091	10025411	Alright.
10026071	10027312	Okay, X-Link said it again.
10027592	10029353	Because the things that come out of that are filthy.
10029673	10032634	So until then, have a great week.
10032774	10034375	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10036769	10039351	Oh my god, her noise made the dolls fall over.
10039632	10040472	Happy Halloween!
