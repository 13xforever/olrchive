Will Amber Alert type messages soon be displayed on your Xbox?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Familiar faces return for Super Street Fighter 4

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Can we talk about the continued growth of LittleBigPlanet a whole year after its release?

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Rob Roberts with you here every week on All Games Radio

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
www.allgames.com where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Rawr

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How are you doing?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Rawr

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see you LJing

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am LJing, I was doing it well before the show

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's so nice to see that people actually still use LJ

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have a permanent account, damn well better use it

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For the uninitiated LJ is short for LiveJournal

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
where we actually have an Orange Lounge community

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but sadly it's been neglected just like LiveJournal has in general

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
thanks to Twitter and Facebook and I guess MySpace in a way

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but do people actually use MySpace anymore?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I actually logged into MySpace the other day

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and this is my exact thing I said aloud

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What a crap!

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because MySpace is really ugly

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't use MySpace anymore

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you're still on there, we have an account on there

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I check maybe once a month and if you want to have this as a friend

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you can join the many record labels and indie bands

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
who think we're like an actual radio station

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
like we want to play their rap music as part of our show

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Maybe we should one night just to see what happens

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't you think so Tech Master Loki?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Also joining us every week here on the program

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, it would not be fun?

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, it would not be fun

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey, also our chat room is always here

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
if you'd like to join it and say hello to us

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and of course we always like to interact with our chat room

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
who right now is razzing me for a technical difficulty

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we had before tonight's show started

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but those of you on the podcast, it'll all be fixed by the time you hear it

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So yeah, if you want to hear all the good technical difficulties

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
not that we usually edit a lot of things

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but most of this is very uncensored radio

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we don't really filter anything out

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but huge technical fuck-ups do get filtered out

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so that's one thing you can look forward to

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and our podcast feed is also available on iTunes

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
just check that out, searching for Orange Launch Radio

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or more information on www.orangeloungeradio.com

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
for those of you that hate all things Apple

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know there are a few of you out there

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you can check us out and several other podcast catchers

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and Loki's raising his hand right there

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I'm sorry, should I call it a blogcast?

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Isn't that what Major Nelson was calling it for the longest time?

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because Microsoft doesn't want to use that word podcast

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
or a Zooncast or whatever

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They tried, but podcast just stuck

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you hate the word podcast, Loki?

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Certainly one thing we don't hate here is video games

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
in fact we play a lot of them

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and every week we like to tell you about what we've been playing

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I've... whoa

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I played World of Warcraft today

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and Sims yesterday

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and I downloaded another game

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
that I'm going to try out

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that I've heard lots of good things about

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and I have to pull it up on

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
actually I have to pull up iTunes so that I can find it

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but it's a little shooting game

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
like a

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
like a Gradius type of shooter

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I just downloaded it

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll find it

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I honestly didn't play a lot

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which is sad

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because we had four days off

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
no, I decided to go ahead

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and I played a little bit

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I brought out the Wii

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
when I went over to my sister's house

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and we played a little bit of Excitebots

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
then also

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
of course more Grand Theft Auto this week

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but mainly I've been busy

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
doing other things

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and that would be for some reason

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and I don't know why

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
during the day

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
on Tuesday this week

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
um

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I just said, hey, you know what

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to turn a PSP into a MAME cabinet

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and so that's

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what I've been doing

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've been taking a PSP

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that I don't use anymore

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You get the most random ass little like inspirations

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
like, my favorite will always be

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
when you walked in here

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
episode 300 last year

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and you walked in here in your Sackboy costume

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
like, hey guys, I made a Sackboy costume

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
like, WHY?

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's funny

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, it's just like

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
um, and it's weird

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because I had specific requirements I wanted to do

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it had to be everything

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that I had in the house already

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
like just random crap

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so it's basically, you know, it's going to be

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
small, like a bar top

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but it'll be out of spare parts

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I had and cardboard boxes

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and that's what I've done

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've started it, I've been soldering

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
all year

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are we actually going to make a cabinet out of cardboard boxes?

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes! I'm serious

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, small

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
like something I've seen on a counter top

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but no, seriously, it's actually really cool

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the problem is though, it's really hard to solder

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to a PSP board

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
because I had to use magnet wire

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
because it's so thin

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I actually burned my finger on the soldering iron

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
which kind of sucks

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
but um, yeah

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I mean, assuming that my soldering

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is an absolute crap, which it is

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but, you know, it looked

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
pretty good

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
then it will actually be done soon

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because I actually finished soldering today

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and um

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what I'm actually going to be running on it

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
is not MAME because they do have

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
MAME for it

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
but the way I soldered

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
everything, I can't really solder

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the directional buttons because

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it's really hard to do that

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
so I instead soldered the

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
analog because it's really easy

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and you can actually use the analog stick

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
in some of the games, so I can't select

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
between which emulator I run

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I just have to have it auto-boot into that emulator

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
so the one I found that runs pretty well

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is actually the CPS2 emulator

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so I can play some Puzzle Fighter on there

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and Street Fighter and stuff like that

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but um, yeah, it's

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
coming along, and um

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
hopefully it'll be done this week

176
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now there's some haters in our chat room

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
at chat.orangelandradiot.com

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
PSP MAME sucks, sorry

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, PSP MAME does kinda suck

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PSP CPS2

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
not that bad, actually, it runs pretty well

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and um

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it's just

184
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you know, this PSP, I haven't used it in like

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
years, okay

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Amae Satsuma in our chat room, chat.orangelandradiot.com

187
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
says, Loki's real name isn't Matt, it's Richard Dean Anderson

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
making a MacGyver reference there

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
which is somewhat true

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and which Act F says, LokiGyver

191
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know if that has the same ring to it

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but Chris Hanogram asks a question though

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
what version of the PSP is it?

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is it a 1000, 2000, 3000?

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's my old 1000 because I bought a 2000

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I thought about breaking the 2000 because

197
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
the emulators run better on there, but

198
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't do that

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know when you talk about like a cute little tabletop

200
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
thing made out of a PSP

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
device, I think back to

202
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and I don't know if you guys remember this growing up

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but they used to have tiny, tiny

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
little tabletop games, and they would be

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
versions of like Ms. Pac-Man

206
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
or Donkey Kong

207
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and these old school 80's games

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
they weren't the actual game

209
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but they were kind of like a step above

210
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Game and Watch, where the lights would actually

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
be in color, but they actually put them in

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a cabinet looking thing, and I think

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
these things were pretty expensive

214
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
they were probably

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
50, 60 dollars, which back in 1980

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
was a lot of money

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, they were like 30 bucks now

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have pictures

219
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, you have pictures

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You should upload some of these to our picture feed

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It doesn't really show much of anything

222
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I mean, right now other than there's a spider of wires

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but here's what I finished before I left

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
real quick, you can see

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know, I know, but you can see where

226
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
it's going to be the actual

227
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
control panel

228
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm looking at a picture of Loki's

229
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
cable modem, of which

230
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
it almost looks like the wired

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
six buttons into the cable modem

232
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The cable modem box

233
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's just the box

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, are you going to paint over the box

235
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, it's going to be a box

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's going to be the most ghetto looking thing in the world

237
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Exactly, that's the point

238
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And you know what?

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You need to send this to our picture blog

240
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And you know what? Because I didn't

241
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I told you, it's everything I had in the house

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't have packaging tape to put this together

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So I'm using duct tape

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's going to be duct tape all over

245
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You need to use chicken wire too

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't have any chicken wire, so it's just

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are making a PSP

248
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
MAME cabinet out of a PSP

249
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Cardboard boxes and duct tape

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And arcade spare parts

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have laying in my house

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wow, amazing

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hitstun's come around a little bit and says

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
this might be cool

255
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
See, now when you finish it

256
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's mini, you're going to have to bring it in here

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh yeah, it's going to have a handle on it

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is assuming

259
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that this all works after it's done

260
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like I said

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't trust my soldering

262
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This saved my life

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know how I managed to solder that mod chip

264
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
into my Wii

265
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That was just some miracle that I worked there

266
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And this is kind of the same type of thing

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Those magnet wires are

268
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
really fragile and they'll break

269
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
out of there pretty quick

270
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So hopefully I didn't cross anything

271
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
or bridge anything

272
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hopefully it works once I power it back up again

273
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But if it does, then it should be good to go

274
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Bochikawa in our chatroom says

275
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey, guess what I got Loki for Christmas?

276
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A box!

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, at least it wasn't your you-know-what-in-a-box

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
like Justin Timberlake

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's see, Pywish, big fan of duct tape

280
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
as a lot of our chatrooms are

281
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
duct tape fixes everything

282
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't wait to see

283
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's like the force

284
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together

285
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This thing is going to be awesomely bad

286
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't wait to see it

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please, please post that picture to our picture blog

288
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For your Twitter at least

289
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you know how to log into the ULR Twitter?

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll give you that info off here

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Because obviously I'm not going to give you the password on here

292
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's...

293
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fire

294
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Alright

295
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
DarkSakura, did you find that Gradius game

296
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
type game you were talking about earlier?

297
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I did, it's called AX Raven Elite

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I'm going to post a link to it in the chatroom

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can go to rocketeergames.com

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and give it a try

301
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's actually made by a local

302
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh wow, very cool

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says

304
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Step one

305
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Put the PSP in a box

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You should

307
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do like a parody video

308
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Building your PSP MAME cabinet

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like called PSP in a box or something

310
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's something here

311
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I originally, like when I originally was going to do

312
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
actually running MAME on there

313
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I actually made a skin for the background

314
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that looked like MAME but built out of cardboard

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So that was kind of funny

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But now this CPS2 emulator

317
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
doesn't really have that

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Nobody else would do a Neo Geo emulator

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Haven't decided yet

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It really depends on which buttons that I've wired

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
work and which don't

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because that's really what it's going to come down to

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because if I'm missing any of the buttons

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that I needed to work, it's just

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
trash

326
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The whole thing is ruined

327
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In which case, I do believe you should just set fire to it

328
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Live on air

329
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Alright, we'll make a little bonfire somewhere

330
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll make it work

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Maybe in DarkSakura's backyard, we'll move all the equipment

332
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and burn the cabinet live on air

333
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Doesn't that sound like fun?

334
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I would rather take a crowbar to it like an office space

335
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
with some loud gangster rap

336
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Maybe if it was a PSP Go inside

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
but PSP 1000 is still kind of valuable

338
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well I guess you bricked it

339
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Not really, no it's not bricked

340
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I mean it's just

341
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well

342
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It could be fixed

343
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I just don't care because I have another

344
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
PSP already and I wasn't using this

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean the battery was dead

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So yes to fire?

347
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not going to burn it

348
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes to crowbar?

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No

350
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It'll work

351
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Moving on so we can get to gaming news before midnight

352
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Moving on to my gaming week

353
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

354
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
but I will say that

355
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've been very enticed by Steam's

356
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
various deals that they've had this week

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You might have seen it, I know Dekeman's been posting them

358
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to our Twitter everyday

359
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The Steam deals, and they're all over the game blogs

360
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There's some really cool deals there on Steam

361
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And one of them that I jumped on was Dragon Age Origins

362
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
was on sale for 25% off

363
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So I think I paid like $37 for it

364
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Considering it's like $59.99

365
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
on $360 or whatever

366
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Getting that price on the PC wasn't that bad

367
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I kind of got into the game

368
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and started playing it

369
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But I couldn't really get

370
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
very far into it before I got highly

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
irritated because

372
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
my video card apparently

373
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
kind of sucks and is behind the time

374
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and cannot run the game very well

375
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
even on it's lowest settings

376
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Things I should have thought about before I plopped the money down for the game

377
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Although maybe it's just a sign I need a new video card

378
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I thought since I just bought my

379
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
computer new last year

380
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that my video card would not suck that bad

381
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but it was one of those, you know

382
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
gateway, everything's there

383
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Gateway, yeah

384
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But I thought when I bought it

385
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
there was something about the video card, it was supposed to be better than normal

386
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
but whatever

387
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So sadly I can't give you a fair review

388
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
of Mage Origins just yet

389
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That wouldn't be a very fair thing of me to review it

390
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I will say this though

391
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was quickly immersed into the game

392
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I did think they did a very good job

393
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Bioware is kind of well known for this

394
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Very good job of story telling

395
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You know, the cut scenes that I did see

396
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and the part of the game that I did play through

397
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
For anybody who's played the game

398
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I rolled a mage

399
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and I played through the first little test

400
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that you have to do with the demon in the very beginning

401
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know, which obviously wasn't very long at all

402
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
which is why I don't want to give you a review

403
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But I did feel very immersed in the game

404
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and I thought the storytelling was done very well

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I did like the fact

406
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you know, just like in Mass Effect

407
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that you can kind of direct the conversations and so forth

408
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Again, something that Bioware has done

409
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
very well for

410
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They do very well

411
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was immersed in it

412
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But I'll give you a longer review after I get a better video card

413
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
which is probably going to happen in the future

414
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And the folks in chat

415
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Tiger Claw say

416
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, we know what to get Skye for Christmas

417
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
A brand new graphics card

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I might just go buy that myself

419
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You know, one thing about

420
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I realize everybody's shopping, shopping, shopping

421
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You gotta get all your shopping done before Christmas

422
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But I noticed that all the sales I have gone

423
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and spent money on have been on me

424
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And it's all been clothes

425
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I went to Macy's yesterday

426
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I bought

427
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
something that was half off

428
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I went to the outlets today and I bought clothes

429
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
because they were all cheap

430
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Go to Old Navy

431
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
for their whole 3 AM rock band thing

432
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did you do any Black Friday at all, Loki?

433
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I went to Radio Shack

434
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's because I couldn't find a screwdriver

435
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So I went and bought another screwdriver

436
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, I wouldn't think Radio Shack

437
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
was doing a huge Black Friday discount

438
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, there was no one in there

439
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I had a feeling

440
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Anyhow, so I went out

441
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and bought a bunch of clothes

442
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I noticed with all these deals

443
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I keep thinking maybe it's just selfish or whatever

444
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But I'm also the type of person

445
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I always do my Christmas shopping like on Christmas Eve

446
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm just a huge procrastinator like that

447
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I never know what to buy, like tons of people

448
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's see

449
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Looking in the chat room

450
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and seeing the comments there

451
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
RickyGoMac says, Get a Mac, Rob!

452
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Gee, wonder why he might be suggesting a Mac

453
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
RickyGoMac

454
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know

455
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I would love to get a Mac, but they're a little pricey

456
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They're kind of the Mercedes Benz

457
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
of computers, you know what I mean?

458
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't hate on Macs

459
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I have an iPhone, that's great for Apple

460
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But my one Mac laptop I did have

461
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Unfortunately, it didn't last

462
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And I was a little bit disappointed in that

463
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So I don't know how I feel about the desktop

464
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Tigerclaw says, Also, be sure your graphics card is an NVIDIA card

465
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oops

466
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My one I have right now is an ATI Radeon

467
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It doesn't matter

468
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It doesn't matter at all

469
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this incorrectly

470
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Vanislucks in chat says,

471
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Screw Macy's, they made my children cry

472
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
See, now I kind of want to know that story

473
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I know that might be traumatic, but I kind of want to know

474
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Was it Santa Claus that made your children cry?

475
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Or did they not want to take something back?

476
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I gotta

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
say my curiosity is piqued by that statement there

478
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Alright, anyhow

479
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We are going to move on and get into the show tonight

480
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Joining us tonight in about

481
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
20 minutes or so

482
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We're going to be speaking to an individual whose name is Brian Moreno

483
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And you might not know him by name, but you might know

484
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
a video that he did that's on YouTube

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
this week

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
A LittleBigPlanet version

487
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance

488
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
video, which you know, Lady Gaga

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
she's kind of started

490
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
a lot of controversy with some of her videos

491
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and so forth, but obviously

492
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
that's what artists do, they make controversy

493
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But we don't want to talk to him

494
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
so much about that end of it, but just

495
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
the fact that he put all this time

496
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
in LittleBigPlanet into this creation

497
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and with LittleBigPlanet

498
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and the community still being really huge

499
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
a year after the game was released

500
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
we thought tonight would be a good time to talk about that

501
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So he'll be joining us a little later on

502
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For now though, we're going to get into some gaming news

503
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I did want to just give a quick plug

504
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to our brand new Facebook, we just launched it

505
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
like a week and a half ago

506
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
www.facebook.com

507
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
slash orange lounge radio, all one word

508
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you guys so much for helping us get the 100 fans

509
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
we needed to get the short URL within a week

510
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's only been a week and we have like 160 fans

511
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So thank you guys very much

512
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's very humbling and very cool

513
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't know if there's really anything after 100

514
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I think maybe if you get to a thousand

515
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
you get more statistics stuff

516
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't get to evolve anymore?

517
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know, I don't know if there's any more evolving

518
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I haven't really looked into it

519
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll have to ask Seg, my buddy Seg that was on the show a couple weeks ago

520
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
promoting UmLoud, which is coming up by the way

521
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He knows more about that stuff than I do

522
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I wouldn't have even known about the short URL

523
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
if I didn't see him talk about it earlier

524
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight

525
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Loki, why don't you start us off

526
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, Datel is kind of pissed

527
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because you may remember

528
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Microsoft blocked their

529
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
memory cards, their max memory

530
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
from working

531
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
with the last dashboard update

532
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and of course

533
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
dashboard update came

534
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and the max memory cards went

535
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and unfortunately

536
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
they had a workaround

537
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
they said at one time, but

538
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't think that

539
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ended up working

540
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Microsoft has taken steps to render

541
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
inoperable the

542
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
competing Datel memory card

543
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
for no visible purpose

544
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
other than to have the market

545
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
entirely to themselves

546
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and this is the Datel

547
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
attorney Marty Glick

548
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
no relation to

549
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the other Glick

550
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
lol

551
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They've accomplished

552
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
their recent update by making

553
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
a system change that will not recognize

554
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
or allow the operation of a memory card

555
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
with greater capacity than their own

556
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
we believe that with the power

557
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Microsoft enjoys in the market

558
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
for Xbox accessories

559
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
this conduct is unlawful

560
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
so they're kind of going with the whole monopoly thing

561
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't really know

562
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
if they have grounds to stand there

563
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
since it is Microsoft's

564
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
hardware and I think that they

565
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
pretty much can say

566
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
who can make what for it

567
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
although I do agree I wish they did

568
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
have some other memory card options

569
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
because the Microsoft memory cards

570
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and Microsoft hard drives

571
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
are way too fucking overpriced

572
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
we're talking like 120 gigabyte

573
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
hard drive for

574
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
$200 or $150

575
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I mean shit you can get way bigger

576
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
drives for a lot cheaper

577
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I got to admit this is tricky for me

578
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and chat I'm really curious what you guys think about

579
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
this one because I'm really on the fence with this

580
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
because I understand

581
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
the whole Microsoft is

582
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
evil and they always have monopolies on

583
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
everything and they violated antitrust

584
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
before and all of this

585
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I totally understand that side of the argument

586
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and yeah they do charge way too much

587
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
considering that 120 gig hard drive

588
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
is dirt cheap

589
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
or even like a 512 megabyte

590
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
memory unit

591
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
for 50 bucks I mean when you can buy

592
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
4 gig thumb drives

593
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
for like $10

594
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
here's the part of it though

595
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
where I'm kind of with Microsoft

596
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and that is that these

597
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
companies take huge losses

598
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
when they put out these consoles

599
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
when you buy a console from

600
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Microsoft Sony

601
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
not Nintendo this time because

602
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
we know the Wii was not quite

603
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the same technological level but in the past

604
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
they've taken a loss on their systems too

605
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
maybe it was a small loss this time I don't have the data

606
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
on that I don't think it was though

607
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but you know Microsoft and Sony take a loss

608
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
on every console that they sell to you

609
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
they've got to make that money back other places

610
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and that is usually through software

611
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
through licensed

612
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
products through the licenses and so forth

613
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that's how they make their money back

614
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so I can

615
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
sort of see where they have the right

616
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to lock out the unauthorized products because

617
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
my fear is

618
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
let's say Datel wins this suit

619
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and it

620
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
just opens the floodgates to all these unauthorized

621
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
devices that are going to be out there

622
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
the next round of consoles are going to cost through the roof

623
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
because companies are not going to want to take a loss on it

624
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No I don't think that's going to happen

625
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I mean they had a ton of unlicensed

626
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
products for the Playstation 2 and the Playstation 1

627
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and you know how older

628
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
consoles and stuff

629
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
never really affected their system

630
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and Sony also tried to charge out the ass for the PS3 when it first came out

631
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and they were still claiming a loss

632
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but we all lapped them off because we said

633
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
too damn much money yeah right

634
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
yeah but that's for other reasons entirely

635
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
except the hardcore fans of course

636
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that's because hey let's throw in this really awesome

637
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
cutting edge cell processor hey let's throw in some blu-ray

638
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
technology hey let's throw in some other

639
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
crap that's why it's so expensive

640
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and you know to their benefit

641
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
they also have allowed you know

642
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
their end user to upgrade the hard drive

643
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
because it's just a

644
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
normal hard drive but Microsoft

645
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
says fuck you guys we're just going to

646
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
put that normal hard drive inside of a case and then

647
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
charge you twice as much for it

648
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
that's all it really is it's just a fancy

649
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
little case storing a normal hard drive

650
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
so it's not like

651
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it's a special technology

652
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
although it is encoded slightly different but

653
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you know hell you can make your own hard drives

654
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
for the Xbox 360 I mean

655
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
there are programs out there to do that

656
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
if you really wanted to make your own

657
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
250 gigabyte hard drive you can do

658
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
that what about the fact though that a lot

659
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
of people well I shouldn't say a lot but there was

660
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
certainly a significant amount of people that were using these devices

661
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
for the cheat functionalities that you know

662
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
the SD cards importing the saves

663
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
inflating gamer scores cheating

664
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and you know Microsoft is trying to protect

665
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Xbox Live because you know they market it

666
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
as hey you're paying $50 a year

667
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because we lock out this kind of

668
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
shit well you

669
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
can't really lock it out

670
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
permanently I mean they have all

671
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
those game saves and everything are now

672
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I mean because originally they weren't

673
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
all signed to the profile so

674
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
yeah you could download game saves and

675
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you know throw them onto your console and kind of

676
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
you know save it at a point right before an

677
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
achievement or something like that and boost your

678
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
achievement scores but now everything's signed

679
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to your user

680
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
ID so unless you're

681
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the actual user that made that save

682
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
you can't really use that save unless

683
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you re-sign it on your computer

684
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
which you can do that and you don't really

685
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
need this memory card to do that so

686
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
it's really not an excuse it's just them

687
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
being dicks let me ask this follow up

688
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
question very plainly because Salacious Pop

689
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
asks this in chat and I kind of

690
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
want to know this too because

691
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I kind of agree with his thought here he says

692
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
can't you put save games on like a thumb drive

693
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it reads USB fine I

694
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
think I'm missing something no you can't

695
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
oh really I always assumed

696
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
you could because you can do like mp3s and

697
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
videos and all that if you can put it on a thumb drive

698
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
then it wouldn't fucking matter that they have their stupid little

699
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
memory cards but you can't because

700
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
you know obviously that'd be the easiest

701
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
route you wouldn't even buy this yeah yeah I guess

702
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
so I mean it makes sense now that you're saying it but

703
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I just kind of always thought but then again

704
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I've never tried to use it you know I'm not the type that

705
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
wants to cheat in games and all this and

706
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and so forth you know

707
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I never really thought to use this

708
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
yeah I never even owned a game genie

709
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
back in the day although I thought they were interesting

710
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
they were awesome yeah it's too bad we don't have

711
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
anything like that anymore you know what I mean everything got

712
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
too not anymore I mean it's all game

713
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
saves now remember

714
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I always wondered how they found those

715
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
codes for game genie like did somebody

716
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
have to sit there and actually go

717
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
0 0 0 0 1 or

718
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
was it because of the fact it was hex decimal base

719
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
they could go into the programming and figure

720
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
it out did you ever like use they had cheat

721
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
programs similar to that on the PC

722
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
for cheating and stuff and basically it's

723
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
memory searches you okay

724
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I have five

725
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
lives right now do a memory search for five

726
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
okay I die once do a memory search for

727
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
four I die again do a memory

728
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
search for three and what it does is it narrows

729
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
down those memory addresses until you get

730
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the one that actually controls

731
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you know the extra lives and boom there you go

732
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and now you can change that value you freeze

733
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the memory to 99 you have

734
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
infinite lives now and it's basically

735
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that interesting okay that

736
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
makes sense uh salaciouspop follows up with

737
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
in chat okay I've run avi's off of thunder

738
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
drive before but never bothered with saves

739
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I figured it was universal yeah I mean I

740
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
thought the same thing honestly I've just never thought

741
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to try I just always assumed it would work yep

742
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
curiosity I don't even know if you know this

743
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
would a ps3 let you do it ps3

744
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
yes will let you put game saves on

745
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
a thumb drive interesting because they don't

746
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
sell memory cards it's it's all

747
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
open oh that's right it's all

748
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
you know thumb drives you know you can use whatever

749
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
you want but Sony fanboys if you haven't

750
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
thought to add that to your arsenal of

751
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
web forum

752
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
harassing there's something for you

753
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
their memory cards are just USB

754
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
drives basically I mean it's

755
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
just sign different and

756
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
they're shaped different they've got you know

757
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but it's basically a UMD drive

758
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
or not UMD uh USB drive

759
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
uh sj100 matt in chat

760
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
asks uh or says basically I was really

761
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
hoping they were gonna drop the price of the HD's

762
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
this holiday season yeah kind of surprising they

763
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
didn't they're doing weird stuff

764
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't know because they're now

765
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
trying to clear out those 20 gig hard drives that

766
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
they have a backlog of too so you're gonna see

767
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
remember how they have like the 60

768
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
gigabyte starter pack where it's like a three month

769
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
card and

770
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you know some miscellaneous crap in there and then

771
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the hard drive they're gonna be doing

772
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the same thing with the 20 gig hard drive now too

773
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
so uh tiger klon chat

774
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
says uh do you mean a trainer

775
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
when you were talking about that memory scan

776
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
software for pc games you used a program

777
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
called a trainer you load the pc game first

778
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
then load the trainer program and it will

779
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
modify what's in the memory so you can run some cheats

780
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
from tiger klon uh no not trainer

781
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
but this is like predating all the trainers

782
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and stuff this is you know because the trainer

783
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
usually is all it's all the hard works

784
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
done for you it's basically okay

785
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
hit button one to have

786
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
infinite ammo or something like that and those are nice

787
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
but I'm talking about something it was

788
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
actually just a program I mean this is back

789
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
you know floppies and shareware

790
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
days you know um

791
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
it was just a program that you'd run that basically

792
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
would work with any um

793
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
pc titles because it's just a memory search

794
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
function and uh

795
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
you can you know

796
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
do searches and stuff

797
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
on different values and I think like

798
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the registered version of it or whatever had

799
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ability to figure something

800
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
out with like life bars because life bars

801
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
are hard to determine since you don't know what

802
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the actual number is it's just like kind of a percentage

803
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
so um

804
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know I mean this was like years ago

805
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but yeah obviously now they have

806
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
trainers for everything

807
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
that come out so very interesting

808
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
quickly to kind of wrap this up and move on with

809
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the show and Jaime, I don't know if you have a thought on

810
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
this either

811
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
how do you think this lawsuit is going to go?

812
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
do you think Deigon frame of view is going to be shit of luck

813
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
or do you think maybe they have something

814
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
with this whole monopoly

815
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
thing... No they are going to be shit of luck

816
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
they're going to be like

817
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it's going to be well

818
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you can make you know peripherals for us

819
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but you just have to pay a licensing fee and we have to

820
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
approve it I don't know I don't think they're

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
going to win. Jaime agree

822
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,120
agree? I think it could go either way. To be honest, it's not like we haven't had other

823
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,720
peripherals be locked out before on certain systems. Like for example, I know that I couldn't

824
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,520
use certain third party controllers for certain games back in the day. I kind of look at it

825
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:29,360
as being along the same lines. However, it would really have to be a situation of, I

826
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,720
think it would have to be a situation of Microsoft it being on them to have some sort of check

827
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,960
in line for cheats instead of just locking out the storage device altogether. So really,

828
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,160
I could see a few things in Datel's direction. I've got to say, for me, either way, this

829
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,920
story sucks. Because if Datel wins, then I truly believe that's going to drive the price

830
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,660
of the consoles up and they're going to use that as justification. And if they lose, then

831
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,080
all those people who spent money on that device lose. Ultimately, the consumer loses. Let

832
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,660
the buyer beware. Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news here. I want to talk

833
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,640
about some news out of Capcom's camp. Two very different stories that have one thing

834
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,160
in common. Apparently, Capcom is working on ports of Final Fight and Magic Sword for Xbox

835
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,440
Live Arcade and PSN. Now, you might remember Final Fight. That was kind of like the side

836
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,320
scroller beat them up, double dragon-esque type of game. Very famous because when it

837
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,800
came out on Super Nintendo, it didn't have Guy. And a lot of people freaked out and that

838
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,040
caused them years later to release Final Fight Guy. Which I have. Oh, do you really? Final

839
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,860
Fight Guy was a Blockbuster exclusive. Oh, that's right. You could only get it by renting

840
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,280
it at Blockbuster. That's right, I remember that. And it came out, I think, a couple years

841
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,240
later. Or no, maybe actually a year later. But when it came out in Japanese packaging

842
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,380
too. Remember. I have it box book everything. Now what's weird about this is that actually

843
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,440
these two games apparently are going to come out together. Final Fight Double Impact is

844
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,480
what it's called because it's not just Final Fight, but Magic Sword comes with it as well.

845
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,980
I'm imagining the games must have run on the same arcade hardware, but I can't think of

846
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,000
like more different types of games. But I got to say, I know a lot of you may not have

847
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,540
heard of Magic Sword. This is one of my all-time favorite arcade games. We actually have this

848
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,360
at the Pizzeria near us. I loved Magic Sword. And they actually had a version of it on Super

849
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,720
Nintendo that was pretty badass. And it's one of the games that's going to be featured

850
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,720
on my box cabinet. Because it's a Capcom system, of course. And it's a PS2, yeah. Of course.

851
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,360
But for those of you that don't have the skill to build a cabinet out of boxes and duct tape.

852
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,960
You can also put it on any homebrew enabled PSP too, so they work pretty well. I read

853
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,480
you some more comments from chat. Apparently a lot of love for Magic Sword in the chat.

854
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,760
Rama's like, Magic Sword. VanisLux, I love Magic Sword. But weird pairing. And let's

855
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,840
see, SalaciousPop, my BFF and I spent like $25 on Magic Sword when we were 14. And after

856
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,960
the final boss, he accepted the orb instead of destroying it and became the new Dark Lord.

857
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,760
That's right. It was also one of those games that had like multiple endings. OMG spoilers.

858
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm more excited about Magic Sword than I am Final Fight. Although I did love that game

859
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,840
too, I gotta say. But I will say this about Final Fight, is that apparently some of the

860
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,840
fighters in very familiar faces are making their way into Super Street Fighter 4. And

861
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,640
I have to admit, from what I do remember and love about Final Fight, I think this is awesome.

862
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,400
Cody and Guy are making their way to Super Street Fighter 4, according to the latest

863
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,800
issue of Famitsu Magazine. Also making an appearance, Dawn from Street Fighter Alpha.

864
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,480
So those were three new characters that were announced this week. I believe Cody's been

865
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,760
in a game before, because he was in Alpha 3. Yeah, Alpha 3. Also, he's going to be one

866
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:49,400
of the characters coming up in Street Fighter 4. Right, right. That's very cool, I think.

867
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, I thought you were just talking about Final Fight. No, no. And this whole new crossover

868
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,760
is kind of interesting. I kind of miss the whole Alpha series of Street Fighter. That

869
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,080
all happened during that period of my life where I wasn't as into video games. So I never

870
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,400
really played those games. I never realized that they had the crossover. Although I do

871
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,880
remember Hagar, the mayor, in Saturday Night Slam Masters, which was also a completely

872
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,320
underrated Capcom classic. We had that at my arcade that I worked at. That was the ultimate

873
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:27,560
pizzeria arcade game. I loved that game. Also on there. Shut up. Let's see, Rama asked in

874
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,280
chat real quick, before we get to another story here, anyone remember Mighty Final Fight?

875
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,200
I do. Wasn't that the version that was on the NES as opposed to the Super Nintendo?

876
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,800
Yeah, it wasn't like all kind of super deformed. It was all the chibi characters. What was

877
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,400
an 8-bit port, you know? Yeah, I remember that game. Obviously it wasn't as great because

878
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,280
it was an 8-bit port. But Dark Sakura, why don't you do one more story for us, then we're

879
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,880
going to get to our interview tonight. That's right, we do have it coming up. But how about

880
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:02,840
some PC news? Please. Okay. Well, Valve is basically sticking their tongue out and waggling

881
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:09,480
it at all the people that are boycotting Steamworks. Which I'm actually laughing. They're saying

882
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,800
basically that any digital distributors who are boycotting PC games because they come

883
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:29,120
with Steamworks services are missing out on an opportunity. They're actually saying that...

884
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,160
Let's see, different companies like Direct to Drive, Impulse and Gamersgate that didn't

885
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,800
want to sell Modern Warfare 2 because it had the Steamworks tools acting as a storefront

886
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,040
for Steam. But they're saying that if you make a good game it should be out through

887
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,360
as many channels as possible. It is kind of interesting though that so many people are

888
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,280
up in arms about it, but I also kind of get it. When you get all this included software

889
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,760
you don't ask for, that can get really annoying. For instance, when I download programs off

890
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,960
the internet like Google Earth, maybe I'll download Google Earth, they try to install

891
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,060
that Google toolbar on my system. That's not what I ask for. Whenever you download iTunes,

892
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,200
it tries to install Safari on your system. I didn't ask for fucking Safari, I wanted

893
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,440
iTunes. I do find that kind of shit annoying. I realize maybe it's a little different because

894
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Steamworks directly does relate to the games, but I can kind of see their point. When you

895
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:40,640
get these things you didn't ask for that even eat up 1K of memory, it's a bit of an annoyance.

896
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:47,480
What the word is, is that they've actually based the inclusion of it on what customers

897
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,160
have asked for, and that they've actually sold the games as well through Steam as they

898
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,480
have in the stores, especially Modern Warfare 2.

899
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,760
Reddertainment in our chatroom at chat.orangeleiser.com says, I call for a boycott of the boycott.

900
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,300
Perhaps that's something that needs to start, I don't know.

901
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,920
You know what, I say if people don't want it, don't get it. If people want it, get it.

902
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,940
Who cares, you can uninstall the shit.

903
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,520
VaniceLux in our chat says, those distributors that didn't carry Modern Warfare 2 cut themselves

904
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,480
out of a crap load of money, and that's about all the effect it had.

905
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Pretty much.

906
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,240
Goldanthro wants to point out not only Safari, but also QuickTime. I give him a buy on that

907
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,160
because the movies that play in iTunes when you download movies and TV shows, which is

908
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,360
an integral part of the system, are in a QuickTime proprietary format.

909
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,080
I, however, refuse to install Safari. Safari is ass on a PC.

910
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Yeah, it's just not as good on a PC as it is on a Mac. Great on a Mac, not on a PC.

911
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,920
Well, you know what part of the problem is, is that it actually tries to, instead of actually

912
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,400
installing a font and having it default to that, you know, like Firefox does all that,

913
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,160
it actually tries to emulate so that you're, it does a weird thing, but it eats a lot of

914
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,600
memory and it's really hard to use.

915
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,760
It's very interesting, though, that these, it's always these browsers, these browsers

916
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,240
now that try to install, because it's that and Google Chrome, too, keeps trying to install

917
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
it.

918
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I hate Chrome.

919
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I'm not a fan of it either.

920
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I hate Chrome.

921
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm all about Firefox. People, I'm glad there's choices now, you know, whereas it's not Internet

922
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,160
Explorer seeing me to dominate as much as they used to. I mean, I know they still are

923
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,840
the number one, but not nearly the hold they used to have.

924
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:31,600
Firefox is, it actually is a lot more secure now in general than Internet Explorer is and

925
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
has a lot more functionality.

926
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,720
A lot of places are really starting to embrace it over, you know, Internet Explorer.

927
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,760
I mean, you saw what happened to Netscape.

928
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Netscape's gone.

929
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Yeah, it's true.

930
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,680
But that kind of turned into Firefox, didn't it?

931
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,040
I think the Mozilla thing kind of, you know, kind of like a copy of a copy of a copy type

932
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
of thing, you know?

933
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,600
Well, and, you know, and keep in mind, too, we know how they tried to do Betamax, Betamax

934
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
didn't catch on.

935
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,780
Some of these didn't catch on.

936
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,960
But now our preferred format is Blu-ray.

937
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,360
So I could see that.

938
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,200
Anyhow, we got to move on because we actually have a rare live interview tonight.

939
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,920
A lot of times our interviews are pre-taped, but we actually have a live interview tonight.

940
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,520
But I have to ask you guys, especially here in studio, how many of you guys have seen

941
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,120
this video that's floating around YouTube right now?

942
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:27,520
It's this little version of Bad Romance, but it actually has the chibi little Sackboy characters.

943
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,560
And I don't know how many of you have seen the actual Lady Gaga video, but this actually

944
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,160
parodies the video.

945
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Isn't this cool?

946
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,960
Thanks to you and Megzi, I've seen both.

947
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,160
So in the end, obviously, it's this little video that kind of parries using these Sackboy

948
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
characters.

949
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,480
And it's kind of gone viral this week.

950
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,880
Very interesting.

951
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,840
The whole thing was created by this gentleman, Brian Moreno.

952
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,760
And you know, his little big plan has been continuing to grow via the online co-op mode

953
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,000
that you've heard about this week.

954
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,440
And after one year of release, the online community is still going.

955
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,880
And I think a lot of us kind of poo-pooed at Media Molecule when they said last year

956
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,040
when this game came out, oh, we're not going to be thinking about a sequel right away.

957
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,820
What we want to do right now is we're going to focus a lot on making LittleBigPlanet bigger.

958
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,560
But they actually delivered on that.

959
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,760
We kind of rolled our eyes and thought, yeah, right.

960
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Next year, they're going to announce LittleBigPlanet 2.

961
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,640
But they've actually continued to make good on that.

962
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,180
And I think this video going viral is just kind of an example of that.

963
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:33,000
So this video, which you can find, LittleBadRomance, YouTube user BrianRDM, it was on YouTube.

964
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Then it got posted to NeoGAF, which is this huge, huge gaming forum.

965
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm sure you've heard of it.

966
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,600
Then it spread through Twitter, through Facebook.

967
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
That's where I found it.

968
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,560
An OLR member posted it on their Twitter.

969
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
That's where I found it.

970
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,060
And then it got coverage on Kotaku, other blogs, so forth.

971
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,840
And ironically, Lady Gaga, she's also big right now.

972
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,840
She just started a big tour of hers last week.

973
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,240
50,000 views on YouTube tonight, just about 50,000, just shy of it.

974
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,680
So we want to get Brian Moreno here on the show to talk a little bit about this and about

975
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,240
the LittleBigPlanet community.

976
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,480
So we're actually going to give him a call right now.

977
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,120
Hopefully he is standing by.

978
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,520
So we're firing up the telephone.

979
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,940
And again, this is a rare live interview.

980
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,960
So please bear with us as we have Brian on the line.

981
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Hello?

982
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:27,160
Hi, is this Brian?

983
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
This is Brian.

984
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Hey, Brian.

985
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
How you doing?

986
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

987
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,620
How are you guys?

988
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,760
We are doing great.

989
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,560
We were just kind of checking out your video here in studio, looking at it, the little

990
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,000
bad romance.

991
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,840
Congratulations on the success.

992
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,240
About 50,000 views now, huh?

993
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I know.

994
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
It's pretty mind-blowing.

995
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Did you ever think that this was going to catch on as big as it did?

996
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,640
Me and my friend were actually talking about this yesterday.

997
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,400
We thought maybe 1,000, 2,000 modest views, a laugh between ourselves.

998
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,760
And then all of a sudden, the second day it was posted, it was number three most viewed

999
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,760
in its category in Russia and 95th most viewed on YouTube that day.

1000
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,520
It was pretty amazing.

1001
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,960
I had no idea it was going to go that far.

1002
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,760
You know, it's very interesting because we've been the subject of some of that viral stuff

1003
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,840
before too, especially the whole president cat ordeal a couple of months ago.

1004
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,600
It's always interesting to see what kind of stuff the internet spreads like wildfire and

1005
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
what doesn't.

1006
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,200
It's fascinating, I got to say.

1007
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,680
And if you guys have questions for Brian in our chat room, head on over to chat.orangelodgeradio.com

1008
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,280
so you can be in the chat room and we'll ask a couple of questions from you guys to Brian.

1009
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,920
But I got some questions for you.

1010
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,240
First off, I got to know Brian.

1011
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,320
Obviously Lady Gaga is huge, people love this new album, she has these super fans.

1012
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,480
People get on YouTube and they do karaokes, they dance, do whatever interpretive thing

1013
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,000
to Bad Romance.

1014
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,200
What made you decide, I'm going to do a tribute, but I'm going to do it in Little Big Planet?

1015
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,740
It was actually like a mixture of many things.

1016
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,740
I work one of my city gigs as a club photographer here in Orange County.

1017
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:11,240
And October last year, I actually had an opportunity to photograph and meet Lady Gaga.

1018
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:17,640
It was right before her career exploded and she was the nicest person I've ever met.

1019
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,720
It was 2 a.m., the show was over, fans were outside of her trailer and security was leaving.

1020
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,480
And she said it herself, she's like, I'm going to be here until I take a picture and take

1021
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,240
an autograph for everyone, everyone.

1022
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,840
You know, she does something like that recently too.

1023
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,560
I heard it like a Best Buy in LA that all these people came out and she said, I'm not

1024
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,680
leaving until I sign all your stuff.

1025
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:48,000
She's great about her and her fans and I thought she was the greatest person since I met her.

1026
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,920
And then with the release of The Fame Monster, I mean, I've been hooked on that album.

1027
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,960
I think it's so much better than her original release.

1028
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,920
And then when it came to Little Big Planet, I had been a fan of it since it had been announced

1029
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:08,680
D3, how many years ago, and just the ability to be able to create whatever you want and

1030
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,400
how accessible it was to everyone.

1031
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,440
Me being a fan of those two, it just seems like the perfect recipe for something that

1032
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,960
would go far, that would have long legs.

1033
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,280
So it just kind of worked out in your mind, I like this, I like this.

1034
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,040
What happens when we throw them together?

1035
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,940
Some could say that's the same way the show started.

1036
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,600
I know Jamie, remember it was about, hey, I like video games and we do amateur radio,

1037
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,000
let's do a radio show about video games.

1038
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,040
Well, to paraphrase the quote is two great tastes that go great together.

1039
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
Exactly.

1040
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,920
I got a question for you, Brian, how long did this whole thing take?

1041
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,000
Because I got to say, one thing that impressed me when I saw this video is I was thinking,

1042
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,360
wait a minute, that because I'll admit anyone that's been listening to the show a long time,

1043
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,960
I'm a big old fan of Lady Gaga, I think she's great.

1044
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,880
And in fact, I'm not going to be here at the show on December 13th, because I'm going to

1045
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Monster Ball.

1046
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm going to be more excited.

1047
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:06,320
But I was going to say, that video came out like Tuesday, and this video seemed like it

1048
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,860
was on the internet, like not even 10 days later.

1049
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,520
How long did this whole thing take you to put together?

1050
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,320
Hours and hours and hours and hours.

1051
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,960
I was in fear of my 60 gigabyte PlayStation hitting the dirt, I was afraid of it dying

1052
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,600
how much I was on it.

1053
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,920
It was honestly maybe a good 48, 64 hours total, it was just trial and error on making

1054
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,440
those costumes and matching it with the video and making the set pieces and doing what I

1055
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,700
could with the tools that I had provided.

1056
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,000
Was anyone helping you out with it?

1057
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,640
Because I noticed in a lot of the scenes, it seems like there were always three Sackboys.

1058
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,520
So was that just you kind of coordinating three controllers, or would you have a couple

1059
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
more inside of you?

1060
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,120
More incidentally, I didn't have three hands.

1061
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:55,000
So I ended up getting another friend to do the backup dancers, while I really tried to

1062
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,360
focus on the Gaga Sad Girl herself.

1063
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,440
So I did have some help in terms of just the actual dancing, but I mean in set pieces and

1064
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,720
costume design, it was just me and the PlayStation and me treating it to friends or facing it

1065
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,440
to friends to see how well they thought it matched up.

1066
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,080
Now, this is kind of a subjective question here, but would you say that the two of you

1067
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,800
tools that Media Molecule gives you in LittleBigPlanet made this process easy?

1068
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,280
I mean, I know you talked about it takes hours and hours, but it takes hours and hours to

1069
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,040
build a really good level in LittleBigPlanet too.

1070
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,920
Do you think you have the tools you needed to produce this video good, or do you think

1071
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,360
there was something that Media Molecule could have given you that would have made this whole

1072
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,680
thing easier?

1073
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:48,280
I think that the process, it went well, but I did discover limitations that I did not

1074
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,180
know existed in the game.

1075
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,040
A lot of the issues was hair with me, because hair for me, I wanted to get the right colors

1076
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,600
and really differentiate from the Gaga Sad Girl.

1077
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,120
And one of the problems is, for a lot of the hairstyles, you can't actually change the

1078
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
hair color.

1079
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:10,280
So the way I had to go around that was using stickers and carefully putting colored stickers

1080
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,380
on the hair.

1081
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:17,520
But another limitation in that is, it seems that items only have a maximum of three stickers

1082
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,040
that you can place on an object before it will erase the first one put in and put in

1083
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,560
the new one.

1084
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:33,000
On top of that, it was too deep, a 2.5D perspective game, and you couldn't get the camera right

1085
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,500
in some ways that you could, especially in close-ups.

1086
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,820
And the way I found a way around that is, when you go open the pop-it menu and go to

1087
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,680
the Customize Sackboy option, it zooms in the camera to maximize the screen on your

1088
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
Sackboy.

1089
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,000
And when you press circle and get out of that, the camera stays on that perspective.

1090
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,880
So that's how I was able to get a lot of the close-ups, because the camera tools that they

1091
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,520
give you don't get that close.

1092
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
Well, there's a tip for other aspiring video makers out there.

1093
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,800
Speaking of which, was this really the first thing you really did in LittleBigPlanet, or

1094
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,480
have you made levels before, or have you done other projects, and this is just the first

1095
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,240
one everybody seems to notice?

1096
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,960
I fooled around with LittleBigPlanet back in the beta, and I made a kind of in-sight

1097
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,040
joke level for one of the websites that I'm a forum member for, thenextlevel.com.

1098
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,640
But after that, I really didn't have the time, and so many other great games are coming out,

1099
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,480
but it was always in the back of my head that I always wanted to do something with LittleBigPlanet.

1100
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,100
And that was just, with the Gaga and LittleBigPlanet, me wondering what would happen with those

1101
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,000
two, I went out and bought a capture device, and I was like, I'm going to do this, I'm

1102
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,480
going to take my time, and I'm going to make sure I make something great.

1103
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,200
Wait, wait, wait, are you saying you bought the video capture device just for this project?

1104
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,320
Just for this project.

1105
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,320
That is dedication.

1106
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,600
Well, you know, since Lady Gaga is so generous to her fans and so forth, do you think there

1107
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,360
might be a chance she's seen it?

1108
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,280
I actually have no idea if she's seen it.

1109
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I hope she does.

1110
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,320
And I spammed her Twitter every time I post the link to that video.

1111
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,920
I do know for sure that some people in Media Molecule have seen it, because if you go on

1112
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,080
their official YouTube page, it is one of their favorites.

1113
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh, well, very cool.

1114
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,960
Hey, at least you got one half of the equation that's a fan of it.

1115
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,880
You should definitely take a compliment from that.

1116
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,280
Well, my thought is that maybe if Gaga does see it, she could contribute some of her outfits

1117
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,000
to the game, and then we'd have a huge variance in some of the costumes we have.

1118
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I don't know.

1119
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,760
I hope Media Molecule gets me on that, because I'll help anyone I need to to get those costumes

1120
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,760
done right.

1121
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
Awesome.

1122
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,920
Well, hey, you're kind of the perfect guy to ask about this, because you said you were

1123
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,480
in the beta in all this, too.

1124
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,920
And we were just talking before you came on the air about how LittleBigPlanet, a lot of

1125
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,960
us didn't really believe Media Molecule a couple years ago, or I should say a year ago

1126
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,280
when this game first came out, that they weren't going to just jump right in and do LittleBigPlanet

1127
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,280
2.

1128
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,480
They came out and said, no, we're going to continue to support LittleBigPlanet, and they've

1129
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,360
really made good on that promise to a lot of our surprise, a very pleasant surprise.

1130
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,040
What do you think it is about the game that keeps this community going strong a year after

1131
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,040
the game is out?

1132
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,520
Is it all these constant updates?

1133
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,000
Is it the fact that people keep building these pop culture references?

1134
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,040
What is it?

1135
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,400
I think, overall, it's very charming to look at, and it's very peculiar to look at.

1136
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,520
There's nothing else really out there like that.

1137
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,560
But most of all, I really feel that it's, you know, the players really feel like they

1138
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,200
are part of the game, and that they can contribute to this larger whole of what is LittleBigPlanet.

1139
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,280
I almost feel like once Media Molecule and Sony released LittleBigPlanet, it left their

1140
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,600
hands and it was everyone.

1141
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,520
Everyone could contribute, everyone could build, and it's kind of just grown into something

1142
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,800
that Sony and Media Molecule could never have done themselves.

1143
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Okay.

1144
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
That would be cool.

1145
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,960
Well, hey, I want to take some questions from our chat room here.

1146
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,280
And Redertainment has a question for you, and says, what song will you make a video

1147
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
for next?

1148
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,160
And he makes a suggestion of Guitar Hero by Amanda Palmer, who must be a favorite artist

1149
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,160
of his.

1150
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,360
I guess that's a really good question to ask.

1151
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,160
After all of this, is this going to be a regular thing for you?

1152
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,600
Are you going to continue to make more videos, or is this kind of like a one-shot thing?

1153
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
You know what?

1154
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,200
I'm going to just enjoy this and move on to other projects.

1155
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,240
What this video was, was a part of a whole of a project that I was doing actually for

1156
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,320
one of my college classes.

1157
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm about to graduate finally.

1158
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,200
And it was kind of about context and what would happen if I took something and put it

1159
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,440
in somewhere, something else, what would happen.

1160
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,560
The next part of this series, I guess I'll give you a little exclusive right now, my

1161
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,720
next video, using LittleBigPlanet and kind of going along with these pop references is

1162
00:49:51,720 --> 00:50:00,160
going to be remaking the New Moon trailer, which if there's anything bigger, then God

1163
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,480
got it to New Moon.

1164
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Fair enough.

1165
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
All right.

1166
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Wow.

1167
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:12,720
Along with that, I'd love to continue doing stuff with LittleBigPlanet.

1168
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,640
With Neil Gaff, I promised them that if this made it on any gaming blocks, that I would

1169
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,640
go along and do some of their music video requests.

1170
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,440
So some of them that they've requested are Thriller and White Wedding.

1171
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,600
So really going to have to see if those are possible, because I did stretch the limits

1172
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,200
and really got really creative with what I was given to be able to get the costumes as

1173
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,080
close as they could look.

1174
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,720
You know, I got to say, it's getting a lot of mixed feedback in our chat room.

1175
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,240
You're getting some LOLs and XDs, and then of course the Do Not Wants and so forth for

1176
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,960
the New Moon trailer.

1177
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,240
But I like this from Tigerclaw.

1178
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,440
How are they going to make a Sackboy turn into a wolf?

1179
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,420
And Botikawa says, roll full sparkly and wolf Sackboys.

1180
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,040
So I guess we'll see, huh?

1181
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Mm-hmm.

1182
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,680
Well, you know, if this whole thing was for school, I hope to hell you get an A or else

1183
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
I hope so.

1184
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,460
You got robbed.

1185
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,120
You play this for your professor.

1186
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,440
Give Brian an A. He earned it.

1187
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,200
This will actually be part of the package that I turn into him.

1188
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,200
This will be.

1189
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Awesome.

1190
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,200
Awesome.

1191
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Well, there you go.

1192
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,280
Hey, Brian, one thing we like to ask everybody we have on the show, just a standard question

1193
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,840
for all the guests, because we always ask it to ourselves at the top of every show.

1194
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:35,800
What video games have you been playing this week, now besides LittleBigPlanet, of course?

1195
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,680
The matter is what haven't I been playing this week.

1196
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,680
I've been playing Dizzidia, Final Fantasy on the PSP.

1197
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,640
I'm not too sure about that one.

1198
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,160
When I played it at E3 earlier this year, I was kind of, I had no idea what was going

1199
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,640
on, but I'm getting used to it.

1200
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,200
I'm really enjoying it.

1201
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,520
It's a really big fan service.

1202
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,600
On top of that, playing the original Left 4 Dead, because I already bought Left 4 Dead

1203
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,160
2 on Black Friday to have me finish the first one.

1204
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,960
And O'Meara Friend also went to the 3 a.m. Old Navy Black Friday opening, and he got

1205
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,280
herself a copy of Little Rock Band.

1206
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,520
So we've been rocking out with that, with Elton John and Vampire Weekend.

1207
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
Very cool.

1208
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,200
I was debating doing that, but I was like, ah, I don't want to fight all those people

1209
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,320
at 3 in the morning, so props to you for doing that.

1210
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,620
Very interesting, too, because Lego Rock Band's another game with very cute-looking avatars.

1211
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:34,120
You think you might have to have something there with Lego Rock Band and making fan videos?

1212
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:41,000
The thing with Lego Rock Band is, for me, I really need those tools, and as far as I've

1213
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,080
seen, Lego Rock Band doesn't give me anywhere close to what Little Big Planet does.

1214
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,080
Very true.

1215
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,880
In terms of the create and being able to have some control.

1216
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,880
Besides Little Big Planet, I am going to start looking into Uncharted 2, because I'm ever

1217
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,800
hearing there's a movie-making mode where you can do all kinds of camera tricks and

1218
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,040
lip-syncing, I believe, is in there.

1219
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,480
Honestly, what I can do with that, I'm really trying to get into the electronic format and

1220
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:14,800
the electronic creative ways to continue this project beyond just the school project and

1221
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,200
the assignment requirements.

1222
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,440
Well, Brian, it sounds like you're going to be able to use this as kind of a launch of

1223
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,920
future Mashima and types of movies based around video games, so props to you.

1224
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,720
Where can the listeners keep tabs on you and your future projects?

1225
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,440
The easiest way is going onto my website, www.brianmarino.com.

1226
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,280
You can find me on YouTube at youtube.com slash brianrdm.

1227
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,720
Those will be the quickest and easy ways to keep up on any of the work I do.

1228
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,160
All right, and stay tuned there for the soon-to-come Little Big Planet New Moon trailer, which

1229
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,200
you heard about here on OLR First.

1230
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Thank you so much, Brian.

1231
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,960
I appreciate that exclusive and everything else.

1232
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,880
And best of luck to you in your future endeavors.

1233
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,880
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1234
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:03,320
I want to thank you guys, Kotaku, NeoGaf, The Next Level, all the listeners on Orange

1235
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,080
Lounge Radio, everyone on YouTube, Lady Gaga, everything, because without all of you guys,

1236
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,440
this wouldn't be anywhere close to what it was.

1237
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,040
Well, I'm glad we can kind of make your day with all of this.

1238
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
And you know what?

1239
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,280
I really smiled and got a good laugh in a really positive way out of the video when

1240
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,000
I first saw it, so I'm glad we can kind of turn it around back to you.

1241
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Excellent.

1242
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Thank you, guys.

1243
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
All right.

1244
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Take care, Brian.

1245
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Have a good one.

1246
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Take care, guys.

1247
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Bye.

1248
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Bye.

1249
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Well, that was fun.

1250
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,160
He definitely sounds like he's going to kind of use this to kind of start something else.

1251
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,240
And although, you know, this may be the one that's really big and maybe the other ones,

1252
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
but I don't know.

1253
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
I mean, that one was so good.

1254
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,240
And he's right.

1255
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
It was very well done.

1256
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,480
No, I was quite impressed.

1257
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,840
Whether I like it or not, you know, I like Gaga, but I don't like Twilight nearly as

1258
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
much.

1259
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
But-

1260
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,040
I'm actually looking forward to seeing how that pans out.

1261
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,920
I love parodies.

1262
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
He's right.

1263
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,800
The only thing bigger than Gaga is Twilight, so why the hell not?

1264
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,800
So yeah, you're totally right.

1265
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,600
Who doesn't love a good Weird Al song no matter what it is he's parodying, right?

1266
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,480
Oh, he should do a Weird Al video.

1267
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Hopefully he's listening.

1268
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
Hopefully he's still listening.

1269
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Seriously?

1270
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
A Weird Al one?

1271
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
That would be good.

1272
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
There you go.

1273
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,480
All right.

1274
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,480
Well, that was fun.

1275
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
All right.

1276
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
Let's move on.

1277
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,200
We've got some more news here before we get to our classic game of the week, and then,

1278
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,640
of course, part B tonight, 7 o'clock here in California, 10 o'clock for those folks

1279
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,700
on the East Coast, but plenty more show to come.

1280
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,160
So, Loki, what's up next?

1281
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,760
As we alluded to in our intro, although the podcast won't be privy to that, New York

1282
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:40,700
State apparently now has teamed up with Microsoft to issue emergency alerts via Xbox Live, kind

1283
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,880
of similar to, I guess, the Amber Alerts that we have and other emergency broadcasts and

1284
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,880
stuff.

1285
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,360
They're going to let you know if there's a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, you

1286
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,560
name it, whatever requires them to do it.

1287
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,080
I just hope they don't do the tests with that, and I also hope they don't have that

1288
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,800
annoying beep that goes with it.

1289
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,080
A message to me might be fine, but, man, I hate watching TV, and all of a sudden there's

1290
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,120
like an Amber Alert thing going on, and all the audio cuts out, and it's like, dude,

1291
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
I'm inside my house.

1292
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,120
I'm not going to see some guy driving around with his stolen child in my house, okay?

1293
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,000
Plus, that's kind of the concern I would think about Amber Alerts is that the more

1294
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,040
you use it, the more desensitized people get to it, right?

1295
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,760
Does that make sense?

1296
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,520
If you saw an Amber Alert every hour on the TV, you would stop paying attention to them.

1297
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,940
So you really have to use a device like this, and I don't know, we're using Amber Alert.

1298
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,800
Is that the type of thing they're talking about here, kidnapped kids?

1299
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,600
It's mainly emergency broadcast system stuff.

1300
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:48,160
Mainly I think it's because New York and the whole 9-11 thing.

1301
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,440
I'm sure other states are probably looking into something like this too.

1302
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,440
I'm sorry.

1303
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,040
Do you know if the gaming consoles are exactly a good platformer for that?

1304
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,800
Because most people would be like, ah, goddammit, who's messaging me now?

1305
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm going to go finish this game first.

1306
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You know, terror alert, you know, death and imminent.

1307
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,360
It's like, ah.

1308
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,560
The Vs have arrived.

1309
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,440
Get out of town.

1310
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
The bombing's gone off already.

1311
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
That bothers me, Rob.

1312
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Why?

1313
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,360
I know I don't like using, okay, that's like seriously my big pet peeve with that

1314
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,080
show is them calling them the Vs that, no.

1315
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:27,920
The whole point of the V in the original series was the reference to World War II.

1316
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,400
Okay, okay, but you know in the new one they got the whole thing, I know, I know, all right.

1317
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,480
But I mean regardless, all joking aside, I got to say though, you know, when they originally

1318
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,820
incorporated the emergency broadcast system, wasn't it kind of a similar deal?

1319
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,960
You know, people use their free time playing TV, or playing TV, watching TV, and so the

1320
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,480
emergency broadcast system would alert those people who aren't glued to the radio or going

1321
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
outside.

1322
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,400
I mean this kind of makes sense in a way.

1323
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,560
I think that they use this tastefully like, hey, there's a fucking fire right by you

1324
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,560
right now.

1325
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,040
You know, it might be a good idea to get the fuck out and stop playing your game.

1326
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,200
I actually don't think it's a bad idea, but again, it's just about how much they

1327
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
use it.

1328
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,460
Because if it's an AMBO alert every other hour, people are going to get pissed off.

1329
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,720
But if it's for like big stuff, like you need to leave your home.

1330
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,500
You need to evacuate or something.

1331
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,220
If it's an absolute emergency like that, they have a way to call all the phones and

1332
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,000
have an automated message play so you can pick up your phone.

1333
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,800
Because most people might not be playing like a game console.

1334
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,760
You know, hey, what's that crackling rumbling sound?

1335
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,040
Oh, hey, it's fire!

1336
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Awesome!

1337
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,320
I'm going to play one more level.

1338
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,960
It's far enough away.

1339
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,960
I don't know.

1340
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,840
It's just, it's a neat idea.

1341
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
It's just interesting to see how it's implemented.

1342
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,080
I think it's going to be just about as effective as it is on TV.

1343
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,520
Which is, if you're like me, that's the time that I go get a snack.

1344
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,160
Because that noise isn't, oh god, I hate it.

1345
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,680
SSJ100Matt in our chat took the words right out of my mouth.

1346
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,600
The next step would be announcements and wow.

1347
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,640
But then again, those people won't leave their homes anyway.

1348
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,880
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1349
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
I resemble that remark.

1350
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,560
Thank you very much.

1351
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,240
Janai in chat, yes, it just goes in the next time.

1352
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,880
We interrupt this wow raid for this important Amber Alert.

1353
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,440
And again, guys, I'm not trying to belittle Amber Alerts.

1354
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,560
Obviously, it's an important thing.

1355
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,720
But I think that type of thing works best on the highway, where the cars are, on the

1356
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,880
signs on the highway.

1357
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:36,960
On the TV in my home, I'm not likely to see white Honda Civic license plate whatever driving

1358
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,960
by.

1359
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,680
I'm not as likely to be receptive to that as I would be.

1360
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,640
But if it's for a big thing, like town being evacuated, then yeah, you need to have your

1361
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,580
game paused for this emergency message.

1362
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,660
But it's all about in how they use it for me.

1363
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,660
That's my opinion anyway.

1364
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,660
I don't know.

1365
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,460
DarkSaga, how would you feel if you were playing a game and then suddenly, a little message

1366
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,480
comes up, fire, get out?

1367
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:06,480
Well, if there was really a fire, then I'd be like, thank you.

1368
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,120
But if it was just like, what?

1369
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,720
I'd be like, GTFO my game.

1370
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,440
Or if it was like, fire in Bakersfield, and then you're like, well, it's like five hours

1371
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
away.

1372
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
Sucks to be there.

1373
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Do not give a crap.

1374
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,920
I mean, sucks to be people in Bakersfield, but don't know.

1375
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,200
That's what I would worry, especially if it's like a statewide thing.

1376
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:36,720
I would want to have it be my specific zip code maybe.

1377
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,320
That might be more appropriate.

1378
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,960
The chat room collectively, I'm just kind of attributing this to several people in the

1379
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,920
chat room, seem to think that the iPhone is a good idea for these types of alerts.

1380
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,580
And I've heard that talk before too, is alerts through text message, which I think could

1381
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,580
be very effective.

1382
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,580
That'd be awesome.

1383
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,640
And then I get charged text messaging.

1384
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,920
Not if you have an iPhone.

1385
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,720
Well, and your carrier doesn't charge.

1386
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,200
I know even when I had Sprint and I got charged for every message on my plan, they didn't

1387
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,880
charge for messages they sent.

1388
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,880
Yeah.

1390
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
And I wouldn't think those would get charged.

1391
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,880
But a lot of times, though, it's built into your iPhone plan to have like a certain number

1392
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
of...

1393
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,040
Or even if it...

1394
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,040
A little app you could download that's like an alert app or something.

1395
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,520
It might not have the same impact, though, than just sending it for a text message.

1396
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
Just send it to your email.

1397
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,000
They just have stuff that goes to your email.

1398
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,600
And then, of course, as the J-100 Map makes the joke, Nintendo will send their Amber Alerts

1399
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,840
through friend codes.

1400
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,960
So an Amber Alert will look like 012463.

1401
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Anyhow.

1402
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:44,520
All right, hey, speaking of WoW came up in that last story, and WoW is the attention

1403
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,180
this week of a lawsuit.

1404
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,180
That's right.

1405
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:53,320
$1 million in a complaint against Activision Blizzard over the design of World of Warcraft.

1406
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:58,760
This complaint says that the publisher maintains a, quote, harmful virtual environment to many

1407
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,040
of its customers by forcing them to follow the game's sneaky and deceitful practices.

1408
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,280
Well, now, what would you think about this lawsuit if I told you it was filed by Eric

1409
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,880
Estavio?

1410
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
That's right.

1411
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,920
The guy who filed the lawsuit against Sony.

1412
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,020
And the judge basically laughed it out of court.

1413
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,800
So he went and sued Microsoft and Nintendo, which we reported on last week.

1414
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,280
And this week, now he sued Activision Blizzard over this one.

1415
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:32,800
Oh, by the way, as part of this case, Estavio has subpoenaed actress Winona Ryder and Depeche

1416
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:38,000
Mode's Martin Lee Gore to testify on his behalf.

1417
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,560
Because apparently, I don't even want to get into it.

1418
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,320
It's just as ridiculous as it sounds.

1419
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,960
Does that mean they have to actually show up?

1420
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,960
I don't know.

1421
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,200
I think he just wanted to meet them.

1422
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,320
I'm reminded of that scene from Clerks, the animated series, where they subpoena George

1423
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,840
Lucas in the courtroom, which, didn't this whole topic-

1424
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
I want my money back.

1425
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,920
Didn't this topic come up on the show like just two weeks ago?

1426
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
Last week.

1427
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,960
Well, here it is again, probably for the same fucking guy.

1428
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,960
Yes, it was.

1429
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,760
And that's just exactly what it sounds like.

1430
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,520
I want my eight dollars back.

1431
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,520
That's exactly what it sounds like.

1432
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
I mean-

1433
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
Someone sued him.

1434
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,320
Hey, let's have a class action lawsuit against that guy.

1435
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,640
For ruining all of the news sites that we- for having such an impact on the gaming culture

1436
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,240
and the game blogs?

1437
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,120
For mental anguish that someone could be that stupid.

1438
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,560
Watch out or we might get sued next.

1439
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,360
Of course, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

1440
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,520
We don't have any money.

1441
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
Good luck.

1442
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,520
I'd take him to court.

1443
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,520
I'd fight it all the way.

1444
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
No, check this out.

1445
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,520
Check this out.

1446
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:46,160
If he sued us, then we could actually petition for damages for cost if-

1447
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
I'd counter sue.

1448
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,240
Just would win.

1449
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,760
And then we'd have money to advertise a show.

1450
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,760
That'd be awesome.

1451
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,760
We would.

1452
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
Here's my thought.

1453
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Okay-

1454
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,760
Buy a studio.

1455
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,540
In all seriousness, though, okay, this is the point where you rela- I mean, last week

1456
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,680
we were asking this, but now you really have to ask, why is he doing this?

1457
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,800
Is it just a tour?

1458
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,960
Or is it just he's trying to be collecting all the money?

1459
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,400
But like, I would be with you on the whole he's doing it just for the money until I heard

1460
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,920
he's subpoenaed Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode because now I'm like, okay, this guy's just

1461
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,800
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

1462
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,400
But how do you have money to pay?

1463
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,960
I mean, is he getting these lawyers that are just like, you know-

1464
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,800
I mean, your average lawyer is not gonna probably follow up with this stuff because there's

1465
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,240
no payout for it.

1466
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,100
I mean, unless this guy's gonna pay him, you know, to do this stuff, I'm assuming that

1467
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:43,760
he's expecting the, you know, win this stuff to, you know, cover his lawyer fees.

1468
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,400
But I don't know.

1469
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,260
It's like there's so little grounds.

1470
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:53,320
It's like it would be such a high risk case for a lawyer.

1471
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,960
If I was an attorney, I would think that it would be damaging to my reputation to take

1472
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,920
such a frivolous case like this.

1473
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,520
And some people in our chat are invoking the name of Lord Voldemort, which you might remember

1474
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,640
is a certain lawyer.

1475
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:11,400
His name rhymes with Jack Fuckhead-Ompson.

1476
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,480
That we call him Lord Voldemort here on the show.

1477
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,240
A few folks invoking that name, dude, this guy is starting to make Lord Voldemort look

1478
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
good.

1479
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Like, really?

1480
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,680
Like, at least you kind of knew what Lord Voldemort was thinking.

1481
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, it's not like you could hire him.

1482
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Right?

1483
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,680
It's just so weird.

1484
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:35,000
Anyway, and I just, I really would like to find this guy and shoot him with a water gun.

1485
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,880
I have to admit, I kind of want him on the show.

1486
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,800
Has this guy made a comment publicly?

1487
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,280
I don't think he's made any type of comment publicly.

1488
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,600
You know, all these blogs are reporting on it when really he should just be banned.

1489
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,600
If you pay the town fool no mind, he will just go away and, you know, entertain himself

1490
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,600
in his house.

1491
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,160
But everybody likes the town fool that jumps around and makes an ass of himself.

1492
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,640
But I would kind of like to hear his side of it, like, you know, and I'm willing to

1493
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,800
give him a fair shot if he'll present himself professionally.

1494
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,640
Isn't he serving as his own lawyer?

1495
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,000
I believe he is.

1496
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,120
Don't they say a man who has himself as a lawyer has a fool for a client or something

1497
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
like that?

1498
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,120
What was that line there from Addams Family?

1499
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Well, by God, I am that fool!

1500
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,240
Yes, exactly.

1501
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,480
I love that movie.

1502
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,800
Me too.

1503
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,920
By the way, totally off topic and I don't care.

1504
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,680
Did you hear that it's going to be a stage play soon with Nathan Lane as Gomez and Bebe

1505
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,680
Neuwirth as Morticia?

1506
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,680
I'm just saying.

1507
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,680
Epic epicness.

1508
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,680
Nathan Lane?

1509
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,680
I can't see that.

1510
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,680
I'm sorry.

1511
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,440
It's a little weird, but let's face it, Raul Julia ain't here no more.

1512
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,400
So if they're going to go with this comic Broadway angle, why not?

1513
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,400
You know, I don't know.

1514
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Anyway.

1515
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,720
He's a little chubby for, you know.

1516
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Maybe he's worked out.

1517
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,360
But anyway, Ricky Gomack says about this guy, he just wants to get on Oprah before she's

1518
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,620
gone.

1519
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,620
This might be the way to do it.

1520
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,880
I don't know.

1521
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,040
And then who was it that said that we should go settle this?

1522
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,040
Oh, here it is.

1523
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,040
Amaze Atsuma.

1524
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,800
Skye, sue him so you can be on the people's court.

1525
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,800
Yeah.

1526
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,000
If this guy does, for whatever reason, sue us, even though we're totally under our rights

1527
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,760
to comment on what is a public news story, for whatever wacky reason, although I don't

1528
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,620
see it happening, we were to get sued, I would only agree to settlement on the people's court

1529
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,000
under Judge Millon because, or Judge Millon, she would tear him a new butthole.

1530
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,680
And you know, you don't fuck with her.

1531
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,760
I don't know if you've ever watched the new people's court, but she's amazing.

1532
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Just saying.

1533
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,960
You know, I remember the people's court back in the day when it was Judge Wapner.

1534
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,080
Oh yeah, I remember that too.

1535
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
Back in the day.

1536
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
I remember that too.

1537
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,840
You always waited for the day he was going to send somebody to the electric chair, but

1538
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
it never happened.

1539
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,840
I don't think they can.

1540
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
No, you can't.

1541
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
They'd make an exception.

1542
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,200
That's not the way TV court works, but you know sometimes there were just those people

1543
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,640
on the show that you wish would get the death penalty.

1544
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,840
No, sir, you can't do that, but you know what, I'm going to make this exception this one

1545
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
time.

1546
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Alright.

1547
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,360
I vote for hanging.

1548
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,280
You know what, part of me just wants to ban this guy from the show.

1549
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
What do you think?

1550
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,280
Are we going to report on this guy ever again?

1551
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,760
Actually, you know what I want to do?

1552
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,760
What?

1553
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,360
I want to publicly humiliate him.

1554
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,440
Well, isn't he kind of doing that for himself?

1555
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
No, I'm not.

1556
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,440
I didn't mean it like that.

1557
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,960
I mean, I meant mock, like apart from just what we're doing on the show.

1558
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,160
Again, is there anything additional we could lend to the rest of the internet?

1559
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,920
Well, we can make a big, well, I'm saying like we could use, are there pictures of this

1560
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,920
guy around?

1561
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Probably not.

1562
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,120
We could totally make lolcat stuff out of this guy.

1563
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,200
Or we'll get Brian to help us make a LittleBigPlanet level.

1564
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Yes!

1565
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,760
We've got $10 with your name on it because we have no money.

1566
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,140
It could be a level in LittleBigPlanet where OLR goes to the people's court with Eric,

1567
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,000
and it's about our adventures of traveling to judge me on it.

1568
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,240
We will provide a voice talent with Judge Mr. Spanky.

1569
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,680
Seriously, that would be fun.

1570
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,700
Now, I'm in the mood to do something silly, like I'm tired of making lol Sims.

1571
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,720
So I want to do something funny.

1572
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,160
We'll have to brainstorm off air.

1573
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,560
Maybe if the chatters have an idea, you can email us at mailbagorangelawnsherd.com, especially

1574
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,200
if you have LittleBigPlanet skills, because I'm loving this idea.

1575
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:17,560
Alright, yes, ActDeaf has the perfect name for it, LittleBigLawsuit.

1576
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,560
How perfect!

1577
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,120
What a perfect name for this whole story.

1578
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,880
Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, please change the subject.

1579
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,100
What I like to ever.

1580
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,800
How about Konami?

1581
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,800
Because we like Konami!

1582
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,480
Yeah, Konami, you know, they've had their ups and downs over the year, but you know

1583
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,000
what, they gave us DDR, and without it we would have never met, so they'll always have

1584
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
a place in my heart.

1585
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,600
Well, they've also given us Castlevania, or as it's known, Demon Castle Dracula.

1586
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:53,360
And now this statement put out by Dave Cox, who's an executive with Konami, is basically

1587
01:09:53,360 --> 01:10:00,800
talking about Castlevania Lords of Shadow, and saying that it's a big departure.

1588
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:08,020
So they're a little nervous about how it's going to be received.

1589
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:17,900
It's going to be a free sort of game, as in you have a free roaming world, you can move

1590
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,120
through different areas.

1591
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:27,080
There's also supposed to be pretty A-list voice credits added in there, too.

1592
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,340
But they're a little nervous because it's going to be a different kind of Castlevania.

1593
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,560
Wasn't this the one that had, like, Patrick Stewart in it?

1594
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,560
Ian McClellan.

1595
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Oh, okay.

1596
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
Sorry.

1597
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,560
What?

1598
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Your mic's not on.

1599
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,560
Turn the mic on.

1600
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,560
Mic is on.

1601
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,560
You know what?

1602
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,560
Oh, okay.

1603
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,960
That was weird, you weren't picking up for some reason.

1604
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,960
No.

1605
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
Oh, weird.

1606
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,960
It was the ghost.

1607
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,960
Apparently.

1608
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:51,280
You read, I'm sorry, go back to the last story, you read what the lawsuit was about, right?

1609
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,040
About the whole fact that it takes over people's lives.

1610
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,760
No, it doesn't take over people's lives.

1611
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,720
He's complaining that because the speed of which you walk or run in the game is too slow

1612
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,520
and therefore it takes you longer to finish quests, therefore causing you to have to pay

1613
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,560
longer and longer subscriptions in order to finish the quest in the game.

1614
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,560
That was his complaint.

1615
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,460
That's even dumber than, you know, it being addicting.

1616
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,460
You know what?

1617
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,160
I would almost not be, like, so pointing and laughing at this guy, again, if it weren't

1618
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,400
for the one owner writer and Depeche Mode subpoenas because that's where you went from

1619
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,680
just petty to batshit crazy, in my opinion.

1620
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,680
And I have a right to state my opinion.

1621
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,680
All right.

1622
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,680
Sorry.

1623
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,680
No, that's okay.

1624
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,280
But I want to go back to Castlevania because, you know, I'm nervous about this new Castlevania

1625
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,400
game too because, let's face it, there hasn't been, in my opinion, a really, really, really

1626
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:48,260
memorable, keyword memorable, Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.

1627
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:54,240
And I realize the DS ones were decent and the, above decent, they were pretty good.

1628
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,480
And you know, the PS2 one was decent, but there hasn't been one that's just been effing

1629
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,680
awesome like the Nintendo one.

1630
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,760
Order of the Clesia was pretty freaking rad.

1631
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,760
I love that game.

1632
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
I don't know.

1633
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,760
Did you play it?

1634
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
Yeah, a little bit.

1635
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,760
A little bit.

1636
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Did you play it a lot bit?

1637
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
Okay.

1638
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
A half bit.

1639
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,760
A half bit.

1640
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,260
I think that was one of the games I played when I was really sick last year, so.

1641
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,040
But I knew what you were getting at.

1642
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,440
Order of the Clesia was hard, it was actually a challenge to play.

1643
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,960
Especially if they're taking this series in a whole new direction, but at the same time,

1644
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,880
Symphony of the Night, which is, I would easily put, in one of my top five video games of

1645
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,440
all time, was a new direction for Castlevania.

1646
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,760
I know what will save the series.

1647
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,760
What's that?

1648
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
More Richter.

1649
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,760
More Richter.

1650
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Sorry.

1651
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,320
We need another Dracula X.

1652
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,320
Dark Sakura?

1653
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,320
What?

1654
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,320
You don't belong in this world.

1655
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,320
Bah.

1656
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,920
Anyhow, let's move on to get some release dates, travel the world, and see what's coming

1657
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,520
out in your neck of the woods.

1658
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Yep.

1659
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,560
There's some stuff coming out this week, actually.

1660
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,400
The first, well I should say the last good week before the end of the year.

1661
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,680
There's a few other things coming out the rest of the year, but this is kind of the

1662
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,440
big hurrah before the end of the year.

1663
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,800
So first thing first, we've got Avatar coming out on pretty much everything.

1664
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,200
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

1665
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,200
And this PC as well.

1666
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,440
Can I be honest with you for a minute?

1667
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,440
Yeah.

1668
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,000
Is it just me, or I am like so not interested in Avatar.

1669
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,920
Like it just doesn't look good to me.

1670
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:32,200
And like, you know, I'll be fair and say, you know, I realize that I'm not always into

1671
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,360
the same type of movies everybody else is and so forth, but you know, I like Terminator.

1672
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,740
I like Titanic.

1673
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,040
I like, you know, all these movies that James Cameron's done.

1674
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,040
Did you cry?

1675
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,440
Of course I cried.

1676
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,220
But I'm looking at- I teared.

1677
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,840
I'm looking for- shut up.

1678
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,360
I'm looking at Avatar, and I'm just kind of like, oh boy.

1679
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:55,600
This just- it just looks bloated, long, pompous, and it doesn't look like it's going to be

1680
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
good to me.

1681
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,600
I'm going to go see it just because it's going to be in 3D.

1682
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,920
It's supposed to be really awesome, but then if, you know, it sucks, I'll be sure to shout

1683
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,160
it to the world that it sucks.

1684
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,480
The game itself is supposed to be good.

1685
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,200
It's- they have been working on it for a few years at least.

1686
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,280
So it's supposed to be good and not sucky, and we'll see though.

1687
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,760
I will take my friend- if my friends all come back and say it was freaking awesome, then

1688
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,400
I will go see it, and maybe I'm wrong, and I'll just blame the marketing.

1689
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:30,440
You know, I'm kind of with you on that because, you know, it does look kind of like it could

1690
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,320
be lame, but you know, I'll give it a chance.

1691
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,920
I think it's going to be really cool looking.

1692
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,400
Dark Sakura just exclaimed, I love salacious pop, referring to one of our chatters.

1693
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,400
Why is that?

1694
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,920
Avatar looks like Starship Troopers plus Warcraft plus The Spirits Within plus corny

1695
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
diarrhea.

1696
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,760
That's a pretty good way to come up.

1697
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:56,920
Now this is my take on Avatar, is now, I am a big fan of fun tech, and looking into the

1698
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,480
how they make it, you know, the behind the scenes stuff, the technology going into it,

1699
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:09,880
the innovations that are actually being made in the CG process, in the motion capture,

1700
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,240
that's really, really interesting to me.

1701
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,320
I'll give you that, I'll give you that.

1702
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,040
And from the technical, a lot of times, I'll go see a movie, even if it's supposed to be,

1703
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:28,520
you know, the corn and crap, I will see it to see how the final product looks like, okay,

1704
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:34,760
I do like a lot of movies that people hate, I love bad movies, I loved Hypercube, I loved

1705
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,760
Xanadu.

1706
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,760
I love Showgirls.

1707
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,320
I love Showgirls too, and you got me into that movie, you don't know shit.

1708
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:50,760
But no, in the end, but you also know that I don't really go for the stuff that's overhyped,

1709
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,040
I really avoid stuff that's overhyped.

1710
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,280
But I think I'll see this one, I will see it, you know, opening week, because honestly,

1711
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,200
I don't want to see it that bad.

1712
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,160
But I will see it after it's been in the theater for a little bit.

1713
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,600
I didn't mean to turn this into Avatar hate, I'm so sorry, but I just, I had to get that

1714
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,580
out there, because there's just, there was just something about it that just wasn't sitting

1715
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,580
well with me.

1716
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,960
And again, maybe it's going to be an awesome movie, and I'm totally wrong, but I love some

1717
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,560
of the comments from chat.

1718
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,320
Legend of Zaku says, Avatar equals Dances with Smurfs.

1719
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,640
That's from South Park.

1720
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,640
Oh, was it?

1721
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,640
Yeah.

1722
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,440
Oh, I didn't see this week's episode, that must be what it is.

1723
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:32,840
And then, that's just Joe 100 Matt saying, I heard it's getting terrible pre-screening

1724
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
reviews.

1725
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,160
You know, this is the time for them to fine-tune it and tailor it and what have you, so I hope

1726
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,320
for their sake they can pull it off.

1727
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:44,520
Now, I will say this, though, at the same time, I so want to go see The Princess and

1728
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:50,360
the Frog, because I am all about Disney going back to the way they did movies back in the,

1729
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,800
you know, 90s with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and all this, so, you know, just because

1730
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,200
the movie's over-hyped doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be bad.

1731
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
But who knows, maybe-

1732
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,460
There's been zero hype for that movie.

1733
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,280
Maybe it's just because I'm a Disney fan, and I'll fully admit, you know, obviously

1734
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,280
I'm biased in that regard.

1735
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,280
No, no, no.

1736
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,440
It looks good, but I'm just saying, there's been no hype, whereas Avatar, they were just

1737
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,320
like, fucking your eyeballs, you know, in 2009, I'm like, I don't think so.

1738
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,160
You don't have kids, though, and I think they've been aiming this at the kids.

1739
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,120
I think it'll do decent.

1740
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,120
I don't think it's going to be like their huge movie, but I think it'll do decent enough

1741
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,140
that they'll get back into doing 2D movies, we'll see.

1742
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,840
I think it'll make more than Avatar does.

1743
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,600
No, it won't.

1744
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,360
Oh, we'll see.

1745
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
Care to make a wager?

1746
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,400
No, I don't, but I can tell you right now it's not going to-

1747
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,400
I tried.

1748
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Alright, let's move on.

1749
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,880
Sorry, release dates.

1750
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,880
Derailed the show.

1751
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,880
My bad.

1752
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
Totally.

1753
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,600
Okay, so other things coming out this week.

1754
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:49,360
Rogue Warrior coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, MX vs. ATV Reflex on the

1755
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:59,160
DS, PSP Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and god, I forgot that this movie was coming

1756
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,720
out, and I really don't want to see this.

1757
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:05,000
Alvin and the Chipmunks is a squeak-quel on the Wii and DS this week.

1758
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,440
Why, god?

1759
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,440
Why?

1760
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,520
It's got the chipettes this time.

1761
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:20,760
I'd rather- I would rather watch like Avatar for 24 hours straight or any- Oh, I know what

1762
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,760
I was going to say.

1763
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,920
Here's the thing.

1764
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,200
When I saw the trailer for Avatar, it looked like an M. Night Shyamalan movie to me.

1765
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,720
That was what didn't sit well with me.

1766
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:32,800
So I would rather than watch the new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I would rather watch

1767
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,800
what was it called?

1768
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,600
The Happening or whatever that latest like that just it was so horrible.

1769
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:42,160
You sure you weren't watching The Last Airbender, which is an M. Night Shyamalan movie?

1770
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,920
I would rather watch The Happening five times in a row than watch the new Alvin and Chipmunks

1771
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,920
movie.

1772
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,320
For the record, this is actually going back to what you're saying about the Princess of

1773
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,320
the Frog.

1774
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Yes.

1775
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,320
It's from Becky.

1776
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
Oh, yeah?

1777
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
Yeah.

1778
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,880
And I do have a kid and I actually haven't seen much about Princess and the Frog on Disney

1779
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,880
Channel yet.

1780
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,880
Really?

1781
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,880
Really?

1782
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,640
She's got a two-year-old who watches Phineas and Ferb, Rob.

1783
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,960
Remember, I showed you some of that.

1784
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:07,960
I know.

1785
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,960
I know.

1786
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,960
I know.

1787
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,960
And it's great.

1788
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,960
Fair enough.

1789
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,960
Fair enough.

1790
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,960
I guess fair enough.

1791
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,960
But you know what?

1792
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,960
Once it does come out- Has it come out yet?

1793
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,960
Or did it come out last Friday?

1794
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,960
What?

1795
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,960
The Princess and the Frog?

1796
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,220
It's in only New York and LA.

1797
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,720
I think it's everywhere the 11th.

1798
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,720
Okay.

1799
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,440
Well, when it does come out, then yeah, their marketing blitz will be just everywhere.

1800
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,160
You won't be able to get away from it.

1801
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:33,640
Anyways, Dirt 2 on PC, the very first DirectX 11 game making its way out.

1802
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:37,760
Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on the DS this week.

1803
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,040
Wreck Room, a generic party game for the Wii.

1804
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:51,240
Storybook Workshop, the latest schlock from Konami coming out on the Wii.

1805
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,440
Seven Wonders 2 on the DS for your casual game fans.

1806
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,640
Safe Cracker, also casual game fans.

1807
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,440
World Party Games, yet another generic party game out on the Wii.

1808
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,320
Of course, next week we're going to have some really awesome stuff with Legend of Zelda

1809
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,880
Spirit Tracks and Saboteur.

1810
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:14,200
All right, let's travel over to Japan and see what they've got to look forward to.

1811
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,320
And they've got on the 3rd of December, Assassin's Creed 2 gets its Japanese release.

1812
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,320
They're from Ubisoft.

1813
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,160
Also, Fallout 3 gets their Game of the Year edition, those coming out both in Japan on

1814
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,160
the 3rd.

1815
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,520
And Japan's kind of in the same place we are, where it's going to be a little bit dry through

1816
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,240
the holiday season.

1817
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,960
They have a different kind of release pattern than they do here, so I think you'll still

1818
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,720
see some things, but for the most part, it's going to be pretty quiet the rest of the year.

1819
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,520
But I will say on the PlayStation 3, they also get Assassin's Creed 2 over there and

1820
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,840
Fallout 3 again.

1821
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,220
They're also getting some discounts on Folklore, moving into the PlayStation 3 the best, or

1822
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:50,720
as they call it there, Folk's Soul, and Ratchet and Clank's future, as well as Resistance

1823
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,720
Fall of Man.

1824
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,960
They're all going into the best series over in Japan, so if you live over there, you can

1825
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,760
get a price reduction on that.

1826
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,560
On the Nintendo Wii, this December, you can get Biohazard and Biohazard Zero.

1827
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,160
That's of course what they call Resident Evil over there.

1828
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,040
Those are also getting price reductions on the Wii.

1829
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,960
Lots of price reductions is kind of the theme here, but that's a good thing going into this

1830
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,360
holiday season.

1831
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,080
Also in Japan on December 3rd, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, yeah, they had to wait.

1832
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,600
So they're getting it this week, though, on December 3rd.

1833
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,020
Sengoku Musou 3 comes out on the Wii as well.

1834
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,080
That's from Koei Entertainment.

1835
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,160
That is, I believe, another one of their strategy-type games.

1836
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,640
That's one of the, I think, Romance of the Three Kingdoms ones?

1837
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,440
Yeah, well, Koei did all of those games, and I'm pretty sure this is right in that same

1838
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,440
vein.

1839
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:43,280
You know, those games are way more popular over there than they are here, although I

1840
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,320
will say the game certainly is not without its fans over here.

1841
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:53,400
On the Nintendo DS, Cross Treasures, you can get that out there from Squeenix.

1842
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,160
Also coming out, Kaiju Busters, and Kira...

1843
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,160
Monsters?

1844
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,200
Yes, Kaiju Big Brawl.

1845
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,200
Is it really?

1846
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
I think it is.

1847
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:08,760
Kira Kira Rhythm Collection comes out as well, and Metal Fight Beyblade comes out from Hudson.

1848
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
So check that out.

1849
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,680
It's a big release for stuff on the DS.

1850
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,680
There's lots and lots of games.

1851
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,700
Signal coming out on the DS as well from D3 over in Japan.

1852
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:21,200
And then lastly, going over to the PSP, seeing if there's anything to look forward to there.

1853
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:26,000
Oh, LittleBigPlanet Portable gets its release in Japan this week, as well as Mobile Suit

1854
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,960
Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.

1855
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,600
Ooh, that sounds fun.

1856
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,880
And also, this one might be worth importing to some people, Phantasy Star Portable 2 comes

1857
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,880
out this week.

1858
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,880
Ooh.

1859
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,880
Oh, and Jamie?

1860
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
What?

1861
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,320
Tokimeki Memorial 4 on the PSP this week.

1862
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,520
No Toki memo for me, please.

1863
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,520
There you go.

1864
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,520
How about you, K?

1865
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,360
Someone in Japan, send me President Cat.

1866
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,360
How about the UK?

1867
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,360
Okay.

1868
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,680
Not really a whole lot.

1869
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:55,980
On the 4th, we have Colin McRae Dirt 2, like anyone cares.

1870
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:00,280
We have Easy Piano for DS.

1871
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,480
And then we have Avatar The Game.

1872
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,480
And The Saboteur.

1873
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:09,920
Oh, and Tony Hawk Ride, but who plays Tony Hawk anymore?

1874
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,240
How is the ride doing out of curiosity?

1875
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,240
Not good.

1876
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,240
No?

1877
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,240
I heard it was not.

1878
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,040
Yeah, I heard it wasn't doing too well.

1879
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,040
I could have called that.

1880
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,040
Oh, wait, I did.

1881
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Yes.

1882
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,040
Sure.

1883
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,040
It looked like crap.

1884
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,040
I'm sorry.

1885
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,120
It's just like, it's a mediocre reboot to the franchise.

1886
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,680
Just go back to what you did well in Pro Skater and just keep pumping those out.

1887
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:36,320
I mean, I don't care how unrealistic it is, I want to grind on the moon or something like

1888
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,320
that.

1889
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,320
I mean, that would be awesome.

1890
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,680
There was a comment from Chad, did we miss Final Fantasy 13 in the release date?

1891
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,800
You know what, it's very possible because I believe that's releasing on a day all its

1892
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,800
own, right?

1893
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,320
And I was only looking at the December 3rd dates.

1894
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,840
When is Final Fantasy 13 out in Japan?

1895
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,840
I don't remember.

1896
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,840
I know it's out in December.

1897
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,840
Let me look up.

1898
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,840
I'm looking up its release date real quick to see if I did miss it for this week.

1899
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,680
Why don't we get into the next story?

1900
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,680
I'll come back to that.

1901
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,680
Okay.

1902
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,680
Okay.

1903
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
So...

1904
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,680
December 17th.

1905
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,680
There you go.

1906
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,680
So we still have a couple weeks.

1907
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,320
Weighs off.

1908
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,640
I don't know why you play this game other than for charity, and that's what's been done

1909
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,520
on the Desert Bus for Charity, an annual event where they play the horrible, horrible game

1910
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,280
that's part of the Penn & Teller game, and they have raised over $100,000.

1911
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:34,720
In fact, they have raised $132,568.94, which is 88% over last year's total, and this is

1912
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:42,640
a marathon that's a project of the, I guess, a comedy troupe Load Ready Run, and of course

1913
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,320
this benefits the Child's Play charity.

1914
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,320
That's kinda cool.

1915
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:59,760
And apparently 88 hours of driving booked by the pre-event donations.

1916
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,120
But now it's not just one guy that has to do the whole thing, right?

1917
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,160
They kinda, it's like a comedy, people do the whole thing.

1918
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,240
I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to tune into the whole thing, although I read

1919
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,280
about it and I thought it was cool, but you know, there's lots and lots of Child's Play

1920
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,840
events going on, including Um Wild's coming up, you know, we had SEGA on the show a couple

1921
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:22,040
weeks ago, and that's coming up, God, it's not next week, but the week after, it's coming

1922
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,240
up around soon, but certainly try to support Child's Play wherever you can.

1923
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,760
I know we also made a donation as a show to another drive that was going on earlier.

1924
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:35,480
It wasn't for Child's Play, but for a hospital in Texas, so good stuff.

1925
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,120
What do we do in our charity marathon?

1926
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,240
When we have a day off that isn't-

1927
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,760
I'm not playing that game, though, that's for sure.

1928
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,160
No, no, we won't play that game, but we gotta do our own spin on charity marathon, find

1929
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,160
a good charity.

1930
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,520
We still need to do the classic game stuff.

1931
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,800
Dan and I were talking about busting out the Master System today.

1932
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,340
That's what I'm saying, we need to do our classic game marathon for charity, where we

1933
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,520
let like, donators pick the games or something.

1934
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:03,880
Well, here's what I think we should do for that, is I pick like, six or seven of my systems

1935
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:10,640
that'll be easy to shift out or whatever, and then put up a list of like, twelve games

1936
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,800
each.

1937
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,800
So someone can say, you know, spin a wheel, you get like a twister wheel, okay, you get

1938
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:23,120
this system, and then spin a wheel again for the number on the list, and then oh, you get

1939
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:28,800
this game, you know, make it all completely random, and go, new game, move, next seat,

1940
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,800
move down.

1941
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,560
You know, so you kind of like musical chairs, but with games.

1942
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:37,000
Well, like, you know, the Mad Hatter, new cup, move down, new game, move down.

1943
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,440
Sadly, you know, usually what would be a great weekend for me is Martin Luther King weekend,

1944
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,240
because I have a holiday there, I don't know if you guys do.

1945
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,240
I do.

1946
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,000
I mean, Jamie works for a bank, so she has everything off, but sadly, I'm going to Seattle

1947
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
that weekend.

1948
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I have Arbor Day off.

1949
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
No, I don't.

1950
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Arbor Day?

1951
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I'm kidding.

1952
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,200
So you can go out and plant a tree, like John Denver told us to, I mean, is that what you're

1953
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,200
doing?

1954
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Well, John Denver also, you know, flew a plane.

1955
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,080
Said he was leaving on a jet plane, and he did.

1956
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,080
That was so awful.

1957
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:06,280
I mean, I love it, but it was really awful.

1958
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,640
It was definitely, like, when they say tragic irony, I think that's exactly what they meant.

1959
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:15,680
It wasn't really a jet plane, it was a little prop plane, wasn't it?

1960
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Whatever.

1961
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,760
If he had been leaving on a jet plane, he probably wouldn't have crashed.

1962
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,760
Alright, let's move on.

1963
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,880
Now we're making John Denver jokes.

1964
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,880
I don't know.

1965
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,880
You started it.

1966
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,880
Uh-uh.

1967
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,880
You're, you're, whatever.

1968
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,280
Alright, hey, every week here on the show, we like to do a little segment here pretty

1969
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,280
regularly.

1970
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,520
We've done it for, gosh, over a year now.

1971
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,560
It used to be, like, the website of the week, then it turned into, like, the Dark Soccer's

1972
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,360
Advice column, and now it's the classic game of the week.

1973
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,200
I kind of miss doing the website of the week, though.

1974
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,320
I do kind of miss it, too, but this is really, this is way more fun.

1975
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,280
Well, if I was going to do another one, though, I'd do Weebles again, can make that a third

1976
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,280
time.

1977
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,080
I'm sorry, I love Weebles.

1978
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,920
So moving on, it's now the classic video game of the week, where Dark Sakura digs through

1979
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,720
the classic game archive she was previously speaking of, and picks out a game that she

1980
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,720
says, you know what?

1981
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,160
The kids need to play this game.

1982
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,460
They need to respect their elders, and they need to dust off their NESs, or whatever it

1983
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,800
happens to be, and go play this game.

1984
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,000
So Dark Sakura, what is the game that, uh, is the classic game of the week?

1985
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,780
A game that pisses me off sometimes.

1986
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:15,880
Little Nemo Dream Master.

1987
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,440
It's a cute game, but it pisses me off.

1988
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,440
Why does it piss you off?

1989
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,040
It's kind of hard.

1990
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,040
I mean, kind of hard.

1991
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,640
I mean, it's got some levels that are easy, it's just you have to be kind of tricky and

1992
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,640
know your way around.

1993
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:32,560
But, the music, though, I have to say, um, was actually composed by, um, Junko Tomie,

1994
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,640
who was in the game as Gonzo.

1995
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:45,800
I always laughed at that, now I know her name, but play a little bit of the music.

1996
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
Isn't that good music?

1997
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Yeah, but it's very Capcom.

1998
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:56,560
One thing about Junko Tomie is that she also did the music in Bionic Commando, and, um,

1999
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:05,600
in uh, Strider, actually, so, uh, those are two notable games that had fantastic music.

2000
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,840
Oh, and, uh, Gunsmoke.

2001
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:19,800
But um, back to Little Nemo, in Japan it was called Pajama Hero Nemo, which is pretty cute.

2002
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,480
It's actually based off of the Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland, the animated movie,

2003
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:31,880
actually, that came out based off of the comic strip from the early, I believe the original

2004
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,700
comic strip came out in, I want to say, the 1920s?

2005
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:39,760
I've seen, actually, an original compilation of the Little Nemo books.

2006
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:46,560
Okay, no, sorry, I take that back, 1905 was when the, um, the comic series first started

2007
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:52,640
in 1905, and then went on through, um, 1914.

2008
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,680
The books that I saw were published in the 1920s.

2009
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,520
Anyway, that's another thing, because you know me and book publishing, I'm all into

2010
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,520
that.

2011
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:09,000
So, going back to this, um, it's about a little boy who, um, goes into his magical dream world

2012
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,760
called Slumberland, and he can, um, actually, uh, ride little animals, and he, what you

2013
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,920
do is you actually, uh, feed them candy, and then they will, uh, let you ride them.

2014
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:26,520
Like, you actually not necessarily ride them, but you sort of become them a little bit,

2015
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,880
like, you wear them like a, like Mario's, um, Tanooki suit.

2016
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,920
That's a good, a good description.

2017
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,600
I have to be honest, Jamie, I, I remember hearing about this game when I was a kid,

2018
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,200
like, I think I saw the commercials, but I never played it.

2019
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,640
So now that I'm kind of watching the video here that the music's coming off of, you know,

2020
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,120
it's kind of interesting, like, it definitely has that whole, like, the different suits

2021
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,160
of Mario, but it's different.

2022
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,360
Like, I can't explain it, you just kind of have to play it yourself, I guess, or check

2023
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,360
out one of the videos of it.

2024
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,680
Like, you know, right now he's kind of riding a dinosaur, which kind of reminds me of something

2025
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,680
in Adventure Island.

2026
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,600
I love, I love the dinosaur, but see, now you, for certain abilities that you get with

2027
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:06,280
some suits or some animals, you lose other, like, for example, you see, he could, like,

2028
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,760
for example, the frog or, I think it's either a frog or a dragon or something, but he can

2029
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:19,920
do, like, a belly sla-, uh, like a belly splash move, and land on them, and, um, and he, if

2030
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,640
his belly lands on the creatures, then he can actually knock them out of the sky, you

2031
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,840
know, to damage, um, I think that's the creature on the thing.

2032
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,360
Yeah, it looks like a little, like, kind of gecko-looking thing.

2033
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,840
Yeah, but he can, he can pop them.

2034
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:38,080
Um, but, like, you can get a mole and you can dig or you can get a gorilla and punch

2035
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,840
them, or climb up the walls.

2036
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,800
The purple little lizard thing, I think it's like a, a salamander or something, but it

2037
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,080
can walk up walls, you know, like a lizard can.

2038
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:55,360
Um, but it is a side-scrolling, um, you know, it's an NES title, it's, you know, really

2039
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,760
cute, it actually has some pretty big levels.

2040
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:03,560
The whole way that you get through it is you actually find these keys, and, um, the keys

2041
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:08,120
unlock a certain number of locks on the door, and so, of course, if you get to the end of

2042
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,360
the level and you don't have all the keys, you have to go back through the level and

2043
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,360
find the keys.

2044
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,360
Oh, good lord.

2045
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,760
And, and, as you were watching some of this, they actually are hidden, like, you had to

2046
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,280
actually, in the first level, if you get the mole, you actually have to go all the way

2047
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:28,720
over as far as you can through the dirt to the left and then go down through the floor

2048
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:35,720
to where two, uh, little blocks of, uh, of, uh, area that you can dig through to get underneath

2049
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:40,840
to another place where you get the key and a one-up and some other crap.

2050
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:51,960
Um, so, uh, you have to have the right animals to get to some places, but if you don't really

2051
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:58,880
have, you know, everything, and on top of that, um, your animals have different life

2052
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,120
bars than Nemo does, so sometimes you have to, you know, really be judicious with what

2053
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,960
you have to make it through.

2054
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:12,000
So actually, it's, I'd have to say it's one of the harder NES games there are, and it's

2055
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,540
a cute game.

2056
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:16,480
You know what this game kind of reminds me of, just kind of looking at it, again, you

2057
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,480
know, I, I missed this game, maybe I need to go back and play this, it's my classic

2058
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,760
game of the week, it reminds me, and again, it's probably because they're both Capcom,

2059
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,680
but the skeleton of the game and the programming looks very similar to DuckTales to me.

2060
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,300
Oh yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.

2061
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:33,440
Just the graphics and the way it's kind of laid out looks like, you know, same engine,

2062
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,720
quote unquote, if you want to say, as DuckTales.

2063
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:41,960
Yeah, I would, I would, I would go that, but, um, in, again, like you said, it was released

2064
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:47,400
by Capcom, the year that it came out was in 1990, so I was actually just starting high

2065
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,400
school.

2066
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,400
Yeah, I know.

2067
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Actually, no, no, I was in eighth grade.

2068
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,880
Yeah, no, you would graduate eighth grade.

2069
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:04,200
And I remember having a fit over this game, I had it, um, when it came out, and I would

2070
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,760
just, I don't think, I think this is actually one game to this day I haven't beaten.

2071
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:13,480
So that's an indication, and I've beaten a lot of games.

2072
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,760
Once again, Jamie, a very popular pick in our chat room, at least those that have played

2073
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,480
it, but a lot of folks agreeing with you on the difficulty that it was a bitch.

2074
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:25,840
I agree with, um, Ricky Go Mac that, um, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES,

2075
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,040
that game was freaking difficult too.

2076
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:32,920
That game pissed me off to the point that I wanted to throw it down the stairs, and

2077
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,400
I did, and actually it lived through it, and I could still play it.

2078
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,360
Um, that was actually one game I had that was duct taped.

2079
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,360
Nice.

2080
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,760
So you'll have to do that another week.

2081
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,240
That's a different game altogether.

2082
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,600
No, that game is not going to make it on my list.

2083
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,600
That game is not going to make it on my list, because to this day, I'm still angry.

2084
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,120
Angry, Rob, angry.

2085
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:58,680
I'm thinking one day we need to do the anti-classic game of the week, the game that Dark Saga

2086
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,680
says, do not play this game, it's terrible.

2087
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,960
I could tell you what that is right now, I'll go ahead and mention it right now.

2088
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,520
I guess we're done with Little Nemo then?

2089
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,520
Yeah.

2090
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,680
Okay, Little Nemo, the Dream Master, your classic game of the week on the NES, there

2091
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,680
you go.

2092
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:15,480
There's a game that is so bad that Dan and I rented it from Blockbuster, because we were

2093
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,440
really into renting games every week, this was about right before the Dreamcast came

2094
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,440
out.

2095
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,480
So, around 98, 99.

2096
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:27,400
Um, we rented, we were also into wrestling games at the time, because, um, the, uh, Wrestle

2097
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:32,240
Mania 2000 came out on the Nintendo 64, which was rad.

2098
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:42,640
We, um, got, uh, NW Thunder, and, um, we got it home, we played it for about 10 minutes

2099
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:47,640
and called Blockbuster and said, we just rented this game about, uh, 30 minutes ago, because

2100
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:52,560
you know we had to drive back, um, we think, we want, we want our money back, or can we

2101
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,300
rent it, can we change it out for something else?

2102
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,560
And we went in there, and the guy's like, oh yeah, I remember you, if it's that bad,

2103
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,660
then yeah, we'll change it out.

2104
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:04,040
It was so bad that Blockbuster let us change out our rental.

2105
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,040
And that's, well, that's just good customer service, you know, too.

2106
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,040
But, but it was, it was-

2107
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,480
They probably, probably wasn't the first time they clapped.

2108
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,760
I kept Spice World longer than that game, Rob.

2109
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,760
I loved Spice World.

2110
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:13,880
And yes, I rented Spice World.

2111
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,680
There was some lulzy moments in Spice World.

2112
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,360
You just make baby Spice do backflips over and over, it's really funny.

2113
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:29,080
I've bought games that are arguably bad games, and I liked them better than, than that game.

2114
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,360
That's probably the worst game I've ever rented.

2115
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,600
I would say the worst video game experience I've ever had, since now we've started this

2116
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,800
new topic, and Loki, I'm coming to you next, the worst video game experience I've probably

2117
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,960
ever had was when I got, um, Tetris Plus on the Playstation 1.

2118
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,280
What a colossal let down that game was, because Tetris was so huge at the time, you know,

2119
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,320
especially on the NES, and I think everybody very fondly remembers that game, and it's

2120
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,840
been done very well on many platforms.

2121
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,500
The DS has an awesome version of Tetris.

2122
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,600
Even Tengen Tetris is pretty good and kind of reminiscent of the arcade version, but

2123
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,560
I'll tell you what, Tetris Plus, which was by, and I remember to this day, Jellico, did

2124
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:09,200
it on the Playstation 1, and it is horrific.

2125
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,600
It is bad, it is terrible, because they changed the game mechanic of Tetris.

2126
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,960
It was one of those things where I spent, like, I bought it, because I was like, oh,

2127
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,840
it's Tetris, how can it be bad?

2128
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,840
I hated it.

2129
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,420
I played it once, and I said, how can you fuck with the main game mechanic of Tetris?

2130
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:25,440
Because what they did, is they changed it so it was like a little professor that would

2131
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,720
walk along the top, and you didn't want him to hit the side.

2132
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,720
I remember that!

2133
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Oh my god, that was awful!

2134
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,720
Yes.

2135
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,720
It was a terrible, terrible game.

2136
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
That was hideous!

2137
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,840
Yes.

2138
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,840
Thank you.

2139
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,840
I'm not alone.

2140
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,840
You know what?

2141
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,840
That deserves, um...

2142
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,960
Yeah, I need to, I need to fire up the Price is Right losing horn.

2143
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,960
Alright.

2144
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,960
Or a Dalek.

2145
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,720
Yeah, that game is an enemy of the Daleks.

2146
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:52,400
Loki, traumatically bad video game experience, anything you can remember?

2147
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,400
Not really.

2148
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,400
Um...

2149
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,400
No.

2150
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,160
There's not really anything horribly bad that I played.

2151
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:03,400
I always used to find some sort of good out of it, I guess.

2152
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,080
Well, aren't you just like the Mother Teresa of video games?

2153
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,080
I don't know.

2154
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:11,920
Um, there was a game, though it's not that old, that I bought and then sold back like

2155
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,680
within a day, and that would be Bullet Witch, because that game is awful.

2156
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,680
I have another bad game.

2157
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,720
Okay, one more, and then we're gonna go to break.

2158
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,080
Dragon Ball GT Final Battle, actually.

2159
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,400
What was so terrible about that?

2160
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,400
Everything.

2161
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,920
Um, I was, okay, keep in mind, it was like the first Dragon Ball game that came out in

2162
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:35,840
the US, unless you want to count, um, what the Dragon Ball RPG that they made into something

2163
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:42,920
else over here, which doesn't count, um, it was, it had the awful, awful American voice

2164
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,320
acting, and it was just hideous.

2165
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:51,240
But the one problem with that game is that I didn't realize it until a little bit later,

2166
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:55,280
that because it was out of print, and they only made a few copies, that that game was

2167
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,640
going for bucks on eBay, and you know what I did?

2168
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,240
I traded it for Blue Stinger.

2169
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:03,840
The Japanese version, because I had the Japanese Dreamcast at the time.

2170
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,920
And honestly, to this day, I still never regret it.

2171
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:07,920
Never regret it.

2172
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,000
I mean, it would have been nice to have gotten some money out of it, but I still don't regret

2173
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
the trade.

2174
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,360
I loved Blue Stinger.

2175
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,520
Isn't that Twinbee or something?

2176
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,720
No, Stinger was Twinbee.

2177
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:24,360
Blue Stinger was the game that came out, the Japanese version of that one was sort of lauded

2178
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:31,960
because it had, um, a movie director directing the cameras and cinematics in the movie, not

2179
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,800
in the movie, in the game, but when it came out over here, they butchered the camera.

2180
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,280
Because people were like, oh, you can't control it, and I did just fine.

2181
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,200
It was a little kind of survival horror type of game, but it was a lot of fun.

2182
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,200
I loved it.

2183
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,200
All right.

2184
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,200
Well, we're going to take a break, guys.

2185
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:50,400
We're going to rest our voices here a minute and, you know, refill our waters and run to

2186
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,520
the restroom and all that good stuff, but when we come back on Orange Lounge Radio,

2187
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,040
we're going to get into Part B. We've got plenty more news for you guys tonight, a lot

2188
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:00,000
of rapid-fire news, including some updates on Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2, and so

2189
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
forth.

2190
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And then we're going to get into some other stories.

2191
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,920
We're going to talk Tron in Part B. I know, so definitely stay tuned for that.

2192
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:10,600
Does that mean when we start Part B, I can just go greetings programs?

2193
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,080
If you really want to, and at the end, you can say end of line.

2194
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,960
In fact, at the very end of tonight's show, I want you to say end of line.

2195
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,960
Okay?

2196
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Can we do that?

2197
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,960
Yeah.

2198
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,960
Like after the credits and everything?

2199
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,960
Yeah.

2200
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,960
End of line.

2201
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,960
We should do it before the credits.

2202
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:24,960
All right.

2203
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,960
Fine.

2204
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:26,960
We'll do it that way.

2205
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:27,960
All right.

2206
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,960
And a proper sequel to Puzzle Quest.

2207
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,960
Not Galactrix, but something else.

2208
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,960
We're going to talk all that in Part B.

2209
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
So stay tuned, guys.

2210
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:40,640
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2211
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,880
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2212
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,240
We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 29th of 2009.

2213
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,880
We hope all our listeners here in America had a great Thanksgiving holiday.

2214
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,960
And if you decided to brave the Black Friday shopping, then props to you guys.

2215
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:59,760
I know our interviewer earlier tonight, he talked about going out to the old Navy to

2216
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,480
get the copy of Lego Rock Band, so I know some of you guys went out there.

2217
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:07,520
By the way, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

2218
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,760
where there's lots of great programming all throughout the week.

2219
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,640
Check out the buffet of great game programming they have here.

2220
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,640
And you know what?

2221
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:18,820
And I always say, if OLR you're finding the show just isn't your taste, hey, no harm done.

2222
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:23,080
But there might be a show that is more your taste throughout the various independent podcasters

2223
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,120
that broadcast over there at All Games Radio.

2224
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,120
So check it out.

2225
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:30,280
We're going to move on and get into some of the rapid fire news tonight.

2226
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,720
And then we'll move into Twitter topics right after that, for those of you guys who asked

2227
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,320
us questions on Twitter.

2228
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,160
And then we got some more gaming news.

2229
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:40,280
So Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid fire news?

2230
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,680
Red Dead Redemption, Take-Two's brand new game coming out, kind of think of Grand Theft

2231
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:50,740
Auto in the Old West, is set to come out actually in April 2010.

2232
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:58,040
And funny enough, on the same day as Grand Theft Auto 4 did a few years ago, April 27th,

2233
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:05,000
2010 is when you can expect that game to hit PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC.

2234
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
That's pretty sweet.

2235
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I'm looking to play that.

2236
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,640
Especially since you can probably mod this game just like you can with Grand Theft Auto,

2237
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,600
drive around in a car or something.

2238
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:21,240
Uncharted 2 is getting some new download content for the price of free.

2239
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:24,820
And that actually happened last Friday.

2240
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:30,520
And it looks like a brand new map called The Fort.

2241
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:37,800
And it's a fortress multiplayer map from a chapter of Drake's Fortune.

2242
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,440
That's kind of neat.

2243
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,640
Well may The Fort be with you.

2244
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,640
Yes.

2245
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:42,640
And it's free.

2246
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:45,480
It can't be free.

2247
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:51,440
And then finally, Valve is selling some Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead themed greeting

2248
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,080
cards.

2249
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,880
And those look kind of cool.

2250
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,440
I wonder if those are actual greeting cards or if they're like e-cards or something like

2251
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,840
that.

2252
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:06,520
Actually they are real cards.

2253
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:13,040
So you can actually pick those up at the Valve Software Store at store.valvesoftware.com

2254
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,040
and check them out.

2255
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:17,400
They are a little pricey.

2256
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,600
Looks like 16 bucks.

2257
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,200
And I'm not sure how many get in that.

2258
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:26,640
But there's a lot of other neat stuff in there as well.

2259
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:29,120
How many portal jokes in the Christmas cards?

2260
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,120
None.

2261
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,120
Really?

2262
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,120
Zero portal jokes.

2263
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,120
Okay.

2264
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,120
Alright.

2265
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,840
Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news I have for you guys.

2266
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,680
There's a whole lot of Rock Band news going on.

2267
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,360
There usually is because every week they try to add something new.

2268
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,680
And this week there's more Nirvana coming to the 360 Wii and PS3.

2269
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,580
Come As You Are, the MTV Unplugged version, which I think is kind of interesting, is coming

2270
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:54,240
out for Rock Band as well as Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit, finally, all in Nirvana

2271
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,900
Pack 2.

2272
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:57,560
Also the band Night Ranger.

2273
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,320
You can still rock in America.

2274
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,360
Don't Tell Me You Love Me and you're going to hear it from me.

2275
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,360
Night Ranger.

2276
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,360
Yeah.

2277
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,360
You're going to hear it from me.

2278
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,360
Hey.

2279
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:09,240
The member of Night Ranger was in Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent.

2280
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,240
Wow.

2281
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,240
Wow.

2282
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:18,000
The Rock Band platform, by the way, now has over 1,000 songs, 390 different musical artists.

2283
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,080
Apparently we have collectively downloaded over 60 million songs from the Rock Band store.

2284
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,200
Somebody's making a shitload of money.

2285
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,480
105 consecutive weeks of new additions to the store.

2286
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,280
Hey, that's pretty impressive.

2287
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,060
And they actually did some math and figured out that if you wanted to play through the

2288
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:39,240
entire catalog, that would take two days, 18 hours, and 40 minutes to play through the

2289
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,320
entire catalog, which I think I wanted to read some.

2290
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,560
I thought I read somewhere some guy was doing for charity.

2291
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,560
Yeah.

2292
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,360
I saw the whole damn catalog.

2293
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,360
Good luck to you.

2294
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,680
Try not to fail on some of those hard songs.

2295
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:55,720
Also the Rock Band Network is being announced that it will finally fully roll out in early

2296
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:56,720
2010.

2297
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,600
You might remember that this is a XNA of sorts.

2298
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,820
I guess that's the best comparison I can make to it so that anybody could get their songs

2299
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,920
in Rock Band through the Rock Band Network.

2300
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,880
And apparently this is going to roll out in 2010.

2301
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,720
So that 1,000 is going to jump up to 2,000 pretty damn quickly when this thing is released.

2302
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,720
Very interesting.

2303
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:16,800
Switching gears here a little bit, Atari is now rolling out arcade games on their web

2304
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,800
page.

2305
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,440
What I mean by that, if you want to go play Yars' Revenge or other great 2,600 games and

2306
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,680
things that Atari was known for back in the day before they made Driver 3 and all this

2307
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,920
stuff, you can head on over to Atari.com.

2308
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:28,920
It's a brand new website.

2309
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:32,280
Looks like it also tracks high scores and things like that.

2310
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,960
Kind of what GameTap was doing back when they were really good.

2311
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:41,480
Oh, by the way, the games you can play there on Atari, you can play Asteroids, Adventure,

2312
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:45,800
Battlezone, Crystal Castles, Lunar Lander, and yes, Yars' Revenge.

2313
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,800
There you go.

2314
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,840
By the way, I used to love Crystal Castles.

2315
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,640
That was the best game ever.

2316
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,640
Good stuff.

2317
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,280
I didn't like the Atari 2,600 version though, nearly as much as the arcade.

2318
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,280
I know.

2319
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,840
I think you'll like it for one thing.

2320
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,120
We've got a trackball.

2321
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,400
That's the way it's meant to be played.

2322
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,600
We've got a 2,600 trackball.

2323
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:09,880
Lastly, some game controller Christmas tree ornaments are available.

2324
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:13,040
I guess they're making their way around the different game blogs.

2325
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:17,200
You can get them, it looks like, at ponoko.com, P-O-N-O-K-O dot com.

2326
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,280
It's $25 plus $10 for shipping or more if it's somewhere else.

2327
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,200
You can get some various game controller themed.

2328
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:28,840
It looks like there's an old school NES controller and a Wiimote, Dreamcast controller, gettin'

2329
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:32,240
the love, and of course, where would you be without a DualShock controller?

2330
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:36,600
All of that is there in the game controller Christmas tree for those of you that are gonna

2331
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,600
be decorating.

2332
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,200
DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?

2333
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,200
Stuff.

2334
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,880
Actually, I've got good stuff.

2335
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:52,840
Well, kind of good stuff because there actually is a statement by Harada Katsuhiro, who is

2336
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:58,200
the producer behind Tekken 6, say that there's gonna have more content on its way, download

2337
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:06,480
content, but that they're not going to charge for it or they don't intend to charge for

2338
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,480
it.

2339
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:15,000
There could be, and this is a quote, strong possibility of additional download content.

2340
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,520
But then again, they've said that before and have kind of lied.

2341
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:21,520
That's true.

2342
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,520
Didn't they say like, oh no.

2343
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,800
We didn't put Darth Vader in the Xbox Soul Calibur.

2344
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,760
Oh no, we didn't do that.

2345
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,760
Guess what?

2346
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,760
Psych.

2347
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,760
Duh, duh, duh.

2348
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,760
Right.

2349
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Okay.

2350
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,680
Well also, about the games convention online, you remember that?

2351
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,640
They're doing another.

2352
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:43,520
And it will be from July 8th through 11th, 2010 at the Leibseger Messe in Germany.

2353
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,080
I hope I pronounced that right.

2354
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,880
I took German for two weeks, sorry.

2355
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:55,720
But they got 43,000 attendees last year, so they're hoping that with another day they

2356
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,000
can get more.

2357
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,440
So hey, good for them.

2358
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:05,360
And lastly, and this is something I'm pretty happy about, Bayonetta demo.

2359
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:10,040
We should be getting it in Europe and North America on December 3rd.

2360
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,960
And that will be freaking fantastic.

2361
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,280
Little Birdie told me you can get it early if you know where to look.

2362
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,280
Really?

2363
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:22,960
I think it was through gamespot.com, if you're like a member over there, you can get a code

2364
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,360
generated, something like that, for the demo.

2365
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,580
I haven't had a chance to check it out myself, because again, I got a BORT 360 that I've

2366
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,580
been too lazy to replace.

2367
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:35,320
See, this, folks, is why you need to create a Japanese region account, so that you can

2368
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:41,840
download these region-free demos to your, you know, 360 or Playstation 3 way early.

2369
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,520
I have one for every region on the Playstation 3, and I have one for Japanese in the US and

2370
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,400
my 360.

2371
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,400
Just putting it out there.

2372
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,240
Anyhow, let's move on to some Twitter topics, and some things that you guys are asking us

2373
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:53,240
on the Twitter.

2374
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,840
Of course, if you don't already have us on Twitter, you should really consider adding

2375
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,840
us.

2376
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:01,520
www.Twitter.com slash OLR, and we always take messages before every show, starting off with

2377
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,440
Spazinator tonight.

2378
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,640
How about a discussion of some of the better PC exclusives out there?

2379
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,580
Must Owns, for example, Recommendations.

2380
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:14,120
With me getting a PC not too long from now, I'd like to know what to get above and beyond

2381
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,120
WoW.

2382
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:18,360
Bummer, because WoW would have been the first thing I suggested it would be, but, you know,

2383
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,800
a lot of MMOs, we haven't really seen console MMOs.

2384
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,040
Granted, Final Fantasy XI, I know the PS3 has some in development.

2385
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,720
This spring, there's going to be a lot of stuff in the spring, supposedly, unless it,

2386
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,600
you know, gets delayed again.

2387
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:35,760
But right now, you know, the Guild Wars, the City of Heroes, the Ion, the Champions, the

2388
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,240
Star Trek Online, none of those are on the console, nor are they going to be on the console.

2389
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,960
So, you know, all those types of MMOs.

2390
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,720
Just a lot of stuff in the pipes, just not quite out yet.

2391
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:47,840
Loki, anything you can think of as far as PC games, though?

2392
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,320
As far as PC MMOs?

2393
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:53,400
No, just PC games in general that are exclusive that you can't get on the console.

2394
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:59,600
Command and Conquer 4, I think, is going to be exclusively on PC at first, at least.

2395
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,360
I'm not positive on that, but I know that's coming out in the fall, and I haven't heard

2396
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:07,160
about a console version yet.

2397
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:10,760
X-Link suggests Civilization 4, and I give that a hell yes.

2398
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:15,760
The Civilization series is outstanding, and they did do, like, kind of a dumbed-down version

2399
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,480
of Civilization called Civ Revolution for the Xbox 360 and PS3, although I will say

2400
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,040
Civ Revolution I liked.

2401
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:26,440
It kind of reminded me of the very first Civilization game, so when I say dumbed-down, I don't mean

2402
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,880
that in a negative way.

2403
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,820
If you like that game, definitely Civ 4.

2404
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:35,960
That's a great suggestion from X-Link in our chat room, so.

2405
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,880
Let's move on to some other questions.

2406
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:42,440
I like this one from Fernando on Twitter, and this is a good one for Loki.

2407
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:47,920
Will there ever be an installment of Grand Theft Auto where you play a female, and would

2408
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,000
it sell?

2409
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:57,960
I think it would, and I hope there is, because hell, they've done it with Saints Row, where

2410
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:04,320
you can play as a female character throughout that game, and it works pretty well.

2411
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:08,160
You may remember before when people were putting out fake screenshots for Grand Theft Auto

2412
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:12,400
4, it had a female wheeling a mace, and that looked pretty awesome.

2413
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,720
I don't see why it couldn't happen.

2414
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,200
Yeah, I don't see why not either.

2415
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,720
I think it's just as long as they can work it into the story, so maybe in the next one,

2416
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:19,720
who knows?

2417
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,720
Yeah.

2418
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,720
Or a future expansion for 4, although, or are they going to say no more?

2419
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,880
They're not going to do any more expansions for 4.

2420
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,560
If anything, what they're going to do now is, like, a Vice City or something like that

2421
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:31,480
using the same engine, but just slightly tweaked, but they have Red Dead Redemption that they're

2422
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:35,720
going to put out first and probably tweak their engine a little bit more.

2423
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:40,680
If you want to see that, dude, I would say email them, but you know what I got to say?

2424
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:46,200
I think Rockstar's been pretty decent about kind of an equal opportunity, if you will.

2425
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:50,280
I'm sure they're about the story and the art they're trying to go for first, and if they

2426
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:54,520
can work it in for a female protagonist, they will.

2427
01:51:54,520 --> 01:52:03,840
Moving on, let's see, looking at this one from Tigerclaw, Nathan Drake gets supersized

2428
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,640
for Thanksgiving weekend and sends us this over.

2429
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:13,640
Apparently, the Uncharted developers made Nathan Drake look fat during Thanksgiving.

2430
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,640
That's kind of funny.

2431
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,300
They made him gain a few pounds there.

2432
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,200
Was that something that was actually in the game, or is that just screenshots?

2433
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,120
No, I guess that's just something they rendered, those screenshots.

2434
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,920
That wasn't actually in the game, or what have you.

2435
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,120
That would be funny, like if you played it on Thanksgiving, that would happen.

2436
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,240
That would be kind of funny, actually.

2437
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,600
So that's pretty cool.

2438
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,840
Yeah, it's just the screenshots there on the website.

2439
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,840
That's kind of funny.

2440
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,240
Sorry if we didn't read your tweets tonight, but remember, you can always email us too

2441
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,240
at mailbagatorangelandtrady.com.

2442
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:43,360
We'll be getting into the mailbag a little later in the show, and Tigerclaw wants to

2443
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,500
point out it's for multiplayer.

2444
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,500
So that's kind of funny.

2445
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,500
I like that.

2446
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,500
That's awesome.

2447
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,500
Yeah, that's cute.

2448
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,720
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

2449
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,200
Loki, back to you.

2450
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,200
Yes.

2451
01:52:53,200 --> 01:53:02,680
So, Obama and apparently the LittleBigPlanet team are teaming up for kids, and the White

2452
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:06,240
House, they basically announced that they're going to have a program to improve science

2453
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:11,040
and math education with a variety of different entertainment software association-backed

2454
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:19,440
initiatives, including a program to put LittleBigPlanet in libraries, as well as $300,000 in game design

2455
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,440
challenges.

2456
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,440
So that's kind of cool.

2457
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:27,120
And, I mean, hell, LittleBigPlanet, very flexible with what you can do with it, and it's supposedly

2458
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,280
pretty easy to learn.

2459
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:32,000
I still haven't actually sat down to try and make a level, even though I really wanted

2460
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
to.

2461
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
It's fucking hard.

2462
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Like, it takes a lot of dedication.

2463
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,120
It's just because we're older.

2464
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,120
That's why.

2465
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,120
Maybe.

2466
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,120
Maybe.

2467
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:43,120
But that's why, you know, I invited the gentleman on the show earlier tonight, because I know

2468
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,480
it's not easy to have that kind of dedication.

2469
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:49,520
I thought it was kind of awesome, and then, you know, to have it all take off, and so

2470
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,520
forth.

2471
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:58,720
But anyway, he said, you know, the Sony LittleBigPlanet initiative, Game Changers, is part of a $2

2472
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:05,400
million 2010 digital media and learning competition funded by the MacArthur Foundation, and involves

2473
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:10,120
Sony donating 1,000 PlayStation 3s and copies of LittleBigPlanet to libraries and community

2474
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,120
organizations.

2475
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:15,800
Participants will strive to create levels that involve science, technology, engineering,

2476
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:20,760
and math, well, engineering, health, physics, and LittleBigPlanet.

2477
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:27,640
The second program is called the STEM Nation Video Game Competition, and it's a three-pronged

2478
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:34,240
$300,000 contest encouraging entrants to create the best browser video games that teach the

2479
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:41,880
STEM disciplines for a trio of ages 4-8, 8-12, and 12-16, and the competitions intend to

2480
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:47,180
reach historically underserved populations, including girls and minority students, according

2481
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,840
to the ESA press release.

2482
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,320
So that's kind of neat.

2483
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:57,620
Kind of interesting, and this whole, especially the whole fact that video games usually get

2484
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,620
a bad rap.

2485
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:02,200
In fact, ironically, and I swear I didn't plan this, I'm wearing my ECA shirt today,

2486
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:06,200
the whole, with the controllers on it, that says, contrary to popular opinion, these do

2487
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,200
not make me a killer.

2488
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:12,080
And you know, video games get such a bad rap usually out there that, you know, games like,

2489
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:16,840
you know, Manhunt 2 are going to turn us all into murderers and all this garbage.

2490
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:21,600
And if I remember correctly, the unedited, unrated PC version came out, and the world

2491
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,600
did not end.

2492
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,160
Yeah, it really didn't.

2493
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:28,200
And so, you know, it's kind of neat to see video games kind of being embraced in this

2494
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:29,200
regard.

2495
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:33,640
So, do you think this is something that people will actually really get into, and it could

2496
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,720
be a successful program?

2497
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,720
I don't see why it can't be.

2498
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,640
I mean, hell, we had, we grew up on kind of like, um, Oregon Trail and like, Number Munchers

2499
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,640
and shit like that.

2500
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:45,200
It's just, you know, kind of an evolved version of that.

2501
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:51,960
I remember we had, um, in my fourth or fifth grade class, you know, back when, you know,

2502
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:59,200
they're introducing us to a thing called a mouse for, you know, a PC, um, you know, they

2503
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:02,720
would, you know, have a program that kind of taught you how to use it and stuff like

2504
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,720
that.

2505
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:07,680
And that's why they wouldn't do something like this where, you know, challenge people

2506
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,560
to kind of learn how to use computers and learn how to, you know, build stuff in video

2507
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:17,840
games and whatnot, um, to kind of help promote education and, you know, their agendas with

2508
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,840
the science and, um, math programs.

2509
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:23,360
So it sounds like a good idea to me.

2510
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:27,920
It's a way to, you know, reach children at a level that they're, you know, going to be

2511
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:28,920
interested in.

2512
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,200
We'll see how this program takes off.

2513
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,240
I do like the comparison to Oregon Trail and Number Bunchers though, because who doesn't

2514
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,200
remember that shit from when we were kids?

2515
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,840
And I know, I realize a lot of our listeners may not have that same memory, although I

2516
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:44,680
think the Oregon Trail kind of evolved.

2517
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:48,160
So I think they were still using it, you know, years later, but just not the old school Apple

2518
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,740
2e one that we were using.

2519
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:50,740
But uh, you know, yeah.

2520
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,880
Carmen Sandiego is another great example.

2521
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,800
I think Math Blasters was one that came around a little later.

2522
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,800
Turtle.

2523
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,800
Uh, Logo.

2524
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,800
Logo.

2525
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,800
The programming language.

2526
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,800
Yeah.

2527
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:00,800
Right?

2528
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,800
Forward 30.

2529
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,800
Right?

2530
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,800
90.

2531
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:06,200
And you know, to draw a square and all that stuff.

2532
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,200
Fun stuff.

2533
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,200
Hey Jamie.

2534
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,200
Tron.

2535
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:11,200
Tron!

2536
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:12,200
That's right.

2537
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:15,400
If you want to see more information about Tron, you're going to have to watch the VGAs.

2538
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,400
That's right.

2539
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:21,880
The Spike Video Game Awards apparently is going to have some new Tron information here.

2540
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:24,440
Uh, I guess this is not about the movie.

2541
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,440
This is about the game.

2542
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,840
The game based on the movie I think.

2543
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,840
Apparently.

2544
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,840
Yeah.

2545
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:29,840
The game that's based on the new movie.

2546
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,440
There was a little teaser that went up and it looks like the game might actually just

2547
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,720
be called Tron.

2548
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:37,880
You might remember they tried relaunching Tron a couple years ago.

2549
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,960
There was a Tron 2.0 video game I remember that came out.

2550
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,200
This was pretty awesome.

2551
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,920
It was pretty cool but it was also uh, it didn't do very well at all.

2552
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,160
Which is kind of unfortunate.

2553
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,480
Um, but yeah.

2554
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,760
Uh, there's movie sequels coming out called Tron Legacy and uh, apparently more information

2555
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,040
is going to come out at the Spike Video Game Awards.

2556
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,560
So that'll be on Saturday, December 12th.

2557
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,160
So very, very brief teaser that's hit the internet recently.

2558
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:03,280
I don't know if Jamie's seen it.

2559
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,840
I'm trying to pull it up here in studio so she can kind of get a peek here at what it

2560
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,840
looks like.

2561
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,720
Uh, I don't know if it's going to play very well here.

2562
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:14,120
But it just, you just see somebody, virus detected.

2563
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,120
And remember.

2564
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,120
Motorbikes.

2565
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,120
Light cycles Rob.

2566
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,120
Light cycles.

2567
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,120
That's it.

2568
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:24,580
And remember the Spike TV Video Game Awards, that's also your chance to vote for the most

2569
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:28,800
anticipated game where you get to write in your own choice and perhaps President Cat.

2570
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,800
That's right.

2571
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:32,400
We did try to start something on the Facebook about trying to get in and Twitter to get

2572
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,880
everybody to write in President Cat.

2573
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:37,780
So uh, hopefully, and we do hope it makes a clip package.

2574
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:41,320
That's what we're hoping for is that when they introduce who wins this award, they do

2575
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:46,000
some type of clip package for all the anticipated things and we're trying to get President.

2576
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,840
We don't think it'll win, realistically, it's not on the ballot.

2577
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:51,880
But maybe it'll make the clip package and that's really all we ask.

2578
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:57,640
We want it's 15 frames of fame on Spike TV.

2579
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:01,580
Because who, don't you want to be the one to send that tweet over to Rina Wee and let

2580
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:05,160
them know, hey, did you know your video game was on TV in America?

2581
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,440
Still been spamming it.

2582
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:11,400
All right, let's move on, Jamie, what do you got for us?

2583
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:14,440
Well um, how about some stuff about another game?

2584
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,440
Puzzle Quest.

2585
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,440
There's a sequel.

2586
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:24,400
I never played Puzzle Quest, so I couldn't really tell you anything about the sequel.

2587
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:30,400
But there is a, I actually don't really know much about Puzzle Quest.

2588
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:33,680
I thought you had played this before, the Puzzle Quest game.

2589
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:34,680
Not at all.

2590
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:35,680
Huh, okay.

2591
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,000
I played, I played Peggle.

2592
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,280
There was Galactrix that came out that was supposed to be some type of sequel to Puzzle

2593
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,760
Quest, but it wasn't really because they had this whole, it was based around hexagons.

2594
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,720
So yeah, I was looking at the screen capture going, what am I looking at?

2595
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:52,400
Which immediately, basically, it's bejeweled with, it's ye olde bejeweled, basically.

2596
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:57,600
But then that also isn't 100% fair because they, especially Puzzle Quest, had all these

2597
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:59,120
different other elements in it.

2598
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:02,520
I mean, when you first play it, you're kind of like, oh, it's bejeweled with attacks.

2599
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,760
But then you have to get into learning the spells, which was, you know, being able to

2600
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,780
clear a board.

2601
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:09,680
You had to get into sieging the towns.

2602
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:13,140
You had to get into like just all this kind of almost micromanagement that you got into

2603
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:15,920
as well, but people got really into this game.

2604
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,960
Like my roommate, who doesn't play a lot of video games, played a shit ton of Puzzle Quest.

2605
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:23,000
I think when I heard about all of that, I said, yeah, I don't want to play that.

2606
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Aww.

2607
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
My wife did too.

2608
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
That's right, yeah.

2609
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Your wife was into this too, huh?

2610
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Well, I guess now it's...

2611
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,520
I think I was also busy playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

2612
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,520
Possibly.

2613
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,720
Well, Puzzle Quest II, I guess, is now going to be a proper sequel to the game.

2614
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:40,460
So I don't know exactly what type of stuff is going to be in it, but there's an early

2615
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:44,200
screenshot that's leaked out there, and apparently the game is in development for the 360, it

2616
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,200
looks like?

2617
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,200
Yeah.

2618
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:51,360
It looks like colors and some ogres and some guy with a sword.

2619
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,120
Now it's interesting though, because there's some new icons here I haven't seen before.

2620
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:57,680
Like there's these different colored skulls, although one of them says plus three, so maybe

2621
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,880
they just changed the color.

2622
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,640
But then there's these fists, and I don't know what that's all about.

2623
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:04,560
And there's no more gold icons either, so...

2624
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,120
Maybe it means a hand comes out of the screen and punches a player in the face.

2625
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,920
That would be unfortunate.

2626
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,920
Puzzle Quest is a fun game.

2627
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,920
Galactus couldn't get into it.

2628
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,720
It was just a whole different way of thinking.

2629
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,720
So.

2630
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:15,720
There you go.

2631
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:19,160
I saw there was a Neopets one, and I just wanted to laugh.

2632
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:20,920
People still play Neopets?

2633
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:21,920
I know, right?

2634
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,920
Let me rephrase.

2635
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,920
People over 13 still play Neopets?

2636
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,920
I know, right?

2637
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,000
Loki.

2638
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,920
No one plays Neopets.

2639
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,920
It's all...

2640
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:33,920
It's all Gaia!

2641
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:34,920
All a hoax.

2642
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,200
Everyone's using Gaia now.

2643
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,400
There is a new game that sort of had a...

2644
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:46,000
I don't know if it leaked out or if it was an intentional leak or whatever.

2645
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,280
Anyways, it looked like a multiplayer version of Mercenaries, the kind of open world action

2646
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:56,280
game that was once part of Pandemic.

2647
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:03,680
Now it has been confirmed that the trailer for Mercs Inc., the brand new game, is actually

2648
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,920
legit.

2649
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:12,320
It's being developed now not by Pandemic since, well, they kind of closed, and EA Los Angeles

2650
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:17,040
is actually going to be working on that game, and it will be a multiplayer, or at least

2651
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:23,440
have multiplayer in it, and it will be kind of a sandbox game, much like the other Mercenaries

2652
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,440
games.

2653
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,800
No word exactly when it's going to come out.

2654
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,960
It's still a work in progress, and even the title's just kind of a work in progress, so.

2655
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:35,520
It's neat, and hopefully it does come out, because I like Mercenaries 2 a little bit.

2656
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,960
Granted, it was an incredibly buggy game, but that's what made it kind of fun, because

2657
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:41,680
it was so buggy.

2658
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,080
You'd like to exploit those buggy games, though.

2659
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,600
I would say as much shit as you give a game like Driver 3 here on the show, you'd love

2660
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,280
to play that game because it was so bad.

2661
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,600
And same with Mercenaries 2.

2662
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:56,480
It's just so buggy, but it's hilarious, because you'll just be watching, and you'll feel like,

2663
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,480
what just happened there?

2664
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,480
You know?

2665
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,480
I don't know.

2666
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,400
I'm reading some comments from our chat room, chat.orangetontrader.com, and there's a little

2667
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:06,760
bit of Pagle versus Puzzle Quest going on there, just a little bit.

2668
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:09,040
Rama says, Puzzle Quest got on my nerves.

2669
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,040
I sold it.

2670
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11,360
I guess the micromanaging's not for everyone.

2671
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,720
SHJ100Matt says, I've got more non-gamers hooked on Pagle than Puzzle Quest.

2672
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,600
Pagle for the win.

2673
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,660
I like Pagle.

2674
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:19,940
I liked Puzzle Quest, too.

2675
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:23,120
Pagle is my number one I'm stuck somewhere board game.

2676
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:25,380
I like Pagle, because it reminds me of Plinko.

2677
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:26,380
That's why I like Pagle.

2678
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:29,440
You know, that's actually the same thought that I had about it, too.

2679
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:32,520
Who didn't want to play Plinko whenever you watched that on The Price is Right?

2680
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,520
But Pagle is so fun.

2681
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,800
Like, I'm actually working on the challenge modes.

2682
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,800
I've beaten one of them.

2683
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:38,800
Yeah?

2684
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:39,800
Yeah.

2685
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:40,800
The extra orange.

2686
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:41,800
We've got to beat more than one.

2687
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,800
I know.

2688
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,800
Keep trying.

2689
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,800
What happened to him?

2690
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,800
After Burner Climax.

2691
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,800
Awesome game!

2692
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,480
Hey, guess what?

2693
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:53,520
Apparently it's been rated by the OFLC and also the Korean game rating board.

2694
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,680
The indication is that it might be coming to the PlayStation Network.

2695
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:01,200
The rating was applied for by Sony, so possibly this game is actually coming out to the PSN.

2696
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:04,440
But then you also have to think, well, wait a minute, because there was an OutRun game

2697
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:09,000
that was out not that long ago, and it was both systems, 360 and PSN.

2698
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,560
So don't know if this game will hit both platforms.

2699
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:13,840
I would assume it would.

2700
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:16,040
Exclusives are very few and far between these days.

2701
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:21,720
If they're going to bring, though, if they're going to bring After Burner Climax, which

2702
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:24,040
by the way, they had it at John's Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

2703
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,040
I remember that game.

2704
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,040
That was so fun.

2705
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:32,280
But, um, I would wish that they would bring out Planet Harrier.

2706
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:36,800
And by the way, for those that don't know, After Burner Climax is an arcade cabinet that's

2707
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,560
like old school After Burner.

2708
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:39,560
Except better!

2709
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:42,080
Yeah, but, you know, now it was modernized, basically.

2710
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:47,240
Well, yeah, it has like a full hydraulic seat in it that moves and turns and everything.

2711
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:50,080
Which sadly you won't be able to install in your chair, although if you're Loki, he'll

2712
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:52,120
make one out of duct tape and cardboard boxes somehow.

2713
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,320
I will not make any chairs.

2714
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:54,320
And ballpoint pens.

2715
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,360
Because you have to use a little spring as the ballpoint pen.

2716
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,360
Anyway.

2717
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:00,000
But if they can bring this out, why can't they bring out Planet Harrier?

2718
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,400
Why?

2719
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:02,400
They hate you.

2720
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:06,360
Planet Harrier, Sega!

2721
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:07,360
So check for that.

2722
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:12,740
That might be coming soon if the ratings boards are to believed, which they usually are.

2723
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:13,740
Just so you know.

2724
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:15,740
Like, are those things ever wrong?

2725
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:16,740
No.

2726
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:17,740
Redotainment's funny.

2727
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:18,740
Why?

2728
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:19,740
What?

2729
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:23,240
To quote After Burner Climax, is that what happens when Maverick ejaculates?

2730
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:28,600
I really should have had that losing horn sound queued up tonight because we've needed

2731
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,800
it several times.

2732
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:36,360
Anyhow, let's open up ye old mailbag at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is where you guys

2733
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:40,640
can email us every week with your thoughts on the program or as we've been getting lately,

2734
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:43,120
stories about your day, apparently.

2735
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:47,440
So Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag and pick some of our favorite emails and read

2736
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,440
them for you here on the show.

2737
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:50,080
So Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag?

2738
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:54,440
Well speaking of Redotainment, dear OLR, first of all, thank you for updating the podcast

2739
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,440
feed.

2740
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,840
Between these episodes, the other podcasts I listen to, the music I've recently pirated,

2741
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,320
I haven't left entertainment to last me for the rest of the year at work.

2742
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,800
What a whole month.

2743
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:08,840
Second, can you send me the link for the article from last week about the guy marrying the

2744
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:10,200
DS character?

2745
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,840
Because I call bullshit.

2746
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:18,120
A guy marrying a character from a DS game in Guam, the part about Guam alone screams

2747
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:19,120
bullshit to me.

2748
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:21,640
Now onto the reason I'm emailing.

2749
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:26,620
Recently many of us have been sick, including Sky Dark Soccer and myself.

2750
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:29,260
When you are sick at home, you need things to entertain you.

2751
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:31,120
These things can include video games.

2752
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,920
What video games do you suggest for someone who is sick at home?

2753
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,180
This game should preferably need little input, doesn't agitate you much, and can be frequently

2754
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:46,200
paused to enable you to visit the bathroom slash sick room on a frequent basis.

2755
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:49,000
My suggestion is to get to ride on the Xbox Live Arcade.

2756
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,160
Little input is required, it's entertaining without being agitating, and can be paused

2757
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,160
at any time.

2758
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:57,480
I say peggle on the iPhone because you can take it with you.

2759
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:03,560
I gotta be honest, when I was home for a week with Swine Flu and all that, I wasn't really

2760
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:06,180
playing video games at all.

2761
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,120
Because I didn't want to think.

2762
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,520
I watched movies.

2763
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,320
That was more my time to catch up on movies and TV shows.

2764
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:17,520
When I'm sick, really, I watch The Muppet Show.

2765
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,640
The last time I had, well remember when I had the plague?

2766
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,200
And then I thought I had Plague 2.0?

2767
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,800
But it wasn't Plague 2.0, it was just another sinus infection?

2768
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,640
I did nothing for three days but sit and eat burritos and watch The Muppet Show.

2769
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:32,440
Because I also have this thing for Mexican food when I'm sick.

2770
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:36,840
Okay, listeners, I've gotta ask her, did you see the Bohemian Rhapsody video this week?

2771
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:37,840
No.

2772
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:38,840
Jamie.

2773
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,840
That's, I even reposted it on my Twitter.

2774
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:43,860
You need to go onto YouTube and look up Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody.

2775
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:48,200
It's an official thing that the Muppet company did this week, and it's amazing.

2776
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,520
But, but, but, but Queen.

2777
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,200
It's, it's, but it's the Muppets.

2778
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,200
It's okay.

2779
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,200
Mmm.

2780
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:55,200
You like parodies.

2781
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,200
I do.

2782
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,200
You'll like it.

2783
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,960
Okay, well, also I need a gift for someone who will be approximately five days old on

2784
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,200
Christmas Day.

2785
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,200
Diapers.

2786
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:04,200
No, no, I'm serious.

2787
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,900
I'm serious.

2788
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:08,100
Buy diapers.

2789
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,280
Buy big, big boxes of diapers.

2790
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:11,880
For a five year old?

2791
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:13,600
Five days old, Rob.

2792
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,920
Oh, five days old.

2793
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:15,920
Oh.

2794
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:21,760
The, the baby can't see shit, except maybe read, seriously, and is gonna be eating all

2795
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,600
the time and shitting.

2796
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:28,960
Buy the present, buy, eating, shitting, crying, and that's it.

2797
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:33,120
And trying to figure out what this big blur in front of its face is.

2798
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:35,200
Do a favor.

2799
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,720
Buy diapers.

2800
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,580
Buy diapers.

2801
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:40,120
For mommy.

2802
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,120
For baby.

2803
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:44,280
Because diapers are expensive and you need a lot of them.

2804
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:47,160
And I only know this because I know mommies.

2805
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:49,160
Buy diapers.

2806
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:51,360
And butt paste, just because it's funny.

2807
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:56,400
No, seriously, whenever I go, whenever I go to a baby shower, I make sure that I do like

2808
02:08:56,400 --> 02:09:00,480
a care basket and put butt paste in it, because I just want an excuse to buy something called

2809
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:01,480
butt paste.

2810
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:05,160
It makes it sound like you're, it's gonna glue it shut.

2811
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:06,160
It's for diaper ash.

2812
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:07,560
I know what it's for, but it's just funny.

2813
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,560
The name is hilarious.

2814
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,560
Butt paste.

2815
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:10,560
I mean, just the way it rolls off.

2816
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,200
Can you say it anymore on the show tonight?

2817
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,240
Rob, give it a try.

2818
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,240
Butt paste.

2819
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,240
See?

2820
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,240
Isn't that great?

2821
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:18,240
Knock knock.

2822
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,240
Who's there?

2823
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:20,240
Butt.

2824
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,240
Butt who?

2825
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,240
Butt paste.

2826
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:23,240
See, that's funny.

2827
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:24,240
No, it's not funny.

2828
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:25,240
It's just not, sorry.

2829
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:26,240
Butt paste.

2830
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:27,240
It's just hilarious.

2831
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,240
Moving on.

2832
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,240
Okay.

2833
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:33,840
This was brought to you by, oh, sorry, Stay Care Entertainment.

2834
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:37,320
This message has been brought to you by prayer, the preferred birth control method of the

2835
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,520
state of Utah.

2836
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:40,520
That's funny.

2837
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:41,520
It is hilarious.

2838
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,520
Ooh.

2839
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,520
A long one from Spazinator.

2840
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,520
Hi, folks.

2841
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:46,520
Hi, Spazinator.

2842
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:54,320
I just thought I'd send you through this email just in case I accidentally fall asleep like

2843
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:58,200
I did last week, dammit, and end up not calling as a result.

2844
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,000
I initially intended to pass the following information along to other listeners out there

2845
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,240
who have been following my situation for the past two weeks.

2846
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,920
I just thought I'd give a little detailed information.

2847
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:14,320
Well, the Monday afternoon after OLR's episode 244 aired live two weeks ago, I placed two

2848
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,960
phone calls to Sony's customer service number.

2849
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,840
The initial call, as you may have suspected, didn't go well.

2850
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,720
I had explained my situation as clearly and calmly as I could.

2851
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:30,720
After bring, oh, must be being put on hold for an insanely long time, I was told that

2852
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:32,340
they couldn't do anything for me.

2853
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:35,700
It goes without saying that this tidbit of info did not sit well with me, and I was not

2854
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,240
about to let it just drop.

2855
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:41,280
If need be, I was prepared to be a major thorn in their sides until something was done.

2856
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:45,840
A short while later, I had placed a second call to Sony and had asked to speak with a

2857
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:46,840
supervisor.

2858
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:51,440
The customer service rep that initially answered the call took down some basic info and connected

2859
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:55,320
me with a supervisor who, if I remember correctly, was named Gerald.

2860
02:10:55,320 --> 02:11:00,560
Can I just intervene real quick and say, usually when you get put on hold for a long length

2861
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:03,360
of time, and you would know this too, Jamie, I know you worked in a call center for a while

2862
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,920
and I trained for one and a half for many years.

2863
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:09,080
Usually it's not because they just want to sit there and not do anything while they have

2864
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,080
you on hold.

2865
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,240
Usually they don't know the answer or they're trying to find out.

2866
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:15,640
That's usually why you're on hold for so long, not all the time, but usually.

2867
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:21,120
No, well, I'll tell you, where I worked, we actually would have, and reps would be marked

2868
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:27,840
down for this, that they'd have a two-minute hold time maximum, and, well, we don't do

2869
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,000
it like that anymore, but we used to have a training queue that we would answer training

2870
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,720
calls to our reps on the phone, or we would also take the escalated calls, you know, the

2871
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:39,360
pissed off people, which I loved.

2872
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:40,360
I was good at it.

2873
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:47,360
But anyway, we, but we'd always go back and say, hey, you've had this person on hold for

2874
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,560
this long, go let them know that you're still talking to somebody.

2875
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,400
Yeah, and any call center I've been in contact with has a very similar policy.

2876
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:57,160
Sony probably doesn't need one, because customer service probably isn't their top priority.

2877
02:11:57,160 --> 02:12:00,240
Hate to say it, but, you know, they don't need it.

2878
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,840
Sadly, they're the only people to make the PS3, you know, customer service is not probably

2879
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:06,480
their forte, although.

2880
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:13,120
But in some cases, too, like when I was actually on the floor doing calls, I would actually

2881
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:17,320
run and go to the source of something, which we weren't technically supposed to do, but

2882
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:20,800
I knew everybody in the other department, so sometimes you may have just someone who's

2883
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:23,200
in the know and knows where to go to find out what you need.

2884
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:26,240
So give them the benefit of the doubt.

2885
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:27,240
Right.

2886
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,240
However, moving forward.

2887
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:32,960
Again, for what seemed like the trillionth time, I explained as clearly as I could in

2888
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:36,880
detail what the situation was and conveyed how upset I was that I no longer was able

2889
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,320
to use the content that I had paid tons of money for.

2890
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:44,080
I also mentioned how aggravated I was due to how previous calls went.

2891
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:47,640
Ultimately, the supervisor agreed to allow me to redownload my paid content, again, as

2892
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:49,240
a one-time deal.

2893
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:52,280
He also made a point to mention that it would take a few days for everything to fully show

2894
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,880
up on my download queue due to two factors.

2895
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:59,560
One, I had bought a lot of stuff, and two, they had to go through it all and reauthorize

2896
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:03,040
it manually as soon as the state was going to take some time.

2897
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:06,360
Considering all that, I had profusely thanked the supervisor and told him that I was thankful

2898
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,360
for this.

2899
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:12,120
Ultimately, everything started showing up on my list late Tuesday night, which I started

2900
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,120
downloading.

2901
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:15,320
The first wave basically took all day to fully download.

2902
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:18,720
The second wave occurred roughly at the same time the following night, and again took a

2903
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:21,400
considerable amount of time, even with high-speed cable.

2904
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:25,560
Needless to say, two weeks later, I now have all my content back.

2905
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:26,560
That's good.

2906
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,560
Hooray.

2907
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:28,560
On...

2908
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,560
Did you...

2909
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:30,560
I was yawning, but I wanted to say hooray.

2910
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:31,560
Sorry.

2911
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,560
I wasn't yawning at the email.

2912
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,560
I promise.

2913
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:34,560
On...

2914
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:35,560
Well, I...

2915
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:38,680
On a semi-related note, I am still likely to use the service, however.

2916
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:42,960
The whole incident and subsequent frustration I've had as a result of the initial calls

2917
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:46,680
will most likely give me something to consider on a regular basis if and when I think about

2918
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:48,240
using the PSN store.

2919
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:53,440
I lucked out this time, but if, God forbid, next time, I may not necessarily be so lucky.

2920
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:55,760
So this email was just a little on the long side.

2921
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,700
Considering that, as of late, the mailbag has been a little light, I figured you three

2922
02:13:58,700 --> 02:14:00,880
wouldn't necessarily mind too much.

2923
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,800
Thanks again for your input and help in the whole situation.

2924
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,320
Believe me, it's greatly appreciated.

2925
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,880
And that's from Spaznator.

2926
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:10,920
Also, he typed this whole thing, I think, on the PlayStation browser.

2927
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,920
Wow.

2928
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,920
Or the PSP, so...

2929
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:13,920
That's impressive.

2930
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,920
So, yeah.

2931
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:15,920
Very good.

2932
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,920
Very few errors.

2933
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,920
I'm quite proud of you.

2934
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:18,920
And last email.

2935
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:23,840
Um, hey olr, sorry about, oh, this is, oh, this is from the person who didn't sign it

2936
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:24,840
again.

2937
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,840
Um, okay.

2938
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:29,320
Hey olr, sorry about last week, I didn't put my name on my email last week.

2939
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:34,920
My screen name for my Xbox and everything is DaMoney125, but I'm gonna change it, maybe,

2940
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,240
something Fallout related.

2941
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,240
Okay?

2942
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:41,480
Um, I had that screen name ever since 1998, so it's long overdue.

2943
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:42,480
You know what?

2944
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:45,480
I've had Dark Sakura since, uh, 1994.

2945
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:47,480
So I take that back.

2946
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,480
Ninety-four, no.

2947
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:49,480
Late ninety-four.

2948
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:50,480
So.

2949
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,480
Yeah.

2950
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,480
Just saying.

2951
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:57,040
I've cycled through several, but, um, I landed on Sky, and, I don't know, I kind of used

2952
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,040
that.

2953
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:00,040
But I don't really, I don't even like using online names anymore.

2954
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,040
No.

2955
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:02,040
Just call me Rob, it's fine.

2956
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:05,560
For me, it's a convenient login tool, so I can use it on everything.

2957
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,560
Sure, sure.

2958
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:07,560
Yeah.

2959
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:11,560
Um, my graphics, uh, let me, okay, there we go.

2960
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:13,960
I had that screen name since 1998, so it's long overdue.

2961
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:17,120
Anyway, I was wondering if you guys will ever post another YouTube video.

2962
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:20,600
My graphics card from my computer is coming soon, and I'm sure everyone will want to see

2963
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:22,080
the room you guys broadcast from.

2964
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:23,080
No you don't.

2965
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,080
No you don't.

2966
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:27,720
You do not want to see the disaster this room is right now.

2967
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:32,140
I will say I did take a picture of the mixing board, and I took a picture of the computer

2968
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:35,280
setup tonight, and put them on our picture feed, so.

2969
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:41,560
I also uploaded my photos of the cardboard slash cabinet, you know, that's, uh, in the

2970
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:42,560
process of, you know, work on.

2971
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,560
Oh, sweet.

2972
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:48,080
Not so much yet, because, you know, I just took a few quick pictures, and they're probably

2973
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:53,760
not even, um, I don't know, I just took a few in case I ever wanted to explain how I

2974
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:54,760
made it.

2975
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:57,840
Oh, God, there it is, your cardboard box with buttons.

2976
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:58,840
Amazing.

2977
02:15:58,840 --> 02:15:59,840
Sorry, Jamie.

2978
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:00,840
No, it's fine.

2979
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,840
Better in person.

2980
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,240
Well, um, you should color it with magic marker.

2981
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,240
I know, really.

2982
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,800
Or a paint pen or something.

2983
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:06,800
That'd be funny.

2984
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,480
I originally wanted to just do it just in plain cardboard.

2985
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,480
Electrical tape!

2986
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:12,000
No, seriously, electrical tape.

2987
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,840
Get that cool vinyl look to it.

2988
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,800
Well, I have duct tape.

2989
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:18,960
I was thinking of wrapping some of it in duct tape, I don't know.

2990
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,000
Use colored duct tape.

2991
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,040
It's gonna look very ghetto when it's done.

2992
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:24,040
That's gonna be great.

2993
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:31,340
Anyway, um, yeah, actually this room is ready for a complete cleanup, because, um, I have

2994
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:35,040
these storage bins that have been sitting here on the floor forever, and I'm ready to

2995
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,440
start using them.

2996
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:40,920
I just, also, to let anyone know too, this is sort of related, I'm getting rid of a whole

2997
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:46,560
bunch of manga, and different books, including a few, I think I'm gonna get rid of my gothic

2998
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:51,920
and lolita magazines, so if anyone wants them, let me know.

2999
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,920
We'll work something out.

3000
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:55,920
Back to the email.

3001
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:01,200
Um, also, when Loki's arcade cabinet works, maybe we could see Loki drunk playing Daytona

3002
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,200
USA.

3003
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:03,200
Haha, just kidding.

3004
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,840
Well, I'm writing this from my Blackberry at Christmas party, so I better go.

3005
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:10,200
But before I go, and this, by the way, halfway through the email, before I go, I hope you

3006
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:14,640
guys check out Fallout 3, or even Fallout 1, I recommend that you guys play Fallout

3007
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:18,680
1 first, since the third one is in first person, and I know how dark soccer gets motion sick.

3008
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:20,560
Aww, thank you, that's so sweet.

3009
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:24,280
Also, I think it's free to play on gamertap, on gametap.

3010
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:30,920
The third one has a game of the year edition, now with all five download content packs that

3011
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:33,800
I highly recommend anyone who hasn't played a Fallout game.

3012
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:38,560
Actually, I've, Becky's husband has Fallout 3, and I saw him play some of it, and it looked

3013
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,560
really cool.

3014
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:43,760
I, you know, like I said, I wouldn't be able to do too much of it.

3015
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:49,640
Not to mention how much of a deal it is, well I hope you guys check those out now, if you'll

3016
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:54,440
excuse me, I've got gifts to open, sent from my Verizon wireless Blackberry.

3017
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:59,840
Wow, we got a crack, we got regular email, a Crackberry, and a PSP all tonight, that's

3018
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,240
pretty amazing.

3019
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:06,560
Well, I'm gonna double check and see if we've got any more, just because I'm nice.

3020
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,560
Nope.

3021
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:08,560
Plank.

3022
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:12,800
You can send in an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send them.

3023
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:16,040
But for now, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here on the program, because you

3024
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,200
know, sometimes things piss us off.

3025
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:21,600
And so a special holiday edition of the FUs of the Week.

3026
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:27,000
Oh, this is bad.

3027
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,120
Here is justice.

3028
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:32,400
Here is punishment.

3029
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:35,880
Here is a fucked up.

3030
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:39,200
DarkSakura, what's on your mind tonight that you want to get out of your chest?

3031
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:46,240
The fact that I still need to, um, FU to me, because I still need to do the faceplate that

3032
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:47,240
we were gonna autograph.

3033
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,240
FU!

3034
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,720
Yeah, and you know, I had it set out.

3035
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:52,720
That's alright.

3036
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:53,720
We'll get it.

3037
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:57,320
You know, but still, I feel bad about myself because I just remembered it.

3038
02:18:57,320 --> 02:19:03,160
And also, um, a secondary FU to me for not actually cleaning my room today, or yesterday.

3039
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:06,080
I came home very intoxicated last night.

3040
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,080
Awesome.

3041
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:09,680
My car is over at Becky's house.

3042
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:12,360
She will be bringing it to me, and I will be taking her home.

3043
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:15,440
So FU to me and Boddington Dale.

3044
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:18,000
But bless you for doing the right thing and not driving home drunk.

3045
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
That was the right thing to do.

3046
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Because I'm amazing.

3047
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Bogey.

3048
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,060
FU to burning myself on my finger with the soldering iron, because I decided for some

3049
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:29,960
reason to grab the tip of the soldering iron to move it to the side.

3050
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,960
Not smart.

3051
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:35,680
Just like that, and like, OWWW, as it sizzled.

3052
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:40,920
Well, maybe I'm the only one not giving an FU to myself tonight, although it does have

3053
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,240
to kind of do with me.

3054
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,800
FU to my back, because I don't know what I did.

3055
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,520
I think I might have slept on it wrong or something, but it's been like hurting me for

3056
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:53,480
like a week, and it sucks, and back pain is never any fun, and it just makes me remember

3057
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:54,480
that I'm getting old.

3058
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,840
FU to getting old.

3059
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,720
I know a lot of you people listening to this show are like, I'm 21 now.

3060
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,440
I'm old.

3061
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:02,440
FU.

3062
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:05,600
Wait about 10 years, then I'll tell you.

3063
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:08,640
Of course, then again, of course, a lot of my friends that are in their 40s would say

3064
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:12,120
I'm being just as big of a whiner, so what can you do?

3065
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:14,120
Age is just a number.

3066
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:17,520
Loki, why don't you give us another story, and then just a couple more stories here.

3067
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:22,360
We're going to make our way to the Skype line, where you guys can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3068
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:25,680
or of course our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3069
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,160
So we'll have that open very soon, just after a couple more stories.

3070
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:39,920
Now, apparently, not to delay themselves from jumping on the bandwagon too late, Microsoft

3071
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:45,240
has decided to go ahead and patent their own Xbox 360 hint system, very similar to what

3072
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:50,160
we saw with the Super Guide on the Nintendo.

3073
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:51,160
You may remember that.

3074
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:55,320
The first game that had that was New Super Mario Brothers.

3075
02:20:55,320 --> 02:21:00,000
This new patent, though, it doesn't really say what they're going to do exactly, but

3076
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:09,960
it's going to have some more guides and digital, kind of like brief audio commentaries or stuff

3077
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:14,780
that adds portions of the screen that kind of give you hints and stuff like that.

3078
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:17,920
So it's just kind of a generic system that maybe they're going to include in some games

3079
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:21,680
going forward to make them more approachable for casual gamers.

3080
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:26,280
Gene, have I heard this before?

3081
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:28,680
I guess it's a neat idea.

3082
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:37,200
We kind of gave the whole hint system crap for the Wii and stuff like that, and it really

3083
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:45,480
ended up that it was so behind the scenes like stuff that really shouldn't have been

3084
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:46,480
brought up.

3085
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:51,920
And in other words, people were reading way too much into the trademark and the patent

3086
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:57,000
documents, but to be fair, we've also only seen it implemented in one game.

3087
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,600
We don't know what it's going to look like in the next Zelda game or some other games

3088
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:03,080
that Nintendo might have in the future, just saying.

3089
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:09,260
But yeah, maybe a lot of us jumped the gun, and that's what happens.

3090
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:12,760
So I don't know, do you think Xbox 360 is just like, hey, Nintendo's got a good idea,

3091
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:15,360
let's copy it, or do you think they're really going in a different direction with this?

3092
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:20,360
I don't think they were just trying to take the same approach, not necessarily just because

3093
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:24,760
Nintendo did it, but maybe had the same ideas.

3094
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:29,080
To be fair, Microsoft does this sort of thing very well, where if somebody's got an idea,

3095
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,000
they sort of take it and make it better.

3096
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,440
Well, also they're trying to broaden themselves out.

3097
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:39,200
They kind of have the opposite problem as Nintendo.

3098
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,920
They're really trying to broaden the audience so much so that they don't really have any

3099
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:46,800
core games for the core gamer, I guess.

3100
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:51,080
But Microsoft has a lot of core games, but they're trying to broaden themselves out to

3101
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:53,440
more of a family audience.

3102
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:58,920
And you might say that the Xbox 360 is probably a little bit more daunting for someone that

3103
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:01,080
hasn't played games so far to pick up and learn how to play.

3104
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,880
Too many buttons!

3105
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:05,440
That's a retarded excuse, but I've heard it.

3106
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:06,880
I know, yeah.

3107
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:09,560
Too many buttons, hey, you use a keyboard at work, do you?

3108
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:10,560
Well, yeah.

3109
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:13,040
Well, how many buttons are on there?

3110
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,040
Yeah, I thought so.

3111
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:15,040
Shut up, bitch.

3112
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:21,760
All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and it has to do with Alienware computers.

3113
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:24,480
Alienware computers are coming now preloaded with Steam.

3114
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:27,800
Of course, those Alienware computers, those are those high-end gaming machines that they

3115
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:28,800
sell.

3116
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:30,040
Think like a Dell or an HP.

3117
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:32,520
In fact, didn't one of these buy Alienware?

3118
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:33,520
Dell.

3119
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:37,280
Yeah, Dell bought Alienware a couple of years ago, so it's everything in a box, which is

3120
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,440
perfect for the non-lokies of the world, the people that can't build their own machines.

3121
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:46,160
I know we have a mixture of people that listen to this show, but Alienware is also known

3122
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:47,520
for being very expensive.

3123
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:53,000
Well, Alienware is now actually bundling with their all-powerful systems.

3124
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,960
These actually, I got to admit, they're kind of cool-looking, the whole black and red thing.

3125
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:59,760
I mean, if you're going to pay that much money for a system, it might as well look kind of

3126
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:00,760
awesome.

3127
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:06,080
So if you buy one of these all-powerful systems, they're actually shipping with Steam.

3128
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:09,020
Steam comes on these systems.

3129
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:12,560
Part of the reason why is because Portal is a free game that's included, which of course

3130
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:15,360
was a Valve game that they did release through Steam.

3131
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:18,880
I actually bought, that was the very first game I ever bought through Steam, was Portal.

3132
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:22,000
So no, second game, because I bought AudioSurf 2.

3133
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,960
But regardless, Steam is now coming in bundled with these systems, which for these box systems

3134
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,240
is not really new news.

3135
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:32,660
I know I talked about earlier, and it's funny kind of to bring this full circle because

3136
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:36,660
Jamie had a story earlier about Steamworks, and I was saying, aren't those Google toolbars

3137
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:40,260
and all that other crap that tries to install with the program kind of annoying?

3138
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:45,080
But this, you sort of grow to expect that when you buy these computers in a box, they

3139
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:48,200
come preloaded with tons of crap.

3140
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,200
Bloatware.

3141
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,800
Yeah, it's, what do they call that?

3142
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:51,800
Bloatware.

3143
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:53,300
I've never heard of that, bloatware.

3144
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:54,480
That's a good term for it.

3145
02:24:54,480 --> 02:25:00,680
But yeah, the antivirus demo is installed, and the trial of Microsoft Office is already

3146
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,680
on the computer.

3147
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:04,880
So this honestly just seems like another logical step to me.

3148
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,760
It is kind of a kick in the groin to the competitors, like direct to drive and so forth.

3149
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:11,400
But what are you going to do?

3150
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:15,320
I guess you could say the Microsoft Office has its competitors too, and they get to jump

3151
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:18,400
up on some of these systems and so forth.

3152
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:23,800
Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangelaunchrater.com, Salacious Pop

3153
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:27,880
says, Alienware has a build your own shopping cart, a la the Apple site, where you can build

3154
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:31,200
a system for $7,000 without really trying.

3155
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:36,240
Pleasurezaco says, Skyit is hella cheaper to build your own PC than to buy from Alienware.

3156
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,240
Can they be as pretty though?

3157
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,080
Because I gotta say, those systems are very nice looking.

3158
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:41,120
You'd be surprised what you can find in cases nowadays.

3159
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:45,680
Although I gotta say, the new computer we've got for the show is pretty sleek looking.

3160
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:46,680
That's a nice looking little box.

3161
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:48,120
And they didn't, that wasn't even trying.

3162
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:49,440
I mean seriously, there's a lot of nice...

3163
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:53,160
It doesn't light up pretty, but it looks nicer than the one I've got for myself.

3164
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,840
Nowadays, it's almost hard to find a case that doesn't light up.

3165
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:07,280
I mean, seriously, my computer at the time I think cost me $1,700, and I put in not entirely

3166
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:12,840
top of the line stuff, but I put in stuff to overclock a dual core processor pretty

3167
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:13,840
heavily.

3168
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:20,640
I mean, so it's not top of the line, but it's not bottom of the line, that's for sure.

3169
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:25,080
And it still runs stuff nowadays pretty well.

3170
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:29,920
Without $1,700, if you're spending like $7,000, holy shit.

3171
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,480
I mean, there's no way...

3172
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:34,800
I don't know if that was an exaggeration or not.

3173
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,300
Part of me says it probably wasn't.

3174
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:42,420
You can, I mean, even if you bought all the top of the line stuff, I still don't see how

3175
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:43,680
it costs that much.

3176
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:48,240
I mean, I really don't, I don't know.

3177
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:50,680
I'm looking at some of the other comments here.

3178
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:53,800
Act Def says, the general consumer doesn't know how to build a computer and will go for

3179
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,720
something that's already built.

3180
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,640
That's clearly where they're making their money.

3181
02:26:57,640 --> 02:26:59,040
Tiger Claw says, here's the thing.

3182
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,840
What is more important, the way the case looks or the performance of the system?

3183
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,060
I choose the latter.

3184
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:07,960
And no, in all seriousness, and for myself and not playing devil's advocate here, obviously

3185
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:10,000
you're not staring at the box the whole time.

3186
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,760
You're staring at what's on the monitor.

3187
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:16,080
The box is just for impressing people at landmarks.

3188
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,120
My computer lights up.

3189
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,120
My power supply lights up.

3190
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:21,200
Mine lights up like a bluish color, but it's nothing special.

3191
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:28,200
My favorite, I think, computer that anyone ever built was the one built into a tall tackle

3192
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:31,840
box, a metal, no, a tall metal toolbox.

3193
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:36,640
And I got to say, maybe lesson learned here, I didn't build my own computer the last time

3194
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:41,380
I bought a computer because I'm not quite as talented as Loki or whatever.

3195
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:45,500
And I thought maybe I was getting a really good deal because I bought my computer for

3196
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:49,960
a certain price that was kind of low to me, but now I'm learning, should have got a better

3197
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:54,120
video card and some of these other things I should have considered better at the time.

3198
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:55,120
Well, lesson learned.

3199
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:58,680
You know, one thing I would change if I were to go back and actually make my computer again

3200
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:04,960
is I would not buy another graphics card to run SLI, because I have two graphics cards

3201
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:05,960
in mine.

3202
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:14,240
And they're both EVGA, GTS, 8800 graphics cards with a half gig RAM in each one.

3203
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:21,860
I mean, in the games that run SLI, it's awesome, but most stuff out there does not support

3204
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:22,860
SLI.

3205
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:25,920
So it's kind of pointless.

3206
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:30,960
I did it for Crysis, but Crysis got boring really fast.

3207
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:31,960
Bummer.

3208
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:32,960
But it ran well.

3209
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:33,960
All right.

3210
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:38,600
We're going to open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

3211
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:39,600
OrangeLoungeRadio.

3212
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:43,040
We're going to take your calls live here for a little bit, and then we'll start to wrap

3213
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:44,040
up the show.

3214
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,360
Meanwhile, while we wait for the calls to come in, because there's a little bit of a

3215
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:52,800
delay from studio to encoding to the all-game server to you guys hearing it, let's see if

3216
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,160
there's any last-minute stories.

3217
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:59,480
There's a rumor that there's going to be some exclusive characters for Sonic and Sega All-Star

3218
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:05,440
Racing, including for the Xbox 360 that Banjo-Kazooie might be in.

3219
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:12,520
That's from some work-in-progress box shots that are appearing, I guess, on their UK site.

3220
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:16,080
So that's kind of interesting.

3221
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:23,680
Also there's a fun little website I was looking at earlier that you can create your own Zelda

3222
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,640
scenes with the Zelda II text generator.

3223
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:33,400
And if you go check it out, it's at ZeldaPower.com, and it's under their features, the Adventures

3224
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:35,440
of Link text box toy.

3225
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:38,520
You can make all sorts of weird scenes.

3226
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,320
But it's not, you can't actually put them in the game, right?

3227
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,320
No.

3228
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:46,480
Just to make little web pages or stuff for forums and stuff like that.

3229
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:49,680
So it's kind of neat.

3230
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:54,400
Great, more forum macros, just what we needed.

3231
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:59,440
And then also there is a rumor that apparently you're going to be able to attend some of

3232
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:03,480
these gaming conferences through your Xbox 360.

3233
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:10,800
One of the, I guess, new things they're talking about is, imagine an interactive online version

3234
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:17,280
of E3, BlizzCon, Gamescom, Comic Con, and every other major video game convention were

3235
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:20,460
made available through Xbox Live.

3236
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:24,080
So it's something that is being put out there.

3237
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:30,220
I guess it's coming from some guy who works in the game industry, VG Market, I guess.

3238
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:36,600
They have a, looks like it's another survey, a market research survey.

3239
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,800
And we know about those market research surveys.

3240
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:42,600
They end up coming true.

3241
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:45,240
There's a lot of comments there in chat about the SLI.

3242
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:48,000
Danger Skew in our chat says, I agree with the SLI argument.

3243
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:53,280
You should never build a computer with SLI from the beginning, only if you need more

3244
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:54,280
power later.

3245
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:58,040
And Tiger Claw says, you only need SLI if you have a huge-ass monitor.

3246
02:30:58,040 --> 02:30:59,640
It's meant to handle graphics at higher resolutions.

3247
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:03,600
If you have a 19-inch widescreen monitor and only one Nvidia card, you're good to go.

3248
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,240
Again, those comments are coming from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

3249
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,920
Especially nowadays with the Nvidia cards are actually multi-processor anyway.

3250
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:11,600
So it's like having two cards already.

3251
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:16,320
So probably no need to have more than that.

3252
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:19,080
Still waiting to see if any calls come in at 1877 Game OLR.

3253
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:20,400
Is Skype all fucked up today?

3254
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:21,960
Is that what's going on?

3255
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:24,520
I had something awful linked to me, Rob.

3256
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:27,160
Skype was acting weird earlier, but yeah, what's that?

3257
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:30,100
A trailer for New King of Fighters movie.

3258
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,100
And it...

3259
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:32,100
Like a real movie?

3260
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:36,060
Yeah, and it has Ray Park in it, and I watched some of it and I wanted to cry because I'm

3261
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:38,960
like, where's Q?

3262
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:39,960
Is it an American movie?

3263
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:40,960
Yeah, it's American.

3264
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:41,960
Or is this something that's being made overseas?

3265
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:42,960
Really?

3266
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:43,960
I didn't know they were making that.

3267
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:44,960
I think...

3268
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,960
Ugh, God.

3269
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:46,960
You would think I would have heard about this sooner.

3270
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,720
Why don't I send you the link?

3271
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,720
Okay.

3272
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,840
So we can play how awful it is on the air.

3273
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:52,840
Hold on.

3274
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:53,840
We're getting a call.

3275
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:54,840
Hi, you're on Orangelaungeradio.

3276
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,840
Who's this?

3277
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:56,840
It's Legend of Zaku.

3278
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:57,840
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

3279
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:59,840
What's on your mind, buddy?

3280
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:00,840
Nothing much.

3281
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:05,960
Just trying to get over this whole Thanksgiving ordeal.

3282
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:06,960
I know.

3283
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,960
Go behind.

3284
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:12,360
It's a bummer we all have to go back to work tomorrow, but you know, such is life.

3285
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:20,440
Well, yeah, basically, I know we barely cover the DDR and Bomani scene, but I figured you

3286
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:24,720
already know by now that DDRX2 has an arcade release.

3287
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:27,000
Well, it's going to be released in Japan.

3288
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,620
We'll mention it once in a while.

3289
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:34,560
We don't mention every little story like we used to, but any of the big things will come

3290
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,560
up.

3291
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:37,960
There was a location test last week, and I did read something on the internet this week

3292
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:43,720
that somebody out there in Japan was bringing back reports of what was in the location test,

3293
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:49,840
which was a lot of your BeatMania 2DX-style artists and a lot of the Konami house originals,

3294
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:55,080
which I think is DDR's biggest problem right now in cracking the mainstream is that I realize

3295
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:56,560
people love their Konami originals.

3296
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:57,560
I do, too.

3297
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:58,680
There's a lot of talented artists.

3298
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:02,320
It's never going to break into the mainstream unless they start building some good licenses.

3299
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:07,440
That all depends on what licenses they end up including in the final version, but right

3300
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:13,000
now, apparently, a lot of the community, from the consensus I'm hearing right now, is that

3301
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
they actually...

3302
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,280
Yeah, I'm actually hearing good consensus from them.

3303
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:22,200
I'm actually hearing a lot of good things in terms of the song selection, but that's

3304
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,200
pretty much it.

3305
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:30,200
They may be skeptical as to whether or not they could execute the same version, the same

3306
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:35,280
Japanese version, to America, which we already know how much of a disaster DDRX was.

3307
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:37,080
Was it?

3308
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:38,080
I didn't really...

3309
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:41,080
I have to admit, I haven't been following DDRX closely.

3310
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:47,520
Yeah, the fucked up pads and the countless number of fixes afterwards.

3311
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,200
Even my pads, even my Dave and Buster's managed to get a DDRX cab that couldn't even last

3312
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,200
a month.

3313
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:55,720
It was not even playable.

3314
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:59,400
The fact that there's not that many machines around.

3315
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:04,240
The fact that they killed off our free kids made it even worse, so I pretty much consider

3316
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:07,640
that a failure.

3317
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:12,480
The way I see it is that I think Supernova is a baseline, because that managed to spread,

3318
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:15,600
and that managed to have good coverage all around.

3319
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:20,720
Just about most of the places I could think off the top of my head that had Supernova

3320
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:25,800
at one point, but then when I try to do the same thing for DDRX, it's just I can.

3321
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:28,960
I can only think of one place.

3322
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:33,600
One place that wasn't Coney Island that no longer had the machine, but that's it.

3323
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:38,120
Honestly, Zaku, I just want to play Fourth Mix Plus.

3324
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:40,840
I already had that chance.

3325
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:47,880
I've already played that last summer back on 8 on the break, when they basically threw

3326
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:48,880
it on their machine.

3327
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,400
Well, no, I mean, I've played it before, but I'm just saying, with all these fancy new

3328
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:57,200
mixes and all that stuff going on, I miss Fourth Plus.

3329
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,640
Fourth Plus was the bomb, that was the best mix they ever did.

3330
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:05,280
On the 8th on the break, apparently they're doing, they've been throwing Fourth and Fifth

3331
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,840
Mix around pretty recently.

3332
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:10,760
I don't know if they're still doing it now, but that's what they were doing a couple of

3333
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:11,760
months ago.

3334
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,640
I'm pretty sure Milpitas Golf Land here locally, I haven't been there in a couple years, granted.

3335
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:18,160
Well, maybe not that long, maybe about a year.

3336
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:22,080
They still had a Fourth Mix Plus last time I was there, so props to them.

3337
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:25,160
And now, of course, I've started the classic amongst the longtime listeners of the show

3338
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:28,000
that are DDR nerds from the beginning.

3339
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,960
The Fourth Mix Plus versus Fifth Mix debate.

3340
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:31,960
My bad.

3341
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,160
Fifth Mix was pretty badass, too.

3342
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:34,280
Where else can you play Moonlight Shadow?

3343
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:35,280
I'll give you that.

3344
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:36,280
Fifth Mix was awesome.

3345
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,280
All right.

3346
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:38,280
Yeah.

3347
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:39,280
All right.

3348
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:45,200
Look, please, is there anything else on your mind this week besides just the DDRX2?

3349
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:49,800
Basically going on what you said about Alienware, you can build yourself a PC for less than

3350
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:53,680
a thousand, a really good gaming rig for less than a thousand clocks.

3351
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:59,080
You just have to look hard and deep, and you've got to really consider what you prioritize,

3352
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:03,280
graphics, sound, or both.

3353
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,280
That's pretty much it.

3354
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:11,280
I've managed to get mine for $1,700 and change when I built it, but it still runs pretty

3355
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:12,280
good as of today.

3356
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:18,760
Obviously, it can't do 60 frames per crisis, but it can play stuff like Left 4 Dead, Team

3357
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:22,080
Fortress 2 pretty well.

3358
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:26,080
Just the better of how much you're willing to spend on something like that.

3359
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,760
I think that's important, too, is prioritizing.

3360
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:31,200
What do you really want out of your machine?

3361
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:35,800
If you buy a cheapo graphics card but buy a bit monitor, it's not going to do a lot

3362
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:36,800
of good.

3363
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,800
Right.

3364
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:43,200
You've got to get at least something, at least Geforce 9 or better right now.

3365
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:47,240
That should do you good for another year or two before you have to refresh.

3366
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:48,800
All right.

3367
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:52,520
Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, see if anybody else

3368
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:53,520
is trying to call tonight.

3369
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:54,520
Have a good one.

3370
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,520
Okay, buddy?

3371
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:56,520
All right.

3372
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:57,520
All right.

3373
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:58,520
Later, buddy.

3374
02:36:58,520 --> 02:36:59,520
All right.

3375
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,440
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3376
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:04,440
Either way will do it.

3377
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:08,560
I will keep the phone lines open a little bit longer to see if anyone wants to get through.

3378
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:10,440
I know some people told me earlier they wanted to call in.

3379
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:12,480
I'm not sure if they're going to try to get through or what.

3380
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:13,680
Do we have any other last minute stories?

3381
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:14,680
I sent you the link.

3382
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,680
Oh, yes.

3383
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,680
Oh, thank you.

3384
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,680
I forgot about it.

3385
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,680
Oh, and of course, we're getting another call.

3386
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:19,680
We'll bring up the link for after this, though.

3387
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:20,680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3388
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:21,680
Who's this?

3389
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:22,680
Hey, this is XLink.

3390
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:23,680
Hi, XLink.

3391
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:24,680
How are you doing?

3392
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,680
Hey, doing good.

3393
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:30,960
I was playing a game recently that I'd like to talk a little bit about, if it's okay with

3394
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:31,960
you.

3395
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:32,960
Of course.

3396
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:33,960
What's up?

3397
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:34,960
I was playing a game called Gyromancer.

3398
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:38,000
It was the new one from Pop Games and Square Enix.

3399
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,240
Yes, the Marriage of Popcat Games and Square Enix.

3400
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:42,760
I played the demo for this.

3401
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:44,240
Have you played the full version?

3402
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:47,600
I've been playing the full version, and the full version is not that much different than

3403
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,600
the demo.

3404
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:53,400
You can level up your monsters a lot more, and I've been playing just a little bit.

3405
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:55,320
I haven't gone through the whole game exactly as of yet.

3406
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:57,480
I've been playing during downtime for a while, so...

3407
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,480
I imagine it takes some time.

3408
02:37:58,480 --> 02:37:59,480
PC or 360?

3409
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:00,480
PC.

3410
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:01,480
Okay.

3411
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:02,480
What do you think?

3412
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:03,480
What are your thoughts on it?

3413
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,480
I like it.

3414
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:09,200
I like, because I'm a big Blitz, Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz fan, and I think they're

3415
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:14,280
taken more after Bejeweled Blitz, because the fact that you have to rotate the pieces

3416
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:18,520
to make the lines this time around, I like it a lot more.

3417
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:22,640
It's a lot more difficult than going, okay, well, I'm going to take this and switch these

3418
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:23,640
two around.

3419
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,640
It's not like two pieces.

3420
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:27,940
You have to switch actually four around in a counter-clockwise position.

3421
02:38:27,940 --> 02:38:31,560
It's so funny you compare it to Bejeweled Blitz, because I was literally, literally

3422
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:37,080
having this conversation last night with somebody about Bejeweled versus Bejeweled Twist or

3423
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:41,600
Gyromancer or what have you, that for me, when I tried to play the demo for Gyromancer,

3424
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:47,380
I was having such a hard time conceptualizing the twist, because I was so used to playing

3425
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:53,680
Bejeweled Blitz and just regular Bejeweled 2 and so forth, that I kept wanting to swap

3426
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:57,600
the gems to make lines of three, like it was very hard for me to kind of change that and

3427
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,880
do the twist.

3428
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:02,720
And then the other thing that really messes with me is that in Bejeweled Blitz or any

3429
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:08,920
other version of Bejeweled, you have to make a move every turn that causes gems to disappear.

3430
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:15,160
In Gyromancer, your twists do not have to cause three to line up.

3431
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:19,080
People get higher scores and even penalized, you know, if it doesn't, and higher scores

3432
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:23,800
if they do, but I just had such a hard time kind of getting used to that idea.

3433
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:27,000
I mean, it didn't ruin the game for me, I still think it's kind of interesting, but

3434
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:31,400
I just think I'm going to suck at it, because I always play Bejeweled Blitz, because I want

3435
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:35,040
my E-peen to have me at the top of the leaderboard, even though that never happens.

3436
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,040
Most definitely.

3437
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:39,080
You get more points by doing that, but also at the same time, though, like if you do a

3438
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:45,000
move and you don't make three, it would cause the enemy's power to grow a little bit each

3439
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,760
time, so you want to make those lines, you want to make the ones, because you get like,

3440
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,680
for each of your characters, you get like a certain color, so you want to make those

3441
02:39:52,680 --> 02:40:00,640
lines with the color that your creature represents, so that way you can use your powers and take

3442
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,640
more.

3443
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:05,960
It's cool because it had like a life, it added more of a really role-playing element

3444
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:11,240
to it with the hit points, so like you do certain moves and it'll take away hit points

3445
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:16,120
away from the other enemy, depending on how many was chained or what was happening, you

3446
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:17,120
know.

3447
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:23,360
It has a lot of the element to Puzzle Quest to it, but it's a lot of fun, though.

3448
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,360
Good thing it fucks.

3449
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:27,960
I was going to ask, did you play any Puzzle Quest previously at all?

3450
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:28,960
I did.

3451
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,680
I played the original Puzzle Quest.

3452
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:34,600
Not the galaxy, because it looked a little too sci-fi, and the way the board was set

3453
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:36,400
up was like, oh my god, what the hell.

3454
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:40,280
Yeah, the hexagon thing was too much of a departure, I think, for some of us, which

3455
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:44,680
in a way is similar to the whole thing that bugs me about the twist, but that's okay.

3456
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:49,520
So how do you feel about this game compared to Puzzle Quest?

3457
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:50,520
I like it.

3458
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:55,320
It has a lot of the Puzzle Quest-type feel to it, but it's more story-line driven and

3459
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:59,920
more, there's a little more interaction that I would say than that, so.

3460
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:05,280
But like I said before, for a puzzle game, $15, it was Pop Game and Square Enix.

3461
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,700
You can't really go too wrong with it, so I mean.

3462
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:08,700
That's true.

3463
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:13,960
It is a damn good price, so it's pretty cool how there's been all this puzzle game resurgence

3464
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:17,440
in the past couple years, especially these very, very fleshed out type of puzzle games

3465
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:21,920
between what Q Entertainment has been giving us with Luminous and so forth, and now, you

3466
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:25,460
know, these RPG meets PopCap games.

3467
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:26,460
It's pretty fascinating.

3468
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:29,120
I just use it mostly, like I said before, as a time killer.

3469
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:33,100
If I want something to fill in at 15 minutes, I usually just load it up and then play it,

3470
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:37,720
you know, or maybe play like one level a day or something, so that way I don't get overkill

3471
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:38,720
of it, so.

3472
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:40,880
I'm surprised this game hasn't shown up on every platform.

3473
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:43,040
I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it's on the iPhone.

3474
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:47,120
Well, right now, I know it's for the Xbox and PC, but I don't know if they're going

3475
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:48,120
to expand it over that.

3476
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:51,280
I think they're trying to wait to see what happens first beforehand, so.

3477
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:52,280
Right.

3478
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:53,280
Very interesting.

3479
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,280
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, XLink?

3480
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:56,280
Not really.

3481
02:41:56,280 --> 02:42:01,920
You know, that, I mean, I got confused a good deal from Steam when it was doing the Black

3482
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:02,920
Friday stuff.

3483
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:03,920
Well, yeah.

3484
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,920
What did you jump in on?

3485
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,920
Oh.

3486
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:06,920
Knights of the Old Republic.

3487
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:08,680
I definitely picked that up for 250.

3488
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:10,200
I heard about that.

3489
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,200
250.

3490
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:12,320
That's an amazing deal.

3491
02:42:12,320 --> 02:42:14,720
You know, and you've got to wonder how Steam makes money off of it.

3492
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:18,360
My thought is they're selling these games at cost, and they're just getting people

3493
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:20,880
to install Steam to get these hella good deals.

3494
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:24,220
And maybe even, you know, kind of the idea behind the consoles, they're taking a little

3495
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:28,480
bit of a loss over these games, you know, especially a game like Knights of the Old

3496
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:31,880
Republic that hasn't really generated buzz, well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't put it

3497
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:32,880
that way.

3498
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:33,880
But, you know, it's years old.

3499
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:34,880
It's years old, so.

3500
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:35,880
Well, you had to think about it this way.

3501
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:39,320
If something was sitting around, like, say, for example, even in the video store, a game

3502
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:41,880
was sitting around, and it wasn't doing anything, and they're going, they put a price

3503
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:45,400
of 250 on there, and they know it's going to hit, then they, you know, at least they're

3504
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:46,400
making something out of nothing.

3505
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,320
So, I mean, they're making money somehow.

3506
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:49,320
So, I mean.

3507
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:50,320
True.

3508
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:51,320
True.

3509
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:52,320
So, maybe it's arranged with these companies.

3510
02:42:52,320 --> 02:42:53,320
I don't know.

3511
02:42:53,320 --> 02:42:55,920
I'm holding out hope that Torchlight is in tomorrow's deals, because I really wanted

3512
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,920
to pick that up.

3513
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:57,920
So, I'm waiting to see them.

3514
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,920
Yeah.

3515
02:42:58,920 --> 02:42:59,920
Well, you know, you get what you pay for.

3516
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:04,440
Kind of like I kind of kicked myself in the ass for picking up Fallout 3, and then two

3517
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:07,120
months down the road, they're like, oh, by the way, the Game of the Year edition, same

3518
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:08,120
price.

3519
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:10,360
And you get all the downloadable content to go with it.

3520
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:11,360
Oh, bummer.

3521
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:17,040
But I did pick up Civ IV also from Go Gamer when they're doing their Black Friday deals

3522
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:18,040
for 10 bucks.

3523
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:19,040
Nice.

3524
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:20,040
Which was the complete edition.

3525
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:21,040
So, that was very nice.

3526
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,040
Very nice.

3527
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:23,520
Compared to that of five bucks from Best Buy.

3528
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,520
So.

3529
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:25,520
All right.

3530
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:26,520
Well.

3531
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:27,520
We'll see you in the game.

3532
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,520
Excellent.

3533
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:29,520
We're going to let you go, so we can try and get maybe one more call in.

3534
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:30,520
But have a great night, okay?

3535
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:31,520
Definitely.

3536
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:32,520
Thank you.

3537
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,520
And thanks for the review on Gyromancer.

3538
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:36,840
One eight seven seven Game O-L-R, or his name on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.

3539
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:40,120
I did get that video brought up here that DarkStalker was talking about earlier.

3540
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:44,720
Let me look at a little bit of a clip here.

3541
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:48,280
It does look like an actual, like, movie.

3542
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:50,240
I just never knew they were making a movie out of King of Fighters.

3543
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:51,240
Or maybe.

3544
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:53,240
Is that mine?

3545
02:43:53,240 --> 02:44:01,120
Yeah, this definitely looks direct to video.

3546
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,120
No?

3547
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:03,120
Okay, whatever.

3548
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:18,240
It'll be fun for Phantom Martial Arts movies and stuff, I'm sure.

3549
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:19,240
Part of my soul cried.

3550
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:21,800
Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

3551
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,800
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

3552
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:23,800
Who's this?

3553
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:24,800
Hey, hey.

3554
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:25,800
It's Ronma.

3555
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:26,800
Hi, hey.

3556
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,800
What's up?

3557
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:28,800
Not too much.

3558
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:32,080
I'll make this brief, because, um, since you guys are talking about DDR and so forth,

3559
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:36,240
funny little anecdote popped up in Anime USA that I have to share with you guys is

3560
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:37,760
the funniest thing I've ever heard.

3561
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,760
Alright.

3562
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:43,760
Okay, um, I'm not sure if you guys covered this about the whole, think you guys did the

3563
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:46,800
whole Konami DDR tournament that was going that they were having?

3564
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:50,000
Yeah, I came up on the show, people emailed us about it, and, you know, we were kinda

3565
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,520
giving our spin on it.

3566
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:55,600
Not enough notice on it, I think, for it to be taken as seriously as they wanted it to

3567
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:56,600
be.

3568
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:57,600
Yeah.

3569
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:02,640
But, if I'm not mistaken, I believe there was also a cutoff point for the tournament.

3570
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,960
You had to be under a certain age to compete.

3571
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:10,320
Yes, I remember that, like, so officially DDR has turned its back on me.

3572
02:45:10,320 --> 02:45:11,320
Yes.

3573
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:15,520
Yeah, from what I understand, they're saying the cutoff date was like 31 or 32, which I

3574
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:23,520
call shenanigans on, but, um, one of the people I know in the DDR fandom community, um, I

3575
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:28,160
believe it was DDR.O Bill, he told me how it was crazy that they were having this, and

3576
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:32,560
I ran to another friend of mine, Jim the Fly, at Anime USA.

3577
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:38,040
He told me that the guy that was hosting the tournament, who more or less put the rules

3578
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:41,880
together, he himself had a heart attack.

3579
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:42,880
What?

3580
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:43,880
Yeah.

3581
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:48,840
Wait, the guy who, wait, are you, like, a heart attack, like, literally had a heart

3582
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:49,840
attack?

3583
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:50,840
Yeah.

3584
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:53,880
Was it- That's a hardcore tournament.

3585
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:58,680
Was it related to this, or was it just unfortunate timing?

3586
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:03,520
It's just odd timing, because everyone's saying he was, like, 33, 34, something like that,

3587
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:04,520
you know?

3588
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:05,520
Oh, God.

3589
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:06,520
Wow.

3590
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:07,520
That's a, yeah.

3591
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:08,520
Yeah, wow.

3592
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:11,520
That's a little close to home.

3593
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:12,520
Wow.

3594
02:46:12,520 --> 02:46:13,520
That's-

3595
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:14,520
Karma's kind of fucked up, isn't it?

3596
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:15,520
Well, yeah, hold on.

3597
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:19,940
I would never, you know, even if it was, let's say, it's just, like, the worst of the worst

3598
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:24,600
bottom of the barrel video game personality, like, for instance, this guy who's suing all

3599
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:29,000
the companies for these ludicrous reasons, I would not wish a heart attack upon them.

3600
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,000
I would wish-

3601
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,120
Neither would I, but I just find this, just, odd, it's, like, he's about, you can't be

3602
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:38,120
over a certain age to compete, this, this, and this, and then, boom, he has a heart attack.

3603
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:39,120
I'm like, what?

3604
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,780
Well, you know, I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence, you know, people get sick as

3605
02:46:42,780 --> 02:46:43,920
they get older, and-

3606
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:47,320
You have to be this age to compete, because this is what, ugh!

3607
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:56,600
How about you have to have a blood pressure under a certain, you know, instance.

3608
02:46:56,600 --> 02:47:01,080
Well, I think it's sad, and I don't want to make jokes about it, you know, and I don't

3609
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:05,360
care if you all hate the fucking rules, or whatever, but I just don't think we would

3610
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:09,280
ever want to wish that upon somebody, and I hope he gets better soon, but I think what

3611
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:14,040
I can speak to is the tournament itself, and, you know, the rules and the tournament itself

3612
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:18,760
seemed a little silly, and was just hastily thrown together, and I think that's why it

3613
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:23,160
didn't get probably the type of coverage that hopefully Konami was going for.

3614
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:24,280
Perhaps so, but you know what?

3615
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:29,280
I think I'm gonna host my own National DDR tournament, and you can be up to whatever

3616
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:34,760
age you want, if you need to bring your walker, your wheelchair, your cane to compete, that's

3617
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:35,760
fine.

3618
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:38,860
Hold on, though, hold on, though, because, like, you know, then I'll bring a cane and

3619
02:47:38,860 --> 02:47:42,400
use it to hit the arrows and, and so forth, that would be cheating.

3620
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:45,880
There was the guy, though, who, uh, who, uh, played on crutches.

3621
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:46,880
Freestyle's different.

3622
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:48,880
And he mostly PA'd, too.

3623
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,200
Did he?

3624
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:51,200
Wow.

3625
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:52,200
Yeah.

3626
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:56,040
I don't, is, is playing with crutches, like, holding the bar, though?

3627
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:57,040
No.

3628
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,040
No, he had one leg.

3629
02:47:58,040 --> 02:47:59,040
Did he really?

3630
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,040
Yeah.

3631
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:01,040
Well, that's, I'm, we're not thinking-

3632
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:02,040
There's a video up on YouTube.

3633
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,040
We're not thinking of the same guy, then.

3634
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:04,040
So.

3635
02:48:04,040 --> 02:48:07,840
And if it might, I think he's actually from New York.

3636
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:10,440
It's been a while.

3637
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:11,720
Does Ramen know him?

3638
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:12,720
I don't know.

3639
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:13,720
Probably not.

3640
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:14,720
No, but Zaku might.

3641
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:15,720
All right.

3642
02:48:15,720 --> 02:48:18,720
Well, Rama, we're gonna let you go and, uh, you know, be safe, us 30-year-olds.

3643
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:19,720
Oh, I am.

3644
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,720
Clearly.

3645
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:21,720
I just have my Geritol Shake.

3646
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:22,720
I have saved some for you.

3647
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:23,720
Yeah.

3648
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:24,720
Thank you.

3649
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:25,720
I use Insure, but thank you.

3650
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:26,720
All right.

3651
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:27,720
All right now.

3652
02:48:27,720 --> 02:48:28,720
Bye, Rama.

3653
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:29,720
All right.

3654
02:48:29,720 --> 02:48:30,720
Later.

3655
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:35,800
Well, that, I mean, that's unfortunate, like, you know, I don't care what fucked-up tournament

3656
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:36,800
he planned.

3657
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:40,400
I mean, heart attacks suck, you know, that's, that's, that's, I hope he's okay, for God's

3658
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:41,400
sake.

3659
02:48:41,400 --> 02:48:42,400
Yeah.

3660
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,840
I hope to hell we didn't get a call like that if the poor guy passed away, but I doubt that's

3661
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:46,440
the case or we would have heard more about it.

3662
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:47,440
All right.

3663
02:48:47,440 --> 02:48:51,000
So, get well soon, guy, and, and, and plan your tournament six months in advance next

3664
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:54,400
time and maybe we'll have, be able to actually, uh, save the money from the change in the

3665
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,400
couch to go.

3666
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:57,960
Anyhow, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight.

3667
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:01,520
If you guys didn't get through, please, you can always feel free to leave us a, um, message

3668
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:05,960
at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or, of course, the Twitter and, of course, the Facebook and

3669
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:08,040
all those social networks we interact with.

3670
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,960
We have eyes and ears everywhere.

3671
02:49:09,960 --> 02:49:12,560
But for now, it's about time to wrap up the show.

3672
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:15,760
But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3673
02:49:15,760 --> 02:49:17,200
Um, I'll start tonight.

3674
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:22,720
My final thought is I need Advil or something that will make my back feel better because

3675
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:23,720
it sucks.

3676
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:25,960
I, I have some.

3677
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:28,680
I might take you up on that or just get, do it when I get home.

3678
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:31,320
It's, it's not like killing me.

3679
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:33,120
Otherwise I'd like be going to a doctor tomorrow.

3680
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:34,120
But it's just annoying.

3681
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:35,120
It's annoying.

3682
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:37,400
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

3683
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:43,240
My final thought is this, um, Doom with, uh, Mega Man looks kind of interesting.

3684
02:49:43,240 --> 02:49:44,240
What?

3685
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:47,960
It's a, uh, Doom mod with, with Mega Man.

3686
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:50,640
It's got, like, all the 8-bit sprites and everything.

3687
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,640
That's fantastic.

3688
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:52,640
Kind of amazing, actually.

3689
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:54,560
I'm so downloading that.

3690
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:55,560
Is that out?

3691
02:49:55,560 --> 02:49:56,560
Like, released publicly?

3692
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:04,640
Um, it's, uh, it's a Deathmatch mod and, um, I'm not sure if it's out yet to download.

3693
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:13,800
The official website, um, cut, looks like, uh, cutstuff.net slash blog slash question

3694
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,240
mark p equals 1677.

3695
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:21,680
That'll, uh, pull it up for you and you can check it out.

3696
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:27,440
And it's, um, it's got a public alpha version right now.

3697
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:29,080
Mega Man Deathmatch.

3698
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:32,120
Um, DarkSakurai, your final thought tonight?

3699
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:34,600
End of line.

3700
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:40,200
And, uh, my final thought tonight would be, um, I, oh, no, I already said my final thought.

3701
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:41,920
I was like, wait, I already said something.

3702
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:43,640
I thought I was last for a reason.

3703
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:44,640
Clearly, it's old age.

3704
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:51,000
If you want the direct download, because that URL's kind of hard to find, it'd be cutstuff.net

3705
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:58,880
slash file slash mega DM alpha dot zip, and that'll get you the, um, zip file for that.

3706
02:50:58,880 --> 02:51:02,640
And for the record, I used to play Gotcha Mon Doom.

3707
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:06,360
You could, like, throw the, the feather and the yo-yo and everything.

3708
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,360
That's cool.

3709
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,360
Wow.

3710
02:51:08,360 --> 02:51:10,160
That takes a lot of dedication to make something like that.

3711
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:11,160
It's pretty impressive.

3712
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:15,720
I was, this was years ago, like, before I moved out here.

3713
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:19,920
Uh, and I also need to say, as I do every week, thank you guys very much for tuning

3714
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:23,200
into Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.

3715
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:25,160
Without you guys, this would not be possible.

3716
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:29,520
Remember, we don't have any fancy website, multimillion dollar magazine or game company

3717
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:30,520
backing us up.

3718
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:34,520
There's three of us do this because we love you and we love doing this broadcasting thing.

3719
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:38,600
So all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show and how to spread the word.

3720
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,120
And pizza would be nice too.

3721
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:41,800
Order us pizza for next show.

3722
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:42,800
So we'll see.

3723
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:46,240
I like vegetarian, just letting you know.

3724
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:47,240
We'll see if that happens.

3725
02:51:47,240 --> 02:51:49,640
Anyhow, we'll be here to do it all again next week.

3726
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:52,000
Uh, in the meantime, I'm Rob.

3727
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
She's Jamie.

3728
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
He's Loki.

3729
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,180
We're out.

3730
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:58,120
But Jamie has to say, end of line.

3731
02:51:58,120 --> 02:52:02,320
