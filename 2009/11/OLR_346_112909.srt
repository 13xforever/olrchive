1
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:14,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:31,754
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

3
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:56,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Rawr.

4
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:56,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Rawr.

5
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Techmaster Loki, also joining us every week here on the program.

6
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:30,058
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

7
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:30,639
[SPEAKER_08]: No, would not be fun.

8
00:01:56,544 --> 00:02:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, also our chat room is always here chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you'd like to join it and say hello to us and of course we always like to interact with our chat room who right now is razzing me for a technical difficulty we had before tonight's show started but those of you on the podcast, it'll all be fixed by the time you hear it so yeah, if you want to hear all the good technical difficulties not that we usually edit a lot of things but most of this is very uncensored radio we don't really filter anything out but

9
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, should I call it a blog cast?

10
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:46,635
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?

11
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I've, whoa, I played World of Warcraft today and Sims yesterday.

12
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:21,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I downloaded another game that I'm going to try out that I've heard lots of good things about.

13
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:25,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have to pull it up on, actually I have to pull up iTunes so that I can find it.

14
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:31,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a little shooting game, like a, like a Gradius type of shooter.

15
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:35,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just, I just downloaded it.

16
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find it.

17
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,888
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?

18
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly didn't play a lot, which is sad, because we had four days off.

19
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I decided to go ahead and I played a little bit.

20
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought out the Wii when I went over to my sister's house, and we played a little bit of Excitebots and...

21
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:01,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also, of course, more Grand Theft Auto this week.

22
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:06,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But mainly, I've been busy doing other things.

23
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:18,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be, for some reason, and I don't know why, during the day on Tuesday this week, I just said, hey, you know what?

24
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn a PSP into a MAME cabinet.

25
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I've been doing.

26
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been taking a PSP...

27
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:30,660
[SPEAKER_08]: You get the most random ass little inspirations.

28
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:40,430
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite will always be when you walked in here, episode 300 last year, and you walked in here in your Sackboy costume like, Hey guys, I made a Sackboy costume!

29
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,091
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like, why?

30
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:43,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

31
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:50,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just like, and it's weird, because I had specific requirements I wanted to do.

32
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to be everything that I had in the house already, like just random crap.

33
00:04:56,384 --> 00:05:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically, you know, it's going to be small, like a bar top, but it'll be out of spare parts I had and cardboard boxes.

34
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:33,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually burned my finger on the soldering iron, which kind of sucks.

36
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:55,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, assuming that my soldering isn't absolute crap, which it is, but it looked pretty good, then it will actually be done soon, because I actually finished soldering today, and what I'm actually going to be running on it is not MAME, because they do have MAME for it, but

37
00:05:56,294 --> 00:06:02,499
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I soldered everything, I can't really solder the directional buttons because it's really hard to do that.

38
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So I instead soldered the analog because it's really easy and you can actually use the analog stick in some of the games.

39
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:15,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't select between which emulator I run, I just have to have it auto boot into that emulator.

40
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:22,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one I found that runs pretty well is actually the CPS2 emulator so I can play some Puzzle Fighter on there and Street Fighter and stuff like that.

41
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:29,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's coming along, and hopefully it'll be done this week.

42
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there's some haters in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

43
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun says, PSP MAME sucks.

44
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:34,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

45
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, PSP MAME does kind of suck.

46
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,374
[SPEAKER_02]: CPS2, not that bad, actually.

47
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:41,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs pretty well.

48
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:47,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, you know, this PSP, I haven't used it in like years, okay?

49
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:53,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, Loki's real name isn't Matt, it's Richard Dean Anderson.

50
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Making a MacGyver reference there, which is somewhat true.

51
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And which Actdeft says, Loki Guyver.

52
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that has the same ring to it.

53
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:04,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Alpha Cananogram asks a question though, what version of the PSP is it?

54
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:05,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a 1000, 2000, 3000?

55
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my old 1000 because I bought a 2000.

56
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:13,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about breaking the 2000 because the emulators run better on there, but I can't do that.

57
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:15,393
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the LCD stuff.

58
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:39,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they weren't the actual game, but they were kind of like a step above Game & Watch where the lights would actually be in color.

59
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,785
[SPEAKER_08]: But they actually put them in a cabinet-looking thing, and I think these things were pretty expensive.

60
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,508
[SPEAKER_08]: They were probably $50, $60, which back in 1980 was a lot of money.

61
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were like $30 now.

62
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

63
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:55,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just... I have pictures.

64
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have pictures.

65
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pictures.

66
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,065
[SPEAKER_08]: You should upload some of these to our picture feed.

67
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really show much, anything.

68
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now, other than there's a spider of wires, but here's what I finished before I left.

69
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick, you can see... Sadly, this is horrible radio.

70
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, but...

71
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:12,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where it's going to be the actual control panel.

72
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:21,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm looking at a picture of Loki's cable modem, of which it almost looks like he has wired six buttons into the cable modem.

73
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:22,982
[SPEAKER_08]: The cable modem box.

74
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the box.

75
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, remember, it's all out of boxes.

76
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, are you going to paint over the box?

77
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,467
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's going to be a box.

78
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be the most ghetto-looking thing in the world.

79
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, that's the point.

80
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:33,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

81
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:35,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

82
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,546
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to send this to our picture blog.

83
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

84
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't... I told you it's everything I had in the house.

85
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have packaging tape to put this together, so I'm using duct tape.

86
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,490
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be duct tape all over this.

87
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:49,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to use chicken wire, too.

88
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:50,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any chicken wire, so it's just...

89
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:57,292
[SPEAKER_08]: You are making a PSP MAME cabinet out of a PSP, cardboard boxes, and duct tape.

90
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:00,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, arcade spare parts I have laying in my house.

91
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

92
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:01,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

93
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:06,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, it's... HitStunts come around a little bit and says, this might be cool.

94
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:10,598
[SPEAKER_08]: See, now when you finish it, since it's mini, you're going to have to bring it in here.

95
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:11,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

96
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have a handle on it.

97
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing, I also... And this is assuming that this all works after it's done, you know, because...

98
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:19,008
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

99
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it works once I power it back up again.

100
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,331
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it does, then it should be good to go.

101
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Hey, guess what I got Loki for Christmas?

102
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:49,974
[SPEAKER_08]: A box.

103
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:53,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at least it wasn't your you-know-what-in-a-box like Justin Timberlake.

104
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:55,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

105
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Pywish, big fan of duct tape as a lot of our chatrooms are.

106
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatroom is duct tape fixes everything.

107
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to see this.

108
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Force.

109
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:03,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

110
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:06,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together.

111
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,207
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing is going to be awesomely bad.

112
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to see it.

113
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, please post that picture to our picture blog or something.

114
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few, yeah.

115
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:13,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Or your Twitter at least.

116
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:13,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, somewhere.

117
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:14,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll post them too.

118
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how to log into the ULR Twitter?

119
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,835
[SPEAKER_08]: You should post it there.

120
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:17,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

121
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that info off air.

122
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:21,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Because obviously I'm not going to give out the password on air.

123
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:21,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

124
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:24,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire.

125
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:25,596
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

126
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,099
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, did you find that Gradius game type game you were talking about earlier?

127
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

128
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called AX Raven Elite.

129
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to post a link to the chat room.

130
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:39,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to RocketeerGames.com and give it a try.

131
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:41,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually made by a local.

132
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow, very cool.

133
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, Step 1, put the PSP in a box.

134
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:55,037
[SPEAKER_08]: You should do like a parody video building your PSP MAME cabinet.

135
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Like called PSP in a box or something.

136
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:58,499
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something here.

137
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:05,844
[SPEAKER_02]: When I originally was going to do actually running MAME on there, I actually made a skin for the background that looked like

138
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:07,965
[SPEAKER_02]: MAME but built out of cardboard.

139
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of funny.

140
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,428
[SPEAKER_02]: But now this CPS2 emulator doesn't really have that.

141
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I may also do a Neo Geo emulator.

142
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:15,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't decided yet.

143
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:20,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on which buttons that I've wired work and which don't.

144
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's really what it's going to come down to.

145
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I'm missing any of the buttons that I needed to work, it's just trash.

146
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,499
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing is ruined.

147
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,241
[SPEAKER_08]: In which case, I do believe you should just set fire to it.

148
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:34,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Live on air.

149
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fine.

150
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,762
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make a little bonfire somewhere.

151
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:37,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make it work.

152
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe in DarkSakura's backyard.

153
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:42,403
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll move all the equipment out in the backyard and burn the cabinet live on air.

154
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:43,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that sound like fun?

155
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:44,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

156
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:48,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather take a crowbar to an office space with some loud gangster rap.

157
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:53,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if it was a PSP Go inside, but PSP 1000 is still kind of valuable.

158
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess you bricked it.

159
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:55,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

160
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,265
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not bricked.

161
00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:01,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just... Well, it could be fixed.

162
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

163
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't care because I have another PSP already and I wasn't using this.

164
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:08,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the battery was dead.

165
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:09,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes to fire?

166
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to burn it.

167
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes to grow bar?

168
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:15,150
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

169
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll work.

170
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll work.

171
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:21,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on so we can get to gaming news before, you know, midnight.

172
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, My Gaming Week.

173
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a whole lot of new stuff, but I will say that, you know, I've been very enticed by Steam's various deals that they've had this week.

174
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:31,825
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have seen it.

175
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:33,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Deekman's been posting them to our Twitter every day.

176
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:38,447
[SPEAKER_08]: The Steam deals, and they're all over the game blogs, because there's just been some really cool deals there on Steam.

177
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:51,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of them that I jumped on was Dragon Age Origins was on sale for 25% off, so I think I paid like $37 for it, which, you know, considering it's like $59.99 on 360 or whatever, getting that price on the PC wasn't that bad.

178
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, you know, kind of got into the game and started playing it.

179
00:12:55,771 --> 00:13:07,777
[SPEAKER_08]: But I couldn't really get very far into it before I got highly irritated because my video card apparently kind of sucks and is behind the time and cannot run the game very well even on its lowest settings.

180
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:13,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Things I should have thought about before I plopped the money down for the game, although maybe it's just a sign I need a new video card.

181
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:22,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, since I just bought my computer new last year, that my video card would not suck that bad, but it was one of those, you know, gateway, everything's there.

182
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Gateway, yeah.

183
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:27,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought when I bought it, there was something about the video card.

184
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,907
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to be better than normal, but whatever.

185
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,930
[SPEAKER_08]: So, sadly, I can't give you a fair review of Dragon Age Origins just yet.

186
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,951
[SPEAKER_08]: That wouldn't be a very fair thing of me to review it.

187
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this, though.

188
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:40,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I was quickly immersed into the game.

189
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I did think they did a very good job.

190
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bioware is kind of well-known for this.

191
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:45,776
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

192
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:07,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did feel very immersed in the game and I thought the storytelling was done very well.

193
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did like the fact, you know, just like in Mass Effect that you can kind of direct the conversations and so forth.

194
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, something that Bioware has done very well for.

195
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: They do very well.

196
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I was immersed in it.

197
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll give you a longer review after I get a better video card, which is...

198
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:25,304
[SPEAKER_08]: One versus one.

199
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:55,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Macy's yesterday and I bought something that was half off and I went to the outlets today and I bought clothes because they were all cheap.

200
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:59,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to go to Old Navy for their whole 3 a.m.

201
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: rock band thing.

202
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you do any Black Friday at all, Loki?

203
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Radio Shack.

204
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I couldn't find a screwdriver.

205
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and bought another screwdriver.

206
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I wouldn't think Radio Shack was doing a huge Black Friday discount.

207
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:14,635
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was no one in there.

208
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:15,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a feeling.

209
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:16,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

210
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, so I went out and bought a bunch of clothes.

211
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,617
[SPEAKER_08]: But I noticed with all these deals, I keep thinking maybe it's just selfish or whatever.

212
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep thinking it's stuff for myself.

213
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,122
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm also the type of person, I always do my Christmas shopping on Christmas Eve.

214
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a huge procrastinator like that.

215
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never know what to buy, like tons of people's.

216
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:35,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

217
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking in the chat room and seeing the comments there.

218
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Ricky GoMac says, Get a Mac, Rob!

219
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder why he might be suggesting a Mac.

220
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Ricky, go Mac.

221
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

222
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to get a Mac, but they're a little pricey.

223
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,041
[SPEAKER_08]: They're kind of the Mercedes-Benz of computers.

224
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:52,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

225
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hate on Macs.

226
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:55,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an iPhone.

227
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:56,862
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great for Apple.

228
00:15:56,902 --> 00:16:00,423
[SPEAKER_08]: But my one Mac laptop I did have, unfortunately, didn't last.

229
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:02,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was a little bit disappointed in that.

230
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know how I feel about the desktop.

231
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,324
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says, also be sure your graphics card is an NVIDIA card.

232
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:07,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

233
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,205
[SPEAKER_08]: My one I have right now is an ATI Radeon.

234
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

235
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:11,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

236
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:13,742
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter at all.

237
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this incorrectly.

238
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanis Lux in chat says, Screw Macy's.

239
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:20,944
[SPEAKER_08]: They made my children cry.

240
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:22,805
[SPEAKER_08]: See, now I kind of want to know that story.

241
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:25,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that might be traumatic, but I kind of want to know.

242
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:27,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Santa Claus that made your children cry?

243
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did they not want to take something back?

244
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:30,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to...

245
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,520
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,712
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

247
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,510
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

248
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's really anything after 100.

249
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I think maybe if you get to 1,000, you get more statistics stuff.

250
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:49,652
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to evolve anymore?

251
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:50,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

252
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:51,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's any more evolving.

253
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:52,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really looked into it.

254
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:58,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to ask Seg, my buddy Seg that was on the show a couple weeks ago promoting Umlaut, which is coming up, by the way.

255
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,322
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows more about that stuff than I do.

256
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:05,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't have even known about the short URL if I didn't see him talk about it earlier.

257
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

258
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:08,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

259
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:21,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Daytel is kind of pissed because, you know, you may remember Microsoft blocked their memory cards, their max memory, from working with the last dashboard update.

260
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, you know, dashboard update came, and the max memory cards went.

261
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And, unfortunately, they had a workaround, they said at one time, but...

262
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:34,122
[SPEAKER_02]: LUL

263
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:08,698
[SPEAKER_02]: They have accomplished their recent update by making a system change that will not recognize or allow the operation of a memory card with greater capacity than their own.

264
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that with the power Microsoft enjoys in the market for Xbox accessories, this conduct is unlawful.

265
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:18,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of going with the whole Monopoly thing.

266
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know if they have grounds to stand there.

267
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:30,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, since it is Microsoft's hardware and I think that they pretty much can say who can make what for it.

268
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:40,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do agree, I wish they did have some other memory card options because the Microsoft memory cards and Microsoft hard drives are way too fucking overpriced.

269
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,842
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we're talking like 120 gigabyte hard drive for $200, $150.

270
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:45,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit, you can get way bigger drives for a lot cheaper, so.

271
00:19:51,184 --> 00:20:14,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta admit, this is tricky for me and chat, I'm really curious what you guys think about this one because I'm really on the fence with this because I understand the whole Microsoft is evil and they always have monopolies on everything and they violated antitrust before and you know, all of this I totally understand that side of the argument and yeah, they do charge way too much for like, you know, considering that 120 gig hard drive is dirt cheap

272
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:19,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even like a 512 megabyte memory unit for 50 bucks.

273
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you can buy like 4 gig thumb drives for like $10.

274
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:29,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the part of it, though, where I'm kind of with Microsoft.

275
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is that these companies take huge losses when they put out these consoles.

276
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:42,771
[SPEAKER_08]: When you buy a console from Microsoft, Sony, not Nintendo this time, because we know the Wii was not quite...

277
00:20:43,451 --> 00:21:04,991
[SPEAKER_08]: The same technological level, but in the past they've taken a loss on their systems too Maybe it was a small loss this time, I don't have the data on that, I don't think it was though But Microsoft and Sony take a loss on every console that they sell to you They've got to make that money back other places And that is usually through software, through licensed products, through the licenses and so forth That's how they make their money back

278
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:20,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can sort of see where they have the right to lock out the unauthorized products because my fear is, my ultimate fear is that let's say Datel wins this suit and it just opens the floodgates to all these unauthorized devices that are going to be out there.

279
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:25,061
[SPEAKER_08]: The next round of consoles are going to cost through the roof because companies are not going to want to take a loss on it.

280
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:27,057
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that's going to happen.

281
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:33,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they had a ton of unlicensed products for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 1 and, you know, hell, older consoles and stuff.

282
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Never really affected their sales.

283
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sony also tried to charge out the ass for the PS3 when it first came out.

284
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:44,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were still claiming a loss, but we all laughed them off because we said, too damn much money.

285
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:44,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.

286
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's for other reasons entirely.

287
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:47,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Except the hardcore fans, of course.

288
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,827
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because, hey, let's throw in this really awesome cutting-edge cell processor.

289
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:53,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's throw in some Blu-ray technology.

290
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:55,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's throw in some other crap.

291
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:03,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's so expensive, and to their benefit, they also have allowed their end user to upgrade the hard drive.

292
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just a normal hard drive.

293
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:12,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But Microsoft says, fuck you guys, we're just going to put that normal hard drive inside of a case and then charge you twice as much for it.

294
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,170
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

295
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:45,230
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the fact, though, that a lot of people, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but there was certainly a significant amount of people that were using these devices for the cheat functionalities that, you know, the SD cards, importing the saves, inflating gamer scores, cheating.

296
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:53,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Microsoft is trying to protect Xbox Live because, you know, they market it as, hey, you're paying $50 a year because we lock out this kind of shit.

297
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:57,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't really lock it out permanently.

298
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:04,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have all those game saves and everything are now... I mean, because originally they weren't all signed to the profile.

299
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:13,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you could download game saves and throw them onto your console and kind of save it at a point right before an achievement or something like that and boost your achievement scores.

300
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:17,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But now everything's signed to your user ID, so...

301
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:28,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're the actual user that made that save, you can't really use that save unless you re-sign it on your computer, which you can do that, and you don't really need this memory card to do that.

302
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:30,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really not an excuse.

303
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just them being dicks.

304
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:40,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask this follow-up question very plainly because SalaciousPop asks this in chat, and I kind of want to know this too because I kind of agree with his thought here.

305
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,247
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, can't you put save games on like a thumb drive?

306
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It reads USB fine.

307
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:45,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm missing something.

308
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:46,488
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't.

309
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:47,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

310
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:51,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I always assumed you could, because you could do MP3s and videos and all that other stuff.

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,681
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you could put it on a thumb drive, then it wouldn't fucking matter that they have their stupid little memory cards.

312
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't, because obviously that'd be the easiest route.

313
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:00,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't even buy the stupid little memory card.

314
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess so.

315
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it makes sense now that you're saying it, but I just kind of always thought.

316
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:05,885
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, I've never tried to use it.

317
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:10,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the type that wants to cheat in games and all this and so forth.

318
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I never really thought to use this.

319
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:17,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I never even owned a Game Genie back in the day, although I thought they were interesting.

320
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,928
[SPEAKER_02]: They were awesome.

321
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too bad we don't have anything like that anymore.

322
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:20,609
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

323
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:22,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything got too... Not anymore.

324
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all game saves now.

325
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, I always wondered how they found those codes for Game Genie.

326
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:30,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, did somebody have to sit there and actually go 00001?

327
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:38,515
[SPEAKER_08]: or was it because of the fact it was hexadecimal based, they could go into the programming and figure it out?

328
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:42,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They had cheat programs similar to that on the PC for cheating and stuff.

329
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:43,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's memory searches.

330
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:48,938
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have five lives right now, do a memory search for five.

331
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I die once, do a memory search for four.

332
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I die again, do a memory search for three.

333
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,701
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it narrows down those memory addresses until you get the one that actually controls

334
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Curiosity, I don't even know if you know this, would a PS3 let you do it?

335
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:27,588
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3, yes, will let you put game saves on a thumb drive.

336
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:28,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

337
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:29,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't sell memory cards.

338
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all open.

339
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

340
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:34,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all thumb drives.

341
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:35,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use whatever you want.

342
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:39,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony fanboys, if you haven't thought to add that to your arsenal of web forum...

343
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:41,913
[SPEAKER_08]: They're harassing.

344
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,294
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something for you.

345
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:46,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Their memory cards are just USB drives, basically.

346
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just signed different and they're shaped different.

347
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,043
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got, you know, but it's basically a UMD drive.

348
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:55,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not UMD, USB drive.

349
00:25:56,066 --> 00:26:02,031
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt in chat asks, or says, basically, I was really hoping they were going to drop the price of the HDs this holiday season.

350
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, kind of surprising they didn't.

351
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

352
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,071
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw in chat says, do you mean a trainer?

353
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,213
[SPEAKER_08]: When you were talking about that memory scan software.

354
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,795
[SPEAKER_08]: For PC games, you used a program called a trainer.

355
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:37,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You load the PC game first, then load the trainer program, and it will modify what's in the memory so you can run some cheats.

356
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,940
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from TigerClaw.

357
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,463
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not a trainer, but this is like predating all the trainers and stuff.

358
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:45,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a trainer usually is all the hard work's done for you.

359
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:50,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, okay, hit button one to have infinite ammo or something like that.

360
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are nice, but

361
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about something, it was actually just a program I mean this is back

362
00:26:55,863 --> 00:27:23,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Floppies and Shareware Days It was just a program that you'd run that basically would work with any PC titles because it's just a memory search function and you can do searches and stuff on different values and I think the registered version of it or whatever had an ability to figure something out with life bars because life bars are hard to determine since you don't know what the actual number is it's just kind of a percentage so

363
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

364
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this was like years ago.

365
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:31,677
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, obviously now they have trainers for everything that come out.

366
00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:33,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

367
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:37,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickly to kind of wrap this up and move on with the show, and Jamie, I don't know if you have a thought on this either.

368
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,246
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think this lawsuit's going to go?

369
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:47,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think Daytale's going to be shit out of luck, or do you think maybe they have something with this whole Monopoly thing?

370
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're going to be shit out of luck because they're going to be like... It's going to be... Well, you can make peripherals for us, but you just have to pay us a licensing fee and we have to approve it.

371
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

372
00:27:58,629 --> 00:27:59,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going to win.

373
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:00,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, agree?

374
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:01,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Disagree?

375
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:04,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could go either way.

376
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:05,735
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest...

377
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we haven't had other peripherals be locked out before on certain systems.

378
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, I know that I couldn't use certain third-party controllers for certain games back in the day.

379
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of look at it as being along the same lines.

380
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:26,617
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it would really have to be a situation of...

381
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:33,303
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

382
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta say, for me, either way, this story sucks.

383
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if Datel wins, then I truly believe that's going to drive the price of the consoles up, and they're going to use that as justification.

384
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:59,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they lose, then all those people that spent money on that device lose.

385
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:01,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the consumer loses.

386
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:02,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the buyer beware.

387
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:04,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Womp, womp, womp, womp

388
00:29:33,117 --> 00:29:34,097
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

389
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:56,846
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:38,357
[SPEAKER_08]: and they actually had a version of it in Super Nintendo that was pretty badass and it's one of the games that's going to be featured on my box cabinet because it's a Capcom system of course but for those of you that don't have the skill to build a cabinet out of boxes and duct tape you can also put it on any homebrew enabled PSP too so they work pretty well

391
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:40,078
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG Spoilers

392
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more excited about Magic Sword than I am Final Fight.

393
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I did love that game too, I gotta say.

394
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:19,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say this about Final Fight, is that apparently some of the fighters and very familiar faces are making their way into Super Street Fighter 4.

395
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:24,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to admit, from what I do remember and love about Final Fight, I think this is awesome.

396
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:29,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Cody and Guy are making their way to Super Street Fighter 4 according to the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.

397
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:44,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Also making an appearance, Adon from Street Fighter Alpha So those were three new characters that were announced this week I believe Cody's been in a game before Yeah, Alpha 3, also he's going to be one of the characters coming up in Street Fighter 4

398
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:46,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

399
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very cool, I think.

400
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:51,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I thought you were still talking about Final Fight.

401
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:52,208
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

402
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And this whole new crossover is kind of interesting.

403
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:58,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of miss the whole Alpha series of Street Fighter.

404
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,590
[SPEAKER_08]: That all happened during that period of my life where I wasn't as into video games.

405
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,990
[SPEAKER_08]: So I never really played those games.

406
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So I never realized that they had the crossover.

407
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:13,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I do remember Hagar, the mayor, in Saturday Night Slammasters, which was also completely underrated Capcom classic.

408
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: we had that at my arcade that I worked at that was the ultimate pizzeria arcade game I loved that game also on there shut up

409
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:26,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

410
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:29,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma asked in chat real quick before we get to another story here.

411
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone remember Mighty Final Fight?

412
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:32,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

413
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that the version that was on the NES as opposed to the Super Nintendo?

414
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wasn't like all kind of super deformed.

415
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:39,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all the chibi characters.

416
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,146
[SPEAKER_08]: What was an 8-bit port, you know?

417
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember that game.

418
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:45,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it wasn't as great because it was an 8-bit port.

419
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:48,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But DarkSakura, why don't you do one more story for us?

420
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to get to our interview tonight.

421
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:51,709
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

422
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:52,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have it coming up.

423
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But how about some PC news?

424
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Valve is basically sticking their tongue out and waggling it at all the people that are boycotting Steamworks.

425
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:09,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I'm actually laughing.

426
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:22,540
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying basically that any digital distributors who are boycotting PC games because they come with Steamworks services are missing out on an opportunity.

427
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually saying that...

428
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:42,356
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see different companies like Direct2Drive, Impulse and GamersGate that didn't want to sell Modern Warfare 2 because it had the Steamworks tools acting as a storefront for Steam.

429
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:48,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're saying that if you make a good game it should be out through as many channels as possible.

430
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,025
[SPEAKER_08]: on my system.

432
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what I asked for.

433
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever you download iTunes, it tries to install Safari on your system.

434
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:19,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't ask for fucking Safari.

435
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:20,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted iTunes.

436
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I do find that kind of shit annoying.

437
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:30,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize maybe it's a little different because Steamworks directly does relate to the games, but I can kind of see their point.

438
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:38,295
[SPEAKER_08]: When you get these things you didn't ask for that even eat up 1K of memory, it's a bit of an annoyance.

439
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:55,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what the word is is that they've actually based the inclusion of it on what customers have asked for and that they've actually sold the games as well through Steam as they have in the stores, especially Modern Warfare 2.

440
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:02,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment in our chat room at chat.orangeleisure.com says, Sorry, I call for a boycott of the boycott.

441
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:06,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps that's something he needs to start.

442
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:06,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

443
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:07,733
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

444
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:09,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I say if people don't want it, don't get it.

445
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,462
[SPEAKER_03]: If people want it, get it.

446
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:12,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

447
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:13,968
[SPEAKER_03]: You can uninstall the shit.

448
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:22,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Vannis Lux in our chat says those distributors that didn't carry Modern Warfare 2 cut themselves out of a crap load of money and that's about all the effect it had.

449
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:26,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And Gold Anthro wants to point out not only Safari but also QuickTime.

450
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:36,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I give them a buy on that because the movies that play in iTunes when you download movies and TV shows which is an integral part of the system are in a QuickTime proprietary format.

451
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I however refuse to install Safari.

452
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Safari is ass on a PC.

453
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,142
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

454
00:35:57,578 --> 00:35:58,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Chrome.

455
00:35:58,859 --> 00:35:59,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Chrome.

456
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:21,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad there's choices now, whereas it's not Internet Explorer seeming to dominate as much as they used to.

457
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:24,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they still are the number one, but not nearly the hold they used to have.

458
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:32,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Firefox actually is a lot more secure now in general than Internet Explorer is and has a lot more functionality.

459
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:40,025
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of places are really starting to embrace it over Internet Explorer.

460
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw what happened to Netscape.

461
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:43,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Netscape's gone.

462
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:44,136
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

463
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:06,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see that.

464
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:11,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we got to move on because we actually have a rare live interview tonight.

465
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,575
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times our interviews are pre-taped, but we actually have a live interview tonight.

466
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:19,602
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to ask you guys, especially here in studio, how many of you guys have seen this video that's floating around YouTube right now?

467
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:20,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this little...

468
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:23,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to you and Megzi, I've seen both.

469
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:41,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the end, obviously, it's this little video that kind of parries using these Sackboy characters.

470
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:43,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of gone viral this week.

471
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:45,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very interesting.

472
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:49,151
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing was created by this gentleman, Brian Moreno.

473
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:55,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, his little big plan has been continuing to grow via the online co-op mode that you've heard about this week.

474
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:59,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And after one year of release, the online community is still going.

475
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of us kind of, you know...

476
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:04,085
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

477
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: continue to make good on that.

478
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:26,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this video going viral is just kind of an example of that.

479
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:32,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So this video, which you can find Little Bad Romance, YouTube user Brian RDM, it was on YouTube.

480
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it got posted to NeoGAF, which is, you know, this huge, huge gaming forum.

481
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:37,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you've heard of it.

482
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it spread through Twitters, through Facebooks.

483
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,199
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I found it.

484
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,340
[SPEAKER_08]: An OLR member posted it on their Twitter.

485
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,021
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I found it.

486
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:46,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it got coverage on Kotaku, other blogs, so forth.

487
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Ironically, Lady Gaga, she's also big right now.

488
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:54,245
[SPEAKER_08]: She just started a big tour of hers last week.

489
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,606
[SPEAKER_08]: 50,000 views on YouTube tonight.

490
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:57,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Just about 50,000.

491
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:58,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Just shy of it.

492
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:02,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to get Brian Moreno here on the show to talk a little bit about this and about the LittleBigPlanet community.

493
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're actually going to give him a call right now.

494
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully he is standing by.

495
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:08,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

496
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:08,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, is this Brian?

497
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:09,170
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Brian.

498
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:09,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Brian, how you doing?

499
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,531
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

500
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:33,713
[SPEAKER_08]: We are doing great.

501
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:38,894
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just kind of checking out your video here in studio, looking at it, the little bad romance.

502
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:40,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations on the success.

503
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:42,115
[SPEAKER_08]: About 50,000 views now, huh?

504
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's pretty mind-blowing.

505
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:49,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever think that this was going to catch on as big as it did?

506
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my friend were actually talking about this yesterday.

507
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:59,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought maybe 1,000, 2,000 modest views, a laugh between ourselves, and then

508
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:08,074
[SPEAKER_06]: all of a sudden the second day it was posted it was number three most viewed in its category in Russia and 95th most viewed on YouTube that day

509
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty amazing.

510
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea it was going to go that far.

511
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:13,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some questions for you.

512
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:14,299
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, I got to know, Brian...

513
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:39,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Lady Gaga is huge.

514
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,300
[SPEAKER_08]: People love this new album.

515
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,701
[SPEAKER_08]: She has these super fans.

516
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:51,526
[SPEAKER_08]: People get on YouTube and they do karaoke, they dance, do whatever interpretive thing to bad romance.

517
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,928
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you decide, I'm going to do a tribute, but I'm going to do it in LittleBigPlanet?

518
00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:59,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a mixture of many things.

519
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I work, one of my steady gigs is a club photographer here in Orange County.

520
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:10,817
[SPEAKER_06]: and October last year, I actually had an opportunity to photograph and meet Lady Gaga.

521
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,658
[SPEAKER_06]: This was right before her career exploded.

522
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:17,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was the nicest person I've ever met.

523
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:18,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 2 a.m.

524
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,439
[SPEAKER_06]: The show was over.

525
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Fans were outside of her trailer and security was leaving.

526
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And she said it herself.

527
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,961
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I'm going to be here until I take a picture and take an autograph for everyone.

528
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:30,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone.

529
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:32,836
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, she did something like that recently, too.

530
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it, like a Best Buy in L.A.

531
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:35,918
[SPEAKER_08]: that all these people came out.

532
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,919
[SPEAKER_08]: She said, I'm not leaving until I sign all your stuff.

533
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: She's great about her and her fans.

534
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:46,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I've thought she's the greatest person since I met her.

535
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with the release of The Fame Monster, I mean, I've been hooked on that album.

536
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's so much better than her original release.

537
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

538
00:41:56,897 --> 00:42:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: and then when it came to LittleBigPlanet I had been a fan of it since it had been announced E3 how many years ago and just the ability to be able to create whatever you want and how accessible it was to everyone it just, me being a fan of those two it just seems like the perfect recipe for something that would go far that would have long legs So it just kind of worked out in your mind I like this, I like this, what happens when we throw them together?

539
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:28,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, some could say that's the same way this show started.

540
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:32,418
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Jamie, remember it was about, hey, I like video games and we do amateur radio.

541
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do a radio show about video games.

542
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to paraphrase the quote is, two great tastes that go great together.

543
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:38,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

544
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:41,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a question for you, Brian.

545
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:43,633
[SPEAKER_08]: How long did this whole thing take?

546
00:42:43,713 --> 00:42:48,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I got to say, one thing that impressed me when I saw this video is I was thinking, wait a minute.

547
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:52,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll admit, anyone that's been listening to the show a long time, I'm a big old fan of Lady Gaga.

548
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she's great.

549
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, I'm not going to be here at the show on December 13th because I'm going to Monster Ball.

550
00:42:57,762 --> 00:42:58,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't be more excited.

551
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:03,826
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to say, that video came out like Tuesday.

552
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:08,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And this video seemed like it was on the internet not even 10 days later.

553
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,611
[SPEAKER_08]: How long did this whole thing take you to put together?

554
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:14,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Hours and hours and hours and hours.

555
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:18,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in fear of my 60 gigabyte PlayStation hitting the dirt.

556
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I was afraid of it dying how much I was on it.

557
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:26,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, maybe a good 48, 64 hours total.

558
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:36,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just trial and error on making those costumes and matching it with the video and making the set pieces and doing what I could with the tools that I had provided.

559
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Was anyone helping you out with it?

560
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:42,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I noticed in a lot of the scenes, it seems like there were always three Sack Boys.

561
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:45,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So was that just you kind of coordinating three controllers?

562
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did you have a couple friends helping you?

563
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:13,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, in set pieces and costume design, it was just me and the PlayStation and me tweeting it to friends or Facebooking it to friends to see how well they thought it matched up.

564
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:23,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you know, this is kind of a subjective question here, but would you say that the tools that Media Molecule gives you in LittleBigPlanet made this process easy?

565
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:29,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know you talked about it takes hours and hours, but it takes hours and hours to build a really good level in LittleBigPlanet, too.

566
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:38,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you have the tools you needed to produce this video good, or do you think there was something that Media Molecule could have given you that would have made this whole thing easier?

567
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:43,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the process, it went well.

568
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:49,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I did discover limitations that I did not know existed in the game.

569
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:58,605
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the issues was hair with me, because hair for me, I wanted to get the right colors and really differentiate from the Gaga Sat Girl.

570
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:03,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the problems is, for a lot of the hairstyles, you can't actually change the hair color.

571
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:10,855
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way I had to go around that was using stickers and carefully putting colored stickers on the hair.

572
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: but another limitation in that is it seems that items only have a maximum of three stickers that you can place on an object before it'll erase the first one put in and put in the new one.

573
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:36,330
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, it's a 2.5D perspective game and you couldn't get the camera in some ways that you could, especially in close-ups.

574
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way I found a way around that is

575
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:46,321
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go open the pop-it menu and go to the customize Sackboy option, it zooms in the camera to maximize the screen on your Sackboy.

576
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:51,205
[SPEAKER_06]: When you press circle and get out of that, the camera stays on that perspective.

577
00:45:51,545 --> 00:45:57,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how I was able to get a lot of the close-ups because the camera tools that they give you don't get that close.

578
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:00,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a tip for other aspiring video makers out there.

579
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:05,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of which, was this really like the first thing you really did in LittleBigPlanet?

580
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Or have you made levels before?

581
00:46:07,356 --> 00:46:08,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you done other projects?

582
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:11,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just the first one everybody seems to notice.

583
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:22,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fooled around with LittleBigPlanet back in the beta, and I had made a kind of inside joke level for one of the websites that I'm a forum member for, thenextlevel.com.

584
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,392
[SPEAKER_06]: But after that, it's just

585
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:33,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I really didn't have the time and so many other great games were coming out, but it was always in the back of my head that I always wanted to do something with LittleBigPlanet.

586
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was just with the Gaga and the LittleBigPlanet and me wondering what would happen with those two.

587
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I went out and bought a capture device and I was like, I'm going to do this.

588
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:45,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take my time and I'm going to make sure I make something great.

589
00:46:45,673 --> 00:46:46,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

590
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:48,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying you bought the video capture device just for this project?

591
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:51,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for this project.

592
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That is dedication.

593
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:58,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, since Lady Gaga is so generous to her fans and so forth, do you think there might be a chance she's seen it?

594
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:02,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have no idea if she's seen it.

595
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope she does.

596
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:09,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spammed her Twitter every time I posted the link to that video.

597
00:47:09,414 --> 00:47:17,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know for sure that some people in Media Molecule have seen it because if you go on their official YouTube page, it is one of their favorites.

598
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:22,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope Media Molecule gets me on that, because I'll help anyone I need to to get those costumes done right.

599
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:40,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

600
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:45,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hey, you're kind of the perfect guy to ask about this because you said you were in the beta and all this too.

601
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:58,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were just talking before you came on the air about how LittleBigPlanet, a lot of us didn't really believe Media Molecule a couple years ago, or I should say a year ago when this game first came out, that they weren't going to just jump right in and do LittleBigPlanet 2.

602
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:01,686
[SPEAKER_08]: They came out and said, no, we're going to continue to support LittleBigPlanet.

603
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:06,669
[SPEAKER_08]: and they've really made good on that promise to a lot of our surprise, a very pleasant surprise.

604
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:12,753
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think it is about the game that keeps this community going strong a year after the game is out?

605
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:14,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it all these constant updates?

606
00:48:14,574 --> 00:48:17,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the fact that people keep building these pop culture references?

607
00:48:18,157 --> 00:48:18,577
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

608
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like overall it's very charming to look at and it's very peculiar to look at.

609
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:27,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing else really out there like that.

610
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,664
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of all I really feel that it's

611
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:30,605
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

612
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to just enjoy this and move on to other projects.

613
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:30,518
[SPEAKER_06]: What this video was, was a part of a whole of a project that I was doing actually for one of my college classes.

614
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:32,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about to graduate finally.

615
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:39,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of about context and what would happen if I took something and put it in somewhere, something else.

616
00:49:39,848 --> 00:49:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: What would happen...

617
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:45,984
[SPEAKER_06]: The next part of the series, I guess I'll give you a little exclusive right now.

618
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: My next video, using LittleBigPlanet and kind of going along with these puff references, is going to be remaking the New Moon trailer.

619
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:55,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dear Lord.

620
00:49:57,548 --> 00:50:01,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, you know, if there's anything bigger than Gaga, it's a new moon.

621
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

622
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,271
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

623
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:05,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's...

624
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:12,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to continue doing stuff with LittleBigPlanet.

625
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:22,070
[SPEAKER_06]: With NeoGAF, I promised them that if this made it on any gaming blogs that I would go along and do some of their music video requests.

626
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of them that they've requested are Thriller and White Wedding.

627
00:50:27,373 --> 00:50:37,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So really going to have to see if those are possible because I did stretch the limits and really got really creative with what I was given to be able to get the costumes as close as they could look.

628
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,638
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I gotta say, it's getting a lot of mixed feedback in our chat room.

629
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:48,103
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting some LOLs and XDs, and then of course the Do Not Wants and so forth for the new Moon trailer.

630
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,926
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like this from Tigerclaw.

631
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:53,288
[SPEAKER_08]: How are they going to make a Sackboy turn into a wolf?

632
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:57,031
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bochikawa says, roll full, sparkly, and wolf Sackboys.

633
00:50:57,371 --> 00:50:58,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess we'll see, huh?

634
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll figure it out.

635
00:51:03,821 --> 00:51:08,925
[SPEAKER_08]: If this whole thing was for school, I hope to hell you get an A. I hope so.

636
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,006
[SPEAKER_08]: You got robbed.

637
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:11,908
[SPEAKER_08]: You play this for your professor.

638
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:13,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Give Brian an A. He earned it.

639
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: This will actually be part of the package that I turn into him.

640
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be.

641
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:20,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, awesome.

642
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:20,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go.

643
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:29,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know, Brian, one thing we like to ask everybody we have on the show, you know, just a standard question for all the guests because we always ask it to ourselves at the top of every show.

644
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,922
[SPEAKER_08]: What video games have you been playing this week?

645
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:33,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, besides LittleBigPlanet, of course.

646
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:38,605
[SPEAKER_06]: The matter is, is what haven't I been playing this week?

647
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:42,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing Dizzidia, Final Fantasy on the PSP.

648
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:44,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too sure about that one.

649
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:48,051
[SPEAKER_06]: When I played it at E3 earlier this year, I was kind of

650
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea what was going on, but I'm getting used to it.

651
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:52,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really enjoying it.

652
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:54,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really big fan service.

653
00:51:55,499 --> 00:52:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, playing the original Left 4 Dead because I already bought Left 4 Dead 2 on Black Friday and haven't even finished the first one.

654
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:06,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and a friend also went to the 3 a.m.

655
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:11,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Old Navy Black Friday opening and we got ourselves a copy of Lego Rock Band.

656
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:15,369
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been rocking out with that with Elton John and Vampire Weekend.

657
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:17,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

658
00:52:17,174 --> 00:52:24,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I was debating doing that, but I was like, I don't want to fight all those people at 3 in the morning, so props to you for doing that.

659
00:52:24,176 --> 00:52:28,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting, too, because LEGO Rock Band is another game with very cute-looking avatars.

660
00:52:29,597 --> 00:52:34,119
[SPEAKER_08]: You think you might have something there with LEGO Rock Band and making fan videos?

661
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:35,559
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing with LEGO Rock Band is...

662
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:39,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for me, I really need those tools.

663
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:45,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as I've seen, Lego Rock Band doesn't give me anywhere close to what LittleBigPlanet does.

664
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:46,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Very true.

665
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of being able to create and being able to have some control.

666
00:52:51,183 --> 00:53:01,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides LittleBigPlanet, I am going to start looking into Uncharted 2 because I remember hearing there's a movie-making mode where you can do all kinds of camera tricks and lip-syncing, I believe, is in there.

667
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what I can do with that.

668
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:03,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really...

669
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:16,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really trying to get into these electronic format and electronic creative ways to continue this project beyond just the school project and the assignment requirements.

670
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:24,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Brian, it sounds like you're going to be able to use this as kind of a launch for future Mashima and types of movies based around video games, so props to you.

671
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:27,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Where can the listeners keep tabs on you and your future projects?

672
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:32,988
[SPEAKER_06]: The easiest way is going onto my website, www.brianmoreno.com

673
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:36,033
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find me on YouTube.

674
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It's youtube.com slash BrianRDM.

675
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Those will be the quickest and easy ways to keep up on any of the work I do.

676
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:48,698
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and stay tuned there for the soon-to-come LittleBigPlanet New Moon trailer, which you heard about here on OLR First.

677
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Brian.

678
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:51,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate that exclusive and everything else.

679
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And best of luck to you in your future endeavors.

680
00:53:54,831 --> 00:54:10,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys, I want to thank you guys, Kotaku, NeoGaf, The Next Level, all the listeners on Orange Lounge Radio, everyone on YouTube, Lady Gaga, everything because without all of you guys this wouldn't be anywhere close to what it was.

681
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:21,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad we can kind of make your day with all of this and you know what, I really smiled and got a good laugh in a really positive way out of the video when I first saw it so I'm glad we can kind of turn it around back to you.

682
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:23,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, thank you guys.

683
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care Brian, have a good one.

684
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:27,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care guys, bye.

685
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:27,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

686
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:27,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

687
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:29,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was fun.

688
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,080
[SPEAKER_08]: He definitely sounds like he's going to kind of use this to kind of start something else.

689
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And although, you know, this may be the one that's really big and maybe the other ones, but I don't know.

690
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:41,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that one was so good and he's right.

691
00:54:41,603 --> 00:54:42,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very well done.

692
00:54:42,523 --> 00:54:43,564
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was quite impressed.

693
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:50,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether I like it or not, you know, I like Gaga, but I don't like Twilight nearly as much.

694
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually looking forward to seeing how that pans out.

695
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:53,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I love...

696
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:56,349
[SPEAKER_08]: He's right.

697
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,692
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing bigger than Gaga is Twilight, so why the hell not?

698
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:02,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, you're totally right.

699
00:55:02,835 --> 00:55:05,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Who doesn't love a good Weird Al song no matter what it is he's parodying, right?

700
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:07,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, he should do a Weird Al video.

701
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully he's listening.

702
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:11,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, a Weird Al one, that would be good.

703
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

704
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:14,334
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

705
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was fun.

706
00:55:16,115 --> 00:55:16,776
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

707
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:20,059
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some more news here before we get to our classic game of the week.

708
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Part B tonight, 7 o'clock here in California.

709
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 o'clock for those folks on the East Coast, but plenty more show to come.

710
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:27,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, what's up next?

711
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:39,752
[SPEAKER_02]: As we alluded to in our intro, although the podcast won't be privy to that, New York State apparently now has teamed up with Microsoft to issue emergency alerts via Xbox Live.

712
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:47,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of similar to, I guess, the Amber Alerts that we have and other emergency broadcast system stuff.

713
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to let you know if there's a natural disaster, terrorist attack, disaster.

714
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:53,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You name it.

715
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:55,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever requires them to do it.

716
00:55:55,813 --> 00:56:01,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope they don't do the tests with that, and I also hope they don't have that annoying beep that goes with it.

717
00:56:02,557 --> 00:56:12,143
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a message to me might be fine, but man, I hate watching TV and all of a sudden there's like an Amber Alert thing going on and all the audio cuts out, and it's like, dude, I'm inside my house.

718
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna see some guy driving around with his stolen child in my house, okay?

719
00:56:17,284 --> 00:56:18,164
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

720
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really have to use a device like this.

721
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:36,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.

722
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,873
[SPEAKER_08]: We're using Amber Alert.

723
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the type of thing they're talking about here?

724
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:39,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidnap kids?

725
00:56:39,714 --> 00:56:41,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mainly emergency broadcast system stuff.

726
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:46,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly, I think it's because New York and the whole 9-11 thing.

727
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:50,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm sure other states are probably looking into something like this too.

728
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:50,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

729
00:56:51,162 --> 00:56:56,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the gaming consoles are exactly a good platform for that because most people would be like, God damn it.

730
00:56:56,825 --> 00:56:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's messaging me now?

731
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go finish this game first.

732
00:56:59,947 --> 00:57:00,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

733
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:03,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Terror, Terror Alert, you know, Death Inimitator.

734
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:06,169
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ah!

735
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:08,210
[SPEAKER_08]: The Vs have arrived, get out of town.

736
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,610
[SPEAKER_08]: The bomb has gone off already.

737
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That bothers me.

738
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:12,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

739
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:21,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I, no, I don't like using, okay, that was, that's like seriously my big pet peeve with that show is I'm calling them the Vs that, no.

740
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:27,414
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole point of the V in the original series was the reference to World War II.

741
00:57:28,482 --> 00:57:29,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

742
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:31,267
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know in the new one they got the whole... I know.

743
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:31,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

744
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's retarded.

745
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:32,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

746
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:41,704
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, regardless, all joking aside, I gotta say, though, you know, when they originally incorporated the emergency broadcast system, wasn't it kind of a similar deal?

747
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:51,968
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people use their free time playing TV, or playing TV, watching TV, and so the emergency broadcast system would alert those people who aren't glued to the radio or going outside.

748
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this kind of makes sense in a way.

749
00:57:54,669 --> 00:58:00,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they use this tastefully, like, hey, there's a fucking fire right by you right now.

750
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:03,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it might be a good idea to get the fuck out and stop playing your game.

751
00:58:04,152 --> 00:58:08,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually don't think it's a bad idea, but again, it's just about how much they use it.

752
00:58:08,955 --> 00:58:12,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if it's an Amber Alert every other hour, people are going to get pissed off.

753
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:17,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's for big stuff, like you need to leave your home, you need to evacuate or something.

754
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:26,683
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's an absolute emergency like that, they have a way to call all the phones and have an automated message play so you can pick up your phone.

755
00:58:26,743 --> 00:58:29,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most people might not be playing a game console.

756
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:32,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's that crackling, rumbling sound?

757
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:34,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh hey, it's fire!

758
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

759
00:58:36,828 --> 00:58:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play it over level, it's far enough away.

760
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just a neat idea.

761
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just interesting to see how it's implemented.

762
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:48,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be just about as effective as it is on TV.

763
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, if you're like me, that's the time that I go get a snack.

764
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that noise is... Oh god, I hate it.

765
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,402
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat took the words right out of my mouth.

766
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:01,503
[SPEAKER_08]: The next step would be announcements in WoW.

767
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, those people won't leave their homes anyway.

768
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:06,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

769
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:08,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I resemble that remark, thank you very much.

770
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:12,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Janayan Chat, yes, it just goes in the next time.

771
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:15,796
[SPEAKER_08]: We interrupt this WoW raid for this important Amber Alert.

772
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, guys, I'm not trying to belittle Amber Alerts.

773
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:27,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it's an important thing, but I think that type of thing works best, you know, on the highway, where the cars are, you know, on the signs on the highway, you know...

774
00:59:27,987 --> 00:59:31,228
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how would you feel if you were playing a game and then suddenly...

775
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:55,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire, Get Out

776
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:21,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire in Bakersfield Do not give a crap.

777
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:25,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sucks to be people in Bakersfield, but don't know.

778
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:27,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I would want to have it be my specific zip code, maybe.

779
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,064
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be more appropriate.

780
01:00:40,244 --> 01:00:47,550
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom collectively, I'm just kind of attributing this to several people in the chatroom, seem to think that the iPhone is a good idea for these types of alerts.

781
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've heard that talk before too, is alerts through text message.

782
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:53,274
[SPEAKER_08]: which I think could be very effective.

783
01:00:53,294 --> 01:00:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

784
01:00:53,995 --> 01:00:55,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get charged text messaging.

785
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:58,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if you have an iPhone.

786
01:00:58,938 --> 01:01:00,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and your carrier doesn't charge.

787
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:05,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I know even when I had Sprint and I got charged for every message on my plan, they didn't charge for messages they sent.

788
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:06,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

789
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:08,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I wouldn't think those you'd get charged for.

790
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times, though, it's built into your iPhone plan to have a certain number.

791
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:20,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even if a little app you could download that's like an alert app or something.

792
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:20,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

793
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:21,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh.

794
01:01:21,841 --> 01:01:24,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not have the same impact, though, that just sending everybody text messages.

795
01:01:24,603 --> 01:01:25,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Just send it to your email.

796
01:01:25,784 --> 01:01:25,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

797
01:01:25,904 --> 01:01:27,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have stuff that goes to your email.

798
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:32,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, SJ100Matt makes the joke, Nintendo will send their Amber Alerts through friend codes.

799
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:35,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So an Amber Alert will look like 012463.

800
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:38,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

801
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, hey, speaking of WoW came up in that last story and WoW is the attention this week of a lawsuit.

802
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:46,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

803
01:01:47,498 --> 01:01:52,880
[SPEAKER_08]: One million dollars in a complaint against Activision Blizzard over the design of World of Warcraft.

804
01:01:53,241 --> 01:02:03,205
[SPEAKER_08]: This complaint says the publisher maintains a quote harmful virtual environment to many of its customers by forcing them to follow the game's sneaky and deceitful practices.

805
01:02:03,905 --> 01:02:08,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well now, what would you think about this lawsuit if I told you it was filed by Eric Estavio?

806
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:12,029
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the guy who filed the lawsuit against Sony.

807
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And the judge basically laughed it out of court.

808
01:02:14,991 --> 01:02:18,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So he went and sued Microsoft and Nintendo, which we reported on last week.

809
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:22,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And this week, now he sued Activision Blizzard over this one.

810
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:30,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, as part of this case, Estavio has subpoenaed actress Winona Ryder...

811
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:36,681
[SPEAKER_08]: and Depeche Mode's Martin Lee Gore to testify on his behalf.

812
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:41,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Because apparently, I don't even want to get into it.

813
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:43,185
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just as ridiculous as it sounds.

814
01:02:43,225 --> 01:02:44,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that mean they have to actually show up?

815
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:46,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

816
01:02:46,532 --> 01:02:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he just wanted to meet them.

817
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:56,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reminded of that scene from Clerks the Animated Series where they subpoenaed George Lucas into the courtroom, which didn't this whole topic... I want my money back.

818
01:02:56,477 --> 01:02:58,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't this topic come up on the show like just two weeks ago?

819
01:02:58,698 --> 01:02:59,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week.

820
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:02,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here it is again, probably for the same fucking guy.

821
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:03,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.

822
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just exactly what it sounds like.

823
01:03:05,802 --> 01:03:06,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my $8 back.

824
01:03:07,863 --> 01:03:09,484
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what it sounds like.

825
01:03:09,504 --> 01:03:10,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sue him.

826
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:13,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's have a class action lawsuit against that guy.

827
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:25,953
[SPEAKER_08]: for ruining all of the news sites for having such an impact on the gaming culture and the game blogs for mental anguish that someone could be that stupid

828
01:03:28,086 --> 01:03:29,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch out or we might get sued next.

829
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

830
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,310
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any money.

831
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

832
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:34,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd take him to court.

833
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd fight it all the way.

834
01:03:35,993 --> 01:03:36,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.

835
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:36,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.

836
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: If he sued us, then we could actually petition for damages for cost if this would win.

837
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:47,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd counter-sue.

838
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:49,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'd have money to advertise the show.

839
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:50,169
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome.

840
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:50,870
[SPEAKER_08]: We would.

841
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my thought.

842
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:53,372
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd buy a studio.

843
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:58,796
[SPEAKER_08]: In all seriousness, though, like, okay, this is the point where you relate.

844
01:03:58,816 --> 01:04:02,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, last week we were asking this, but now you really have to ask.

845
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:03,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Money.

846
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:03,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Money.

847
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:03,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Money.

848
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:29,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

849
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

850
01:05:11,229 --> 01:05:13,490
[SPEAKER_08]: That we call him Lord Voldemort here on the show.

851
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,211
[SPEAKER_08]: A few folks invoking that name.

852
01:05:15,231 --> 01:05:17,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, this guy is starting to make Lord Voldemort look good.

853
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:18,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, really.

854
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:23,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, at least you kind of knew what Lord Voldemort was thinking.

855
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:25,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not like you could hire him.

856
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:25,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

857
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:28,324
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just so weird.

858
01:05:30,105 --> 01:05:34,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would like to find this guy and shoot him with a water gun.

859
01:05:35,086 --> 01:05:37,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit, I kind of want him on the show.

860
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:39,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Has this guy made a comment publicly?

861
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:42,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he's made any type of comment publicly.

862
01:05:42,528 --> 01:05:45,489
[SPEAKER_08]: All these blogs are reporting on it when really he should just be banned.

863
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:50,150
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pay the town fool no mind, he will just go away and entertain himself in his house.

864
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody likes the town fool that jumps around and makes an ass of himself.

865
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:54,732
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

866
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:14,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that movie.

867
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:14,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

868
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:17,849
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, totally off topic and I don't care.

869
01:06:18,029 --> 01:06:24,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that there's going to be a stage play soon with Nathan Lane as Gomez and Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia?

870
01:06:25,311 --> 01:06:25,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

871
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:27,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic epicness.

872
01:06:27,432 --> 01:06:28,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Nathan Lane?

873
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:29,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see that.

874
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

875
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:33,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little weird, but let's face it, Raul Julia ain't here no more.

876
01:06:34,414 --> 01:06:37,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they're going to go with this comic Broadway angle, why not?

877
01:06:38,015 --> 01:06:38,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

878
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:41,856
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little chubby for a... You know.

879
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:43,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe he's worked out.

880
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:43,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

881
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:44,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, look.

882
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:49,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Ricky GoMac says about this guy, he just wants to get on Oprah before she's gone.

883
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:52,437
[SPEAKER_08]: This might be the way to do it.

884
01:06:52,477 --> 01:06:52,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

885
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:55,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And then who was it that said that we should go settle this?

886
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:56,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here it is.

887
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:57,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Maysatsuma.

888
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, sue him so you can be on the people's court.

889
01:06:59,961 --> 01:07:08,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if this guy does, for whatever reason, sue us, even though we're totally under our rights to comment on what is a public news story, for whatever wacky reason...

890
01:07:09,246 --> 01:07:10,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the People's Court back in the day when it was Judge Wapner

891
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:28,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I remember that too.

892
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:29,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day.

893
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:31,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that too.

894
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,221
[SPEAKER_08]: You always waited for the day he was going to send somebody to the electorate chair, but it never happened.

895
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:36,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they can.

896
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:37,783
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't.

897
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:38,643
[SPEAKER_02]: They make an exception.

898
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:44,666
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the way TV court works, but you know, sometimes there were just those people on the show that you wish would get the death penalty.

899
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,407
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir, you can't do that.

900
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:48,048
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

901
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:50,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make this exception this one time.

902
01:07:52,203 --> 01:07:53,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I vote for hanging.

903
01:07:54,224 --> 01:07:54,605
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

904
01:07:54,685 --> 01:07:57,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of me just wants to ban this guy from the show.

905
01:07:57,146 --> 01:07:57,626
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

906
01:07:57,686 --> 01:07:59,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to report on this guy ever again?

907
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:00,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what I want to do?

908
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:00,968
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

909
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:02,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to publicly humiliate him.

910
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, isn't he kind of doing that for himself?

911
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:07,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't mean it like that.

912
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:10,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant mock, apart from just what we're doing on the show.

913
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:15,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, is there anything additional we could lend to the rest of the internet?

914
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,444
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get Brian to help us make a little big planet level.

915
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:18,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

916
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:34,347
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got $10 with your name on it because we have no money.

917
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:40,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be a level in LittleBigPlanet where OLR goes to the people's court with Eric.

918
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:44,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's about our adventures of traveling to Judge Leon.

919
01:08:44,056 --> 01:08:49,080
[SPEAKER_03]: We will provide a voice talent with Judge Mr. Spanky.

920
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:52,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, that would be fun.

921
01:08:53,746 --> 01:08:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the mood to do something silly.

922
01:08:56,327 --> 01:08:57,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of making lol sims.

923
01:08:58,629 --> 01:09:01,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to do something funny.

924
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:03,992
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have to brainstorm off air.

925
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:10,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if the chatters have an idea, you can email us at mailbagorangelinger.com, especially if you have LittleBigPlanet skills, because I'm loving this idea.

926
01:09:12,317 --> 01:09:13,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ActDeft has the perfect name for it.

927
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:14,739
[SPEAKER_08]: LittleBigLawSuit.

928
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,121
[SPEAKER_08]: How perfect.

929
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:19,842
[SPEAKER_08]: What a perfect name for this whole story.

930
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,886
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

931
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania, Lords of Shadow

932
01:09:57,638 --> 01:10:00,301
[SPEAKER_03]: and saying that it's a big departure.

933
01:10:00,722 --> 01:10:06,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're a little nervous about how it's going to be received.

934
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:08,912
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be...

935
01:10:12,163 --> 01:10:16,887
[SPEAKER_03]: A free sort of game as in you have a free roaming world.

936
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:19,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You can move through different areas.

937
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:26,674
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also supposed to be a pretty A-list voice credits added in there too.

938
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,216
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're a little nervous because it's going to be a different kind of Castlevania.

939
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:31,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't this the one that had Patrick Stewart in it?

940
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Ian McClellan.

941
01:10:32,178 --> 01:10:32,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

942
01:10:34,801 --> 01:10:35,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

943
01:10:35,843 --> 01:10:36,063
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

944
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The mic's not on.

945
01:10:38,006 --> 01:10:38,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn the mic on.

946
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:39,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Mic is on.

947
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:39,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

948
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:40,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That was weird.

949
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:41,711
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't picking up for some reason.

950
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:42,572
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

951
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:43,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, weird.

952
01:10:43,374 --> 01:10:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the ghost.

953
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:45,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently.

954
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: You read, I'm sorry, go back to the last story.

955
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You read what the lawsuit was about, right?

956
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:53,925
[SPEAKER_08]: about the whole fact that it takes over people's lives.

957
01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't take over people's lives.

958
01:10:55,687 --> 01:11:10,982
[SPEAKER_02]: He's complaining that because the speed of which you walk or run in the game is too slow, and therefore it takes you longer to finish quests, therefore causing you to have to pay longer and longer subscriptions in order to finish the quests in the game.

959
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:12,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his complaint.

960
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:14,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even dumber than, you know, it being addicting.

961
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

962
01:11:17,358 --> 01:11:30,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I would almost not be, like, so pointing and laughing at this guy again if it weren't for the Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode subpoenas because that's where you went from just petty to batshit crazy, in my opinion.

963
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:32,597
[SPEAKER_08]: and Ivorite state my opinion.

964
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:33,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sorry.

965
01:11:33,639 --> 01:11:34,099
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's okay.

966
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:47,037
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to go back to Castlevania because I'm nervous about this new Castlevania game too because let's face it, there hasn't been, in my opinion, a really, really, really memorable, keyword memorable, Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.

967
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:49,452
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

968
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:09,980
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

969
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:40,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't belong in this world.

970
01:13:01,235 --> 01:13:02,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Big hurrah before the end of the year.

971
01:13:03,456 --> 01:13:13,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So first thing first, we've got Avatar coming out on pretty much everything on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

972
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:16,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And this PC as well.

973
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:17,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I be honest with you for a minute?

974
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:17,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

975
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:37,077
[SPEAKER_08]: is it just me or I am so not interested in Avatar it just doesn't look good to me I'll be fair and say I realize that I'm not always into the same type of movies everybody else is but I like Terminator I like Titanic

976
01:13:37,816 --> 01:13:40,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, you know, all these movies that James Cameron's done.

977
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:41,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course I cried.

978
01:13:42,237 --> 01:13:44,138
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm looking at... I cheered.

979
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:45,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking for... Shut up.

980
01:13:45,898 --> 01:13:49,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at Avatar, and I'm just kind of like, oh boy.

981
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:56,001
[SPEAKER_08]: This just... It just looks bloated, long, pompous, and it doesn't look like it's going to be good to me.

982
01:13:56,462 --> 01:13:58,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go see it just because it's going to be in 3D.

983
01:13:58,562 --> 01:14:02,984
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be really awesome, but then if, you know, it sucks, I'll be sure to shout it to the world that it sucks.

984
01:14:04,164 --> 01:14:06,305
[SPEAKER_02]: The game itself is supposed to be good.

985
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:13,364
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been working on it for a few years at least.

986
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be good and not sucky.

987
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see though.

988
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:22,706
[SPEAKER_08]: If my friends all come back and say it was freaking awesome, then I will go see it and maybe I'm wrong.

989
01:14:23,027 --> 01:14:24,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just blame the marketing.

990
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:30,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of with you on that because it does look kind of like it could be lame.

991
01:14:32,962 --> 01:14:38,306
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura just exclaimed, I love salacious pop, referring to one of our chatters.

992
01:14:38,346 --> 01:14:38,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

993
01:14:39,066 --> 01:14:43,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Avatar looks like Starship Troopers plus Warcraft plus The Spirits Within plus corny diarrhea.

994
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,451
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty good way to sum up.

995
01:14:46,731 --> 01:14:48,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is my take on Avatar.

996
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:53,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I am a big fan of Fantech.

997
01:14:54,725 --> 01:15:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: and looking into how they make it, the behind the scenes stuff, the technology going into it, the innovations that are actually being made

998
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: in the CG process, in the motion capture.

999
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:12,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really, really interesting to me.

1000
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

1001
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:25,794
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times I'll go see a movie, even if it's supposed to be the corn and crap, I will see it to see how the final product looks.

1002
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:30,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I do like a lot of movies that people hate.

1003
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:31,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I love bad movies.

1004
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Hypercube.

1005
01:15:34,139 --> 01:16:01,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Xanadu I love Showgirls I love Showgirls too and you got me into that movie you don't know shit but no in the end but you also know that I don't really go for the stuff that's overhyped I really avoid stuff that's overhyped but I think I'll see this one I won't see it opening week because honestly I don't want to see it that bad

1006
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will see it after it's been in the theater for a little bit.

1007
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:05,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mean to turn this into Avatar hate.

1008
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:06,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry.

1009
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:11,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But I had to get that out there because there was just something about it that just wasn't sitting well with me.

1010
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:13,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, maybe it's going to be an awesome movie and I'm totally wrong.

1011
01:16:13,512 --> 01:16:16,193
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love some of the comments from chat.

1012
01:16:16,553 --> 01:16:19,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku says, Avatar equals dances with Smurfs.

1013
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:21,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Dances with Smurfs.

1014
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:23,471
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from South Park.

1015
01:16:23,932 --> 01:16:24,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, was it?

1016
01:16:24,773 --> 01:16:25,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1017
01:16:25,574 --> 01:16:26,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't see this week's episode.

1018
01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:27,596
[SPEAKER_08]: That must be what it is.

1019
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:33,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And then SSJ100Matt saying, I heard it's getting terrible pre-screening reviews.

1020
01:16:33,582 --> 01:16:37,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, this is the time for them to fine-tune it and tailor it and what have you.

1021
01:16:37,446 --> 01:16:40,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope for their sake they can pull it off.

1022
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:42,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I will say this, though, at the same time.

1023
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to go see The Princess and the Frog because I am all about Disney going back to the way they did movies back in the 90s with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and all this.

1024
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because a movie is overhyped doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be bad.

1025
01:16:56,246 --> 01:16:58,667
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been zero hype for that movie.

1026
01:17:00,352 --> 01:17:25,968
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe it's just because I'm a Disney fan and I'll fully admit obviously I'm biased in that regard it looks good but I'm just saying there's been no hype whereas Avatar they were just like fucking your eyeballs in 2009 I don't think so you don't have kids though and I think they've been aiming this at the kids I think it'll do decent I don't think it's going to be like their huge movie but I think it'll do decent enough that they'll get back into doing 2D movies we'll see I think it'll make more than Avatar does

1027
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:29,347
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it won't.

1028
01:17:30,307 --> 01:17:30,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Care to make a wager?

1029
01:17:31,587 --> 01:17:34,348
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't, but I can tell you right now it's not gonna.

1030
01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:34,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried.

1031
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:36,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

1032
01:17:36,369 --> 01:17:37,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, release dates.

1033
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:38,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Derailed the show, my bad.

1034
01:17:39,269 --> 01:17:39,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

1035
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so other things coming out this week.

1036
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:46,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogue Warrior coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1037
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:54,774
[SPEAKER_02]: MX vs. ATV Reflex on the DS, PSP, Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1038
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:00,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And God, I forgot that this movie was coming out, and I really don't want to see this.

1039
01:18:00,867 --> 01:18:04,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Alvin and the Chipmunks' Squeakquel on the Wii and DS this week.

1040
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:06,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Why, God?

1041
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:07,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1042
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:09,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the Chipettes this time.

1043
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:16,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather... I would rather watch, like, Avatar...

1044
01:18:17,863 --> 01:18:21,445
[SPEAKER_08]: for 24 hours straight, or any... Oh, I know what I was going to say.

1045
01:18:21,725 --> 01:18:22,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

1046
01:18:22,905 --> 01:18:26,667
[SPEAKER_08]: When I saw the trailer for Avatar, it looked like an M. Night Shyamalan movie to me.

1047
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:28,668
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what didn't sit well with me.

1048
01:18:28,748 --> 01:18:36,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would rather than watch the new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I would rather watch, what was it called, The Happening, or whatever that latest... It was so horrible.

1049
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:41,194
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you weren't watching The Last Airbender, which is an M. Night Shyamalan movie?

1050
01:18:41,214 --> 01:18:41,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1051
01:18:42,547 --> 01:18:48,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I would rather watch The Happening five times in a row than watch the new Alvin Chipmunks movie.

1052
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:52,792
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, this is actually going back to what you're saying about The Princess and the Frog.

1053
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Becky.

1054
01:18:56,534 --> 01:19:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell Rob that I do have a kid and I actually haven't seen much about Princess and the Frog on Disney Channel yet.

1055
01:19:01,957 --> 01:19:02,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1056
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:05,501
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a two-year-old who watches Phineas and Ferb, Rob.

1057
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I showed you some of that.

1058
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:07,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1059
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:08,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great.

1060
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:09,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1061
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:11,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, I guess, fair enough.

1062
01:19:11,488 --> 01:19:12,329
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what?

1063
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it does come out, and it hasn't come out yet, or it did come out last Friday.

1064
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:17,495
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1065
01:19:17,615 --> 01:19:18,676
[SPEAKER_02]: The Princess and Frog.

1066
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:20,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in only New York and L.A.

1067
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's everywhere the 11th.

1068
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt 2 on PC, the very first DirectX 11 game making its way out Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on the DS this week

1069
01:19:37,675 --> 01:19:57,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Wreck Room, a generic party game for the Wii Storybook Workshop, the latest schlock from Konami coming out on the Wii Seven Wonders 2 on the DS for your casual game fans Safecracker, also casual game fans

1070
01:19:59,484 --> 01:20:03,247
[SPEAKER_02]: World Party Games, yet another generic party game out on the Wii.

1071
01:20:03,628 --> 01:20:09,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, next week we're going to have some really awesome stuff with Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks and Saboteur.

1072
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:11,758
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1073
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:53,671
[SPEAKER_08]: for the most part it's going to be pretty quiet the rest of the year but I will say on the PlayStation 3 they also get Assassin's Creed 2 over there and Fallout 3 again they're also getting some discounts on folklore moving into the PlayStation 3 the best or as they call it their folks soul and Ratchet and Clank's future as well as Resistance Fall of Man those are all going into the best series over in Japan

1074
01:20:54,071 --> 01:20:54,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey!

1075
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:19,847
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting it this week, though, on December 3rd.

1076
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:23,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Sengoku Musou 3 comes out on the Wii as well.

1077
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:25,229
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from Koei Entertainment.

1078
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:28,950
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, I believe, another one of their strategy-type games.

1079
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:33,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the... I think Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

1080
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:38,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Koei did all of those games, and I'm pretty sure this is right in that same vein.

1081
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:38,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Those games are...

1082
01:21:39,492 --> 01:21:42,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Way more popular over there than they are here.

1083
01:21:42,795 --> 01:21:46,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I will say, the game certainly is not without its fans over here.

1084
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,900
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Nintendo DS, Cross Treasures.

1085
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get that out there from Squeenix.

1086
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:55,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out, Kaiju Busters.

1087
01:21:57,369 --> 01:21:58,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1088
01:22:16,644 --> 01:22:20,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And then lastly, going over to the PSP, seeing if there's anything to look forward to there.

1089
01:22:21,427 --> 01:22:28,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, LittleBigPlanet Portable gets its release in Japan this week, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.

1090
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that sounds fun.

1091
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:35,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, this one might be worth importing to some people, Phantasy Star Portable 2 comes out this week.

1092
01:22:36,435 --> 01:22:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1093
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:37,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and Jamie?

1094
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:38,096
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1095
01:22:38,396 --> 01:22:40,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Tokimeki Memorial 4 on the PSP this week.

1096
01:22:41,318 --> 01:22:43,139
[SPEAKER_03]: No Tokimemo for me, please.

1097
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:47,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone in Japan send me President Cat.

1098
01:22:48,324 --> 01:22:49,145
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the UK?

1099
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really a whole lot.

1100
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:55,091
[SPEAKER_03]: On the fourth we have Colin McRae, Dirt 2, like anyone cares.

1101
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Easy Piano for DS.

1102
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:04,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Avatar The Game and The Saboteur.

1103
01:23:04,641 --> 01:23:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Tony Hawk Ride, but who plays Tony Hawk anymore?

1104
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:13,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care how unrealistic it is, I want to grind on the moon or something like that.

1105
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that would be awesome.

1106
01:23:39,156 --> 01:23:42,718
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a comment from chat, did we miss Final Fantasy XIII in the release dates?

1107
01:23:42,759 --> 01:23:46,401
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, it's very possible because I believe that's releasing on a day all its own, right?

1108
01:23:46,441 --> 01:23:48,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was only looking at the December 3rd dates.

1109
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:49,843
[SPEAKER_08]: When is Final Fantasy XIII out in Japan?

1110
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:50,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

1111
01:23:50,223 --> 01:23:51,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's out in December.

1112
01:23:52,105 --> 01:23:52,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look up.

1113
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:55,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking up its release date real quick to see if I did miss it for this week.

1114
01:23:56,768 --> 01:23:57,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we get into the next story?

1115
01:23:57,748 --> 01:23:58,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll come back to that.

1116
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:00,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1117
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:03,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so... December 17th.

1118
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:04,193
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1119
01:24:04,733 --> 01:24:05,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still have a couple weeks.

1120
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:06,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1121
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:06,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1122
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:12,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why you'd play this game other than for charity, and that's what's been done.

1123
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:19,855
[SPEAKER_02]: The Desert Bus for Charity, an annual event where they play the horrible, horrible game that's part of the Penn & Teller game.

1124
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have raised over $100,000.

1125
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they have raised $132,568.94, which is 88% over last year's total.

1126
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:41,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a comedy troupe load-ready run.

1127
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this benefits the Child's Play charity.

1128
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:47,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1129
01:24:48,236 --> 01:24:50,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently... 88 hours...

1130
01:24:55,197 --> 01:24:55,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

1131
01:24:56,298 --> 01:24:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Of driving, booked by the pre-event donations.

1132
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,101
[SPEAKER_08]: But now it's not just one guy that has to do the whole thing, right?

1133
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:06,063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a comedy, people do the whole thing.

1134
01:25:06,403 --> 01:25:15,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to tune into the whole thing, although I read about it and I thought it was cool, but there's lots and lots of child play events going on, including Umlaut's coming up.

1135
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,290
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Seg on the show a couple weeks ago, and that's coming up.

1136
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,010
[SPEAKER_08]: God, it's...

1137
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:20,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Charity Marathon

1138
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:41,611
[SPEAKER_03]: When we have a day off that isn't... I'm not playing that game, though, that's for sure.

1139
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:45,013
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, we won't play that game, but we've got to do our own spin on Charity Marathon.

1140
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:45,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Find a good charity.

1141
01:25:46,034 --> 01:25:48,516
[SPEAKER_03]: We still need to do the classic game stuff.

1142
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:50,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I were talking about busting out the Master System today.

1143
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:51,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.

1144
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:56,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do our classic game marathon for charity, where we let donators pick the games or something.

1145
01:25:56,421 --> 01:26:00,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what I think we should do for that, is I pick...

1146
01:26:02,785 --> 01:26:26,737
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 or 7 of my systems it'll be easy to shift out or whatever and then put up a list of like 12 games each so someone can say spin a wheel you get like a twister wheel okay you get this system and then spin a wheel again for the number on the list and then oh you get this game make it all completely random and go

1147
01:26:27,117 --> 01:26:29,278
[SPEAKER_03]: New game, move, next seat, move down.

1148
01:26:29,298 --> 01:26:31,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so you're kind of like musical chairs, but with games.

1149
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:33,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, you know, the Mad Hatter.

1150
01:26:33,781 --> 01:26:34,781
[SPEAKER_03]: New cup, move down.

1151
01:26:35,321 --> 01:26:36,142
[SPEAKER_03]: New game, move down.

1152
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:41,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, you know, usually what would be a great weekend for me is Martin Luther King weekend, because I have a holiday there.

1153
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:42,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys do.

1154
01:26:42,445 --> 01:26:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Jamie works for a bank, so she has everything off.

1155
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:47,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But sadly, I'm going to Seattle that weekend.

1156
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Arbor Day off.

1157
01:26:49,549 --> 01:26:49,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Arbor Day?

1158
01:26:49,809 --> 01:26:50,149
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

1159
01:26:50,509 --> 01:26:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

1160
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go out and plant a tree like John Denver told us to?

1161
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is that what you're doing?

1162
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:59,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, John Denver also, you know, flew a plane.

1163
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:00,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Said he was leaving on a jet plane, and he did.

1164
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so awful.

1165
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:06,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love it, but it was really awful.

1166
01:27:06,267 --> 01:27:10,589
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely, like when they say tragic irony, I think that's exactly what they meant.

1167
01:27:10,829 --> 01:27:11,870
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really a jet plane.

1168
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little prop plane, wasn't it?

1169
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:16,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1170
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:18,793
[SPEAKER_03]: If he had been leaving on a jet plane, he probably wouldn't have crashed.

1171
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:20,665
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

1172
01:27:20,685 --> 01:27:22,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're making John Denver jokes.

1173
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:23,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1174
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:24,288
[SPEAKER_08]: You started it.

1175
01:27:25,349 --> 01:27:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh.

1176
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:26,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1177
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:27,110
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1178
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, every week here on the show, we like to do a little segment here pretty regularly.

1179
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:32,394
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done it for, gosh, over a year now.

1180
01:27:32,474 --> 01:27:34,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to be like the website of the week.

1181
01:27:34,156 --> 01:27:36,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it turned into like the DarkSakura's advice column.

1182
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:38,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's the classic game of the week.

1183
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of miss doing the website of the week, though.

1184
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I do kind of miss it, too.

1185
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:42,923
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is really fun.

1186
01:27:42,943 --> 01:27:46,325
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was going to do another one, though, I'd do Weebles again and make that a third time.

1187
01:27:47,246 --> 01:27:47,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1188
01:27:47,586 --> 01:27:48,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Weebles.

1189
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:58,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving on, it's now the classic video game of the week where DarkSakura digs through the classic game archive she was previously speaking of and picks out the game that she says, you know what?

1190
01:27:59,687 --> 01:28:01,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The kids need to play this game.

1191
01:28:01,088 --> 01:28:06,392
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to respect their elders and they need to dust off their NESs or whatever it happens to be and go play this game.

1192
01:28:06,712 --> 01:28:09,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, what is the game that is the classic game of the week?

1193
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,816
[SPEAKER_03]: A game that pisses me off sometimes.

1194
01:28:12,597 --> 01:28:13,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Nemo Dream Master.

1195
01:28:15,754 --> 01:28:17,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a little bit of the music.

1196
01:28:17,775 --> 01:28:18,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a little bit of the music.

1197
01:28:45,751 --> 01:28:46,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that good music?

1198
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit quiet, but it's very Capcom.

1199
01:28:48,774 --> 01:28:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing about Junko Tamiya is that she also did the music in Bionic Commando and in Strider, actually.

1200
01:29:00,304 --> 01:29:05,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are two notable games that had fantastic music.

1201
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:06,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Gunsmoke.

1202
01:29:08,672 --> 01:29:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1203
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:12,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to Little Nemo.

1204
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, it was called Pajama Hero Nemo.

1205
01:29:17,429 --> 01:29:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is pretty cute.

1206
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually based off of the Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland.

1207
01:29:24,312 --> 01:29:34,956
[SPEAKER_03]: The animated movie, actually, that came out based off of the comic strip from the early... I believe the original comic strip came out in, I want to say, the 1920s?

1208
01:29:35,756 --> 01:29:39,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen, actually, an original compilation of the Little Nemo books.

1209
01:29:40,178 --> 01:29:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, sorry, I take that back.

1210
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:41,759
[SPEAKER_03]: 1905 was when the...

1211
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:49,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The comic series first started in 1905 and then went on through 1914.

1212
01:29:50,665 --> 01:29:55,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The books that I saw were published in the 1920s.

1213
01:29:56,089 --> 01:29:56,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's another thing.

1214
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:59,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know me and book publishing, I'm all into that.

1215
01:30:00,632 --> 01:30:10,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back to this, it's about a little boy who goes into his magical dream world called Slumberland.

1216
01:30:11,081 --> 01:30:11,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And he can...

1217
01:30:13,266 --> 01:30:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1218
01:30:33,164 --> 01:30:34,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to be honest, Jamie.

1219
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:37,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember hearing about this game when I was a kid.

1220
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:39,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I think I saw the commercials, but I never played it.

1221
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that I'm kind of watching the video here that the music's coming off of, you know, it's kind of interesting.

1222
01:30:44,368 --> 01:30:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it definitely has that whole, like, the different suits of Mario, but it's...

1223
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:50,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't explain it.

1224
01:30:50,689 --> 01:30:53,330
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kind of have to play it yourself, I guess, or check out one of the videos of it.

1225
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:57,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, right now he's kind of riding a dinosaur, which kind of reminds me of something in Adventure Island.

1226
01:30:57,551 --> 01:31:17,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the dinosaur, but see, now you, for certain abilities that you get with some suits or some animals, you lose other, like, for example, you see he could, like, for example, the frog or, I think it's either a frog or a dragon or something, but he can do like a belly slap, like a belly splash move and land on them.

1227
01:31:18,117 --> 01:31:27,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and he, if his belly lands on the creatures, then he can actually knock them out of the sky, you know, to damage, um, I think that's the creature on the thing.

1228
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like a little, like, kind of gecko-looking thing.

1229
01:31:30,265 --> 01:31:32,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but he can, he can pop them.

1230
01:31:33,047 --> 01:31:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, like, you can get a mole, and you can dig, or you can get a gorilla and punch them, or climb up the walls.

1231
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:47,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The purple little lizard thing, I think it's like a salamander or something, but it can walk up walls, you know, like a lizard can.

1232
01:31:48,277 --> 01:31:49,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good lord.

1233
01:32:13,664 --> 01:32:42,891
[SPEAKER_03]: and as you were watching some of this they actually are hidden like you had to actually in the first level if you get the mole you actually have to go all the way over as far as you can through the dirt to the left and then go down through the floor to where two little blocks of of area that you can dig through to get underneath to another place where you get the key and a one up and some other crap um so uh

1234
01:32:45,180 --> 01:33:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have the right animals to get to some places, but if you don't really have everything, and on top of that, your animals have different lifeforms than Nemo does, so sometimes you have to really be judicious with what you have to make it through.

1235
01:33:05,904 --> 01:33:12,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, I'd have to say it's one of the harder NES games there are, and it's a cute game.

1236
01:33:13,482 --> 01:33:14,343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1237
01:33:35,825 --> 01:33:38,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would go that.

1238
01:33:38,807 --> 01:33:42,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But, again, like you said, it was released by Capcom.

1239
01:33:42,669 --> 01:33:47,911
[SPEAKER_03]: The year that it came out was in 1990, so I was actually just starting high school.

1240
01:33:49,052 --> 01:33:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1241
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I was in 8th grade.

1242
01:33:52,534 --> 01:33:53,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, you were in 8th grade.

1243
01:33:54,815 --> 01:33:55,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember...

1244
01:33:57,432 --> 01:33:59,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a fit over this game.

1245
01:33:59,653 --> 01:34:02,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it when it came out.

1246
01:34:03,336 --> 01:34:07,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just... I don't think... I think this is actually one game to this day I haven't beaten.

1247
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:10,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's an indication.

1248
01:34:10,941 --> 01:34:12,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've beaten a lot of games.

1249
01:34:13,462 --> 01:34:19,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, Jamie, a very popular pick in our chatroom, at least those that have played it, but a lot of folks agreeing with you on the difficulty that it was a bitch.

1250
01:34:19,662 --> 01:34:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Ricky GoMac that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES, that game was freaking difficult too.

1251
01:34:27,945 --> 01:34:34,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That game pissed me off to the point that I wanted to throw it down the stairs and I did and actually it lived through it and I can still play it.

1252
01:34:36,147 --> 01:34:37,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually one game I had that was duct taped.

1253
01:34:39,033 --> 01:34:39,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1254
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:41,655
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll have to do that another week.

1255
01:34:42,055 --> 01:34:43,136
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a different game altogether.

1256
01:34:43,836 --> 01:34:45,417
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that game is not going to make it on my list.

1257
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:51,461
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is not going to make it on my list because to this day, I'm still angry.

1258
01:34:52,502 --> 01:34:53,763
Angry, Rob, angry.

1259
01:34:54,463 --> 01:34:57,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking one day we need to do the anti-classic game of the week.

1260
01:34:57,605 --> 01:34:59,967
[SPEAKER_08]: The game that DarkSakura says, do not play this game.

1261
01:35:00,307 --> 01:35:00,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.

1262
01:35:00,827 --> 01:35:02,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you what that is right now.

1263
01:35:02,328 --> 01:35:04,470
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'll go ahead and mention it right now.

1264
01:35:05,171 --> 01:35:06,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we're done with Little Nemo then?

1265
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:06,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1266
01:35:06,732 --> 01:35:09,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Little Nemo, the Dream Master, your classic game of the week on the NES.

1267
01:35:09,614 --> 01:35:10,155
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1268
01:35:10,195 --> 01:35:17,059
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a game that is so bad that Dan and I rented it from Blockbuster because we were really into renting games every week.

1269
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:18,701
[SPEAKER_03]: This was about right before the Dreamcast came out.

1270
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:20,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So, around 98, 99.

1271
01:35:22,163 --> 01:35:29,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We rented... We were also into wrestling games at the time because the WrestleMania 2000 came out on the Nintendo 64, which was rad.

1272
01:35:29,748 --> 01:35:29,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We...

1273
01:35:34,031 --> 01:36:02,863
[SPEAKER_03]: got NWO Thunder and we got it home we played it for about 10 minutes and called Blockbuster and said we just rented this game about 30 minutes ago because we had to drive back we want our money back or can we change it out for something else and we went in there and the guy was like oh yeah I remember you if it's that bad then yeah we'll change it out it was so bad that Blockbuster let us change out our rental

1274
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:05,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's just good customer service, you know.

1275
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:08,680
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was... It probably wasn't the first time they got out.

1276
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept Spice World longer than that game, Rob.

1277
01:36:11,821 --> 01:36:12,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved Spice World.

1278
01:36:12,361 --> 01:36:13,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I rented Spice World.

1279
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:15,442
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some lulzy moments in Spice World.

1280
01:36:15,862 --> 01:36:17,762
[SPEAKER_08]: You just make Baby Spice do backflips over and over.

1281
01:36:17,782 --> 01:36:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really funny.

1282
01:36:18,442 --> 01:36:28,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I've bought games that are arguably bad games, and I liked them better than that game.

1283
01:36:28,904 --> 01:36:31,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the worst game I've ever rented.

1284
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:35,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the worst video game experience I ever had was when I got Tetris Plus on the PlayStation 1.

1285
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:36,639
[SPEAKER_08]: What a colossal letdown that game was.

1286
01:36:48,283 --> 01:36:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Tetris was so huge at the time, you know, especially on the NES, and I think everybody very fondly remembers that game, and it's been done very well on many platforms.

1287
01:36:54,848 --> 01:36:57,130
[SPEAKER_08]: The DS has an awesome version of Tetris.

1288
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:08,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Even Tengen Tetris is pretty good and kind of reminiscent of the arcade version, but I'll tell you what, Tetris Plus, which was by, and I remember to this day, Jellico, did it on the PlayStation 1, and it is horrific.

1289
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:17,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It is bad, it is terrible, because they changed the game mechanic of Tetris, and it was one of those things where I spent, like, I bought it, because I was like, oh, it's Tetris, how can it be bad?

1290
01:37:17,907 --> 01:37:18,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I hated it.

1291
01:37:18,668 --> 01:37:22,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it once and I said, how can you fuck with the main game mechanic of Tetris?

1292
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:28,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what they did is they changed it so it was like a little professor that would walk along the top and you didn't want him to hit the- I remember that!

1293
01:37:29,037 --> 01:37:30,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that was awful!

1294
01:37:30,598 --> 01:37:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1295
01:37:31,098 --> 01:37:32,600
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a terrible, terrible game.

1296
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hideous!

1297
01:37:34,661 --> 01:37:34,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1298
01:37:35,662 --> 01:37:36,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1299
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:37,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not alone.

1300
01:37:37,704 --> 01:37:38,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1301
01:37:38,224 --> 01:37:40,506
[SPEAKER_08]: That deserves- Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1302
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:42,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I need to fire up the Price is Right losing horn.

1303
01:37:42,528 --> 01:37:43,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1304
01:37:44,049 --> 01:37:44,530
[SPEAKER_08]: We're idyllic.

1305
01:37:46,638 --> 01:37:48,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that game is an enemy of the Daleks.

1306
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, traumatically bad video game experience?

1307
01:37:50,959 --> 01:37:51,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you can remember?

1308
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1309
01:37:55,601 --> 01:37:58,162
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's not really anything horribly bad that I played.

1310
01:37:58,222 --> 01:38:02,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I always used to find some sort of good out of it, I guess.

1311
01:38:03,325 --> 01:38:05,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, aren't you just like the Mother Teresa of video games?

1312
01:38:19,528 --> 01:38:22,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Ball GT Final Battle, actually.

1313
01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:23,789
[SPEAKER_08]: What was so terrible about that?

1314
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:24,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

1315
01:38:25,229 --> 01:38:37,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, keep in mind, it was like the first Dragon Ball game that came out in the U.S., unless you want to count the Dragon Ball RPG that they made into something else over here, which doesn't count.

1316
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:44,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the awful, awful American voice acting, and it was just...

1317
01:38:45,114 --> 01:38:47,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't regret the trade I loved Blue Stinger

1318
01:39:14,249 --> 01:39:16,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that Twinbee or something?

1319
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:18,210
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Stinger was Twinbee.

1320
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:21,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Stinger was the game that came out.

1321
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:30,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese version of that one was sort of lauded because it had a movie director directing the cameras and cinematics in the movie.

1322
01:39:31,613 --> 01:39:32,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the movie, in the game.

1323
01:39:33,053 --> 01:39:35,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it came out over here, they butchered the camera.

1324
01:39:35,614 --> 01:39:36,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people were like, oh, we can't control it.

1325
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:39,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I did just fine.

1326
01:39:39,615 --> 01:39:41,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little kind of survival horror type of game.

1327
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a lot of fun.

1328
01:39:43,196 --> 01:39:43,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

1329
01:39:44,201 --> 01:39:44,501
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1330
01:39:45,202 --> 01:39:46,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to take a break, guys.

1331
01:39:46,603 --> 01:39:51,388
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to rest our voices here a minute and refill our waters and run to the restroom and all that good stuff.

1332
01:39:51,648 --> 01:40:00,296
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we come back on Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to get into Part B. We've got plenty more news for you guys tonight, a lot of rapid-fire news, including some updates on Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2, and so forth.

1333
01:40:00,816 --> 01:40:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to get into some other stories.

1334
01:40:02,177 --> 01:40:03,719
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk Tron in Part B.

1335
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, so definitely stay tuned for that.

1336
01:40:07,082 --> 01:40:10,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when we start Part B, I can just go greetings programs.

1337
01:40:10,404 --> 01:40:11,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you really want to.

1338
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:12,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end, you can say end of line.

1339
01:40:13,066 --> 01:40:14,408
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, end of line.

1340
01:40:14,528 --> 01:40:16,810
[SPEAKER_08]: At the very end of tonight's show, I want you to say end of line.

1341
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, can we do that?

1342
01:40:18,611 --> 01:40:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1343
01:40:18,831 --> 01:40:19,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Like after the credits and everything?

1344
01:40:20,052 --> 01:40:20,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1345
01:40:20,353 --> 01:40:20,713
[SPEAKER_08]: End of line.

1346
01:40:21,468 --> 01:40:22,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do it before the credits.

1347
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fine.

1348
01:40:23,211 --> 01:40:24,493
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it that way.

1349
01:40:24,954 --> 01:40:27,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And a proper sequel to Puzzle Quest.

1350
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:29,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Galactrix, but something else.

1351
01:40:29,261 --> 01:40:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk all that in Part B. So stay tuned, guys.

1352
01:40:31,405 --> 01:40:34,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1353
01:40:40,538 --> 01:40:40,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio

[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move on and get into some of the rapid-fire news tonight.

1356
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll move into Twitter topics right after that for those of you guys who asked us questions on Twitter.

1357
01:41:34,216 --> 01:41:35,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got some more gaming news.

1358
01:41:36,117 --> 01:41:39,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid-fire news?

1359
01:41:40,186 --> 01:41:44,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption

1360
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:05,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted 2 The Fort

1361
01:42:30,462 --> 01:42:37,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a Fortress multiplayer map from Chapter of Drake's Fortune.

1362
01:42:37,744 --> 01:42:38,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

1363
01:42:39,425 --> 01:42:40,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, may the fort be with you.

1364
01:42:40,665 --> 01:42:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and it's free, so you can't beat free.

1365
01:42:44,786 --> 01:42:52,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, Valve is selling some Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead themed greeting cards.

1366
01:42:52,949 --> 01:42:53,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1367
01:42:54,642 --> 01:42:55,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Those look kind of cool.

1368
01:42:56,163 --> 01:42:59,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if those are actual greeting cards or if they're like e-cards or something like that.

1369
01:43:01,464 --> 01:43:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1370
01:43:02,525 --> 01:43:06,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they are real cards.

1371
01:43:06,466 --> 01:43:13,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually pick those up at the Valve Software Store at store.valvesoftware.com and check them out.

1372
01:43:13,948 --> 01:43:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a little pricey.

1373
01:43:17,289 --> 01:43:17,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like $16.

1374
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:22,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure how many you get in that, but...

1375
01:43:24,274 --> 01:43:28,519
[SPEAKER_07]: How many portal jokes in the Christmas cards?

1376
01:43:28,799 --> 01:43:29,019
[SPEAKER_02]: None.

1377
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1378
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:31,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero portal jokes.

1379
01:43:32,143 --> 01:43:32,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1380
01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:36,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, moving on to some other rapid fire news I have for you guys.

1381
01:43:36,904 --> 01:43:44,950
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole lot of Rock Band news going on, as there usually is, because every week they try to add something new, and this week there's more Nirvana coming to the 360 Wii and PS3.

1382
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:52,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Come As You Are, the MTV Unplugged version, which I think is kind of interesting, is coming out for Rock Band, as well as Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit, finally!

1383
01:43:53,676 --> 01:43:54,576
[SPEAKER_08]: All in Nirvana Pack 2.

1384
01:43:55,757 --> 01:43:57,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Also the band Night Ranger.

1385
01:43:57,558 --> 01:43:58,759
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still rock in America.

1386
01:43:59,159 --> 01:44:00,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me you love me, and you're going to hear it from me.

1387
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Ranger!

1388
01:44:02,713 --> 01:44:03,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm laughing.

1389
01:44:03,635 --> 01:44:08,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, a member of Night Ranger was in Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent.

1390
01:44:08,524 --> 01:44:08,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1391
01:44:11,223 --> 01:44:15,565
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rock Band platform, by the way, now has over 1,000 songs.

1392
01:44:16,425 --> 01:44:17,585
[SPEAKER_08]: 390 different musical artists.

1393
01:44:17,945 --> 01:44:23,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, we have collectively downloaded over 60 million songs from the Rock Band store.

1394
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:26,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody's making a shitload of money.

1395
01:44:26,948 --> 01:44:29,409
[SPEAKER_08]: 105 consecutive weeks of new additions to the store.

1396
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:30,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's pretty impressive.

1397
01:44:31,149 --> 01:44:36,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And they actually did some math and figured out that if you wanted to play through the entire catalog, that would take two days...

1398
01:44:37,392 --> 01:44:41,179
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 hours and 40 minutes to play through the entire catalog, which I think I wanted to read some.

1399
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I read somewhere some guy was doing for charity.

1400
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:44,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw that.

1401
01:44:44,145 --> 01:44:44,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to you.

1402
01:44:48,137 --> 01:44:48,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1403
01:45:11,567 --> 01:45:12,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1404
01:45:34,437 --> 01:45:35,738
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, back when they were really good.

1405
01:45:36,559 --> 01:45:45,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, the games you can play there on Atari, you can play Asteroids, Adventure, Battlezone, Crystal Castles, Lunar Lander, and yes, Yars' Revenge.

1406
01:45:45,948 --> 01:45:46,368
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1407
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,291
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I used to love Crystal Castles.

1408
01:45:49,732 --> 01:45:51,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the best game ever.

1409
01:45:51,653 --> 01:45:52,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

1410
01:45:52,254 --> 01:45:54,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like the Atari 2600 version, though, nearly as much as the arcade.

1411
01:45:55,437 --> 01:45:56,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you'll like it, for one thing.

1412
01:45:57,739 --> 01:45:58,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a trackball.

1413
01:45:59,946 --> 01:46:01,166
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way it's meant to be played.

1414
01:46:01,987 --> 01:46:03,687
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a 2600 trackball.

1415
01:46:04,588 --> 01:46:16,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, some game controller Christmas tree ornaments are available and I guess they're making their way around the different game blogs and you can get them, it looks like, at ponoko.com P-O-N-O-K-O dot com.

1416
01:46:17,092 --> 01:46:20,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It's $25 plus $10 for shipping or more if it's somewhere else.

1417
01:46:21,213 --> 01:46:24,094
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get some various game controller themed.

1418
01:46:24,174 --> 01:46:26,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like there's an old school NES controller and a Wiimote

1419
01:46:27,475 --> 01:46:31,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Dreamcast Controller, Gettin' the Love, and of course, Where Would You Be Without a DualShock Controller.

1420
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:37,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of that is there in the Game Controller Christmas tree for those of you that are going to be decorating.

1421
01:46:38,889 --> 01:46:40,271
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?

1422
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:41,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff.

1423
01:46:42,473 --> 01:46:43,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've got good stuff.

1424
01:46:43,835 --> 01:46:45,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, kind of good stuff, because...

1425
01:46:46,835 --> 01:47:06,642
[SPEAKER_03]: There actually is a statement by Harada Katsuhiro, who is the producer behind Tekken 6, say that there's going to have more content on its way via download content, but that they're not going to charge for it or they don't intend to charge for it.

1426
01:47:07,282 --> 01:47:12,466
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be, there's a, and this is a quote, strong possibility of additional download content.

1427
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:20,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, then again, they've said that before and have kind of lied.

1428
01:47:20,412 --> 01:47:20,873
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1429
01:47:20,913 --> 01:47:24,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they say like, oh no, we didn't put Darth Vader in the Xbox Soul Calibur.

1430
01:47:25,016 --> 01:47:26,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, we didn't do that.

1431
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:26,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

1432
01:47:27,058 --> 01:47:29,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like, psych.

1433
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:29,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1434
01:47:30,781 --> 01:47:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1435
01:47:31,481 --> 01:47:35,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, about the Games Convention Online, you remember that?

1436
01:47:35,564 --> 01:47:36,405
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing another one.

1437
01:47:37,496 --> 01:47:43,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will be from July 8th through 11th, 2010 at the Leipziger Messe in Germany.

1438
01:47:43,783 --> 01:47:44,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I pronounced that right.

1439
01:47:45,185 --> 01:47:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I took German for two weeks, sorry.

1440
01:47:49,657 --> 01:47:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got 43,000 attendees last year, so they're hoping that with another day they can get more.

1441
01:47:56,945 --> 01:47:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So hey, good for them.

1442
01:48:00,268 --> 01:48:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, and this is something I'm pretty happy about, Bayonetta demo.

1443
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be getting it in Europe and North America on December 3rd.

1444
01:48:09,898 --> 01:48:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be freaking fantastic.

1445
01:48:13,857 --> 01:48:16,059
[SPEAKER_08]: LittleBirdie told me you can get it early if you know where to look.

1446
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:17,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1447
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:21,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was through GameSpot.com.

1448
01:48:21,223 --> 01:48:25,446
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're like a member over there, you can get a code generated, something like that, for the demo.

1449
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:29,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had a chance to check it out myself because, again, I got a Bork 360 that I've been too lazy to replace.

1450
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this, folks, is why you need to create a Japanese region account so that you can download these region-free demos to your 360 or PlayStation 3 way early.

1451
01:48:42,014 --> 01:48:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one for every region on the PlayStation 3 and I have one for Japanese and US and my 360.

1452
01:48:47,356 --> 01:48:48,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Just putting it out there.

1453
01:48:48,756 --> 01:48:53,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on to some Twitter topics and some things that you guys are asking us on the Twitter.

1454
01:48:53,077 --> 01:48:55,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you don't already have us on Twitter, you should really consider adding us.

1455
01:48:56,178 --> 01:48:58,699
[SPEAKER_08]: www.twitter.com slash OLR.

1456
01:48:58,779 --> 01:49:00,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We always take messages before every show.

1457
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:02,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off with Spazinator tonight.

1458
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,001
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a discussion of some of the better PC exclusives out there?

1459
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:08,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Must-owns.

1460
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:10,161
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, recommendations.

1461
01:49:10,541 --> 01:49:14,482
[SPEAKER_08]: With me getting a PC not too long from now, I'd like to know what to get above and beyond WoW.

1462
01:49:15,262 --> 01:49:17,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer, because WoW would have been the first thing I suggested it would be.

1463
01:49:17,763 --> 01:49:19,543
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, a lot of MMOs.

1464
01:49:19,603 --> 01:49:21,583
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't really seen console MMOs.

1465
01:49:22,044 --> 01:49:23,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, Final Fantasy XI.

1466
01:49:23,644 --> 01:49:25,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the PS3 has some in development.

1467
01:49:25,544 --> 01:49:27,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, there's going to be a lot of stuff in the spring.

1468
01:49:27,325 --> 01:49:28,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly.

1469
01:49:28,045 --> 01:49:29,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it, you know, gets...

1470
01:49:30,506 --> 01:49:39,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, you know, the Guild Wars, the City of Heroes, the Aion, the Champions, the Star Trek Online, none of those are on the console, nor are they going to be on the console.

1471
01:49:40,216 --> 01:49:41,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, all those types of MMOs.

1472
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:44,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of stuff in the pipes, just not quite out yet.

1473
01:49:45,181 --> 01:49:47,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything you can think of as far as PC games go?

1474
01:49:47,823 --> 01:49:49,285
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as PC MMOs?

1475
01:49:49,745 --> 01:49:53,229
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just PC games in general that are exclusive that you can't get on the console.

1476
01:49:54,022 --> 01:49:59,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Command & Conquer 4 is going to be exclusively on PC at first at least.

1477
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not positive on that, but I know that's coming out in the fall and I haven't heard about a console version yet.

1478
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:10,200
[SPEAKER_08]: X-Link suggests Civilization 4 and I give that a hell yes.

1479
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:21,844
[SPEAKER_08]: The Civilization series is outstanding and they did do like kind of a dumbed down version of Civilization called Civ Revolution for the Xbox 360 and PS3 although I will say Civ Revolution I liked.

1480
01:50:22,004 --> 01:50:27,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of reminded me of the very first Civilization game so when I say dumbed down I don't mean that in a negative way.

1481
01:50:27,867 --> 01:50:30,328
[SPEAKER_08]: If you like that game definitely Civ 4.

1482
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:33,349
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great suggestion from X-Link in our chat room.

1483
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:34,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1484
01:50:35,867 --> 01:50:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to some other questions.

1485
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:41,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this one from Fernando on Twitter and this is a good one for Loki.

1486
01:50:42,337 --> 01:50:48,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Will there ever be an installment of Grand Theft Auto where you play a female and would it sell?

1487
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:51,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would, and I hope there is.

1488
01:50:52,964 --> 01:51:01,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, hell, they've done it with Saints Row, where you can play as a female character throughout that game, and it works pretty well.

1489
01:51:04,292 --> 01:51:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember before when people were putting out fake screenshots for Grand Theft Auto 4, it had a female wheeling a mace, and that looked pretty awesome.

1490
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:13,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why it couldn't happen.

1491
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:15,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption

1492
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,812
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to see that, dude, I would say email them.

1493
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:39,733
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I got to say?

1494
01:51:40,794 --> 01:51:45,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Rockstar has been pretty decent about, you know, kind of an equal opportunity, if you will.

1495
01:51:45,998 --> 01:51:50,022
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm sure they're about the story and the art they're trying to go for first.

1496
01:51:50,062 --> 01:51:53,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they can work it in for a female protagonist, they will.

1497
01:51:54,366 --> 01:51:55,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, let's see...

1498
01:51:59,965 --> 01:52:02,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at this one from Tigerclaw.

1499
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:06,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Nathan Drake gets supersized for Thanksgiving weekend and sends us this over.

1500
01:52:06,937 --> 01:52:08,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the Uncharted developers...

1501
01:52:10,706 --> 01:52:13,468
[SPEAKER_08]: made Nathan Drake look fat during Thanksgiving.

1502
01:52:13,508 --> 01:52:14,448
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of funny.

1503
01:52:14,589 --> 01:52:16,710
[SPEAKER_08]: They made him gain a few pounds there.

1504
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:19,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that something that was actually in the game, or is that just screenshots?

1505
01:52:20,632 --> 01:52:23,094
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I guess that's just something they rendered, those screenshots.

1506
01:52:23,114 --> 01:52:24,455
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't actually in the game.

1507
01:52:24,475 --> 01:52:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny if you played it on Thanksgiving.

1508
01:52:27,377 --> 01:52:28,778
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be kind of funny, actually.

1509
01:52:29,218 --> 01:52:30,639
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

1510
01:52:32,532 --> 01:52:33,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1511
01:52:54,187 --> 01:53:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So Obama and apparently the LittleBigPlanet team are teaming up for kids.

1512
01:53:01,792 --> 01:53:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And the White House, they basically announced that they're going to have a program to improve science and math education with a variety of different entertainment software association-backed initiatives, including a program to put LittleBigPlanet in libraries, as well as $300,000 in game design challenges.

1513
01:53:20,264 --> 01:53:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

1514
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, hell, LittleBigPlanet,

1515
01:53:24,207 --> 01:53:28,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Very flexible with what you can do with it, and it's supposedly pretty easy to learn.

1516
01:53:28,411 --> 01:53:32,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't actually sat down to try and make a level, even though I really wanted to.

1517
01:53:32,314 --> 01:53:33,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking hard!

1518
01:53:33,976 --> 01:53:35,737
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a lot of dedication.

1519
01:53:35,757 --> 01:53:37,499
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because we're older, that's why.

1520
01:53:37,539 --> 01:53:45,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, maybe, but that's why I invited the gentleman on the show earlier tonight, because I know it's not easy to have that kind of dedication.

1521
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:49,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was kind of awesome, and then to have it all take off, and so forth.

1522
01:53:49,950 --> 01:54:10,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they said, you know, the Sony LittleBigPlanet initiative, Game Changers, is part of a $2 million 2010 digital media and learning competition funded by the MacArthur Foundation and involves Sony donating 1,000 PlayStation 3s and copies of the LittleBigPlanet to libraries and committee organizations.

1523
01:54:11,258 --> 01:54:16,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Participants will strive to create levels that involve science, technology, engineering, and math.

1524
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, engineering, health, physics, and...

1525
01:54:20,782 --> 01:54:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: The second program is called the STEM Nation Video Game Competition.

1526
01:54:26,684 --> 01:54:39,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three-pronged $300,000 contest encouraging entrants to create the best browser video games that teach the STEM disciplines for a trio of ages 4-8, 8-12, and 12-16.

1527
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:48,353
[SPEAKER_02]: The competitions intend to reach historically underserved populations including girls and minority students according to the ESA press release.

1528
01:54:50,012 --> 01:54:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat

1529
01:54:52,230 --> 01:54:58,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of interesting, especially the whole fact that video games usually get a bad rap.

1530
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:07,193
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, ironically, and I swear I didn't plan this, I'm wearing my ECA shirt today with the controllers on it that says, contrary to popular opinion, these do not make me a killer.

1531
01:55:07,533 --> 01:55:16,295
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, video games get such a bad rap usually out there that games like Manhunt 2 are going to turn us all into murderers and all this garbage.

1532
01:55:16,555 --> 01:55:20,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I remember correctly, the unedited, unrated...

1533
01:55:20,396 --> 01:55:22,237
[SPEAKER_02]: PC version came out and the world did not end.

1534
01:55:22,617 --> 01:55:23,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it really didn't.

1535
01:55:24,098 --> 01:55:28,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's kind of neat to see video games being embraced in this regard.

1536
01:55:28,701 --> 01:55:34,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think this is something that people will actually really get into and it will be a successful program?

1537
01:55:34,844 --> 01:55:35,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why it can't be.

1538
01:55:35,805 --> 01:55:42,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hell, we grew up on Oregon Trail and number munchers and shit like that.

1539
01:55:42,508 --> 01:55:45,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of an evolved version of that.

1540
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we had...

1541
01:55:47,819 --> 01:55:49,381
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1542
01:56:04,938 --> 01:56:20,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't do something like this where, you know, challenge people to kind of learn how to use computers and learn how to, you know, build stuff in video games and whatnot to kind of help promote education and, you know, their agendas with the science and math programs.

1543
01:56:20,793 --> 01:56:23,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like a good idea to me.

1544
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way to reach children at a level that they're, you know, going to be interested in.

1545
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:31,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Carameldansen

1546
01:56:56,011 --> 01:56:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Logo, the programming language, right?

1547
01:56:58,774 --> 01:57:05,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Forward 30, right 90, forward 30, right 90, to draw a square and all that stuff.

1548
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun stuff.

1549
01:57:08,154 --> 01:57:09,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Jamie, Tron.

1550
01:57:10,355 --> 01:57:10,735
Tron!

1551
01:57:10,915 --> 01:57:14,836
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, if you want to see more information about Tron, you're going to have to watch the VGAs.

1552
01:57:15,256 --> 01:57:21,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the Spike Video Game Awards apparently is going to have some new Tron information here.

1553
01:57:22,458 --> 01:57:25,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this is not about the movie, this is about the game.

1554
01:57:25,059 --> 01:57:26,559
[SPEAKER_08]: The game based on the movie?

1555
01:57:26,679 --> 01:57:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, yeah, the game that's based on the new movie.

1556
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:33,321
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a little teaser that went up, and it looks like the game might actually just be called Tron.

1557
01:57:33,662 --> 01:57:34,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You might remember...

1558
01:57:35,242 --> 01:57:37,763
[SPEAKER_08]: They tried relaunching Tron a couple years ago.

1559
01:57:37,803 --> 01:57:40,584
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a Tron 2.0 video game I remember that came out.

1560
01:57:40,924 --> 01:57:41,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty awesome.

1561
01:57:42,184 --> 01:57:46,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty cool, but it didn't do very well at all, which is kind of unfortunate.

1562
01:57:47,826 --> 01:57:55,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, there's movie sequels coming out called Tron Legacy, and apparently more information is going to come out at the Spike Video Game Awards.

1563
01:57:55,989 --> 01:57:57,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be on Saturday, December 12th.

1564
01:57:58,490 --> 01:58:01,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very, very brief teaser that's hit the internet recently.

1565
01:58:02,214 --> 01:58:03,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Jamie's seen it.

1566
01:58:03,315 --> 01:58:06,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to pull it up here in studio so she can kind of get a peek here at what it looks like.

1567
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's going to play very well here.

1568
01:58:10,623 --> 01:58:13,847
[SPEAKER_08]: But you just see somebody... Virus detected.

1569
01:58:13,867 --> 01:58:14,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Motorbikes.

1570
01:58:14,107 --> 01:58:14,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember...

1571
01:58:16,329 --> 01:58:16,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Light Cycles, Rob.

1572
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:17,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Light Cycles.

1573
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:18,731
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1574
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:21,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the Spike TV Video Game Awards.

1575
01:58:21,533 --> 01:58:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also your chance to vote for the most anticipated game where you get to write in your own choice and perhaps President Cat.

1576
01:58:28,973 --> 01:58:34,395
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, we did try to start something on the Facebook and Twitter to get everybody to write in President Cat.

1577
01:58:35,916 --> 01:58:37,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do hope it makes a clip package.

1578
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:44,820
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're hoping for, is that when they introduce who wins this award, they do some type of clip package for all the anticipated things.

1579
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:47,601
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't think it'll win, realistically.

1580
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:48,582
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not on the ballot.

1581
01:58:48,642 --> 01:58:51,463
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe it'll make the clip package, and that's really all we ask.

1582
01:58:52,143 --> 01:58:55,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We want it's 15 frames of fame on Spike TV.

1583
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:03,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you want to be the one to send that tweet over to Rina Wee and let them know, hey, did you know your video game was on TV in America?

1584
01:59:03,984 --> 01:59:05,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still been spamming it.

1585
01:59:07,566 --> 01:59:07,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1586
01:59:08,466 --> 01:59:09,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

1587
01:59:09,047 --> 01:59:09,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, what do you got for us?

1588
01:59:11,188 --> 01:59:13,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about some stuff about another game?

1589
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:14,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest.

1590
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,271
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a sequel.

1591
01:59:17,491 --> 01:59:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played Puzzle Quest, so I couldn't really tell you anything about the sequel.

1592
01:59:24,155 --> 01:59:25,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is...

1593
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't really know much about Puzzle Quest Rob.

1594
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you had played this before, the Puzzle Quest game.

1595
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:33,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

1596
01:59:34,081 --> 01:59:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh, okay.

1597
01:59:35,322 --> 01:59:36,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Peggle.

1598
01:59:36,883 --> 01:59:44,746
[SPEAKER_08]: There was Galactrix that came out that was supposed to be some type of sequel to Puzzle Quest, but it wasn't really because it had this whole, it was based around hexagons.

1599
01:59:45,126 --> 01:59:47,609
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I was looking at the screen capture going, what am I looking at?

1600
01:59:47,689 --> 01:59:49,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Bejeweled, basically.

1601
01:59:49,231 --> 01:59:52,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ye Olde Bejeweled, basically.

1602
01:59:52,315 --> 01:59:59,064
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, that also isn't 100% fair, because especially Puzzle Quest had all these different other elements in it.

1603
01:59:59,184 --> 02:00:03,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you first play it, you're kind of like, oh, it's Bejeweled with attacks, but then you have to get into...

1604
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:05,131
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1605
02:00:23,444 --> 02:00:24,425
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife did too.

1606
02:00:24,485 --> 02:00:25,265
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, yeah.

1607
02:00:25,305 --> 02:00:27,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Your wife was into this too, huh?

1608
02:00:27,746 --> 02:00:30,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was also busy playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

1609
02:00:30,448 --> 02:00:30,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

1610
02:00:31,228 --> 02:00:34,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Puzzle Quest 2, I guess, is now going to be a proper sequel to the game.

1611
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:44,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know exactly what type of stuff is going to be in it, but there's an early screenshot that's leaked out there, and apparently the game is in development for the 360, it looks like?

1612
02:00:44,795 --> 02:00:50,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like colors and some ogres and some guy with a sword.

1613
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's interesting though because there's some new icons here I haven't seen before.

1614
02:00:54,003 --> 02:00:58,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's these different colored skulls, although one of them says plus three, so maybe they just changed the color.

1615
02:00:58,768 --> 02:01:02,231
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's these fists, and I don't know what that's all about.

1616
02:01:02,532 --> 02:01:04,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no more gold icons either.

1617
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:07,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it means a hand comes out of the screen and punches a player in the face.

1618
02:01:08,017 --> 02:01:08,878
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be unfortunate.

1619
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:10,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Puzzle Quest is a fun game.

1620
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:11,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Galactrix couldn't get into it.

1621
02:01:12,261 --> 02:01:13,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a whole different way of thinking.

1622
02:01:13,703 --> 02:01:14,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1623
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:18,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw there was a Neopets one, and I just wanted to laugh.

1624
02:01:19,802 --> 02:01:20,862
[SPEAKER_03]: People still play Neopets?

1625
02:01:21,042 --> 02:01:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1626
02:01:24,084 --> 02:01:24,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me rephrase.

1627
02:01:24,764 --> 02:01:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: People over 13 still play Neopets?

1628
02:01:27,265 --> 02:01:27,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1629
02:01:28,886 --> 02:01:29,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1630
02:01:30,006 --> 02:01:31,227
[SPEAKER_08]: No one plays Neopets.

1631
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:35,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all... It's all Gaia.

1632
02:01:35,249 --> 02:01:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: All a hoax.

1633
02:01:36,929 --> 02:01:38,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's using Gaia now.

1634
02:01:39,153 --> 02:01:40,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1635
02:01:56,307 --> 02:02:04,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it has been confirmed that the trailer for Mercs Inc., the brand new game, is actually legit.

1636
02:02:04,851 --> 02:02:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being developed now, not by Pandemic, since, well, they kind of closed.

1637
02:02:10,213 --> 02:02:19,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And EA Los Angeles is actually going to be working on that game, and it will be a multiplayer, or at least have multiplayer in it, release.

1638
02:02:20,217 --> 02:02:20,778
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1639
02:02:39,906 --> 02:02:41,668
[SPEAKER_08]: because it was so buggy.

1640
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:43,129
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd like to exploit those buggy games, though.

1641
02:02:43,169 --> 02:02:48,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say as much shit as you give a game like Driver 3 here on the show, you'd love to play that game because it was so bad.

1642
02:02:48,253 --> 02:02:49,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with Mercenaries 2.

1643
02:02:49,554 --> 02:02:57,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so buggy, but it's hilarious because you'll just be watching and feel like, what just happened there, you know?

1644
02:02:59,003 --> 02:02:59,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1645
02:03:00,331 --> 02:03:02,773
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt says, I've gotten more non-gamers hooked on Peggle than Puzzle Quest.

1646
02:03:02,793 --> 02:03:03,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Peggle for the win.

1647
02:03:03,493 --> 02:03:04,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Peggle.

1648
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:05,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Puzzle Quest too.

1649
02:03:05,374 --> 02:03:07,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Peggle is my number one I'm stuck somewhere board game.

1650
02:03:07,496 --> 02:03:09,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Peggle because it reminds me of Plinko.

1651
02:03:09,497 --> 02:03:10,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I like Peggle.

1652
02:03:26,943 --> 02:03:29,727
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's actually the same thought that I had about it, too.

1653
02:03:30,007 --> 02:03:32,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Who didn't want to play Plinko whenever you watched that on The Price is Right?

1654
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But Peggle is so fun.

1655
02:03:34,433 --> 02:03:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm actually working on the challenge modes.

1656
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I've beaten one of them.

1657
02:03:37,897 --> 02:03:38,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

1658
02:03:38,518 --> 02:03:39,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the extra orange.

1659
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:41,301
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta beat more than one.

1660
02:03:41,702 --> 02:03:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1661
02:03:42,002 --> 02:03:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep trying.

1662
02:03:42,423 --> 02:03:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been doing them.

1663
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,734
[SPEAKER_08]: After Burner Climax

1664
02:04:06,707 --> 02:04:08,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Both systems, 360 and PSN.

1665
02:04:08,968 --> 02:04:11,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So, don't know if this game will hit both platforms.

1666
02:04:11,689 --> 02:04:12,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume it would.

1667
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:15,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Exclusives are very few and far between these days.

1668
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:24,073
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to bring After Burner Climax, which, by the way, they had it at John's Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

1669
02:04:24,993 --> 02:04:25,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that game.

1670
02:04:25,533 --> 02:04:26,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so fun.

1671
02:04:26,873 --> 02:04:31,315
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would wish that they would bring out Planet Harrier.

1672
02:04:32,236 --> 02:04:38,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, for those that don't know, After Burner Climax is an arcade cabinet that's like old school After Burner.

1673
02:04:38,518 --> 02:04:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Except better!

1674
02:04:39,618 --> 02:04:42,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but, you know, now it was modernized, basically.

1675
02:04:42,098 --> 02:04:46,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it has like a full hydraulic seat in it that moves and turns and everything.

1676
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, sadly, you won't be able to install in your chair.

1677
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:52,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, if you're Loki, he'll make one out of duct tape and cardboard boxes somehow.

1678
02:04:52,201 --> 02:04:53,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not make any chairs.

1679
02:04:53,261 --> 02:04:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And ballpoint pens.

1680
02:04:54,482 --> 02:04:56,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to use the little springs of the ballpoint pen.

1681
02:04:56,122 --> 02:04:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1682
02:04:57,102 --> 02:04:59,423
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, if they can bring this out, why can't they bring out Planet Harrier?

1683
02:05:00,123 --> 02:05:00,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1684
02:05:00,363 --> 02:05:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1685
02:05:01,383 --> 02:05:01,924
[SPEAKER_08]: They hate you.

1686
02:05:03,065 --> 02:05:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Planet Harry or Sega?

1687
02:05:06,328 --> 02:05:06,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So check for that.

1688
02:05:06,988 --> 02:05:11,813
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be coming soon if the ratings boards are to believed, which they usually are.

1689
02:05:12,613 --> 02:05:13,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know.

1690
02:05:13,434 --> 02:05:14,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those things ever wrong?

1691
02:05:14,715 --> 02:05:17,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Entertainment's funny.

1692
02:05:17,318 --> 02:05:17,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1693
02:05:17,558 --> 02:05:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1694
02:05:19,019 --> 02:05:22,903
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote, After Burner Climax, is that what happens when Maverick ejaculates?

1695
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:25,752
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?

1696
02:05:49,963 --> 02:05:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of Redertainment, dear OLR, first of all, thank you for updating the podcast feed.

1697
02:05:55,127 --> 02:06:01,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Between these episodes, the other podcasts I listen to, the music I've recently pirated, I have enough entertainment to last me for the rest of the year at work.

1698
02:06:02,213 --> 02:06:02,873
[SPEAKER_03]: What, a whole month?

1699
02:06:04,034 --> 02:06:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, can you send me the link for the article from last week about the guy marrying the DS character?

1700
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:10,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I call bullshit.

1701
02:06:11,909 --> 02:06:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: A guy marrying a character from a DS game in Guam.

1702
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:18,792
[SPEAKER_03]: The part about Guam alone screams bullshit to me.

1703
02:06:19,413 --> 02:06:20,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, on to the reason I'm emailing.

1704
02:06:21,314 --> 02:06:26,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, many of us have been sick, including SkyDarkSakura and myself.

1705
02:06:26,536 --> 02:06:28,817
[SPEAKER_03]: When you are sick at home, you need things to entertain you.

1706
02:06:29,177 --> 02:06:30,518
[SPEAKER_03]: These things can include video games.

1707
02:06:31,018 --> 02:06:33,359
[SPEAKER_03]: What video games do you suggest for someone who is sick at home?

1708
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: This game should preferably need little input, doesn't agitate you much, and can be frequently paused...

1709
02:06:39,182 --> 02:06:45,731
[SPEAKER_03]: to enable you to visit the bathroom slash sickness... sick room on a frequent basis.

1710
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:48,555
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion is to get to ride on the Xbox Live Arcade.

1711
02:06:48,895 --> 02:06:49,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Little input is required.

1712
02:06:49,956 --> 02:06:52,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's entertaining without being agitating and can be paused at any time.

1713
02:06:53,521 --> 02:06:55,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I say peggle on the iPhone because you can take it with you.

1714
02:06:57,540 --> 02:07:04,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta be honest, when I was home for a week with swine flu and all that, I wasn't really playing video games at all.

1715
02:07:05,783 --> 02:07:07,423
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because I didn't want to think.

1716
02:07:08,244 --> 02:07:09,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched movies.

1717
02:07:09,404 --> 02:07:11,925
[SPEAKER_08]: That was more my time to catch up on movies and TV shows.

1718
02:07:12,265 --> 02:07:14,506
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm sick, really, I watch The Muppet Show.

1719
02:07:15,706 --> 02:07:17,327
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1720
02:07:39,131 --> 02:07:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Diapers!

1721
02:07:39,812 --> 02:07:40,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Diapers!

1722
02:08:02,895 --> 02:08:03,916
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1723
02:08:23,553 --> 02:08:27,576
[SPEAKER_03]: By the present... Eating, shitting, crying, and that's it.

1724
02:08:28,717 --> 02:08:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to figure out what this big blur in front of its face is.

1725
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:33,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a favor.

1726
02:08:35,141 --> 02:08:35,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy diapers.

1727
02:08:36,682 --> 02:08:37,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy diapers.

1728
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: For mommy.

1729
02:08:40,085 --> 02:08:40,545
[SPEAKER_03]: For baby.

1730
02:08:41,186 --> 02:08:43,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Because diapers are expensive and you need a lot of them.

1731
02:08:44,208 --> 02:08:45,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only know this because I know mommies.

1732
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy diapers.

1733
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:50,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And butt paste, just because it's funny.

1734
02:08:50,612 --> 02:08:51,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha!

1735
02:08:52,651 --> 02:09:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, whenever I go to a baby shower, I make sure that I do like a care basket and put butt paste in it because I just want an excuse to buy something called butt paste.

1736
02:09:02,776 --> 02:09:04,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it sound like it's going to glue it shut.

1737
02:09:05,057 --> 02:09:05,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for diaper rash.

1738
02:09:05,638 --> 02:09:07,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it's for, but it's just funny.

1739
02:09:07,498 --> 02:09:09,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The name is hilarious, butt paste.

1740
02:09:09,339 --> 02:09:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just the way it rolls off the tongue.

1741
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:12,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say it anymore on the show tonight?

1742
02:09:12,121 --> 02:09:13,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, give it a try.

1743
02:09:14,122 --> 02:09:14,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Butt paste.

1744
02:09:15,402 --> 02:09:16,583
[SPEAKER_03]: See, isn't that great?

1745
02:09:16,963 --> 02:09:17,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Knock, knock.

1746
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's there?

1747
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:20,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But Paste.

1748
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's funny.

1749
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:23,461
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not funny.

1750
02:09:23,541 --> 02:09:24,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not.

1751
02:09:24,622 --> 02:09:24,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1752
02:09:24,782 --> 02:09:25,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But Paste.

1753
02:09:25,242 --> 02:09:26,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hilarious.

1754
02:09:26,183 --> 02:09:26,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1755
02:09:26,863 --> 02:09:27,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1756
02:09:28,004 --> 02:09:32,588
[SPEAKER_03]: This was brought to you by Stay Care Redertainment.

1757
02:09:33,729 --> 02:09:38,052
[SPEAKER_03]: This message has been brought to you by Prayer, the preferred birth control method of the state of Utah.

1758
02:09:39,333 --> 02:09:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1759
02:09:40,154 --> 02:09:41,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that is hilarious.

1760
02:09:43,637 --> 02:09:45,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, a long one from Spazinator.

1761
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:47,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi folks!

1762
02:09:47,826 --> 02:09:49,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Spazinator!

1763
02:09:50,187 --> 02:09:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd send you three this email just in case I accidentally fall asleep like I did last week, dammit, and end up not calling as a result.

1764
02:09:58,252 --> 02:10:04,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I initially intended to pass the following information along to other listeners out there who have been following my situation for the past two weeks.

1765
02:10:05,355 --> 02:10:07,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd give a little detailed information.

1766
02:10:08,337 --> 02:10:16,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Monday afternoon after OLR's episode 244 aired live two weeks ago, I placed two phone calls to Sony's customer service number.

1767
02:10:16,942 --> 02:10:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial call, as you may have suspected, didn't go well.

1768
02:10:20,024 --> 02:10:23,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I had explained my situation as clearly and calmly as I could after put...

1769
02:10:24,506 --> 02:10:31,989
[SPEAKER_03]: After being put on hold for an insanely long time, I was told that they couldn't do anything for me.

1770
02:10:32,309 --> 02:10:36,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes without saying that this tidbit of info did not sit well with me, and I was not about to let it just drop.

1771
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:41,192
[SPEAKER_03]: If need be, I was prepared to be a major thorn in their sides until something was done.

1772
02:10:41,932 --> 02:10:45,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Short while later, I had placed a second call to Sony and had asked to speak with a supervisor.

1773
02:10:46,336 --> 02:10:55,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The customer service rep that initially answered the call took down some basic info and connected me with a supervisor who, if I remember correctly, was named Gerald.

1774
02:10:56,533 --> 02:11:01,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just interview real quick and say, usually when you get put on hold for a long length of time, and you would know this too, Jamie.

1775
02:11:01,977 --> 02:11:04,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you worked in a call center for a while, and I trained for one and have for many years.

1776
02:11:05,619 --> 02:11:09,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually it's not because they just want to sit there and not do anything while they have you on hold.

1777
02:11:09,602 --> 02:11:10,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually they don't know the answer.

1778
02:11:10,943 --> 02:11:11,784
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to find out.

1779
02:11:12,124 --> 02:11:13,765
[SPEAKER_08]: That's usually why you're on hold for so long.

1780
02:11:14,185 --> 02:11:15,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all the time, but usually.

1781
02:11:15,767 --> 02:11:16,707
[SPEAKER_03]: No, well, I'll tell you.

1782
02:11:17,648 --> 02:11:24,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I worked, we actually would have, and reps would be marked down for this, that they'd have a two-minute hold time maximum.

1783
02:11:25,574 --> 02:11:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1784
02:11:26,414 --> 02:11:27,297
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

1785
02:11:32,984 --> 02:11:33,944
[SPEAKER_03]: to our reps on the phone.

1786
02:11:34,745 --> 02:11:38,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we would also take the escalated calls, you know, the pissed off people, which I loved.

1787
02:11:39,406 --> 02:11:39,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I was good at it.

1788
02:11:40,387 --> 02:11:47,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we... But we'd always go back and say, hey, you've had this person on hold for this long.

1789
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:50,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Go let them know that you're still talking to somebody.

1790
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:54,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and any call center I've been in contact with has a very similar policy.

1791
02:11:54,352 --> 02:11:57,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony probably doesn't need one because customer service probably isn't their top priority.

1792
02:11:57,213 --> 02:11:59,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it, but, you know, they don't need it.

1793
02:11:59,614 --> 02:11:59,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1794
02:12:00,934 --> 02:12:02,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, they're the only people to make the PS3.

1795
02:12:02,875 --> 02:12:06,036
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, customer service is not probably their forte.

1796
02:12:06,256 --> 02:12:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Although... But in some cases, too, like when I was actually on the floor doing calls, I would actually run and go to the source of something, which we weren't technically supposed to do, but I knew everybody in the other department.

1797
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:22,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you may have just someone who's in the know and knows where to go to find out what you need.

1798
02:12:23,121 --> 02:12:24,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So, give them the benefit of the doubt.

1799
02:12:24,982 --> 02:12:25,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1800
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:38,898
[SPEAKER_03]: However, moving forward, again, for what seemed like the trillionth time, I explained as clearly as I could in detail what the situation was and conveyed how upset I was that I no longer was able to use the content that I had paid tons of money for.

1801
02:12:39,399 --> 02:12:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I also mentioned how aggravated I was due to how previous calls went.

1802
02:12:44,202 --> 02:12:48,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, the supervisor agreed to allow me to re-download my paid content again as a one-time deal.

1803
02:12:49,205 --> 02:12:54,749
[SPEAKER_03]: He also made a point to mention that it would take a few days for everything to fully show up on my download queue due to two factors-

1804
02:12:55,349 --> 02:12:57,630
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.

1805
02:12:55,489 --> 02:12:57,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a lot of stuff and 2.

1806
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:01,791
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to go through it all and reauthorize it manually so needless to say it was going to take some time.

1807
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering all that I had profusely thanked the supervisor and told him that I was thankful for this.

1808
02:13:07,312 --> 02:13:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately everything started showing up on my list late Tuesday night which I started downloading.

1809
02:13:12,813 --> 02:13:15,254
[SPEAKER_03]: The first wave basically took all day to fully download.

1810
02:13:15,314 --> 02:13:21,275
[SPEAKER_03]: The second wave occurred roughly at the same time the following night and again took a considerable amount of time even with high speed cable.

1811
02:13:21,335 --> 02:13:24,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say two weeks later I now have all my content back.

1812
02:13:25,555 --> 02:13:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked out this time, but if, God forbid, next time I may not necessarily be so lucky.

1813
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So this email is just a little on the long side.

1814
02:13:55,362 --> 02:14:00,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that as of late the mailbag has been a little light, I figured you three wouldn't necessarily mind too much.

1815
02:14:00,767 --> 02:14:03,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for your input and help in the whole situation.

1816
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:05,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, it's greatly appreciated.

1817
02:14:05,851 --> 02:14:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's from Spazinator.

1818
02:14:06,932 --> 02:14:10,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, he typed this whole thing, I think, on the PlayStation browser.

1819
02:14:10,855 --> 02:14:11,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1820
02:14:11,556 --> 02:14:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the PSP.

1821
02:14:12,937 --> 02:14:13,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's impressive.

1822
02:14:13,978 --> 02:14:16,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, very good, very few errors.

1823
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite proud of you.

1824
02:14:17,341 --> 02:14:18,182
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1825
02:14:47,704 --> 02:14:48,485
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1826
02:15:07,117 --> 02:15:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: My graphics card from my computer is coming soon and I'm sure everyone will want to see the room you guys broadcast from.

1827
02:15:22,111 --> 02:15:22,612
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.

1828
02:15:23,232 --> 02:15:23,633
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.

1829
02:15:23,693 --> 02:15:27,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not want to see the disaster this room is right now.

1830
02:15:27,817 --> 02:15:31,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say I did take a picture of the mixing board and I took a picture of

1831
02:15:32,681 --> 02:15:41,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I also uploaded my photos of the cardboard slash cabinet Oh really, you got those up there?

1832
02:15:41,347 --> 02:16:00,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sweet It doesn't look like much yet because I just took a few quick pictures and they're probably not even I don't know, I just took a few in case I ever wanted to explain how I made it Oh god, there it is, your cardboard box with buttons Amazing Sorry Jamie No it's fine Better in person

1833
02:16:01,277 --> 02:16:03,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you should color it with magic marker.

1834
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:04,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, really.

1835
02:16:04,821 --> 02:16:05,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a paint pen or something.

1836
02:16:05,903 --> 02:16:06,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be funny.

1837
02:16:06,724 --> 02:16:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally wanted to just do it just in plain cardboard.

1838
02:16:10,628 --> 02:16:11,249
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

1839
02:16:11,349 --> 02:16:11,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Electrical tape.

1840
02:16:11,950 --> 02:16:13,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that cool vinyl look to it.

1841
02:16:14,753 --> 02:16:15,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have duct tape.

1842
02:16:15,854 --> 02:16:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of wrapping some of it in duct tape.

1843
02:16:17,737 --> 02:16:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1844
02:16:18,901 --> 02:16:19,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Use colored duct tape.

1845
02:16:19,943 --> 02:16:21,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to look very ghetto when it's done.

1846
02:16:21,885 --> 02:16:22,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be great.

1847
02:16:23,868 --> 02:16:35,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, actually this room is ready for a complete cleanup because I have these storage bins that have been sitting here on the floor forever and I'm ready to start using them.

1848
02:16:37,344 --> 02:16:52,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, to let anyone know too, this is sort of related, I'm getting rid of a whole bunch of manga and different books, including a few, I think I'm going to get rid of my Gothic and Lolita magazines, so if anyone wants them, let me know, we'll work something out.

1849
02:16:53,563 --> 02:16:54,424
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to the email.

1850
02:16:56,085 --> 02:17:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also when Loki's arcade cabinet works, maybe we could see Loki drunk playing Daytona USA.

1851
02:17:01,649 --> 02:17:02,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, just kidding.

1852
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:06,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm writing this from my Blackberry at Christmas party, so I better go.

1853
02:17:06,773 --> 02:17:08,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I go, and this is by the way halfway through the email.

1854
02:17:09,215 --> 02:17:12,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I go, I hope you guys check out Fallout 3 or even Fallout 1.

1855
02:17:13,257 --> 02:17:18,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend that you guys play Fallout 1 first since the third one is in first person and I know how DarkSakura gets motion sick.

1856
02:17:18,881 --> 02:17:19,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, thank you, that's so sweet.

1857
02:17:20,683 --> 02:17:22,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I think it's free to play on GameTap.

1858
02:17:22,844 --> 02:17:22,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1859
02:17:24,245 --> 02:17:33,451
[SPEAKER_03]: The third one has a game of the year edition now with all five downloaded content packs that I highly recommend anyone who hasn't played a Fallout game.

1860
02:17:33,591 --> 02:17:40,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Becky's husband has Fallout 3 and I saw him play some of it and it looked really cool.

1861
02:17:40,075 --> 02:17:41,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I wouldn't be able to do too much of it.

1862
02:17:43,649 --> 02:17:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention how much of a deal it is.

1863
02:17:47,091 --> 02:17:49,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you guys check those out now.

1864
02:17:49,453 --> 02:17:51,214
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'll excuse me, I've got gifts to open.

1865
02:17:51,814 --> 02:17:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Sent from my Verizon Wireless Blackberry.

1866
02:17:55,136 --> 02:17:55,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1867
02:17:55,637 --> 02:17:59,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We got regular email, a Crackberry, and a PSP all tonight.

1868
02:17:59,719 --> 02:18:00,480
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty amazing.

1869
02:18:01,468 --> 02:18:05,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to double check and see if we've got any more just because I'm nice.

1870
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:05,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1871
02:18:07,094 --> 02:18:07,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Clank.

1872
02:18:08,095 --> 02:18:12,320
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to send in an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send them.

1873
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:17,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here on the program because, you know, sometimes things piss us off.

1874
02:18:18,166 --> 02:18:20,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And so a special holiday edition of the FUs of the Week.

1875
02:18:35,782 --> 02:18:38,464
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what's on your mind tonight that you want to get off your chest?

1876
02:18:39,145 --> 02:18:43,009
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that I still need to, um, F you to me.

1877
02:18:43,449 --> 02:18:47,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I still need to do the faceplate that we were going to autograph.

1878
02:18:48,374 --> 02:18:48,714
[SPEAKER_08]: F you!

1879
02:18:49,154 --> 02:18:49,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1880
02:18:49,895 --> 02:18:51,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I had it set out.

1881
02:18:52,057 --> 02:18:52,477
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

1882
02:18:53,178 --> 02:18:53,578
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get it.

1883
02:18:53,859 --> 02:18:56,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but still, I feel bad about myself because I just remembered it.

1884
02:18:57,262 --> 02:19:00,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, um, a secondary F you to me for not actually cleaning my room today.

1885
02:19:01,346 --> 02:19:01,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Or yesterday.

1886
02:19:01,766 --> 02:19:01,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1887
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:05,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I came home very intoxicated last night.

1888
02:19:06,335 --> 02:19:06,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1889
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:08,196
[SPEAKER_03]: My car is over at Becky's house.

1890
02:19:09,596 --> 02:19:11,677
[SPEAKER_03]: She will be bringing it to me and I will be taking her home.

1891
02:19:12,257 --> 02:19:14,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So F you to me and Boddington's Ale.

1892
02:19:15,258 --> 02:19:17,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But bless you for doing the right thing and not driving home drunk.

1893
02:19:18,139 --> 02:19:18,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the right thing to do.

1894
02:19:18,919 --> 02:19:20,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm amazing.

1895
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1896
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to burning myself on my finger with a soldering iron.

1897
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:29,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided for some reason to grab the tip of the soldering iron to move it to the side.

1898
02:19:29,845 --> 02:19:30,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Not smart.

1899
02:19:30,346 --> 02:19:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I did that and was like, ow, as it sizzled.

1900
02:19:35,952 --> 02:19:36,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.

1901
02:19:37,165 --> 02:19:41,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe I'm the only one not giving an FU to myself tonight, although it does have to kind of do with me.

1902
02:19:42,306 --> 02:19:44,826
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to my back, because I don't know what I did.

1903
02:19:44,866 --> 02:19:49,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I might have slept on it wrong or something, but it's been hurting me for like a week, and it sucks.

1904
02:19:50,267 --> 02:19:51,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Back pain's never any fun.

1905
02:19:51,568 --> 02:19:54,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It just makes me remember that I'm getting old.

1906
02:19:54,868 --> 02:19:55,588
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to getting old.

1907
02:19:56,909 --> 02:20:00,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of you people listening to this show are like, I'm 21 now, I'm old.

1908
02:20:01,469 --> 02:20:01,849
[SPEAKER_08]: FU!

1909
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait about 10 years, then I'll tell you.

1910
02:20:06,271 --> 02:20:28,334
[SPEAKER_08]: of course then again a lot of my friends that are in their 40s would say I'm being just as big of a whiner so what can you do age is just a number Loki, why don't you give us another story and then just a couple more stories here we're going to make our way to the Skype line where you guys can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so we'll have that open very soon just after a couple more stories

1911
02:20:28,954 --> 02:20:50,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently not to delay themselves from jumping on the bandwagon too late, Microsoft has decided to go ahead and patent their own Xbox 360 hint system, very similar to what we saw with the Super Guide on the Nintendo.

1912
02:20:50,169 --> 02:20:53,371
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember that the first game that had that was New Super Mario Bros.,

1913
02:20:55,232 --> 02:21:14,256
[SPEAKER_02]: This new patent, though, it doesn't really say what they're going to do exactly, but it's going to have some more guides and digital brief audio commentaries or stuff that adds portions of the screen that give you hints and stuff like that.

1914
02:21:14,716 --> 02:21:21,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of a generic system that maybe they're going to include in some games going forward to make them more approachable for casual gamers.

1915
02:21:23,547 --> 02:21:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1916
02:21:24,108 --> 02:21:25,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Have I heard this before?

1917
02:21:26,370 --> 02:21:28,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a neat idea.

1918
02:21:28,652 --> 02:21:35,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of gave the whole hint system crap for the Wii and stuff like that.

1919
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:39,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to be the staple CC button.

1920
02:21:39,702 --> 02:21:47,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so behind the scenes stuff, it really shouldn't have been even brought up.

1921
02:21:47,427 --> 02:21:52,750
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, people were reading way too much into the trademark and the patent documents.

1922
02:21:53,291 --> 02:21:56,873
[SPEAKER_08]: But, to be fair, we've also only seen it implemented in one game.

1923
02:21:57,413 --> 02:22:02,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what it's going to look like in the next Zelda game or some other games that Nintendo might have in the future, just saying.

1924
02:22:03,017 --> 02:22:06,299
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, maybe a lot of us jumped the gun and that's what happens.

1925
02:22:09,217 --> 02:22:15,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know, do you think Xbox 360 is just like, hey, Nintendo's got a good idea, let's copy it, or do you think they're really going in a different direction with this?

1926
02:22:15,385 --> 02:22:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just trying to kind of...

1927
02:22:17,967 --> 02:22:23,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the same approach, not necessarily just because Nintendo did it, but maybe had the same ideas.

1928
02:22:24,248 --> 02:22:30,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to be fair, Microsoft kind of does this sort of thing very well where somebody's got an idea, they sort of take it and make it better.

1929
02:22:31,450 --> 02:22:34,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're trying to kind of broaden themselves out.

1930
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of have the opposite problem as Nintendo.

1931
02:22:37,451 --> 02:22:46,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo, they're really trying to broaden the audience so much so that they don't really have any core games for the core gamer, I guess.

1932
02:22:46,693 --> 02:22:46,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1933
02:23:17,509 --> 02:23:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Alienware computers are coming now pre-loaded with Steam

1934
02:23:34,625 --> 02:23:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Alienware is now actually bundling with their all-powerful systems.

1935
02:23:52,833 --> 02:23:55,934
[SPEAKER_08]: These actually, I gotta admit, they're kind of cool looking, the whole black and red thing.

1936
02:23:55,974 --> 02:23:59,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're gonna pay that much money for a system, it might as well look kind of awesome.

1937
02:24:00,135 --> 02:24:05,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you buy one of these all-powerful systems, they're actually shipping with Steam.

1938
02:24:06,037 --> 02:24:07,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Steam comes on these systems.

1939
02:24:08,817 --> 02:24:15,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the reason why is because Portal is a free game that's included, which of course was a Valve game that they did release through Steam.

1940
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:18,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually bought, that was the very first game I ever bought through Steam was Portal.

1941
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So, no, second game because I bought AudioSurf too.

1942
02:24:21,842 --> 02:24:25,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless, Steam is now coming in bundled with these systems.

1943
02:24:25,764 --> 02:24:29,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Which for these box systems is not really new news.

1944
02:24:29,426 --> 02:24:39,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I talked about earlier, and it's funny kind of to bring this full circle because Jamie had a story earlier about Steamworks and I was saying like, aren't those like Google Toolbars and all that other crap that tries to install with the program kind of annoying?

1945
02:24:40,132 --> 02:24:47,897
[SPEAKER_08]: But this, you sort of grow to expect that when you buy these computers in a box, they come preloaded with tons of crap.

1946
02:24:48,157 --> 02:24:48,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloatware.

1947
02:24:49,298 --> 02:24:50,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's... What do they call that?

1948
02:24:50,618 --> 02:24:51,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloatware.

1949
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:52,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of that.

1950
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:52,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloatware.

1951
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:54,080
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good term for it.

1952
02:24:54,740 --> 02:25:01,424
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you know, the antivirus demo is installed and the trial of Microsoft Office is already on the computer.

1953
02:25:01,524 --> 02:25:04,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So this honestly just seems like another logical step to me.

1954
02:25:04,846 --> 02:25:08,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of a kick in the groin to the competitors like, you know, direct-to-drive and so forth.

1955
02:25:08,588 --> 02:25:10,809
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are you going to do?

1956
02:25:11,169 --> 02:25:11,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1957
02:25:11,469 --> 02:25:13,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you could say the Microsoft Office has its competitors too.

1958
02:25:14,051 --> 02:25:16,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, they get to jump up on some of these...

1959
02:25:17,778 --> 02:25:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: and so forth.

1960
02:25:19,278 --> 02:25:30,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangelongerator.com Salacious Pop says Alienware has a build your own shopping cart a la the Apple site where you can build a system for $7,000 without really trying.

1961
02:25:31,141 --> 02:25:35,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku says Skyid is hella cheaper to build your own PC than to buy from Alienware.

1962
02:25:36,183 --> 02:25:37,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Can they be as pretty though?

1963
02:25:37,203 --> 02:25:39,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I gotta say those systems are very nice looking.

1964
02:25:39,063 --> 02:25:41,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised what you can find in cases nowadays.

1965
02:25:41,784 --> 02:25:45,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I've got to say, the new computer we've got for the show is pretty sleek looking.

1966
02:25:45,645 --> 02:25:46,625
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice looking little box.

1967
02:25:46,685 --> 02:25:48,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't even trying.

1968
02:25:48,605 --> 02:25:53,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't light up pretty, but it looks nicer than the one I've got for myself.

1969
02:25:53,186 --> 02:25:56,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, it's almost hard to find a case that doesn't light up.

1970
02:25:57,687 --> 02:26:01,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, my computer at the time, I think, cost me $1,700.

1971
02:26:01,348 --> 02:26:01,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put in...

1972
02:26:05,785 --> 02:26:06,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1973
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:28,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

1974
02:26:28,361 --> 02:26:28,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1975
02:26:48,511 --> 02:26:50,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at some of the other comments here.

1976
02:26:50,652 --> 02:26:54,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says, the general consumer doesn't know how to build a computer and will go for something that's already built.

1977
02:26:55,554 --> 02:26:56,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That's clearly where they're making their money.

1978
02:26:57,615 --> 02:26:58,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw says, here's the thing.

1979
02:26:58,956 --> 02:27:01,837
[SPEAKER_08]: What is more important, the way the case looks or the performance of the system?

1980
02:27:01,917 --> 02:27:02,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I choose the latter.

1981
02:27:02,978 --> 02:27:09,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, in all seriousness, and for myself and not playing devil's advocate here, obviously, you're not staring at the box the whole time.

1982
02:27:09,921 --> 02:27:11,222
[SPEAKER_08]: You're staring at what's on the monitor.

1983
02:27:11,682 --> 02:27:14,783
[SPEAKER_08]: The box is just for impressing people at LAN parties.

1984
02:27:15,224 --> 02:27:15,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1985
02:27:16,044 --> 02:27:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: My computer lights up.

1986
02:27:17,105 --> 02:27:18,206
[SPEAKER_02]: My power supply lights up.

1987
02:27:18,266 --> 02:27:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine lights up like a bluish color, but it's nothing special.

1988
02:27:21,209 --> 02:27:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite, I think, computer that anyone ever built was one built into a tall tackle box.

1989
02:27:29,017 --> 02:27:30,579
[SPEAKER_03]: No, a tall metal toolbox.

1990
02:27:31,761 --> 02:27:41,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta say, maybe lesson learned here, I didn't build my own computer the last time I bought a computer because, you know, I'm not quite as talented as Loki or whatever.

1991
02:27:41,348 --> 02:27:47,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought maybe I was getting a really good deal because I bought my computer for, you know, a certain price that was kind of low to me.

1992
02:27:47,652 --> 02:27:54,096
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I'm learning, should have got a better video card and, you know, some of these other things I should have considered better at the time.

1993
02:27:54,156 --> 02:27:54,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But lesson learned.

1994
02:27:55,578 --> 02:28:03,604
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I would change if I were to go back and actually make my computer again is I would not buy another graphics card to run SLI.

1995
02:28:03,624 --> 02:28:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have two graphics cards in mine.

1996
02:28:05,526 --> 02:28:13,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're both EVGA, GTS, 8800 graphics cards with half gig RAM in each one.

1997
02:28:14,353 --> 02:28:18,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in the games that run SLI, it's awesome.

1998
02:28:18,296 --> 02:28:22,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But most stuff out there does not support SLI.

1999
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:22,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

2000
02:28:26,115 --> 02:28:30,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it for Crysis, but Crysis got boring really fast.

2001
02:28:31,531 --> 02:28:31,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Bummer.

2002
02:28:32,672 --> 02:28:36,555
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line now.

2003
02:28:36,575 --> 02:28:39,556
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.

2004
02:28:39,596 --> 02:28:43,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take your calls live here for a little bit, and then we'll start to wrap up the show.

2005
02:28:44,019 --> 02:28:53,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, while we wait for the calls to come in, because there's a little bit of a delay from studio to encoding to the all-game server to you guys hearing it, let's see if there's any last-minute stories.

2006
02:28:54,045 --> 02:28:58,228
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rumor that there's going to be some exclusive characters for Sonic Sega Online.

2007
02:28:58,508 --> 02:29:03,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic and Sega All-Star Racing, including for the Xbox 360 that Banjo-Kazooie might be interesting.

2008
02:29:05,233 --> 02:29:12,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from some work-in-progress box shots that are appearing, I guess, on their UK site.

2009
02:29:12,479 --> 02:29:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of interesting.

2010
02:29:15,882 --> 02:29:20,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's a fun little website I was looking at earlier that you can...

2011
02:29:21,633 --> 02:29:41,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Create your own Zelda scenes with the Zelda 2 text generator And if you go check it out, it's at ZeldaPower.com And it's under their features The Adventures of Link text box toy You can make all sorts of weird scenes But you can't actually put them in the game, right?

2012
02:29:41,331 --> 02:29:47,036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just to make little webpages or stuff for forums and stuff like that So it's kind of neat

2013
02:29:49,983 --> 02:29:52,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, more forum macros, just what we needed.

2014
02:29:54,505 --> 02:30:02,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is a rumor that apparently you're going to be able to attend some of these gaming conferences through your Xbox 360.

2015
02:30:03,409 --> 02:30:19,137
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the new things they're talking about is imagine an interactive online version of E3, BlizzCon, Gamescom, Comic-Con, and every other major video game convention were made available through Xbox Live.

2016
02:30:20,413 --> 02:30:24,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that is being put out there.

2017
02:30:24,135 --> 02:30:29,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's coming from some guy who works in the game industry, VG Market, I guess.

2018
02:30:30,179 --> 02:30:35,182
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a, looks like it's another survey, a market research survey.

2019
02:30:36,543 --> 02:30:38,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know about those market research surveys.

2020
02:30:38,404 --> 02:30:41,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they end up coming true.

2021
02:30:42,517 --> 02:30:45,119
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of comments there in chat about the SLI.

2022
02:30:45,239 --> 02:30:47,922
[SPEAKER_08]: DangerSkew in our chat says, I agree with the SLI argument.

2023
02:30:47,982 --> 02:30:54,027
[SPEAKER_08]: You should never build a computer with SLI from the beginning, only if you need more power later.

2024
02:30:55,128 --> 02:30:57,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And TigerClaw says, you only need SLI if you have a huge-ass monitor.

2025
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:59,872
[SPEAKER_08]: It's meant to handle graphics to higher resolutions.

2026
02:31:00,212 --> 02:31:03,374
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a 19-inch widescreen monitor and only one NVIDIA card, you're good to go.

2027
02:31:03,595 --> 02:31:06,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, those comments coming from chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

2028
02:31:06,357 --> 02:31:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Skype all fucked up today?

2029
02:31:07,198 --> 02:31:07,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what's going on?

2030
02:31:22,511 --> 02:31:24,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I had something awful linked to me, Rob.

2031
02:31:24,472 --> 02:31:26,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype was acting weird earlier, but yeah, what's that?

2032
02:31:27,212 --> 02:31:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: A trailer for Nuking a Fighter's movie.

2033
02:31:30,253 --> 02:31:31,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a real movie?

2034
02:31:31,453 --> 02:31:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it has Ray Park in it.

2035
02:31:33,333 --> 02:31:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And I watched some of it and I wanted to cry because I'm like, where's Kyo?

2036
02:31:38,594 --> 02:31:40,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an American movie or is it something that's been made overseas?

2037
02:31:41,015 --> 02:31:41,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's American.

2038
02:31:41,635 --> 02:31:41,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2039
02:31:41,975 --> 02:31:43,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know they were making that.

2040
02:31:44,236 --> 02:31:46,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You would have thought I would have heard about this sooner.

2041
02:31:46,864 --> 02:31:48,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I send you the link?

2042
02:31:48,845 --> 02:31:49,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2043
02:31:49,486 --> 02:31:51,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can play how awful it is on the air.

2044
02:31:51,747 --> 02:31:52,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, we're getting a call.

2045
02:31:53,968 --> 02:31:54,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Islands Radio.

2046
02:31:54,889 --> 02:31:55,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2047
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:57,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Legend of Zaku.

2048
02:31:57,410 --> 02:31:58,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

2049
02:31:58,331 --> 02:31:58,971
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2050
02:31:59,932 --> 02:32:00,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much.

2051
02:32:00,612 --> 02:32:05,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to get over this whole Thanksgiving ordeal.

2052
02:32:06,155 --> 02:32:06,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2053
02:32:07,456 --> 02:32:11,899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bummer we all have to go back to work tomorrow, but such is life.

2054
02:32:13,206 --> 02:32:18,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, basically, I know we barely covered the DDR and Belmonte scene, but...

2055
02:32:19,955 --> 02:32:24,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured you already know by now that DDRX2 has an arcade release.

2056
02:32:24,819 --> 02:32:26,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to be released in Japan.

2057
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:28,521
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll mention it once in a while.

2058
02:32:28,601 --> 02:32:34,746
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't mention every little story like we used to, but any of the big things will come up.

2059
02:32:34,786 --> 02:32:44,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we mentioned the location test last week, and I did read something on the internet this week that somebody out there in Japan was bringing back reports of what was in the location test, which was a lot of...

2060
02:32:45,313 --> 02:33:13,520
[SPEAKER_08]: your Beatmania 2DX style artists and a lot of the Konami House originals which I think is DDR's biggest problem right now in cracking the mainstream is that I realize people love their Konami originals I do too, there's a lot of talented artists it's never going to break into the mainstream unless they start Well, I mean, that all depends on what licenses they end up including in the final version but right now, apparently a lot of the community from the consensus I'm hearing right now is that they actually

2061
02:33:14,811 --> 02:33:17,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually hearing good consensus from them.

2062
02:33:17,413 --> 02:33:21,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually hearing a lot of good things in terms of the song selections.

2063
02:33:21,876 --> 02:33:22,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty much it.

2064
02:33:22,977 --> 02:33:34,446
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be skeptical as to whether or not they can execute the same Japanese version to America, which we already know how much of a disaster DRX was.

2065
02:33:36,553 --> 02:33:37,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it?

2066
02:33:37,153 --> 02:33:40,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really, I have to admit, you know, I haven't been following DDRs closely.

2067
02:33:41,257 --> 02:33:46,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the fucked up pads and the countless number of, you know, fixes afterwards.

2068
02:33:47,021 --> 02:33:52,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Even my pads, even my David Busters managed to get a DDRX CAD that couldn't even last a month.

2069
02:33:53,205 --> 02:33:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not even playable.

2070
02:33:55,747 --> 02:33:58,289
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that there's, yeah, there's not that many machines around.

2071
02:33:58,869 --> 02:34:02,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the fact that they killed off upgrade kits made it even worse.

2072
02:34:02,832 --> 02:34:04,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pretty much consider that a failure.

2073
02:34:07,608 --> 02:34:14,915
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I see it is that I use Supernova as a baseline because that manages to have good coverage all around.

2074
02:34:15,455 --> 02:34:21,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about most of the places I can think of off the top of my head that had Supernova at one point.

2075
02:34:22,021 --> 02:34:25,725
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when I try to do the same thing for DDRX, I can't.

2076
02:34:25,885 --> 02:34:27,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only think of one place.

2077
02:34:28,604 --> 02:34:32,506
[SPEAKER_01]: and another place that wasn't Coney Island that no longer has the machine.

2078
02:34:32,666 --> 02:34:33,126
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.

2079
02:34:33,827 --> 02:34:36,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, Zaku, I just want to play 4th Mix Plus.

2080
02:34:38,229 --> 02:34:40,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I already had that chance.

2081
02:34:40,830 --> 02:34:41,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already played that.

2082
02:34:42,091 --> 02:34:42,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

2083
02:34:43,771 --> 02:34:46,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer, back on 8 on the break, we basically...

2084
02:34:47,879 --> 02:34:57,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I've played it before, but I'm just saying, like, with all these fancy new mixes and all that stuff going on, I miss 4th Plus.

2085
02:34:57,206 --> 02:34:58,406
[SPEAKER_08]: 4th Plus was the bomb.

2086
02:34:58,426 --> 02:35:00,308
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the best mix they ever did.

2087
02:35:00,908 --> 02:35:03,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they're doing, they have, like,

2088
02:35:03,951 --> 02:35:06,874
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been throwing fourth and fifth mix around pretty recently.

2089
02:35:06,894 --> 02:35:11,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're still doing it now, but that's what they were doing a couple of months ago.

2090
02:35:30,894 --> 02:35:31,294
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

2091
02:35:31,314 --> 02:35:33,035
[SPEAKER_08]: 5th Mix was pretty badass, too.

2092
02:35:33,055 --> 02:35:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Where else can you play Moonlight Shadow?

2093
02:35:34,355 --> 02:35:34,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

2094
02:35:35,415 --> 02:35:36,235
[SPEAKER_02]: 5th Mix was awesome.

2095
02:35:37,536 --> 02:35:37,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2096
02:35:38,356 --> 02:35:39,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, please.

2097
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:43,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else on your mind this week besides just the DDRX2?

2098
02:35:44,757 --> 02:35:50,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, going on what you said about Alienware, you can build yourself a PC for less than $1,000.

2099
02:35:50,579 --> 02:35:52,699
[SPEAKER_01]: A really good gaming rate for less than $1,000.

2100
02:35:53,599 --> 02:35:55,860
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to look hard and deep and you just gotta...

2101
02:35:56,724 --> 02:35:59,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta really consider what you prioritize.

2102
02:35:59,206 --> 02:36:00,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphics, sound, or both.

2103
02:36:02,909 --> 02:36:04,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

2104
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:08,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've managed to get mine for $1,700 and change when I bought them, you know, when I built it.

2105
02:36:09,555 --> 02:36:12,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still runs pretty good as of today.

2106
02:36:12,357 --> 02:36:20,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously it can't do 60 frames of a crisis, but it can play stuff like Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 pretty well.

2107
02:36:21,297 --> 02:36:25,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of how much you're willing to spend on something like that.

2108
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:28,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's important, too, is prioritizing.

2109
02:36:28,661 --> 02:36:30,202
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you really want out of your machine?

2110
02:36:30,482 --> 02:36:36,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you buy a cheapo graphics card but buy a big monitor, it's not going to do a lot of good.

2111
02:36:36,445 --> 02:36:38,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, you've got to get at least something.

2112
02:36:38,947 --> 02:36:42,248
[SPEAKER_01]: At least GeForce 9 or better right now.

2113
02:36:43,129 --> 02:36:46,871
[SPEAKER_01]: That should do you good for another year or two before you have to refresh it.

2114
02:36:49,048 --> 02:36:53,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, see if anybody else is trying to call tonight.

2115
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:54,411
[SPEAKER_08]: But have a good one, okay, buddy?

2116
02:36:54,991 --> 02:36:55,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2117
02:36:55,451 --> 02:36:55,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, later, buddy.

2118
02:36:56,812 --> 02:37:03,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, 1877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2119
02:37:03,295 --> 02:37:04,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way will do it.

2120
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:08,538
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep the phone lines open a little bit longer to see if anyone wants to get through.

2121
02:37:08,558 --> 02:37:10,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some people told me earlier they wanted to call in.

2122
02:37:10,499 --> 02:37:12,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if they're going to try to get through or what.

2123
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:13,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other last-minute stories?

2124
02:37:13,901 --> 02:37:14,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you the link.

2125
02:37:14,941 --> 02:37:15,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

2126
02:37:15,361 --> 02:37:15,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

2127
02:37:16,602 --> 02:37:18,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot about... Oh, and of course we're getting another call.

2128
02:37:18,404 --> 02:37:19,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring up the link for after this though.

2129
02:37:20,606 --> 02:37:21,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2130
02:37:21,567 --> 02:37:21,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2131
02:37:23,649 --> 02:37:24,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2132
02:37:24,850 --> 02:37:25,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, X-Link.

2133
02:37:25,470 --> 02:37:25,971
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?

2134
02:37:26,611 --> 02:37:27,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing good.

2135
02:37:27,672 --> 02:37:31,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing a game recently that I'd like to talk a little bit about if it's okay with you.

2136
02:37:31,276 --> 02:37:31,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

2137
02:37:31,736 --> 02:37:32,057
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

2138
02:37:33,024 --> 02:37:36,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing the full version, and the full version is not that much different than the demo.

2139
02:37:37,045 --> 02:37:39,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you can level up your monsters a lot more.

2140
02:37:39,366 --> 02:37:40,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been playing just a little bit.

2141
02:37:40,607 --> 02:37:43,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't gone through the whole game exactly yet.

2142
02:37:44,248 --> 02:37:45,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing during downtime for a while, so...

2143
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:00,639
[SPEAKER_00]: PC.

2144
02:38:00,939 --> 02:38:01,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2145
02:38:01,699 --> 02:38:02,120
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

2146
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:02,800
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts on it?

2147
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:03,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

2148
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:16,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I like because I'm a big Blitz, Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz fan and I think they're taking more after Bejeweled Blitz because the fact you have to rotate the pieces to make the lines to sum around.

2149
02:38:17,545 --> 02:38:18,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot more.

2150
02:38:19,525 --> 02:38:23,227
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more difficult than going, okay, well I'm going to take this and switch these two around.

2151
02:38:23,287 --> 02:38:24,247
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like two pieces.

2152
02:38:24,267 --> 02:38:27,488
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to switch actually four around in a counterclockwise position.

2153
02:38:27,779 --> 02:38:28,480
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2154
02:38:49,025 --> 02:38:49,926
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2155
02:39:08,869 --> 02:39:34,280
[SPEAKER_08]: in gyromancer your twists do not have to cause three to line up you'll get higher scores and even penalized you know if it doesn't and higher scores if they do but I just had such a hard time kind of getting used to that idea I mean it didn't ruin the game for me I still think it's kind of interesting but I just think I'm going to suck at it because I always play Bejeweled Blitz because I want my epine to have me at the top of the leaderboard even though that never happens

2156
02:39:34,835 --> 02:39:35,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.

2157
02:39:35,335 --> 02:39:45,480
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more points by doing that, but also at the same time though, if you do a move and you don't make three, it will cause the enemy's power to grow a little bit each time.

2158
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:54,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make those lines, you want to make the ones, because for each of your characters you get a certain color, so you want to make those lines with the color that you're...

2159
02:39:56,664 --> 02:40:00,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Creature Represents, so that way you can use your powers and take more.

2160
02:40:01,346 --> 02:40:02,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool because it has a life.

2161
02:40:03,947 --> 02:40:15,931
[SPEAKER_00]: It added more of a role-playing element to it with the hit points, so you do certain moves and it'll take away hit points away from the other enemy depending on how many was chained or what was happening.

2162
02:40:17,291 --> 02:40:23,393
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of the element to Puzzle Quest to it, but it's a lot of fun, though.

2163
02:40:23,473 --> 02:40:24,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Puzzle Quest Puzzle Quest Puzzle Quest

2164
02:40:49,651 --> 02:40:50,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

2165
02:40:50,192 --> 02:40:59,237
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of the puzzle quest type feel to it, but it's more storyline driven and a little more interaction that I would say than that.

2166
02:41:01,311 --> 02:41:05,294
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said before, for a puzzle game, $15, it was Pop Game and Square Enix.

2167
02:41:05,314 --> 02:41:07,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really go too wrong with it.

2168
02:41:07,616 --> 02:41:07,997
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.

2169
02:41:08,057 --> 02:41:09,678
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a damn good price.

2170
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:25,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool how there's been all this puzzle game resurgence in the past couple of years, especially these very, very fleshed out type of puzzle games between what Q Entertainment has been giving us with Luminous and so forth, and now these RPG meets PopCap games.

2171
02:41:25,411 --> 02:41:26,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty fascinating.

2172
02:41:26,972 --> 02:41:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use it mostly, like I said before, as a time killer.

2173
02:41:29,254 --> 02:41:38,299
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want something to fill in in 15 minutes, I usually just load it up and then play it, you know, play or maybe play like one level a day or something, so that way I don't get an overkill of it, so.

2174
02:41:38,679 --> 02:41:40,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised this game hasn't shown up on every platform.

2175
02:41:40,961 --> 02:41:42,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it's on the iPhone.

2176
02:41:43,382 --> 02:41:48,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now I know it's for the Xbox and PC, but I don't know if they're going to expand it over that.

2177
02:41:48,145 --> 02:41:50,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're trying to wait to see what happens first beforehand, so.

2178
02:41:51,047 --> 02:41:51,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

2179
02:41:51,948 --> 02:41:52,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.

2180
02:41:52,548 --> 02:41:53,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?

2181
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:57,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Night of the Old Republic 250

2182
02:42:17,515 --> 02:42:25,087
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're just getting people to install Steam to get these hella good deals and maybe even, you know, kind of the idea behind the consoles they're taking a little bit of a loss

2183
02:42:26,389 --> 02:42:30,370
[SPEAKER_08]: over these games, you know, especially a game like Knights of the Old Republic that hasn't really generated buzz.

2184
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:32,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't put it that way.

2185
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:33,211
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's years old.

2186
02:42:33,311 --> 02:42:33,931
[SPEAKER_08]: It's years old.

2187
02:42:34,391 --> 02:42:35,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to think about it this way.

2188
02:42:35,771 --> 02:42:46,493
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone was sitting around, like, say, for, like, example, even in the video store, a game was sitting around, they wasn't doing anything, and they're going, they put a price tag of $250 on there, and they know it's going to hit, then they, you know, at least they're making something out of nothing.

2189
02:42:46,533 --> 02:42:48,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, they're making money somehow.

2190
02:42:48,234 --> 02:42:48,574
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

2191
02:42:49,795 --> 02:42:50,035
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

2192
02:42:50,055 --> 02:42:51,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe it's a range of these companies.

2193
02:42:51,216 --> 02:42:51,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2194
02:42:51,856 --> 02:42:56,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm holding out hope that Torchlight is in tomorrow's deals because I really wanted to pick that up.

2195
02:42:56,978 --> 02:42:59,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, you get what you pay for.

2196
02:42:59,139 --> 02:43:03,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like I kind of kicked myself in the ass for picking up F.A.W.

2197
02:43:03,681 --> 02:43:07,483
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 and then two months down the road they're like, oh, by the way, Game of Year Edition, same price.

2198
02:43:07,523 --> 02:43:10,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all the downloadable content to go with it.

2199
02:43:10,625 --> 02:43:11,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bummer.

2200
02:43:11,605 --> 02:43:19,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did pick up Civ 4 also from GoGamer when they're doing their Black Friday deals for $10, which was the complete edition.

2201
02:43:19,628 --> 02:43:23,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very nice compared to that of $5 from Best Buy.

2202
02:43:24,090 --> 02:43:24,370
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2203
02:43:24,791 --> 02:43:28,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, X-Link, we're going to let you go so we can try and get maybe one more call in.

2204
02:43:28,432 --> 02:43:29,433
[SPEAKER_08]: But have a great night, okay?

2205
02:43:29,673 --> 02:43:29,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

2206
02:43:29,893 --> 02:43:30,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2207
02:43:30,093 --> 02:43:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks for the review on Gyromancer.

2208
02:43:31,814 --> 02:43:32,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

2209
02:43:32,094 --> 02:43:32,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime.

2210
02:43:34,075 --> 02:43:36,837
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2211
02:43:36,958 --> 02:43:40,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get that video brought up here that DarkSakura was talking about earlier.

2212
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:43,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look at a little bit of a clip here.

2213
02:43:44,704 --> 02:43:50,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It does look like an actual, like... I just never knew they were making a movie out of King of Fighters.

2214
02:43:50,228 --> 02:43:51,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe... Is that mine?

2215
02:43:51,509 --> 02:43:53,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this definitely looks direct-to-video.

2216
02:44:01,756 --> 02:44:02,036
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2217
02:44:03,298 --> 02:44:08,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, and Rick Park.

2218
02:44:12,726 --> 02:44:13,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, whatever.

2219
02:44:15,689 --> 02:44:17,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun for fan of martial arts movies and stuff, I'm sure.

2220
02:44:18,091 --> 02:44:19,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of my soul cried.

2221
02:44:20,513 --> 02:44:21,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

2222
02:44:21,794 --> 02:44:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2223
02:44:22,775 --> 02:44:23,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2224
02:44:23,976 --> 02:44:25,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

2225
02:44:25,137 --> 02:44:26,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, hey, what's up?

2226
02:44:26,778 --> 02:44:27,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

2227
02:44:27,438 --> 02:44:36,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make this brief because since you guys were talking about DDR and so forth, a funny little anecdote popped up at Anime USA that I have to share with you guys.

2228
02:44:36,142 --> 02:44:37,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

2229
02:44:37,723 --> 02:44:38,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2230
02:44:39,723 --> 02:44:46,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you guys covered this about the whole... I think you guys did the whole Konami DDR tournament that they were having.

2231
02:44:47,146 --> 02:44:48,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I came up on the show.

2232
02:44:48,087 --> 02:44:50,848
[SPEAKER_08]: People emailed us about it and we were kind of giving our spin on it.

2233
02:44:51,408 --> 02:44:55,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Not enough notice on it, I think, for it to be taken as seriously as they wanted it to be.

2234
02:44:56,868 --> 02:45:02,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, I believe there was also a cutoff point for the tournament.

2235
02:45:02,569 --> 02:45:04,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to be under a certain age to compete.

2236
02:45:05,070 --> 02:45:06,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I remember that.

2237
02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:10,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So officially DDR has turned its back on me, yes.

2238
02:45:10,731 --> 02:45:17,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from what I understand, they're saying the cutoff date was like 31 or 32, which I call shenanigans on.

2239
02:45:17,453 --> 02:45:21,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the people I know in the DDR fandom community...

2240
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:31,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was DDR Darryl Bill, he told me how it was crazy that they were having this, and I ran into another friend of mine, Jim DaFly, at Anime USA.

2241
02:45:32,533 --> 02:45:41,037
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me that the guy that was hosting the tournament, who more or less put the rules together, he himself had a heart attack.

2242
02:45:42,497 --> 02:45:42,777
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2243
02:45:43,738 --> 02:45:44,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2244
02:45:44,798 --> 02:45:49,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, the guy who, wait, like a heart attack, like literally had a heart attack?

2245
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:49,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2246
02:45:51,984 --> 02:45:53,525
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2247
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:14,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Caram is kind of fucked up, isn't it?

2248
02:46:14,119 --> 02:46:15,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, hold on.

2249
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:22,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I would never, you know, even if it was, let's say it's just like the worst of the worst bottom of the barrel video game personality.

2250
02:46:22,541 --> 02:46:26,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for instance, this guy who's suing all the companies for these ludicrous reasons.

2251
02:46:26,922 --> 02:46:28,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not wish a heart attack upon them.

2252
02:46:29,122 --> 02:46:29,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I would wish.

2253
02:46:29,502 --> 02:46:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither would I, but I just find this just odd.

2254
02:46:32,483 --> 02:46:35,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like he's talking about you can't be over a certain age to compete.

2255
02:46:35,163 --> 02:46:35,783
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this, and this.

2256
02:46:35,883 --> 02:46:38,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, boom, he has a heart attack.

2257
02:46:38,104 --> 02:46:38,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what?

2258
02:46:39,895 --> 02:46:41,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence.

2259
02:46:41,958 --> 02:46:43,600
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people get sick as they get older.

2260
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:46,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be the stage to compete, because this is what?

2261
02:46:46,543 --> 02:46:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you have to have a blood pressure under a certain, you know,

2262
02:46:57,065 --> 02:47:21,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's sad, and I don't want to make jokes about it, you know, and I don't care if you all hate the fucking rules or whatever, but I just don't think we would ever want to wish that upon somebody, and I hope it gets better soon, but I think what I can speak to is the tournament itself, and, you know, the rules and the tournament itself seemed a little silly, and was hastily thrown together, and I think that's why it didn't get probably the type of coverage that hopefully Konami was going for.

2263
02:47:23,484 --> 02:47:24,105
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know what?

2264
02:47:24,405 --> 02:47:30,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to host my own national DDR tournament and you can be up to whatever age you want.

2265
02:47:30,430 --> 02:47:35,374
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need to bring your walker, your wheelchair, your cane to compete, that's fine.

2266
02:47:35,394 --> 02:47:36,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't bar me.

2267
02:47:36,275 --> 02:47:41,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on though because then I'll bring a cane and use it to hit the arrows and so forth.

2268
02:47:41,699 --> 02:47:42,280
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be cheating.

2269
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the guy though who played on crutches.

2270
02:47:45,863 --> 02:47:46,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Freestyle's different.

2271
02:47:47,965 --> 02:47:48,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And he mostly PA'd too.

2272
02:47:48,765 --> 02:47:48,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he?

2273
02:47:48,985 --> 02:47:49,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2274
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:56,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Is playing with crutches like holding the bar, though?

2275
02:47:56,252 --> 02:47:57,413
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, he had one leg.

2276
02:47:58,073 --> 02:47:58,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he really?

2277
02:47:58,854 --> 02:47:59,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2278
02:47:59,214 --> 02:48:00,695
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video up on YouTube.

2279
02:48:00,815 --> 02:48:01,936
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not thinking of the same guy, then.

2280
02:48:05,798 --> 02:48:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I might, I think he's actually from New York.

2281
02:48:09,841 --> 02:48:10,361
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while.

2282
02:48:10,401 --> 02:48:11,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Ranma know him?

2283
02:48:11,852 --> 02:48:12,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2284
02:48:12,252 --> 02:48:14,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not no, but Zaku might.

2285
02:48:14,192 --> 02:48:14,493
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2286
02:48:14,873 --> 02:48:17,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go and, you know, be safe.

2287
02:48:18,473 --> 02:48:19,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Us 30-year-olds.

2288
02:48:19,794 --> 02:48:21,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have my Geritol shake.

2289
02:48:21,514 --> 02:48:22,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I saved some for you.

2290
02:48:22,814 --> 02:48:23,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2291
02:48:23,334 --> 02:48:23,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2292
02:48:23,794 --> 02:48:25,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I use Ensure, but thank you.

2293
02:48:25,595 --> 02:48:25,815
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2294
02:48:25,835 --> 02:48:26,475
[SPEAKER_08]: All right now.

2295
02:48:26,715 --> 02:48:27,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Ranma.

2296
02:48:27,375 --> 02:48:28,095
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2297
02:48:28,215 --> 02:48:28,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2298
02:48:31,376 --> 02:48:33,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that, I mean, that's unfortunate.

2299
02:48:33,256 --> 02:48:36,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I don't care what fucked up tournament he planned.

2300
02:48:36,477 --> 02:48:37,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, heart attacks suck.

2301
02:48:37,677 --> 02:48:40,618
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's just, that's, that's, I hope he's okay, for God's sake.

2302
02:48:41,318 --> 02:48:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2303
02:48:41,538 --> 02:48:41,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2304
02:48:42,082 --> 02:48:42,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2305
02:48:56,164 --> 02:48:57,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2306
02:48:57,944 --> 02:49:07,906
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys didn't get through, please, you can always feel free to leave us a message at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or of course the Twitter and of course the Facebook and all those social networks we interact with.

2307
02:49:08,006 --> 02:49:09,567
[SPEAKER_08]: We have eyes and ears everywhere.

2308
02:49:09,887 --> 02:49:12,487
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, it's about time to wrap up the show.

2309
02:49:12,527 --> 02:49:15,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2310
02:49:16,288 --> 02:49:17,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll start tonight.

2311
02:49:17,208 --> 02:49:23,230
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I need Advil or something that will make my back feel better because it sucks.

2312
02:49:24,150 --> 02:49:25,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some.

2313
02:49:26,118 --> 02:49:28,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I might take you up on that or just do it when I get home.

2314
02:49:28,941 --> 02:49:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like killing me.

2315
02:49:31,263 --> 02:49:34,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I'd be going to a doctor tomorrow, but it's just annoying.

2316
02:49:34,505 --> 02:49:35,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It's annoying.

2317
02:49:35,927 --> 02:49:36,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

2318
02:49:37,228 --> 02:49:43,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought is this Doom with Mega Man looks kind of interesting.

2319
02:49:43,413 --> 02:49:43,733
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2320
02:49:44,394 --> 02:49:45,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Doom mod.

2321
02:49:45,695 --> 02:49:46,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Mega Doom?

2322
02:49:46,976 --> 02:49:47,677
[SPEAKER_02]: With Mega Man.

2323
02:49:47,877 --> 02:49:50,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all the 8-bit sprites and everything.

2324
02:49:50,459 --> 02:49:52,040
[SPEAKER_08]: That is fantastic.

2325
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:52,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of amazing, actually.

2326
02:49:52,841 --> 02:49:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so downloading that.

2327
02:49:54,557 --> 02:49:55,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that out?

2328
02:49:55,418 --> 02:49:56,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Released publicly?

2329
02:49:57,219 --> 02:50:00,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Deathmatch mod.

2330
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:01,581
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

2331
02:50:02,022 --> 02:50:04,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's out yet to download.

2332
02:50:04,783 --> 02:50:16,610
[SPEAKER_02]: The official website looks like cutstuff.net slash blog slash question mark P equals 1677.

2333
02:50:17,011 --> 02:50:21,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pull it up for you and you can check it out.

2334
02:50:21,874 --> 02:50:21,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

2335
02:50:28,648 --> 02:50:31,329
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2336
02:50:32,069 --> 02:50:32,569
[SPEAKER_08]: End of line.

2337
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:40,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought tonight would be... Oh no, I already said my final thought.

2338
02:50:40,392 --> 02:50:41,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wait, I already said something.

2339
02:50:42,652 --> 02:50:43,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I was last for a reason.

2340
02:50:43,553 --> 02:50:44,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly it's old age.

2341
02:50:44,718 --> 02:50:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want the direct download, because that URL is kind of hard to find, it'd be cutstuff.net slash file slash megadmalpha.zip and that'll get you the zip file for that.

2342
02:50:58,937 --> 02:51:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, I used to play Gatchaman Doom.

2343
02:51:02,543 --> 02:51:04,746
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2344
02:51:16,714 --> 02:51:23,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also need to say, as I do every week, thank you guys very much for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.

2345
02:51:23,135 --> 02:51:24,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Without you guys, this would not be possible.

2346
02:51:25,236 --> 02:51:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, we don't have any fancy website, multi-million dollar magazine or game company backing us up.

2347
02:51:30,317 --> 02:51:34,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just three of us do this because we love you and we love doing this broadcasting thing.

2348
02:51:34,477 --> 02:51:36,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.

2349
02:51:37,058 --> 02:51:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And get us pizza.

2350
02:51:38,498 --> 02:51:39,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And pizza would be nice too.

2351
02:51:39,978 --> 02:51:41,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Order us pizza for next show.

2352
02:51:41,719 --> 02:51:42,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

2353
02:51:42,939 --> 02:51:44,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I like vegetarian, just letting you know.

2354
02:51:46,101 --> 02:51:47,041
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see if that happens.

2355
02:51:47,081 --> 02:51:49,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we'll be here to do it all again next week.

2356
02:51:50,323 --> 02:51:53,444
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki.

2357
02:51:53,805 --> 02:51:56,506
[SPEAKER_08]: We're out, but Jamie has to say...

2358
02:51:57,605 --> 02:51:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: End of line.

2359
02:52:27,078 --> 02:52:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week!
