Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight November 29th, 2009

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Will Amber Alert type messages soon be displayed on your Xbox?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Familiar faces return for Super Street Fighter 4

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Can we talk about the continued growth of LittleBigPlanet a whole year after its release?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Rob Roberts with you here every week on All Games Radio

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
www.allgames.com where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Rawr

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you doing?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Rawr

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I see you LJing

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I am LJing, I was doing it well before the show

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
It's so nice to see that people actually still use LJ

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I have a permanent account, damn well better use it

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
For the uninitiated LJ is short for LiveJournal

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
where we actually have an Orange Lounge community

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
but sadly it's been neglected just like LiveJournal has in general

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
thanks to Twitter and Facebook and I guess MySpace in a way

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
but do people actually use MySpace anymore?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I actually logged into MySpace the other day

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
and this is my exact thing I said aloud

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
What a crap!

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Because MySpace is really ugly

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't use MySpace anymore

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
If you're still on there, we have an account on there

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I check maybe once a month and if you want to have this as a friend

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
you can join the many record labels and indie bands

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
who think we're like an actual radio station

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
like we want to play their rap music as part of our show

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Maybe we should one night just to see what happens

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Don't you think so Tech Master Loki?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Also joining us every week here on the program

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
No

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
No, it would not be fun?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
No, it would not be fun

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Hey, also our chat room is always here

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
if you'd like to join it and say hello to us

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
and of course we always like to interact with our chat room

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
who right now is razzing me for a technical difficulty

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
we had before tonight's show started

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
but those of you on the podcast, it'll all be fixed by the time you hear it

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So yeah, if you want to hear all the good technical difficulties

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
not that we usually edit a lot of things

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
but most of this is very uncensored radio

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
we don't really filter anything out

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
but huge technical fuck-ups do get filtered out

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
so that's one thing you can look forward to

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
and our podcast feed is also available on iTunes

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
just check that out, searching for Orange Launch Radio

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
or more information on www.orangeloungeradio.com

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
for those of you that hate all things Apple

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I know there are a few of you out there

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
you can check us out and several other podcast catchers

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
and Loki's raising his hand right there

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So I'm sorry, should I call it a blogcast?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Isn't that what Major Nelson was calling it for the longest time?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
because Microsoft doesn't want to use that word podcast

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
or a Zooncast or whatever

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
They tried, but podcast just stuck

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Do you hate the word podcast, Loki?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
No

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Certainly one thing we don't hate here is video games

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
in fact we play a lot of them

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
and every week we like to tell you about what we've been playing

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I've... whoa

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I played World of Warcraft today

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and Sims yesterday

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and I downloaded another game

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
that I'm going to try out

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
that I've heard lots of good things about

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and I have to pull it up on

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
actually I have to pull up iTunes so that I can find it

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
but it's a little shooting game

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
like a

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
like a Gradius type of shooter

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
and

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I just downloaded it

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I'll find it

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I honestly didn't play a lot

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
which is sad

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
because we had four days off

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
no, I decided to go ahead

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and I played a little bit

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I brought out the Wii

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
when I went over to my sister's house

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and we played a little bit of Excitebots

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
then also

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
of course more Grand Theft Auto this week

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
and

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
but mainly I've been busy

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
doing other things

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
and that would be for some reason

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and I don't know why

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
during the day

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
on Tuesday this week

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
um

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I just said, hey, you know what

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm going to turn a PSP into a MAME cabinet

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
and so that's

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
what I've been doing

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I've been taking a PSP

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
that I don't use anymore

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
You get the most random ass little like inspirations

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
like, my favorite will always be

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
when you walked in here

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
episode 300 last year

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
and you walked in here in your Sackboy costume

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
like, hey guys, I made a Sackboy costume

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
like, WHY?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It's funny

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Well, it's just like

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
um, and it's weird

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
because I had specific requirements I wanted to do

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
it had to be everything

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
that I had in the house already

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
like just random crap

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
so it's basically, you know, it's going to be

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
small, like a bar top

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
but it'll be out of spare parts

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I had and cardboard boxes

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
and that's what I've done

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I've started it, I've been soldering

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
all year

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Are we actually going to make a cabinet out of cardboard boxes?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Yes! I'm serious

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
No, small

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
like something I've seen on a counter top

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
but no, seriously, it's actually really cool

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
the problem is though, it's really hard to solder

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
to a PSP board

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
because I had to use magnet wire

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
because it's so thin

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I actually burned my finger on the soldering iron

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
which kind of sucks

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
but um, yeah

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I mean, assuming that my soldering

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
is an absolute crap, which it is

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
but, you know, it looked

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
pretty good

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
then it will actually be done soon

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
because I actually finished soldering today

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
and um

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
what I'm actually going to be running on it

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
is not MAME because they do have

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
MAME for it

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
but the way I soldered

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
everything, I can't really solder

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
the directional buttons because

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
it's really hard to do that

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
so I instead soldered the

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
analog because it's really easy

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
and you can actually use the analog stick

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
in some of the games, so I can't select

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
between which emulator I run

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I just have to have it auto-boot into that emulator

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
so the one I found that runs pretty well

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
is actually the CPS2 emulator

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
so I can play some Puzzle Fighter on there

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
and Street Fighter and stuff like that

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
but um, yeah, it's

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
coming along, and um

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
hopefully it'll be done this week

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Now there's some haters in our chat room

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
at chat.orangelandradiot.com

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
PSP MAME sucks, sorry

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes, PSP MAME does kinda suck

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
PSP CPS2

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
not that bad, actually, it runs pretty well

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and um

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
it's just

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
you know, this PSP, I haven't used it in like

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
years, okay

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Amae Satsuma in our chat room, chat.orangelandradiot.com

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
says, Loki's real name isn't Matt, it's Richard Dean Anderson

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
making a MacGyver reference there

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
which is somewhat true

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
and which Act F says, LokiGyver

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't know if that has the same ring to it

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
but Chris Hanogram asks a question though

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
what version of the PSP is it?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Is it a 1000, 2000, 3000?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's my old 1000 because I bought a 2000

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I thought about breaking the 2000 because

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
the emulators run better on there, but

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I can't do that

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
You know when you talk about like a cute little tabletop

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
thing made out of a PSP

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
device, I think back to

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
and I don't know if you guys remember this growing up

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but they used to have tiny, tiny

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
little tabletop games, and they would be

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
versions of like Ms. Pac-Man

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
or Donkey Kong

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
and these old school 80's games

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
they weren't the actual game

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
but they were kind of like a step above

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Game and Watch, where the lights would actually

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
be in color, but they actually put them in

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
a cabinet looking thing, and I think

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
these things were pretty expensive

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
they were probably

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
50, 60 dollars, which back in 1980

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
was a lot of money

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, they were like 30 bucks now

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I have pictures

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh, you have pictures

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You should upload some of these to our picture feed

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It doesn't really show much of anything

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, right now other than there's a spider of wires

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
but here's what I finished before I left

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
real quick, you can see

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I know, I know, but you can see where

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
it's going to be the actual

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
control panel

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm looking at a picture of Loki's

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
cable modem, of which

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
it almost looks like the wired

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
six buttons into the cable modem

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
The cable modem box

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's just the box

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Okay, are you going to paint over the box

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
No, it's going to be a box

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's going to be the most ghetto looking thing in the world

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Exactly, that's the point

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And you know what?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You need to send this to our picture blog

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And you know what? Because I didn't

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I told you, it's everything I had in the house

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I don't have packaging tape to put this together

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So I'm using duct tape

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
There's going to be duct tape all over

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You need to use chicken wire too

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't have any chicken wire, so it's just

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You are making a PSP

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
MAME cabinet out of a PSP

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Cardboard boxes and duct tape

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And arcade spare parts

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I have laying in my house

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Wow, amazing

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Hitstun's come around a little bit and says

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
this might be cool

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
See, now when you finish it

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It's mini, you're going to have to bring it in here

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh yeah, it's going to have a handle on it

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
This is assuming

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
that this all works after it's done

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Like I said

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I don't trust my soldering

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
This saved my life

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't know how I managed to solder that mod chip

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
into my Wii

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That was just some miracle that I worked there

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
And this is kind of the same type of thing

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Those magnet wires are

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
really fragile and they'll break

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
out of there pretty quick

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
So hopefully I didn't cross anything

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
or bridge anything

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Hopefully it works once I power it back up again

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
But if it does, then it should be good to go

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Bochikawa in our chatroom says

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Hey, guess what I got Loki for Christmas?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
A box!

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, at least it wasn't your you-know-what-in-a-box

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
like Justin Timberlake

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Let's see, Pywish, big fan of duct tape

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
as a lot of our chatrooms are

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
duct tape fixes everything

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I can't wait to see

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's like the force

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
This thing is going to be awesomely bad

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I can't wait to see it

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Please, please post that picture to our picture blog

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
For your Twitter at least

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Do you know how to log into the ULR Twitter?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I'll give you that info off here

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Because obviously I'm not going to give you the password on here

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It's...

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Fire

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Alright

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
DarkSakura, did you find that Gradius game

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
type game you were talking about earlier?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I did, it's called AX Raven Elite

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And I'm going to post a link to it in the chatroom

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You can go to rocketeergames.com

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
and give it a try

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's actually made by a local

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh wow, very cool

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Step one

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Put the PSP in a box

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You should

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Do like a parody video

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Building your PSP MAME cabinet

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Like called PSP in a box or something

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
There's something here

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I originally, like when I originally was going to do

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
actually running MAME on there

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I actually made a skin for the background

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
that looked like MAME but built out of cardboard

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
So that was kind of funny

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
But now this CPS2 emulator

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
doesn't really have that

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Nobody else would do a Neo Geo emulator

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Haven't decided yet

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It really depends on which buttons that I've wired

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
work and which don't

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Because that's really what it's going to come down to

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Because if I'm missing any of the buttons

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
that I needed to work, it's just

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
trash

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
The whole thing is ruined

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
In which case, I do believe you should just set fire to it

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Live on air

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Alright, we'll make a little bonfire somewhere

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I'll make it work

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Maybe in DarkSakura's backyard, we'll move all the equipment

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and burn the cabinet live on air

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Doesn't that sound like fun?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I would rather take a crowbar to it like an office space

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
with some loud gangster rap

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Maybe if it was a PSP Go inside

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
but PSP 1000 is still kind of valuable

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Well I guess you bricked it

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Not really, no it's not bricked

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean it's just

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It could be fixed

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I just don't care because I have another

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
PSP already and I wasn't using this

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I mean the battery was dead

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So yes to fire?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm not going to burn it

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes to crowbar?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
No

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
It'll work

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Moving on so we can get to gaming news before midnight

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Moving on to my gaming week

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
but I will say that

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I've been very enticed by Steam's

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
various deals that they've had this week

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You might have seen it, I know Dekeman's been posting them

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
to our Twitter everyday

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The Steam deals, and they're all over the game blogs

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
There's some really cool deals there on Steam

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And one of them that I jumped on was Dragon Age Origins

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
was on sale for 25% off

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
So I think I paid like $37 for it

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Considering it's like $59.99

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
on $360 or whatever

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Getting that price on the PC wasn't that bad

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So I kind of got into the game

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and started playing it

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
But I couldn't really get

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
very far into it before I got highly

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
irritated because

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
my video card apparently

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
kind of sucks and is behind the time

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
and cannot run the game very well

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
even on it's lowest settings

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Things I should have thought about before I plopped the money down for the game

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Although maybe it's just a sign I need a new video card

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I thought since I just bought my

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
computer new last year

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
that my video card would not suck that bad

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
but it was one of those, you know

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
gateway, everything's there

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Gateway, yeah

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
But I thought when I bought it

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
there was something about the video card, it was supposed to be better than normal

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
but whatever

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So sadly I can't give you a fair review

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
of Mage Origins just yet

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
That wouldn't be a very fair thing of me to review it

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I will say this though

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I was quickly immersed into the game

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I did think they did a very good job

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Bioware is kind of well known for this

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Very good job of story telling

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You know, the cut scenes that I did see

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
and the part of the game that I did play through

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
For anybody who's played the game

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I rolled a mage

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and I played through the first little test

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
that you have to do with the demon in the very beginning

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
You know, which obviously wasn't very long at all

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
which is why I don't want to give you a review

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But I did feel very immersed in the game

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and I thought the storytelling was done very well

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And I did like the fact

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
you know, just like in Mass Effect

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
that you can kind of direct the conversations and so forth

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Again, something that Bioware has done

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
very well for

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
They do very well

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I was immersed in it

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
But I'll give you a longer review after I get a better video card

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
which is probably going to happen in the future

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And the folks in chat

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Tiger Claw say

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Well, we know what to get Skye for Christmas

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
A brand new graphics card

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I might just go buy that myself

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
You know, one thing about

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I realize everybody's shopping, shopping, shopping

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
You gotta get all your shopping done before Christmas

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
But I noticed that all the sales I have gone

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
and spent money on have been on me

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And it's all been clothes

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I went to Macy's yesterday

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I bought

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
something that was half off

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And I went to the outlets today and I bought clothes

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
because they were all cheap

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Go to Old Navy

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
for their whole 3 AM rock band thing

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Did you do any Black Friday at all, Loki?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I went to Radio Shack

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
That's because I couldn't find a screwdriver

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
So I went and bought another screwdriver

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, I wouldn't think Radio Shack

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
was doing a huge Black Friday discount

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
No, there was no one in there

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I had a feeling

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Anyhow, so I went out

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
and bought a bunch of clothes

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
But I noticed with all these deals

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I keep thinking maybe it's just selfish or whatever

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
But I'm also the type of person

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I always do my Christmas shopping like on Christmas Eve

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm just a huge procrastinator like that

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And I never know what to buy, like tons of people

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Let's see

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Looking in the chat room

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and seeing the comments there

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
RickyGoMac says, Get a Mac, Rob!

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Gee, wonder why he might be suggesting a Mac

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
RickyGoMac

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I don't know

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I would love to get a Mac, but they're a little pricey

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
They're kind of the Mercedes Benz

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
of computers, you know what I mean?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I don't hate on Macs

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I have an iPhone, that's great for Apple

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But my one Mac laptop I did have

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Unfortunately, it didn't last

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And I was a little bit disappointed in that

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
So I don't know how I feel about the desktop

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Tigerclaw says, Also, be sure your graphics card is an NVIDIA card

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Oops

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
My one I have right now is an ATI Radeon

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It doesn't matter

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
It doesn't matter at all

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this incorrectly

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Vanislucks in chat says,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Screw Macy's, they made my children cry

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
See, now I kind of want to know that story

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I know that might be traumatic, but I kind of want to know

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Was it Santa Claus that made your children cry?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Or did they not want to take something back?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I gotta

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
say my curiosity is piqued by that statement there

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Alright, anyhow

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
We are going to move on and get into the show tonight

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Joining us tonight in about

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
20 minutes or so

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
We're going to be speaking to an individual whose name is Brian Moreno

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And you might not know him by name, but you might know

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
a video that he did that's on YouTube

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
this week

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
A LittleBigPlanet version

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
video, which you know, Lady Gaga

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
she's kind of started

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
a lot of controversy with some of her videos

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and so forth, but obviously

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
that's what artists do, they make controversy

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But we don't want to talk to him

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
so much about that end of it, but just

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
the fact that he put all this time

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
in LittleBigPlanet into this creation

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and with LittleBigPlanet

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and the community still being really huge

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
a year after the game was released

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
we thought tonight would be a good time to talk about that

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So he'll be joining us a little later on

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
For now though, we're going to get into some gaming news

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I did want to just give a quick plug

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
to our brand new Facebook, we just launched it

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
like a week and a half ago

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
www.facebook.com

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
slash orange lounge radio, all one word

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Thank you guys so much for helping us get the 100 fans

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
we needed to get the short URL within a week

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It's only been a week and we have like 160 fans

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
So thank you guys very much

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That's very humbling and very cool

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I don't know if there's really anything after 100

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I think maybe if you get to a thousand

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
you get more statistics stuff

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You don't get to evolve anymore?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't know, I don't know if there's any more evolving

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I haven't really looked into it

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I'll have to ask Seg, my buddy Seg that was on the show a couple weeks ago

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
promoting UmLoud, which is coming up by the way

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
He knows more about that stuff than I do

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I wouldn't have even known about the short URL

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
if I didn't see him talk about it earlier

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Loki, why don't you start us off

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Well, Datel is kind of pissed

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because you may remember

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Microsoft blocked their

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
memory cards, their max memory

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
from working

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
with the last dashboard update

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
and of course

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
dashboard update came

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and the max memory cards went

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
and unfortunately

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
they had a workaround

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
they said at one time, but

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't think that

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
ended up working

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Microsoft has taken steps to render

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
inoperable the

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
competing Datel memory card

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
for no visible purpose

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
other than to have the market

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
entirely to themselves

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and this is the Datel

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
attorney Marty Glick

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
no relation to

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
the other Glick

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
lol

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
They've accomplished

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
their recent update by making

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
a system change that will not recognize

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
or allow the operation of a memory card

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
with greater capacity than their own

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
we believe that with the power

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Microsoft enjoys in the market

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
for Xbox accessories

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
this conduct is unlawful

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
so they're kind of going with the whole monopoly thing

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't really know

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
if they have grounds to stand there

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
since it is Microsoft's

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
hardware and I think that they

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
pretty much can say

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
who can make what for it

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
although I do agree I wish they did

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
have some other memory card options

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
because the Microsoft memory cards

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and Microsoft hard drives

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
are way too fucking overpriced

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
we're talking like 120 gigabyte

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
hard drive for

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
$200 or $150

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I mean shit you can get way bigger

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
drives for a lot cheaper

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I got to admit this is tricky for me

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and chat I'm really curious what you guys think about

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
this one because I'm really on the fence with this

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
because I understand

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
the whole Microsoft is

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
evil and they always have monopolies on

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
everything and they violated antitrust

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
before and all of this

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I totally understand that side of the argument

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
and yeah they do charge way too much

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
considering that 120 gig hard drive

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
is dirt cheap

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
or even like a 512 megabyte

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
memory unit

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
for 50 bucks I mean when you can buy

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
4 gig thumb drives

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
for like $10

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
here's the part of it though

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
where I'm kind of with Microsoft

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and that is that these

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
companies take huge losses

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
when they put out these consoles

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
when you buy a console from

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Microsoft Sony

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
not Nintendo this time because

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
we know the Wii was not quite

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
the same technological level but in the past

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
they've taken a loss on their systems too

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
maybe it was a small loss this time I don't have the data

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
on that I don't think it was though

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
but you know Microsoft and Sony take a loss

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
on every console that they sell to you

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
they've got to make that money back other places

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
and that is usually through software

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
through licensed

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
products through the licenses and so forth

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
that's how they make their money back

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
so I can

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
sort of see where they have the right

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
to lock out the unauthorized products because

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
my fear is

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
let's say Datel wins this suit

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and it

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
just opens the floodgates to all these unauthorized

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
devices that are going to be out there

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
the next round of consoles are going to cost through the roof

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
because companies are not going to want to take a loss on it

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
No I don't think that's going to happen

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I mean they had a ton of unlicensed

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
products for the Playstation 2 and the Playstation 1

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and you know how older

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
consoles and stuff

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
never really affected their system

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and Sony also tried to charge out the ass for the PS3 when it first came out

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and they were still claiming a loss

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
but we all lapped them off because we said

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
too damn much money yeah right

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
yeah but that's for other reasons entirely

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
except the hardcore fans of course

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
that's because hey let's throw in this really awesome

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
cutting edge cell processor hey let's throw in some blu-ray

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
technology hey let's throw in some other

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
crap that's why it's so expensive

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
and you know to their benefit

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
they also have allowed you know

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
their end user to upgrade the hard drive

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
because it's just a

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
normal hard drive but Microsoft

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
says fuck you guys we're just going to

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
put that normal hard drive inside of a case and then

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
charge you twice as much for it

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
that's all it really is it's just a fancy

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
little case storing a normal hard drive

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
so it's not like

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
it's a special technology

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
although it is encoded slightly different but

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
you know hell you can make your own hard drives

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
for the Xbox 360 I mean

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
there are programs out there to do that

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
if you really wanted to make your own

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
250 gigabyte hard drive you can do

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
that what about the fact though that a lot

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
of people well I shouldn't say a lot but there was

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
certainly a significant amount of people that were using these devices

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
for the cheat functionalities that you know

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
the SD cards importing the saves

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
inflating gamer scores cheating

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
and you know Microsoft is trying to protect

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Xbox Live because you know they market it

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
as hey you're paying $50 a year

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
because we lock out this kind of

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
shit well you

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
can't really lock it out

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
permanently I mean they have all

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
those game saves and everything are now

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I mean because originally they weren't

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
all signed to the profile so

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
yeah you could download game saves and

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
you know throw them onto your console and kind of

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
you know save it at a point right before an

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
achievement or something like that and boost your

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
achievement scores but now everything's signed

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
to your user

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
ID so unless you're

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
the actual user that made that save

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
you can't really use that save unless

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
you re-sign it on your computer

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
which you can do that and you don't really

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
need this memory card to do that so

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
it's really not an excuse it's just them

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
being dicks let me ask this follow up

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
question very plainly because Salacious Pop

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
asks this in chat and I kind of

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
want to know this too because

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I kind of agree with his thought here he says

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
can't you put save games on like a thumb drive

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
it reads USB fine I

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
think I'm missing something no you can't

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
oh really I always assumed

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
you could because you can do like mp3s and

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
videos and all that if you can put it on a thumb drive

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
then it wouldn't fucking matter that they have their stupid little

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
memory cards but you can't because

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
you know obviously that'd be the easiest

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
route you wouldn't even buy this yeah yeah I guess

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
so I mean it makes sense now that you're saying it but

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I just kind of always thought but then again

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I've never tried to use it you know I'm not the type that

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
wants to cheat in games and all this and

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and so forth you know

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I never really thought to use this

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
yeah I never even owned a game genie

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
back in the day although I thought they were interesting

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
they were awesome yeah it's too bad we don't have

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
anything like that anymore you know what I mean everything got

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
too not anymore I mean it's all game

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
saves now remember

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I always wondered how they found those

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
codes for game genie like did somebody

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
have to sit there and actually go

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
0 0 0 0 1 or

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
was it because of the fact it was hex decimal base

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
they could go into the programming and figure

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
it out did you ever like use they had cheat

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
programs similar to that on the PC

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
for cheating and stuff and basically it's

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
memory searches you okay

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I have five

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
lives right now do a memory search for five

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
okay I die once do a memory search for

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
four I die again do a memory

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
search for three and what it does is it narrows

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
down those memory addresses until you get

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
the one that actually controls

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
you know the extra lives and boom there you go

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
and now you can change that value you freeze

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
the memory to 99 you have

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
infinite lives now and it's basically

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
that interesting okay that

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
makes sense uh salaciouspop follows up with

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
in chat okay I've run avi's off of thunder

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
drive before but never bothered with saves

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I figured it was universal yeah I mean I

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
thought the same thing honestly I've just never thought

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
to try I just always assumed it would work yep

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
curiosity I don't even know if you know this

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
would a ps3 let you do it ps3

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
yes will let you put game saves on

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
a thumb drive interesting because they don't

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
sell memory cards it's it's all

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
open oh that's right it's all

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
you know thumb drives you know you can use whatever

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
you want but Sony fanboys if you haven't

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
thought to add that to your arsenal of

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
web forum

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
harassing there's something for you

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
their memory cards are just USB

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
drives basically I mean it's

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
just sign different and

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
they're shaped different they've got you know

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
but it's basically a UMD drive

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
or not UMD uh USB drive

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
uh sj100 matt in chat

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
asks uh or says basically I was really

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
hoping they were gonna drop the price of the HD's

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
this holiday season yeah kind of surprising they

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
didn't they're doing weird stuff

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I don't know because they're now

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
trying to clear out those 20 gig hard drives that

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
they have a backlog of too so you're gonna see

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
remember how they have like the 60

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
gigabyte starter pack where it's like a three month

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
card and

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
you know some miscellaneous crap in there and then

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
the hard drive they're gonna be doing

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
the same thing with the 20 gig hard drive now too

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
so uh tiger klon chat

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
says uh do you mean a trainer

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
when you were talking about that memory scan

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
software for pc games you used a program

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
called a trainer you load the pc game first

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
then load the trainer program and it will

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
modify what's in the memory so you can run some cheats

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
from tiger klon uh no not trainer

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
but this is like predating all the trainers

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
and stuff this is you know because the trainer

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
usually is all it's all the hard works

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
done for you it's basically okay

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
hit button one to have

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
infinite ammo or something like that and those are nice

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
but I'm talking about something it was

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
actually just a program I mean this is back

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
you know floppies and shareware

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
days you know um

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
it was just a program that you'd run that basically

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
would work with any um

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
pc titles because it's just a memory search

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
function and uh

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
you can you know

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
do searches and stuff

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
on different values and I think like

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
the registered version of it or whatever had

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
ability to figure something

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
out with like life bars because life bars

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
are hard to determine since you don't know what

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
the actual number is it's just like kind of a percentage

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
so um

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't know I mean this was like years ago

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
but yeah obviously now they have

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
trainers for everything

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
that come out so very interesting

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
quickly to kind of wrap this up and move on with

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
the show and Jaime, I don't know if you have a thought on

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
this either

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
how do you think this lawsuit is going to go?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
do you think Deigon frame of view is going to be shit of luck

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
or do you think maybe they have something

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
with this whole monopoly

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
thing... No they are going to be shit of luck

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
they're going to be like

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
it's going to be well

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
you can make you know peripherals for us

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
but you just have to pay a licensing fee and we have to

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
approve it I don't know I don't think they're

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
going to win. Jaime agree

28:01.000 --> 28:10.120
agree? I think it could go either way. To be honest, it's not like we haven't had other

28:10.120 --> 28:15.720
peripherals be locked out before on certain systems. Like for example, I know that I couldn't

28:15.720 --> 28:20.520
use certain third party controllers for certain games back in the day. I kind of look at it

28:20.520 --> 28:29.360
as being along the same lines. However, it would really have to be a situation of, I

28:29.360 --> 28:35.720
think it would have to be a situation of Microsoft it being on them to have some sort of check

28:35.720 --> 28:41.960
in line for cheats instead of just locking out the storage device altogether. So really,

28:41.960 --> 28:48.160
I could see a few things in Datel's direction. I've got to say, for me, either way, this

28:48.160 --> 28:52.920
story sucks. Because if Datel wins, then I truly believe that's going to drive the price

28:52.920 --> 28:57.660
of the consoles up and they're going to use that as justification. And if they lose, then

28:57.660 --> 29:02.080
all those people who spent money on that device lose. Ultimately, the consumer loses. Let

29:02.080 --> 29:07.660
the buyer beware. Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news here. I want to talk

29:07.660 --> 29:11.640
about some news out of Capcom's camp. Two very different stories that have one thing

29:11.640 --> 29:17.160
in common. Apparently, Capcom is working on ports of Final Fight and Magic Sword for Xbox

29:17.160 --> 29:22.440
Live Arcade and PSN. Now, you might remember Final Fight. That was kind of like the side

29:22.440 --> 29:26.320
scroller beat them up, double dragon-esque type of game. Very famous because when it

29:26.320 --> 29:30.800
came out on Super Nintendo, it didn't have Guy. And a lot of people freaked out and that

29:30.800 --> 29:36.040
caused them years later to release Final Fight Guy. Which I have. Oh, do you really? Final

29:36.040 --> 29:40.860
Fight Guy was a Blockbuster exclusive. Oh, that's right. You could only get it by renting

29:40.860 --> 29:44.280
it at Blockbuster. That's right, I remember that. And it came out, I think, a couple years

29:44.280 --> 29:51.240
later. Or no, maybe actually a year later. But when it came out in Japanese packaging

29:51.240 --> 29:57.380
too. Remember. I have it box book everything. Now what's weird about this is that actually

29:57.380 --> 30:01.440
these two games apparently are going to come out together. Final Fight Double Impact is

30:01.440 --> 30:05.480
what it's called because it's not just Final Fight, but Magic Sword comes with it as well.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.980
I'm imagining the games must have run on the same arcade hardware, but I can't think of

30:08.980 --> 30:13.000
like more different types of games. But I got to say, I know a lot of you may not have

30:13.000 --> 30:16.540
heard of Magic Sword. This is one of my all-time favorite arcade games. We actually have this

30:16.540 --> 30:20.360
at the Pizzeria near us. I loved Magic Sword. And they actually had a version of it on Super

30:20.360 --> 30:23.720
Nintendo that was pretty badass. And it's one of the games that's going to be featured

30:23.720 --> 30:28.720
on my box cabinet. Because it's a Capcom system, of course. And it's a PS2, yeah. Of course.

30:28.720 --> 30:33.360
But for those of you that don't have the skill to build a cabinet out of boxes and duct tape.

30:33.360 --> 30:39.960
You can also put it on any homebrew enabled PSP too, so they work pretty well. I read

30:39.960 --> 30:44.480
you some more comments from chat. Apparently a lot of love for Magic Sword in the chat.

30:44.480 --> 30:50.760
Rama's like, Magic Sword. VanisLux, I love Magic Sword. But weird pairing. And let's

30:50.760 --> 30:55.840
see, SalaciousPop, my BFF and I spent like $25 on Magic Sword when we were 14. And after

30:55.840 --> 30:59.960
the final boss, he accepted the orb instead of destroying it and became the new Dark Lord.

30:59.960 --> 31:06.760
That's right. It was also one of those games that had like multiple endings. OMG spoilers.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.440
I'm more excited about Magic Sword than I am Final Fight. Although I did love that game

31:10.440 --> 31:14.840
too, I gotta say. But I will say this about Final Fight, is that apparently some of the

31:14.840 --> 31:19.840
fighters in very familiar faces are making their way into Super Street Fighter 4. And

31:19.840 --> 31:24.640
I have to admit, from what I do remember and love about Final Fight, I think this is awesome.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.400
Cody and Guy are making their way to Super Street Fighter 4, according to the latest

31:28.400 --> 31:33.800
issue of Famitsu Magazine. Also making an appearance, Dawn from Street Fighter Alpha.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.480
So those were three new characters that were announced this week. I believe Cody's been

31:37.480 --> 31:41.760
in a game before, because he was in Alpha 3. Yeah, Alpha 3. Also, he's going to be one

31:41.760 --> 31:49.400
of the characters coming up in Street Fighter 4. Right, right. That's very cool, I think.

31:49.400 --> 31:54.000
Well, I thought you were just talking about Final Fight. No, no. And this whole new crossover

31:54.000 --> 31:58.760
is kind of interesting. I kind of miss the whole Alpha series of Street Fighter. That

31:58.760 --> 32:02.080
all happened during that period of my life where I wasn't as into video games. So I never

32:02.080 --> 32:05.400
really played those games. I never realized that they had the crossover. Although I do

32:05.400 --> 32:11.880
remember Hagar, the mayor, in Saturday Night Slam Masters, which was also a completely

32:11.880 --> 32:18.320
underrated Capcom classic. We had that at my arcade that I worked at. That was the ultimate

32:18.320 --> 32:27.560
pizzeria arcade game. I loved that game. Also on there. Shut up. Let's see, Rama asked in

32:27.560 --> 32:32.280
chat real quick, before we get to another story here, anyone remember Mighty Final Fight?

32:32.280 --> 32:36.200
I do. Wasn't that the version that was on the NES as opposed to the Super Nintendo?

32:36.200 --> 32:39.800
Yeah, it wasn't like all kind of super deformed. It was all the chibi characters. What was

32:39.800 --> 32:44.400
an 8-bit port, you know? Yeah, I remember that game. Obviously it wasn't as great because

32:44.400 --> 32:48.280
it was an 8-bit port. But Dark Sakura, why don't you do one more story for us, then we're

32:48.280 --> 32:53.880
going to get to our interview tonight. That's right, we do have it coming up. But how about

32:53.880 --> 33:02.840
some PC news? Please. Okay. Well, Valve is basically sticking their tongue out and waggling

33:02.840 --> 33:09.480
it at all the people that are boycotting Steamworks. Which I'm actually laughing. They're saying

33:09.480 --> 33:17.800
basically that any digital distributors who are boycotting PC games because they come

33:17.800 --> 33:29.120
with Steamworks services are missing out on an opportunity. They're actually saying that...

33:29.120 --> 33:35.160
Let's see, different companies like Direct to Drive, Impulse and Gamersgate that didn't

33:35.160 --> 33:41.800
want to sell Modern Warfare 2 because it had the Steamworks tools acting as a storefront

33:41.800 --> 33:47.040
for Steam. But they're saying that if you make a good game it should be out through

33:47.040 --> 33:53.360
as many channels as possible. It is kind of interesting though that so many people are

33:53.360 --> 33:58.280
up in arms about it, but I also kind of get it. When you get all this included software

33:58.280 --> 34:04.760
you don't ask for, that can get really annoying. For instance, when I download programs off

34:04.760 --> 34:09.960
the internet like Google Earth, maybe I'll download Google Earth, they try to install

34:09.960 --> 34:16.060
that Google toolbar on my system. That's not what I ask for. Whenever you download iTunes,

34:16.060 --> 34:20.200
it tries to install Safari on your system. I didn't ask for fucking Safari, I wanted

34:20.200 --> 34:24.440
iTunes. I do find that kind of shit annoying. I realize maybe it's a little different because

34:24.440 --> 34:30.440
Steamworks directly does relate to the games, but I can kind of see their point. When you

34:30.440 --> 34:40.640
get these things you didn't ask for that even eat up 1K of memory, it's a bit of an annoyance.

34:40.640 --> 34:47.480
What the word is, is that they've actually based the inclusion of it on what customers

34:47.480 --> 34:53.160
have asked for, and that they've actually sold the games as well through Steam as they

34:53.160 --> 34:57.480
have in the stores, especially Modern Warfare 2.

34:57.480 --> 35:04.760
Reddertainment in our chatroom at chat.orangeleiser.com says, I call for a boycott of the boycott.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.300
Perhaps that's something that needs to start, I don't know.

35:07.300 --> 35:11.920
You know what, I say if people don't want it, don't get it. If people want it, get it.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.940
Who cares, you can uninstall the shit.

35:14.940 --> 35:19.520
VaniceLux in our chat says, those distributors that didn't carry Modern Warfare 2 cut themselves

35:19.520 --> 35:22.480
out of a crap load of money, and that's about all the effect it had.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.480
Pretty much.

35:23.480 --> 35:28.240
Goldanthro wants to point out not only Safari, but also QuickTime. I give him a buy on that

35:28.240 --> 35:33.160
because the movies that play in iTunes when you download movies and TV shows, which is

35:33.160 --> 35:36.360
an integral part of the system, are in a QuickTime proprietary format.

35:36.360 --> 35:41.080
I, however, refuse to install Safari. Safari is ass on a PC.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.480
Yeah, it's just not as good on a PC as it is on a Mac. Great on a Mac, not on a PC.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.920
Well, you know what part of the problem is, is that it actually tries to, instead of actually

35:48.920 --> 35:54.400
installing a font and having it default to that, you know, like Firefox does all that,

35:54.400 --> 36:00.160
it actually tries to emulate so that you're, it does a weird thing, but it eats a lot of

36:00.160 --> 36:02.600
memory and it's really hard to use.

36:02.600 --> 36:06.760
It's very interesting, though, that these, it's always these browsers, these browsers

36:06.760 --> 36:10.240
now that try to install, because it's that and Google Chrome, too, keeps trying to install

36:10.240 --> 36:11.240
it.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.240
I hate Chrome.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.240
I'm not a fan of it either.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.240
I hate Chrome.

36:14.240 --> 36:19.200
I'm all about Firefox. People, I'm glad there's choices now, you know, whereas it's not Internet

36:19.200 --> 36:22.160
Explorer seeing me to dominate as much as they used to. I mean, I know they still are

36:22.160 --> 36:24.840
the number one, but not nearly the hold they used to have.

36:24.840 --> 36:31.600
Firefox is, it actually is a lot more secure now in general than Internet Explorer is and

36:31.600 --> 36:33.000
has a lot more functionality.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.720
A lot of places are really starting to embrace it over, you know, Internet Explorer.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.760
I mean, you saw what happened to Netscape.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.760
Netscape's gone.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.760
Yeah, it's true.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.680
But that kind of turned into Firefox, didn't it?

36:46.680 --> 36:52.040
I think the Mozilla thing kind of, you know, kind of like a copy of a copy of a copy type

36:52.040 --> 36:53.040
of thing, you know?

36:53.040 --> 36:59.600
Well, and, you know, and keep in mind, too, we know how they tried to do Betamax, Betamax

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
didn't catch on.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.780
Some of these didn't catch on.

37:01.780 --> 37:05.960
But now our preferred format is Blu-ray.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.360
So I could see that.

37:07.360 --> 37:11.200
Anyhow, we got to move on because we actually have a rare live interview tonight.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.920
A lot of times our interviews are pre-taped, but we actually have a live interview tonight.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.520
But I have to ask you guys, especially here in studio, how many of you guys have seen

37:17.520 --> 37:20.120
this video that's floating around YouTube right now?

37:20.120 --> 37:27.520
It's this little version of Bad Romance, but it actually has the chibi little Sackboy characters.

37:27.520 --> 37:31.560
And I don't know how many of you have seen the actual Lady Gaga video, but this actually

37:31.560 --> 37:33.160
parodies the video.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
Isn't this cool?

37:34.160 --> 37:37.960
Thanks to you and Megzi, I've seen both.

37:37.960 --> 37:41.160
So in the end, obviously, it's this little video that kind of parries using these Sackboy

37:41.160 --> 37:42.160
characters.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.480
And it's kind of gone viral this week.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.880
Very interesting.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.840
The whole thing was created by this gentleman, Brian Moreno.

37:49.840 --> 37:54.760
And you know, his little big plan has been continuing to grow via the online co-op mode

37:54.760 --> 37:56.000
that you've heard about this week.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.440
And after one year of release, the online community is still going.

37:59.440 --> 38:04.880
And I think a lot of us kind of poo-pooed at Media Molecule when they said last year

38:04.880 --> 38:09.040
when this game came out, oh, we're not going to be thinking about a sequel right away.

38:09.040 --> 38:13.820
What we want to do right now is we're going to focus a lot on making LittleBigPlanet bigger.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.560
But they actually delivered on that.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.760
We kind of rolled our eyes and thought, yeah, right.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.760
Next year, they're going to announce LittleBigPlanet 2.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.640
But they've actually continued to make good on that.

38:21.640 --> 38:26.180
And I think this video going viral is just kind of an example of that.

38:26.180 --> 38:33.000
So this video, which you can find, LittleBadRomance, YouTube user BrianRDM, it was on YouTube.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.480
Then it got posted to NeoGAF, which is this huge, huge gaming forum.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.580
I'm sure you've heard of it.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.600
Then it spread through Twitter, through Facebook.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.600
That's where I found it.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.560
An OLR member posted it on their Twitter.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
That's where I found it.

38:43.560 --> 38:47.060
And then it got coverage on Kotaku, other blogs, so forth.

38:47.060 --> 38:51.840
And ironically, Lady Gaga, she's also big right now.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.840
She just started a big tour of hers last week.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.240
50,000 views on YouTube tonight, just about 50,000, just shy of it.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.680
So we want to get Brian Moreno here on the show to talk a little bit about this and about

39:01.680 --> 39:03.240
the LittleBigPlanet community.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.480
So we're actually going to give him a call right now.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.120
Hopefully he is standing by.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.520
So we're firing up the telephone.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.940
And again, this is a rare live interview.

39:11.940 --> 39:17.960
So please bear with us as we have Brian on the line.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
Hello?

39:19.960 --> 39:27.160
Hi, is this Brian?

39:27.160 --> 39:28.160
This is Brian.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.160
Hey, Brian.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.160
How you doing?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.620
How are you guys?

39:32.620 --> 39:33.760
We are doing great.

39:33.760 --> 39:37.560
We were just kind of checking out your video here in studio, looking at it, the little

39:37.560 --> 39:39.000
bad romance.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.840
Congratulations on the success.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.240
About 50,000 views now, huh?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
I know.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.240
It's pretty mind-blowing.

39:46.240 --> 39:50.240
Did you ever think that this was going to catch on as big as it did?

39:50.240 --> 39:54.640
Me and my friend were actually talking about this yesterday.

39:54.640 --> 39:59.400
We thought maybe 1,000, 2,000 modest views, a laugh between ourselves.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.760
And then all of a sudden, the second day it was posted, it was number three most viewed

40:03.760 --> 40:08.760
in its category in Russia and 95th most viewed on YouTube that day.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.520
It was pretty amazing.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.960
I had no idea it was going to go that far.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.760
You know, it's very interesting because we've been the subject of some of that viral stuff

40:15.760 --> 40:18.840
before too, especially the whole president cat ordeal a couple of months ago.

40:18.840 --> 40:23.600
It's always interesting to see what kind of stuff the internet spreads like wildfire and

40:23.600 --> 40:24.920
what doesn't.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.200
It's fascinating, I got to say.

40:26.200 --> 40:30.680
And if you guys have questions for Brian in our chat room, head on over to chat.orangelodgeradio.com

40:30.680 --> 40:34.280
so you can be in the chat room and we'll ask a couple of questions from you guys to Brian.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.920
But I got some questions for you.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.240
First off, I got to know Brian.

40:38.240 --> 40:45.320
Obviously Lady Gaga is huge, people love this new album, she has these super fans.

40:45.320 --> 40:50.480
People get on YouTube and they do karaokes, they dance, do whatever interpretive thing

40:50.480 --> 40:52.000
to Bad Romance.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.200
What made you decide, I'm going to do a tribute, but I'm going to do it in Little Big Planet?

40:57.200 --> 41:00.740
It was actually like a mixture of many things.

41:00.740 --> 41:05.740
I work one of my city gigs as a club photographer here in Orange County.

41:05.740 --> 41:11.240
And October last year, I actually had an opportunity to photograph and meet Lady Gaga.

41:11.240 --> 41:17.640
It was right before her career exploded and she was the nicest person I've ever met.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.720
It was 2 a.m., the show was over, fans were outside of her trailer and security was leaving.

41:22.720 --> 41:28.480
And she said it herself, she's like, I'm going to be here until I take a picture and take

41:28.480 --> 41:31.240
an autograph for everyone, everyone.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.840
You know, she does something like that recently too.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.560
I heard it like a Best Buy in LA that all these people came out and she said, I'm not

41:36.560 --> 41:39.680
leaving until I sign all your stuff.

41:39.680 --> 41:48.000
She's great about her and her fans and I thought she was the greatest person since I met her.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.920
And then with the release of The Fame Monster, I mean, I've been hooked on that album.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.960
I think it's so much better than her original release.

41:56.960 --> 42:00.920
And then when it came to Little Big Planet, I had been a fan of it since it had been announced

42:00.920 --> 42:08.680
D3, how many years ago, and just the ability to be able to create whatever you want and

42:08.680 --> 42:12.400
how accessible it was to everyone.

42:12.400 --> 42:17.440
Me being a fan of those two, it just seems like the perfect recipe for something that

42:17.440 --> 42:19.960
would go far, that would have long legs.

42:19.960 --> 42:23.280
So it just kind of worked out in your mind, I like this, I like this.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.040
What happens when we throw them together?

42:27.040 --> 42:28.940
Some could say that's the same way the show started.

42:28.940 --> 42:32.600
I know Jamie, remember it was about, hey, I like video games and we do amateur radio,

42:32.600 --> 42:34.000
let's do a radio show about video games.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.040
Well, to paraphrase the quote is two great tastes that go great together.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.040
Exactly.

42:39.040 --> 42:43.920
I got a question for you, Brian, how long did this whole thing take?

42:43.920 --> 42:48.000
Because I got to say, one thing that impressed me when I saw this video is I was thinking,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.360
wait a minute, that because I'll admit anyone that's been listening to the show a long time,

42:51.360 --> 42:53.960
I'm a big old fan of Lady Gaga, I think she's great.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.880
And in fact, I'm not going to be here at the show on December 13th, because I'm going to

42:56.880 --> 42:57.880
Monster Ball.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.480
I'm going to be more excited.

42:59.480 --> 43:06.320
But I was going to say, that video came out like Tuesday, and this video seemed like it

43:06.320 --> 43:08.860
was on the internet, like not even 10 days later.

43:08.860 --> 43:12.520
How long did this whole thing take you to put together?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.320
Hours and hours and hours and hours.

43:14.320 --> 43:19.960
I was in fear of my 60 gigabyte PlayStation hitting the dirt, I was afraid of it dying

43:19.960 --> 43:21.600
how much I was on it.

43:21.600 --> 43:28.920
It was honestly maybe a good 48, 64 hours total, it was just trial and error on making

43:28.920 --> 43:34.440
those costumes and matching it with the video and making the set pieces and doing what I

43:34.440 --> 43:37.700
could with the tools that I had provided.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.000
Was anyone helping you out with it?

43:39.000 --> 43:42.640
Because I noticed in a lot of the scenes, it seems like there were always three Sackboys.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.520
So was that just you kind of coordinating three controllers, or would you have a couple

43:46.520 --> 43:47.520
more inside of you?

43:47.520 --> 43:49.120
More incidentally, I didn't have three hands.

43:49.120 --> 43:55.000
So I ended up getting another friend to do the backup dancers, while I really tried to

43:55.000 --> 43:59.360
focus on the Gaga Sad Girl herself.

43:59.360 --> 44:05.440
So I did have some help in terms of just the actual dancing, but I mean in set pieces and

44:05.440 --> 44:10.720
costume design, it was just me and the PlayStation and me treating it to friends or facing it

44:10.720 --> 44:14.440
to friends to see how well they thought it matched up.

44:14.440 --> 44:19.080
Now, this is kind of a subjective question here, but would you say that the two of you

44:19.080 --> 44:23.800
tools that Media Molecule gives you in LittleBigPlanet made this process easy?

44:23.800 --> 44:27.280
I mean, I know you talked about it takes hours and hours, but it takes hours and hours to

44:27.280 --> 44:30.040
build a really good level in LittleBigPlanet too.

44:30.040 --> 44:34.920
Do you think you have the tools you needed to produce this video good, or do you think

44:34.920 --> 44:37.360
there was something that Media Molecule could have given you that would have made this whole

44:37.360 --> 44:39.680
thing easier?

44:39.680 --> 44:48.280
I think that the process, it went well, but I did discover limitations that I did not

44:48.280 --> 44:50.180
know existed in the game.

44:50.180 --> 44:56.040
A lot of the issues was hair with me, because hair for me, I wanted to get the right colors

44:56.040 --> 44:58.600
and really differentiate from the Gaga Sad Girl.

44:58.600 --> 45:03.120
And one of the problems is, for a lot of the hairstyles, you can't actually change the

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
hair color.

45:04.120 --> 45:10.280
So the way I had to go around that was using stickers and carefully putting colored stickers

45:10.280 --> 45:11.380
on the hair.

45:11.380 --> 45:17.520
But another limitation in that is, it seems that items only have a maximum of three stickers

45:17.520 --> 45:23.040
that you can place on an object before it will erase the first one put in and put in

45:23.040 --> 45:25.560
the new one.

45:25.560 --> 45:33.000
On top of that, it was too deep, a 2.5D perspective game, and you couldn't get the camera right

45:33.000 --> 45:36.500
in some ways that you could, especially in close-ups.

45:36.500 --> 45:40.820
And the way I found a way around that is, when you go open the pop-it menu and go to

45:40.820 --> 45:45.680
the Customize Sackboy option, it zooms in the camera to maximize the screen on your

45:45.680 --> 45:46.680
Sackboy.

45:46.680 --> 45:51.000
And when you press circle and get out of that, the camera stays on that perspective.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.880
So that's how I was able to get a lot of the close-ups, because the camera tools that they

45:55.880 --> 45:57.520
give you don't get that close.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.880
Well, there's a tip for other aspiring video makers out there.

46:00.880 --> 46:05.800
Speaking of which, was this really the first thing you really did in LittleBigPlanet, or

46:05.800 --> 46:09.480
have you made levels before, or have you done other projects, and this is just the first

46:09.480 --> 46:12.240
one everybody seems to notice?

46:12.240 --> 46:17.960
I fooled around with LittleBigPlanet back in the beta, and I made a kind of in-sight

46:17.960 --> 46:24.040
joke level for one of the websites that I'm a forum member for, thenextlevel.com.

46:24.040 --> 46:29.640
But after that, I really didn't have the time, and so many other great games are coming out,

46:29.640 --> 46:34.480
but it was always in the back of my head that I always wanted to do something with LittleBigPlanet.

46:34.480 --> 46:39.100
And that was just, with the Gaga and LittleBigPlanet, me wondering what would happen with those

46:39.100 --> 46:43.000
two, I went out and bought a capture device, and I was like, I'm going to do this, I'm

46:43.000 --> 46:45.480
going to take my time, and I'm going to make sure I make something great.

46:45.480 --> 46:50.200
Wait, wait, wait, are you saying you bought the video capture device just for this project?

46:50.200 --> 46:51.320
Just for this project.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.320
That is dedication.

46:52.320 --> 46:56.600
Well, you know, since Lady Gaga is so generous to her fans and so forth, do you think there

46:56.600 --> 46:59.360
might be a chance she's seen it?

46:59.360 --> 47:02.280
I actually have no idea if she's seen it.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.280
I hope she does.

47:03.280 --> 47:09.320
And I spammed her Twitter every time I post the link to that video.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.920
I do know for sure that some people in Media Molecule have seen it, because if you go on

47:13.920 --> 47:17.080
their official YouTube page, it is one of their favorites.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.680
Oh, well, very cool.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.960
Hey, at least you got one half of the equation that's a fan of it.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.880
You should definitely take a compliment from that.

47:23.880 --> 47:28.280
Well, my thought is that maybe if Gaga does see it, she could contribute some of her outfits

47:28.280 --> 47:32.000
to the game, and then we'd have a huge variance in some of the costumes we have.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
I don't know.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.760
I hope Media Molecule gets me on that, because I'll help anyone I need to to get those costumes

47:38.760 --> 47:39.760
done right.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.760
Awesome.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.920
Well, hey, you're kind of the perfect guy to ask about this, because you said you were

47:43.920 --> 47:46.480
in the beta in all this, too.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.920
And we were just talking before you came on the air about how LittleBigPlanet, a lot of

47:49.920 --> 47:53.960
us didn't really believe Media Molecule a couple years ago, or I should say a year ago

47:53.960 --> 47:58.280
when this game first came out, that they weren't going to just jump right in and do LittleBigPlanet

47:58.280 --> 47:59.280
2.

47:59.280 --> 48:02.480
They came out and said, no, we're going to continue to support LittleBigPlanet, and they've

48:02.480 --> 48:07.360
really made good on that promise to a lot of our surprise, a very pleasant surprise.

48:07.360 --> 48:12.040
What do you think it is about the game that keeps this community going strong a year after

48:12.040 --> 48:13.040
the game is out?

48:13.040 --> 48:14.520
Is it all these constant updates?

48:14.520 --> 48:18.000
Is it the fact that people keep building these pop culture references?

48:18.000 --> 48:20.040
What is it?

48:20.040 --> 48:25.400
I think, overall, it's very charming to look at, and it's very peculiar to look at.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.520
There's nothing else really out there like that.

48:27.520 --> 48:32.560
But most of all, I really feel that it's, you know, the players really feel like they

48:32.560 --> 48:39.200
are part of the game, and that they can contribute to this larger whole of what is LittleBigPlanet.

48:39.200 --> 48:45.280
I almost feel like once Media Molecule and Sony released LittleBigPlanet, it left their

48:45.280 --> 48:48.600
hands and it was everyone.

48:48.600 --> 48:52.520
Everyone could contribute, everyone could build, and it's kind of just grown into something

48:52.520 --> 48:55.800
that Sony and Media Molecule could never have done themselves.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.800
Okay.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
That would be cool.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.960
Well, hey, I want to take some questions from our chat room here.

48:59.960 --> 49:04.280
And Redertainment has a question for you, and says, what song will you make a video

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
for next?

49:05.280 --> 49:09.160
And he makes a suggestion of Guitar Hero by Amanda Palmer, who must be a favorite artist

49:09.160 --> 49:10.160
of his.

49:10.160 --> 49:12.360
I guess that's a really good question to ask.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.160
After all of this, is this going to be a regular thing for you?

49:15.160 --> 49:19.600
Are you going to continue to make more videos, or is this kind of like a one-shot thing?

49:19.600 --> 49:20.600
You know what?

49:20.600 --> 49:24.200
I'm going to just enjoy this and move on to other projects.

49:24.200 --> 49:29.240
What this video was, was a part of a whole of a project that I was doing actually for

49:29.240 --> 49:30.320
one of my college classes.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.880
I'm about to graduate finally.

49:32.880 --> 49:38.200
And it was kind of about context and what would happen if I took something and put it

49:38.200 --> 49:42.440
in somewhere, something else, what would happen.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.560
The next part of this series, I guess I'll give you a little exclusive right now, my

49:46.560 --> 49:51.720
next video, using LittleBigPlanet and kind of going along with these pop references is

49:51.720 --> 50:00.160
going to be remaking the New Moon trailer, which if there's anything bigger, then God

50:00.160 --> 50:02.480
got it to New Moon.

50:02.480 --> 50:03.480
Fair enough.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.480
All right.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.480
Wow.

50:05.480 --> 50:12.720
Along with that, I'd love to continue doing stuff with LittleBigPlanet.

50:12.720 --> 50:19.640
With Neil Gaff, I promised them that if this made it on any gaming blocks, that I would

50:19.640 --> 50:22.640
go along and do some of their music video requests.

50:22.640 --> 50:27.440
So some of them that they've requested are Thriller and White Wedding.

50:27.440 --> 50:31.600
So really going to have to see if those are possible, because I did stretch the limits

50:31.600 --> 50:36.200
and really got really creative with what I was given to be able to get the costumes as

50:36.200 --> 50:38.080
close as they could look.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.720
You know, I got to say, it's getting a lot of mixed feedback in our chat room.

50:41.720 --> 50:47.240
You're getting some LOLs and XDs, and then of course the Do Not Wants and so forth for

50:47.240 --> 50:48.960
the New Moon trailer.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.240
But I like this from Tigerclaw.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.440
How are they going to make a Sackboy turn into a wolf?

50:53.440 --> 50:57.420
And Botikawa says, roll full sparkly and wolf Sackboys.

50:57.420 --> 51:00.040
So I guess we'll see, huh?

51:00.040 --> 51:01.040
Mm-hmm.

51:01.040 --> 51:07.680
Well, you know, if this whole thing was for school, I hope to hell you get an A or else

51:07.680 --> 51:08.680
I hope so.

51:08.680 --> 51:10.460
You got robbed.

51:10.460 --> 51:12.120
You play this for your professor.

51:12.120 --> 51:15.440
Give Brian an A. He earned it.

51:15.440 --> 51:18.200
This will actually be part of the package that I turn into him.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.200
This will be.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.200
Awesome.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
Awesome.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
Well, there you go.

51:22.200 --> 51:26.280
Hey, Brian, one thing we like to ask everybody we have on the show, just a standard question

51:26.280 --> 51:29.840
for all the guests, because we always ask it to ourselves at the top of every show.

51:29.840 --> 51:35.800
What video games have you been playing this week, now besides LittleBigPlanet, of course?

51:35.800 --> 51:38.680
The matter is what haven't I been playing this week.

51:38.680 --> 51:42.680
I've been playing Dizzidia, Final Fantasy on the PSP.

51:42.680 --> 51:44.640
I'm not too sure about that one.

51:44.640 --> 51:50.160
When I played it at E3 earlier this year, I was kind of, I had no idea what was going

51:50.160 --> 51:51.640
on, but I'm getting used to it.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.200
I'm really enjoying it.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.520
It's a really big fan service.

51:55.520 --> 51:59.600
On top of that, playing the original Left 4 Dead, because I already bought Left 4 Dead

51:59.600 --> 52:03.160
2 on Black Friday to have me finish the first one.

52:03.160 --> 52:08.960
And O'Meara Friend also went to the 3 a.m. Old Navy Black Friday opening, and he got

52:08.960 --> 52:11.280
herself a copy of Little Rock Band.

52:11.280 --> 52:16.520
So we've been rocking out with that, with Elton John and Vampire Weekend.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.520
Very cool.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.200
I was debating doing that, but I was like, ah, I don't want to fight all those people

52:20.200 --> 52:24.320
at 3 in the morning, so props to you for doing that.

52:24.320 --> 52:29.620
Very interesting, too, because Lego Rock Band's another game with very cute-looking avatars.

52:29.620 --> 52:34.120
You think you might have to have something there with Lego Rock Band and making fan videos?

52:34.120 --> 52:41.000
The thing with Lego Rock Band is, for me, I really need those tools, and as far as I've

52:41.000 --> 52:46.080
seen, Lego Rock Band doesn't give me anywhere close to what Little Big Planet does.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.080
Very true.

52:47.080 --> 52:50.880
In terms of the create and being able to have some control.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.880
Besides Little Big Planet, I am going to start looking into Uncharted 2, because I'm ever

52:54.880 --> 52:59.800
hearing there's a movie-making mode where you can do all kinds of camera tricks and

52:59.800 --> 53:02.040
lip-syncing, I believe, is in there.

53:02.040 --> 53:07.480
Honestly, what I can do with that, I'm really trying to get into the electronic format and

53:07.480 --> 53:14.800
the electronic creative ways to continue this project beyond just the school project and

53:14.800 --> 53:16.200
the assignment requirements.

53:16.200 --> 53:19.440
Well, Brian, it sounds like you're going to be able to use this as kind of a launch of

53:19.440 --> 53:24.920
future Mashima and types of movies based around video games, so props to you.

53:24.920 --> 53:28.720
Where can the listeners keep tabs on you and your future projects?

53:28.720 --> 53:34.440
The easiest way is going onto my website, www.brianmarino.com.

53:34.440 --> 53:38.280
You can find me on YouTube at youtube.com slash brianrdm.

53:38.280 --> 53:42.720
Those will be the quickest and easy ways to keep up on any of the work I do.

53:42.720 --> 53:47.160
All right, and stay tuned there for the soon-to-come Little Big Planet New Moon trailer, which

53:47.160 --> 53:49.200
you heard about here on OLR First.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.200
Thank you so much, Brian.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.960
I appreciate that exclusive and everything else.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.880
And best of luck to you in your future endeavors.

53:53.880 --> 53:55.880
Yeah, thank you, guys.

53:55.880 --> 54:03.320
I want to thank you guys, Kotaku, NeoGaf, The Next Level, all the listeners on Orange

54:03.320 --> 54:08.080
Lounge Radio, everyone on YouTube, Lady Gaga, everything, because without all of you guys,

54:08.080 --> 54:10.440
this wouldn't be anywhere close to what it was.

54:10.440 --> 54:14.040
Well, I'm glad we can kind of make your day with all of this.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
And you know what?

54:15.040 --> 54:19.280
I really smiled and got a good laugh in a really positive way out of the video when

54:19.280 --> 54:22.000
I first saw it, so I'm glad we can kind of turn it around back to you.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Excellent.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Thank you, guys.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
All right.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Take care, Brian.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Have a good one.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Take care, guys.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Bye.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Bye.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Well, that was fun.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.160
He definitely sounds like he's going to kind of use this to kind of start something else.

54:34.160 --> 54:39.240
And although, you know, this may be the one that's really big and maybe the other ones,

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
but I don't know.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
I mean, that one was so good.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.240
And he's right.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.240
It was very well done.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.480
No, I was quite impressed.

54:44.480 --> 54:48.840
Whether I like it or not, you know, I like Gaga, but I don't like Twilight nearly as

54:48.840 --> 54:49.840
much.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.840
But-

54:50.840 --> 54:54.040
I'm actually looking forward to seeing how that pans out.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.920
I love parodies.

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
He's right.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.800
The only thing bigger than Gaga is Twilight, so why the hell not?

54:59.800 --> 55:02.800
So yeah, you're totally right.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.600
Who doesn't love a good Weird Al song no matter what it is he's parodying, right?

55:05.600 --> 55:08.480
Oh, he should do a Weird Al video.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.480
Hopefully he's listening.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.480
Hopefully he's still listening.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
Seriously?

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
A Weird Al one?

55:12.480 --> 55:13.480
That would be good.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.480
There you go.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.480
All right.

55:15.480 --> 55:16.480
Well, that was fun.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.480
All right.

55:17.480 --> 55:18.480
Let's move on.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.200
We've got some more news here before we get to our classic game of the week, and then,

55:20.200 --> 55:24.640
of course, part B tonight, 7 o'clock here in California, 10 o'clock for those folks

55:24.640 --> 55:26.700
on the East Coast, but plenty more show to come.

55:26.700 --> 55:28.160
So, Loki, what's up next?

55:28.160 --> 55:33.760
As we alluded to in our intro, although the podcast won't be privy to that, New York

55:33.760 --> 55:40.700
State apparently now has teamed up with Microsoft to issue emergency alerts via Xbox Live, kind

55:40.700 --> 55:46.880
of similar to, I guess, the Amber Alerts that we have and other emergency broadcasts and

55:46.880 --> 55:47.880
stuff.

55:47.880 --> 55:53.360
They're going to let you know if there's a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, you

55:53.360 --> 55:55.560
name it, whatever requires them to do it.

55:55.560 --> 56:00.080
I just hope they don't do the tests with that, and I also hope they don't have that

56:00.080 --> 56:02.800
annoying beep that goes with it.

56:02.800 --> 56:07.080
A message to me might be fine, but, man, I hate watching TV, and all of a sudden there's

56:07.080 --> 56:11.120
like an Amber Alert thing going on, and all the audio cuts out, and it's like, dude,

56:11.120 --> 56:12.120
I'm inside my house.

56:12.120 --> 56:17.120
I'm not going to see some guy driving around with his stolen child in my house, okay?

56:17.120 --> 56:22.000
Plus, that's kind of the concern I would think about Amber Alerts is that the more

56:22.000 --> 56:26.040
you use it, the more desensitized people get to it, right?

56:26.040 --> 56:28.760
Does that make sense?

56:28.760 --> 56:33.520
If you saw an Amber Alert every hour on the TV, you would stop paying attention to them.

56:33.520 --> 56:37.940
So you really have to use a device like this, and I don't know, we're using Amber Alert.

56:37.940 --> 56:39.800
Is that the type of thing they're talking about here, kidnapped kids?

56:39.800 --> 56:42.600
It's mainly emergency broadcast system stuff.

56:42.600 --> 56:48.160
Mainly I think it's because New York and the whole 9-11 thing.

56:48.160 --> 56:50.440
I'm sure other states are probably looking into something like this too.

56:50.440 --> 56:51.440
I'm sorry.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.040
Do you know if the gaming consoles are exactly a good platformer for that?

56:55.040 --> 56:57.800
Because most people would be like, ah, goddammit, who's messaging me now?

56:57.800 --> 57:00.000
I'm going to go finish this game first.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
You know, terror alert, you know, death and imminent.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.360
It's like, ah.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.560
The Vs have arrived.

57:07.560 --> 57:10.440
Get out of town.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.440
The bombing's gone off already.

57:11.440 --> 57:13.440
That bothers me, Rob.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.440
Why?

57:14.440 --> 57:19.360
I know I don't like using, okay, that's like seriously my big pet peeve with that

57:19.360 --> 57:22.080
show is them calling them the Vs that, no.

57:22.080 --> 57:27.920
The whole point of the V in the original series was the reference to World War II.

57:27.920 --> 57:34.400
Okay, okay, but you know in the new one they got the whole thing, I know, I know, all right.

57:34.400 --> 57:38.480
But I mean regardless, all joking aside, I got to say though, you know, when they originally

57:38.480 --> 57:41.820
incorporated the emergency broadcast system, wasn't it kind of a similar deal?

57:41.820 --> 57:46.960
You know, people use their free time playing TV, or playing TV, watching TV, and so the

57:46.960 --> 57:51.480
emergency broadcast system would alert those people who aren't glued to the radio or going

57:51.480 --> 57:52.480
outside.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.400
I mean this kind of makes sense in a way.

57:54.400 --> 57:59.560
I think that they use this tastefully like, hey, there's a fucking fire right by you

57:59.560 --> 58:00.560
right now.

58:00.560 --> 58:04.040
You know, it might be a good idea to get the fuck out and stop playing your game.

58:04.040 --> 58:08.200
I actually don't think it's a bad idea, but again, it's just about how much they

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
use it.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.460
Because if it's an AMBO alert every other hour, people are going to get pissed off.

58:12.460 --> 58:15.720
But if it's for like big stuff, like you need to leave your home.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.500
You need to evacuate or something.

58:17.500 --> 58:22.220
If it's an absolute emergency like that, they have a way to call all the phones and

58:22.220 --> 58:27.000
have an automated message play so you can pick up your phone.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.800
Because most people might not be playing like a game console.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.760
You know, hey, what's that crackling rumbling sound?

58:32.760 --> 58:35.040
Oh, hey, it's fire!

58:35.040 --> 58:36.040
Awesome!

58:36.040 --> 58:38.320
I'm going to play one more level.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.960
It's far enough away.

58:40.960 --> 58:41.960
I don't know.

58:41.960 --> 58:43.840
It's just, it's a neat idea.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.840
It's just interesting to see how it's implemented.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.080
I think it's going to be just about as effective as it is on TV.

58:49.080 --> 58:52.520
Which is, if you're like me, that's the time that I go get a snack.

58:52.520 --> 58:56.160
Because that noise isn't, oh god, I hate it.

58:56.160 --> 58:59.680
SSJ100Matt in our chat took the words right out of my mouth.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.600
The next step would be announcements and wow.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.640
But then again, those people won't leave their homes anyway.

59:05.640 --> 59:06.880
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.880
I resemble that remark.

59:07.880 --> 59:10.560
Thank you very much.

59:10.560 --> 59:13.240
Janai in chat, yes, it just goes in the next time.

59:13.240 --> 59:15.880
We interrupt this wow raid for this important Amber Alert.

59:15.880 --> 59:18.440
And again, guys, I'm not trying to belittle Amber Alerts.

59:18.440 --> 59:20.560
Obviously, it's an important thing.

59:20.560 --> 59:25.720
But I think that type of thing works best on the highway, where the cars are, on the

59:25.720 --> 59:28.880
signs on the highway.

59:28.880 --> 59:36.960
On the TV in my home, I'm not likely to see white Honda Civic license plate whatever driving

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
by.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.680
I'm not as likely to be receptive to that as I would be.

59:40.680 --> 59:44.640
But if it's for a big thing, like town being evacuated, then yeah, you need to have your

59:44.640 --> 59:47.580
game paused for this emergency message.

59:47.580 --> 59:49.660
But it's all about in how they use it for me.

59:49.660 --> 59:50.660
That's my opinion anyway.

59:50.660 --> 59:51.660
I don't know.

59:51.660 --> 59:55.460
DarkSaga, how would you feel if you were playing a game and then suddenly, a little message

59:55.460 --> 59:59.480
comes up, fire, get out?

59:59.480 --> 01:00:06.480
Well, if there was really a fire, then I'd be like, thank you.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.120
But if it was just like, what?

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.720
I'd be like, GTFO my game.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.440
Or if it was like, fire in Bakersfield, and then you're like, well, it's like five hours

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
away.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440
Sucks to be there.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
Do not give a crap.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.920
I mean, sucks to be people in Bakersfield, but don't know.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.200
That's what I would worry, especially if it's like a statewide thing.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:36.720
I would want to have it be my specific zip code maybe.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.320
That might be more appropriate.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.960
The chat room collectively, I'm just kind of attributing this to several people in the

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.920
chat room, seem to think that the iPhone is a good idea for these types of alerts.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.580
And I've heard that talk before too, is alerts through text message, which I think could

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580
be very effective.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580
That'd be awesome.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.640
And then I get charged text messaging.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.920
Not if you have an iPhone.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.720
Well, and your carrier doesn't charge.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.200
I know even when I had Sprint and I got charged for every message on my plan, they didn't

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.880
charge for messages they sent.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880
Oh, yeah.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880
Yeah.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
And I wouldn't think those would get charged.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.880
But a lot of times, though, it's built into your iPhone plan to have like a certain number

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
of...

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.040
Or even if it...

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.040
A little app you could download that's like an alert app or something.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.520
It might not have the same impact, though, than just sending it for a text message.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520
Just send it to your email.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.000
They just have stuff that goes to your email.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.600
And then, of course, as the J-100 Map makes the joke, Nintendo will send their Amber Alerts

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.840
through friend codes.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.960
So an Amber Alert will look like 012463.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960
Anyhow.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:44.520
All right, hey, speaking of WoW came up in that last story, and WoW is the attention

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.180
this week of a lawsuit.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180
That's right.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:53.320
$1 million in a complaint against Activision Blizzard over the design of World of Warcraft.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.760
This complaint says that the publisher maintains a, quote, harmful virtual environment to many

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.040
of its customers by forcing them to follow the game's sneaky and deceitful practices.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.280
Well, now, what would you think about this lawsuit if I told you it was filed by Eric

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.880
Estavio?

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880
That's right.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.920
The guy who filed the lawsuit against Sony.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.020
And the judge basically laughed it out of court.

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.800
So he went and sued Microsoft and Nintendo, which we reported on last week.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.280
And this week, now he sued Activision Blizzard over this one.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:32.800
Oh, by the way, as part of this case, Estavio has subpoenaed actress Winona Ryder and Depeche

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.000
Mode's Martin Lee Gore to testify on his behalf.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.560
Because apparently, I don't even want to get into it.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.320
It's just as ridiculous as it sounds.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.960
Does that mean they have to actually show up?

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960
I don't know.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.200
I think he just wanted to meet them.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.320
I'm reminded of that scene from Clerks, the animated series, where they subpoena George

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.840
Lucas in the courtroom, which, didn't this whole topic-

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840
I want my money back.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.920
Didn't this topic come up on the show like just two weeks ago?

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920
Last week.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.960
Well, here it is again, probably for the same fucking guy.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960
Yes, it was.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.760
And that's just exactly what it sounds like.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.520
I want my eight dollars back.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.520
That's exactly what it sounds like.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
I mean-

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
Someone sued him.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.320
Hey, let's have a class action lawsuit against that guy.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.640
For ruining all of the news sites that we- for having such an impact on the gaming culture

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.240
and the game blogs?

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.120
For mental anguish that someone could be that stupid.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.560
Watch out or we might get sued next.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.360
Of course, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.520
We don't have any money.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520
Good luck.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520
I'd take him to court.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520
I'd fight it all the way.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520
No, check this out.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520
Check this out.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:46.160
If he sued us, then we could actually petition for damages for cost if-

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160
I'd counter sue.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.240
Just would win.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.760
And then we'd have money to advertise a show.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760
That'd be awesome.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760
We would.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760
Here's my thought.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.760
Okay-

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.760
Buy a studio.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.540
In all seriousness, though, okay, this is the point where you rela- I mean, last week

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:04.680
we were asking this, but now you really have to ask, why is he doing this?

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.800
Is it just a tour?

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.960
Or is it just he's trying to be collecting all the money?

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.400
But like, I would be with you on the whole he's doing it just for the money until I heard

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.920
he's subpoenaed Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode because now I'm like, okay, this guy's just

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.800
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.400
But how do you have money to pay?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.960
I mean, is he getting these lawyers that are just like, you know-

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.800
I mean, your average lawyer is not gonna probably follow up with this stuff because there's

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.240
no payout for it.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.100
I mean, unless this guy's gonna pay him, you know, to do this stuff, I'm assuming that

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.760
he's expecting the, you know, win this stuff to, you know, cover his lawyer fees.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.400
But I don't know.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.260
It's like there's so little grounds.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:53.320
It's like it would be such a high risk case for a lawyer.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.960
If I was an attorney, I would think that it would be damaging to my reputation to take

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.920
such a frivolous case like this.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.520
And some people in our chat are invoking the name of Lord Voldemort, which you might remember

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.640
is a certain lawyer.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.400
His name rhymes with Jack Fuckhead-Ompson.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.480
That we call him Lord Voldemort here on the show.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.240
A few folks invoking that name, dude, this guy is starting to make Lord Voldemort look

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240
good.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.240
Like, really?

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.680
Like, at least you kind of knew what Lord Voldemort was thinking.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, it's not like you could hire him.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Right?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.680
It's just so weird.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:35.000
Anyway, and I just, I really would like to find this guy and shoot him with a water gun.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.880
I have to admit, I kind of want him on the show.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.800
Has this guy made a comment publicly?

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.280
I don't think he's made any type of comment publicly.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.600
You know, all these blogs are reporting on it when really he should just be banned.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.600
If you pay the town fool no mind, he will just go away and, you know, entertain himself

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.600
in his house.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.160
But everybody likes the town fool that jumps around and makes an ass of himself.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.640
But I would kind of like to hear his side of it, like, you know, and I'm willing to

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.800
give him a fair shot if he'll present himself professionally.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.640
Isn't he serving as his own lawyer?

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.000
I believe he is.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.120
Don't they say a man who has himself as a lawyer has a fool for a client or something

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120
like that?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.120
What was that line there from Addams Family?

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Well, by God, I am that fool!

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.240
Yes, exactly.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.480
I love that movie.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.800
Me too.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.920
By the way, totally off topic and I don't care.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.680
Did you hear that it's going to be a stage play soon with Nathan Lane as Gomez and Bebe

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680
Neuwirth as Morticia?

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680
I'm just saying.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.680
Epic epicness.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680
Nathan Lane?

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680
I can't see that.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680
I'm sorry.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.440
It's a little weird, but let's face it, Raul Julia ain't here no more.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.400
So if they're going to go with this comic Broadway angle, why not?

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400
You know, I don't know.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400
Anyway.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.720
He's a little chubby for, you know.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720
Maybe he's worked out.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.360
But anyway, Ricky Gomack says about this guy, he just wants to get on Oprah before she's

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.620
gone.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.620
This might be the way to do it.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.880
I don't know.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.040
And then who was it that said that we should go settle this?

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040
Oh, here it is.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040
Amaze Atsuma.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.800
Skye, sue him so you can be on the people's court.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800
Yeah.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.000
If this guy does, for whatever reason, sue us, even though we're totally under our rights

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.760
to comment on what is a public news story, for whatever wacky reason, although I don't

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.620
see it happening, we were to get sued, I would only agree to settlement on the people's court

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:18.000
under Judge Millon because, or Judge Millon, she would tear him a new butthole.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.680
And you know, you don't fuck with her.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.760
I don't know if you've ever watched the new people's court, but she's amazing.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760
Just saying.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.960
You know, I remember the people's court back in the day when it was Judge Wapner.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.080
Oh yeah, I remember that too.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080
Back in the day.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080
I remember that too.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.840
You always waited for the day he was going to send somebody to the electric chair, but

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840
it never happened.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
I don't think they can.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840
No, you can't.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840
They'd make an exception.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.200
That's not the way TV court works, but you know sometimes there were just those people

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.640
on the show that you wish would get the death penalty.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.840
No, sir, you can't do that, but you know what, I'm going to make this exception this one

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
time.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840
Alright.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.360
I vote for hanging.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.280
You know what, part of me just wants to ban this guy from the show.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
What do you think?

01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280
Are we going to report on this guy ever again?

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.760
Actually, you know what I want to do?

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760
What?

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.360
I want to publicly humiliate him.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.440
Well, isn't he kind of doing that for himself?

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440
No, I'm not.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440
I didn't mean it like that.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.960
I mean, I meant mock, like apart from just what we're doing on the show.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.160
Again, is there anything additional we could lend to the rest of the internet?

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.920
Well, we can make a big, well, I'm saying like we could use, are there pictures of this

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.920
guy around?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.920
Probably not.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.120
We could totally make lolcat stuff out of this guy.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.200
Or we'll get Brian to help us make a LittleBigPlanet level.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.200
Yes!

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.760
We've got $10 with your name on it because we have no money.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.140
It could be a level in LittleBigPlanet where OLR goes to the people's court with Eric,

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.000
and it's about our adventures of traveling to judge me on it.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.240
We will provide a voice talent with Judge Mr. Spanky.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.680
Seriously, that would be fun.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.700
Now, I'm in the mood to do something silly, like I'm tired of making lol Sims.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.720
So I want to do something funny.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.160
We'll have to brainstorm off air.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.560
Maybe if the chatters have an idea, you can email us at mailbagorangelawnsherd.com, especially

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.200
if you have LittleBigPlanet skills, because I'm loving this idea.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.560
Alright, yes, ActDeaf has the perfect name for it, LittleBigLawsuit.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560
How perfect!

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.120
What a perfect name for this whole story.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.880
Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, please change the subject.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.100
What I like to ever.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.800
How about Konami?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800
Because we like Konami!

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.480
Yeah, Konami, you know, they've had their ups and downs over the year, but you know

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.000
what, they gave us DDR, and without it we would have never met, so they'll always have

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
a place in my heart.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.600
Well, they've also given us Castlevania, or as it's known, Demon Castle Dracula.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:53.360
And now this statement put out by Dave Cox, who's an executive with Konami, is basically

01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:00.800
talking about Castlevania Lords of Shadow, and saying that it's a big departure.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:08.020
So they're a little nervous about how it's going to be received.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:17.900
It's going to be a free sort of game, as in you have a free roaming world, you can move

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.120
through different areas.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:27.080
There's also supposed to be pretty A-list voice credits added in there, too.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.340
But they're a little nervous because it's going to be a different kind of Castlevania.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.560
Wasn't this the one that had, like, Patrick Stewart in it?

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.560
Ian McClellan.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560
Oh, okay.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
Sorry.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.560
What?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560
Your mic's not on.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.560
Turn the mic on.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.560
Mic is on.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560
You know what?

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.560
Oh, okay.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.960
That was weird, you weren't picking up for some reason.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960
No.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960
Oh, weird.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960
It was the ghost.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.960
Apparently.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:51.280
You read, I'm sorry, go back to the last story, you read what the lawsuit was about, right?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.040
About the whole fact that it takes over people's lives.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.760
No, it doesn't take over people's lives.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.720
He's complaining that because the speed of which you walk or run in the game is too slow

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.520
and therefore it takes you longer to finish quests, therefore causing you to have to pay

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.560
longer and longer subscriptions in order to finish the quest in the game.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560
That was his complaint.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.460
That's even dumber than, you know, it being addicting.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.460
You know what?

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:23.160
I would almost not be, like, so pointing and laughing at this guy, again, if it weren't

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.400
for the one owner writer and Depeche Mode subpoenas because that's where you went from

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.680
just petty to batshit crazy, in my opinion.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680
And I have a right to state my opinion.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680
All right.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.680
Sorry.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.680
No, that's okay.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.280
But I want to go back to Castlevania because, you know, I'm nervous about this new Castlevania

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.400
game too because, let's face it, there hasn't been, in my opinion, a really, really, really

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.260
memorable, keyword memorable, Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:54.240
And I realize the DS ones were decent and the, above decent, they were pretty good.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.480
And you know, the PS2 one was decent, but there hasn't been one that's just been effing

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.680
awesome like the Nintendo one.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.760
Order of the Clesia was pretty freaking rad.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
I love that game.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760
I don't know.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760
Did you play it?

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.760
Yeah, a little bit.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760
A little bit.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.760
Did you play it a lot bit?

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760
Okay.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.760
A half bit.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.760
A half bit.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.260
I think that was one of the games I played when I was really sick last year, so.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.040
But I knew what you were getting at.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.440
Order of the Clesia was hard, it was actually a challenge to play.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.960
Especially if they're taking this series in a whole new direction, but at the same time,

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.880
Symphony of the Night, which is, I would easily put, in one of my top five video games of

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.440
all time, was a new direction for Castlevania.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.760
I know what will save the series.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.760
What's that?

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.760
More Richter.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.760
More Richter.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.760
Sorry.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.320
We need another Dracula X.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320
Dark Sakura?

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.320
What?

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320
You don't belong in this world.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320
Bah.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.920
Anyhow, let's move on to get some release dates, travel the world, and see what's coming

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.520
out in your neck of the woods.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
Yep.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.560
There's some stuff coming out this week, actually.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.400
The first, well I should say the last good week before the end of the year.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.680
There's a few other things coming out the rest of the year, but this is kind of the

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.440
big hurrah before the end of the year.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.800
So first thing first, we've got Avatar coming out on pretty much everything.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:15.200
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200
And this PC as well.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.440
Can I be honest with you for a minute?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.440
Yeah.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.000
Is it just me, or I am like so not interested in Avatar.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.920
Like it just doesn't look good to me.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.200
And like, you know, I'll be fair and say, you know, I realize that I'm not always into

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.360
the same type of movies everybody else is and so forth, but you know, I like Terminator.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.740
I like Titanic.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.040
I like, you know, all these movies that James Cameron's done.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040
Did you cry?

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.440
Of course I cried.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.220
But I'm looking at- I teared.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.840
I'm looking for- shut up.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.360
I'm looking at Avatar, and I'm just kind of like, oh boy.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.600
This just- it just looks bloated, long, pompous, and it doesn't look like it's going to be

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600
good to me.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.600
I'm going to go see it just because it's going to be in 3D.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.920
It's supposed to be really awesome, but then if, you know, it sucks, I'll be sure to shout

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.160
it to the world that it sucks.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.480
The game itself is supposed to be good.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.200
It's- they have been working on it for a few years at least.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.280
So it's supposed to be good and not sucky, and we'll see though.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.760
I will take my friend- if my friends all come back and say it was freaking awesome, then

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.400
I will go see it, and maybe I'm wrong, and I'll just blame the marketing.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:30.440
You know, I'm kind of with you on that because, you know, it does look kind of like it could

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.320
be lame, but you know, I'll give it a chance.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.920
I think it's going to be really cool looking.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.400
Dark Sakura just exclaimed, I love salacious pop, referring to one of our chatters.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400
Why is that?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.920
Avatar looks like Starship Troopers plus Warcraft plus The Spirits Within plus corny

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
diarrhea.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.760
That's a pretty good way to come up.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:56.920
Now this is my take on Avatar, is now, I am a big fan of fun tech, and looking into the

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.480
how they make it, you know, the behind the scenes stuff, the technology going into it,

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:09.880
the innovations that are actually being made in the CG process, in the motion capture,

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.240
that's really, really interesting to me.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.320
I'll give you that, I'll give you that.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.040
And from the technical, a lot of times, I'll go see a movie, even if it's supposed to be,

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:28.520
you know, the corn and crap, I will see it to see how the final product looks like, okay,

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.760
I do like a lot of movies that people hate, I love bad movies, I loved Hypercube, I loved

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.760
Xanadu.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760
I love Showgirls.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:42.320
I love Showgirls too, and you got me into that movie, you don't know shit.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:50.760
But no, in the end, but you also know that I don't really go for the stuff that's overhyped,

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.040
I really avoid stuff that's overhyped.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.280
But I think I'll see this one, I will see it, you know, opening week, because honestly,

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.200
I don't want to see it that bad.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.160
But I will see it after it's been in the theater for a little bit.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.600
I didn't mean to turn this into Avatar hate, I'm so sorry, but I just, I had to get that

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.580
out there, because there's just, there was just something about it that just wasn't sitting

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580
well with me.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.960
And again, maybe it's going to be an awesome movie, and I'm totally wrong, but I love some

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.560
of the comments from chat.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.320
Legend of Zaku says, Avatar equals Dances with Smurfs.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.640
That's from South Park.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640
Oh, was it?

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.640
Yeah.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.440
Oh, I didn't see this week's episode, that must be what it is.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.840
And then, that's just Joe 100 Matt saying, I heard it's getting terrible pre-screening

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.840
reviews.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.160
You know, this is the time for them to fine-tune it and tailor it and what have you, so I hope

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.320
for their sake they can pull it off.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.520
Now, I will say this, though, at the same time, I so want to go see The Princess and

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.360
the Frog, because I am all about Disney going back to the way they did movies back in the,

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.800
you know, 90s with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and all this, so, you know, just because

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.200
the movie's over-hyped doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be bad.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200
But who knows, maybe-

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.460
There's been zero hype for that movie.

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.280
Maybe it's just because I'm a Disney fan, and I'll fully admit, you know, obviously

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280
I'm biased in that regard.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.280
No, no, no.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.440
It looks good, but I'm just saying, there's been no hype, whereas Avatar, they were just

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.320
like, fucking your eyeballs, you know, in 2009, I'm like, I don't think so.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.160
You don't have kids, though, and I think they've been aiming this at the kids.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.120
I think it'll do decent.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.120
I don't think it's going to be like their huge movie, but I think it'll do decent enough

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.140
that they'll get back into doing 2D movies, we'll see.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.840
I think it'll make more than Avatar does.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.600
No, it won't.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.360
Oh, we'll see.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360
Care to make a wager?

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.400
No, I don't, but I can tell you right now it's not going to-

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400
I tried.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400
Alright, let's move on.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.880
Sorry, release dates.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880
Derailed the show.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880
My bad.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.880
Totally.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.600
Okay, so other things coming out this week.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:49.360
Rogue Warrior coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, MX vs. ATV Reflex on the

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:59.160
DS, PSP Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and god, I forgot that this movie was coming

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.720
out, and I really don't want to see this.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.000
Alvin and the Chipmunks is a squeak-quel on the Wii and DS this week.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.440
Why, god?

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440
Why?

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.520
It's got the chipettes this time.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:20.760
I'd rather- I would rather watch like Avatar for 24 hours straight or any- Oh, I know what

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.760
I was going to say.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.920
Here's the thing.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.200
When I saw the trailer for Avatar, it looked like an M. Night Shyamalan movie to me.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.720
That was what didn't sit well with me.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.800
So I would rather than watch the new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I would rather watch

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800
what was it called?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.600
The Happening or whatever that latest like that just it was so horrible.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.160
You sure you weren't watching The Last Airbender, which is an M. Night Shyamalan movie?

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.920
I would rather watch The Happening five times in a row than watch the new Alvin and Chipmunks

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.920
movie.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.320
For the record, this is actually going back to what you're saying about the Princess of

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
the Frog.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
Yes.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
It's from Becky.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
Oh, yeah?

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
Yeah.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.880
And I do have a kid and I actually haven't seen much about Princess and the Frog on Disney

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880
Channel yet.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880
Really?

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880
Really?

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.640
She's got a two-year-old who watches Phineas and Ferb, Rob.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.960
Remember, I showed you some of that.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.960
I know.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960
I know.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960
I know.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.960
And it's great.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.960
Fair enough.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.960
Fair enough.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.960
I guess fair enough.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.960
But you know what?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960
Once it does come out- Has it come out yet?

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.960
Or did it come out last Friday?

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.960
What?

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.960
The Princess and the Frog?

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.220
It's in only New York and LA.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.720
I think it's everywhere the 11th.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.720
Okay.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.440
Well, when it does come out, then yeah, their marketing blitz will be just everywhere.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.160
You won't be able to get away from it.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:33.640
Anyways, Dirt 2 on PC, the very first DirectX 11 game making its way out.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.760
Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on the DS this week.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.040
Wreck Room, a generic party game for the Wii.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:51.240
Storybook Workshop, the latest schlock from Konami coming out on the Wii.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.440
Seven Wonders 2 on the DS for your casual game fans.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.640
Safe Cracker, also casual game fans.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.440
World Party Games, yet another generic party game out on the Wii.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.320
Of course, next week we're going to have some really awesome stuff with Legend of Zelda

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.880
Spirit Tracks and Saboteur.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:14.200
All right, let's travel over to Japan and see what they've got to look forward to.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.320
And they've got on the 3rd of December, Assassin's Creed 2 gets its Japanese release.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.320
They're from Ubisoft.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.160
Also, Fallout 3 gets their Game of the Year edition, those coming out both in Japan on

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160
the 3rd.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.520
And Japan's kind of in the same place we are, where it's going to be a little bit dry through

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.240
the holiday season.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.960
They have a different kind of release pattern than they do here, so I think you'll still

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.720
see some things, but for the most part, it's going to be pretty quiet the rest of the year.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.520
But I will say on the PlayStation 3, they also get Assassin's Creed 2 over there and

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.840
Fallout 3 again.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.220
They're also getting some discounts on Folklore, moving into the PlayStation 3 the best, or

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.720
as they call it there, Folk's Soul, and Ratchet and Clank's future, as well as Resistance

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.720
Fall of Man.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.960
They're all going into the best series over in Japan, so if you live over there, you can

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.760
get a price reduction on that.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.560
On the Nintendo Wii, this December, you can get Biohazard and Biohazard Zero.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.160
That's of course what they call Resident Evil over there.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.040
Those are also getting price reductions on the Wii.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.960
Lots of price reductions is kind of the theme here, but that's a good thing going into this

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.360
holiday season.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:17.080
Also in Japan on December 3rd, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, yeah, they had to wait.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.600
So they're getting it this week, though, on December 3rd.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:24.020
Sengoku Musou 3 comes out on the Wii as well.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.080
That's from Koei Entertainment.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.160
That is, I believe, another one of their strategy-type games.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.640
That's one of the, I think, Romance of the Three Kingdoms ones?

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.440
Yeah, well, Koei did all of those games, and I'm pretty sure this is right in that same

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440
vein.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.280
You know, those games are way more popular over there than they are here, although I

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.320
will say the game certainly is not without its fans over here.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:53.400
On the Nintendo DS, Cross Treasures, you can get that out there from Squeenix.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.160
Also coming out, Kaiju Busters, and Kira...

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
Monsters?

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.200
Yes, Kaiju Big Brawl.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200
Is it really?

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200
I think it is.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:08.760
Kira Kira Rhythm Collection comes out as well, and Metal Fight Beyblade comes out from Hudson.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760
So check that out.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.680
It's a big release for stuff on the DS.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.680
There's lots and lots of games.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.700
Signal coming out on the DS as well from D3 over in Japan.

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:21.200
And then lastly, going over to the PSP, seeing if there's anything to look forward to there.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:26.000
Oh, LittleBigPlanet Portable gets its release in Japan this week, as well as Mobile Suit

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.960
Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.600
Ooh, that sounds fun.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.880
And also, this one might be worth importing to some people, Phantasy Star Portable 2 comes

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880
out this week.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880
Ooh.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.880
Oh, and Jamie?

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880
What?

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.320
Tokimeki Memorial 4 on the PSP this week.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.520
No Toki memo for me, please.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520
There you go.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520
How about you, K?

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.360
Someone in Japan, send me President Cat.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360
How about the UK?

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360
Okay.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.680
Not really a whole lot.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.980
On the 4th, we have Colin McRae Dirt 2, like anyone cares.

01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:00.280
We have Easy Piano for DS.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.480
And then we have Avatar The Game.

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.480
And The Saboteur.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.920
Oh, and Tony Hawk Ride, but who plays Tony Hawk anymore?

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.240
How is the ride doing out of curiosity?

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.240
Not good.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240
No?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240
I heard it was not.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.040
Yeah, I heard it wasn't doing too well.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.040
I could have called that.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.040
Oh, wait, I did.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040
Yes.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.040
Sure.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.040
It looked like crap.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040
I'm sorry.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.120
It's just like, it's a mediocre reboot to the franchise.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.680
Just go back to what you did well in Pro Skater and just keep pumping those out.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.320
I mean, I don't care how unrealistic it is, I want to grind on the moon or something like

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.320
that.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320
I mean, that would be awesome.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.680
There was a comment from Chad, did we miss Final Fantasy 13 in the release date?

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.800
You know what, it's very possible because I believe that's releasing on a day all its

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.800
own, right?

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.320
And I was only looking at the December 3rd dates.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.840
When is Final Fantasy 13 out in Japan?

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.840
I don't remember.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840
I know it's out in December.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.840
Let me look up.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.840
I'm looking up its release date real quick to see if I did miss it for this week.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.680
Why don't we get into the next story?

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.680
I'll come back to that.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.680
Okay.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.680
Okay.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.680
So...

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.680
December 17th.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.680
There you go.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.680
So we still have a couple weeks.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.320
Weighs off.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.640
I don't know why you play this game other than for charity, and that's what's been done

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.520
on the Desert Bus for Charity, an annual event where they play the horrible, horrible game

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:24.280
that's part of the Penn & Teller game, and they have raised over $100,000.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:34.720
In fact, they have raised $132,568.94, which is 88% over last year's total, and this is

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:42.640
a marathon that's a project of the, I guess, a comedy troupe Load Ready Run, and of course

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.320
this benefits the Child's Play charity.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320
That's kinda cool.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:59.760
And apparently 88 hours of driving booked by the pre-event donations.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.120
But now it's not just one guy that has to do the whole thing, right?

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.160
They kinda, it's like a comedy, people do the whole thing.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.240
I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to tune into the whole thing, although I read

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.280
about it and I thought it was cool, but you know, there's lots and lots of Child's Play

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.840
events going on, including Um Wild's coming up, you know, we had SEGA on the show a couple

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:22.040
weeks ago, and that's coming up, God, it's not next week, but the week after, it's coming

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.240
up around soon, but certainly try to support Child's Play wherever you can.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.760
I know we also made a donation as a show to another drive that was going on earlier.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:35.480
It wasn't for Child's Play, but for a hospital in Texas, so good stuff.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.120
What do we do in our charity marathon?

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.240
When we have a day off that isn't-

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.760
I'm not playing that game, though, that's for sure.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.160
No, no, we won't play that game, but we gotta do our own spin on charity marathon, find

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160
a good charity.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.520
We still need to do the classic game stuff.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.800
Dan and I were talking about busting out the Master System today.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.340
That's what I'm saying, we need to do our classic game marathon for charity, where we

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.520
let like, donators pick the games or something.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:03.880
Well, here's what I think we should do for that, is I pick like, six or seven of my systems

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:10.640
that'll be easy to shift out or whatever, and then put up a list of like, twelve games

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.800
each.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.800
So someone can say, you know, spin a wheel, you get like a twister wheel, okay, you get

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.120
this system, and then spin a wheel again for the number on the list, and then oh, you get

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.800
this game, you know, make it all completely random, and go, new game, move, next seat,

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800
move down.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.560
You know, so you kind of like musical chairs, but with games.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:37.000
Well, like, you know, the Mad Hatter, new cup, move down, new game, move down.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.440
Sadly, you know, usually what would be a great weekend for me is Martin Luther King weekend,

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.240
because I have a holiday there, I don't know if you guys do.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.240
I do.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.000
I mean, Jamie works for a bank, so she has everything off, but sadly, I'm going to Seattle

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
that weekend.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I have Arbor Day off.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
No, I don't.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Arbor Day?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I'm kidding.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.200
So you can go out and plant a tree, like John Denver told us to, I mean, is that what you're

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200
doing?

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200
Well, John Denver also, you know, flew a plane.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.080
Said he was leaving on a jet plane, and he did.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080
That was so awful.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.280
I mean, I love it, but it was really awful.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.640
It was definitely, like, when they say tragic irony, I think that's exactly what they meant.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.680
It wasn't really a jet plane, it was a little prop plane, wasn't it?

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.680
Whatever.

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.760
If he had been leaving on a jet plane, he probably wouldn't have crashed.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760
Alright, let's move on.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.880
Now we're making John Denver jokes.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.880
I don't know.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.880
You started it.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:25.880
Uh-uh.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880
You're, you're, whatever.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.280
Alright, hey, every week here on the show, we like to do a little segment here pretty

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280
regularly.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.520
We've done it for, gosh, over a year now.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.560
It used to be, like, the website of the week, then it turned into, like, the Dark Soccer's

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.360
Advice column, and now it's the classic game of the week.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.200
I kind of miss doing the website of the week, though.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.320
I do kind of miss it, too, but this is really, this is way more fun.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.280
Well, if I was going to do another one, though, I'd do Weebles again, can make that a third

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.280
time.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.080
I'm sorry, I love Weebles.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.920
So moving on, it's now the classic video game of the week, where Dark Sakura digs through

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.720
the classic game archive she was previously speaking of, and picks out a game that she

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.720
says, you know what?

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.160
The kids need to play this game.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.460
They need to respect their elders, and they need to dust off their NESs, or whatever it

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.800
happens to be, and go play this game.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.000
So Dark Sakura, what is the game that, uh, is the classic game of the week?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.780
A game that pisses me off sometimes.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.880
Little Nemo Dream Master.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.440
It's a cute game, but it pisses me off.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.440
Why does it piss you off?

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.040
It's kind of hard.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040
I mean, kind of hard.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.640
I mean, it's got some levels that are easy, it's just you have to be kind of tricky and

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.640
know your way around.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:32.560
But, the music, though, I have to say, um, was actually composed by, um, Junko Tomie,

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.640
who was in the game as Gonzo.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:45.800
I always laughed at that, now I know her name, but play a little bit of the music.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800
Isn't that good music?

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.800
Yeah, but it's very Capcom.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:56.560
One thing about Junko Tomie is that she also did the music in Bionic Commando, and, um,

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:05.600
in uh, Strider, actually, so, uh, those are two notable games that had fantastic music.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.840
Oh, and, uh, Gunsmoke.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:19.800
But um, back to Little Nemo, in Japan it was called Pajama Hero Nemo, which is pretty cute.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:25.480
It's actually based off of the Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland, the animated movie,

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:31.880
actually, that came out based off of the comic strip from the early, I believe the original

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.700
comic strip came out in, I want to say, the 1920s?

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.760
I've seen, actually, an original compilation of the Little Nemo books.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.560
Okay, no, sorry, I take that back, 1905 was when the, um, the comic series first started

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:52.640
in 1905, and then went on through, um, 1914.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.680
The books that I saw were published in the 1920s.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.520
Anyway, that's another thing, because you know me and book publishing, I'm all into

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.520
that.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:09.000
So, going back to this, um, it's about a little boy who, um, goes into his magical dream world

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.760
called Slumberland, and he can, um, actually, uh, ride little animals, and he, what you

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.920
do is you actually, uh, feed them candy, and then they will, uh, let you ride them.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.520
Like, you actually not necessarily ride them, but you sort of become them a little bit,

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.880
like, you wear them like a, like Mario's, um, Tanooki suit.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.920
That's a good, a good description.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:37.600
I have to be honest, Jamie, I, I remember hearing about this game when I was a kid,

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.200
like, I think I saw the commercials, but I never played it.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.640
So now that I'm kind of watching the video here that the music's coming off of, you know,

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:47.120
it's kind of interesting, like, it definitely has that whole, like, the different suits

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.160
of Mario, but it's different.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.360
Like, I can't explain it, you just kind of have to play it yourself, I guess, or check

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360
out one of the videos of it.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.680
Like, you know, right now he's kind of riding a dinosaur, which kind of reminds me of something

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.680
in Adventure Island.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.600
I love, I love the dinosaur, but see, now you, for certain abilities that you get with

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:06.280
some suits or some animals, you lose other, like, for example, you see, he could, like,

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.760
for example, the frog or, I think it's either a frog or a dragon or something, but he can

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:19.920
do, like, a belly sla-, uh, like a belly splash move, and land on them, and, um, and he, if

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.640
his belly lands on the creatures, then he can actually knock them out of the sky, you

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.840
know, to damage, um, I think that's the creature on the thing.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.360
Yeah, it looks like a little, like, kind of gecko-looking thing.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.840
Yeah, but he can, he can pop them.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:38.080
Um, but, like, you can get a mole and you can dig or you can get a gorilla and punch

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.840
them, or climb up the walls.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.800
The purple little lizard thing, I think it's like a, a salamander or something, but it

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:49.080
can walk up walls, you know, like a lizard can.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:55.360
Um, but it is a side-scrolling, um, you know, it's an NES title, it's, you know, really

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.760
cute, it actually has some pretty big levels.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.560
The whole way that you get through it is you actually find these keys, and, um, the keys

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.120
unlock a certain number of locks on the door, and so, of course, if you get to the end of

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.360
the level and you don't have all the keys, you have to go back through the level and

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360
find the keys.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360
Oh, good lord.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.760
And, and, as you were watching some of this, they actually are hidden, like, you had to

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.280
actually, in the first level, if you get the mole, you actually have to go all the way

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:28.720
over as far as you can through the dirt to the left and then go down through the floor

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:35.720
to where two, uh, little blocks of, uh, of, uh, area that you can dig through to get underneath

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:40.840
to another place where you get the key and a one-up and some other crap.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:51.960
Um, so, uh, you have to have the right animals to get to some places, but if you don't really

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:58.880
have, you know, everything, and on top of that, um, your animals have different life

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:04.120
bars than Nemo does, so sometimes you have to, you know, really be judicious with what

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.960
you have to make it through.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:12.000
So actually, it's, I'd have to say it's one of the harder NES games there are, and it's

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.540
a cute game.

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:16.480
You know what this game kind of reminds me of, just kind of looking at it, again, you

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.480
know, I, I missed this game, maybe I need to go back and play this, it's my classic

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.760
game of the week, it reminds me, and again, it's probably because they're both Capcom,

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:26.680
but the skeleton of the game and the programming looks very similar to DuckTales to me.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.300
Oh yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.440
Just the graphics and the way it's kind of laid out looks like, you know, same engine,

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.720
quote unquote, if you want to say, as DuckTales.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:41.960
Yeah, I would, I would, I would go that, but, um, in, again, like you said, it was released

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:47.400
by Capcom, the year that it came out was in 1990, so I was actually just starting high

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.400
school.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400
Yeah, I know.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.400
Actually, no, no, I was in eighth grade.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.880
Yeah, no, you would graduate eighth grade.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:04.200
And I remember having a fit over this game, I had it, um, when it came out, and I would

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.760
just, I don't think, I think this is actually one game to this day I haven't beaten.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:13.480
So that's an indication, and I've beaten a lot of games.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.760
Once again, Jamie, a very popular pick in our chat room, at least those that have played

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.480
it, but a lot of folks agreeing with you on the difficulty that it was a bitch.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:25.840
I agree with, um, Ricky Go Mac that, um, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES,

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.040
that game was freaking difficult too.

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.920
That game pissed me off to the point that I wanted to throw it down the stairs, and

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.400
I did, and actually it lived through it, and I could still play it.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.360
Um, that was actually one game I had that was duct taped.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.360
Nice.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.760
So you'll have to do that another week.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.240
That's a different game altogether.

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.600
No, that game is not going to make it on my list.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.600
That game is not going to make it on my list, because to this day, I'm still angry.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.120
Angry, Rob, angry.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.680
I'm thinking one day we need to do the anti-classic game of the week, the game that Dark Saga

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.680
says, do not play this game, it's terrible.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.960
I could tell you what that is right now, I'll go ahead and mention it right now.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.520
I guess we're done with Little Nemo then?

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520
Yeah.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.680
Okay, Little Nemo, the Dream Master, your classic game of the week on the NES, there

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680
you go.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.480
There's a game that is so bad that Dan and I rented it from Blockbuster, because we were

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.440
really into renting games every week, this was about right before the Dreamcast came

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.440
out.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.480
So, around 98, 99.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:27.400
Um, we rented, we were also into wrestling games at the time, because, um, the, uh, Wrestle

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:32.240
Mania 2000 came out on the Nintendo 64, which was rad.

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:42.640
We, um, got, uh, NW Thunder, and, um, we got it home, we played it for about 10 minutes

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.640
and called Blockbuster and said, we just rented this game about, uh, 30 minutes ago, because

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.560
you know we had to drive back, um, we think, we want, we want our money back, or can we

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.300
rent it, can we change it out for something else?

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:58.560
And we went in there, and the guy's like, oh yeah, I remember you, if it's that bad,

01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.660
then yeah, we'll change it out.

01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.040
It was so bad that Blockbuster let us change out our rental.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.040
And that's, well, that's just good customer service, you know, too.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040
But, but it was, it was-

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.480
They probably, probably wasn't the first time they clapped.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.760
I kept Spice World longer than that game, Rob.

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.760
I loved Spice World.

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.880
And yes, I rented Spice World.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.680
There was some lulzy moments in Spice World.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.360
You just make baby Spice do backflips over and over, it's really funny.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:29.080
I've bought games that are arguably bad games, and I liked them better than, than that game.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.360
That's probably the worst game I've ever rented.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.600
I would say the worst video game experience I've ever had, since now we've started this

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.800
new topic, and Loki, I'm coming to you next, the worst video game experience I've probably

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.960
ever had was when I got, um, Tetris Plus on the Playstation 1.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:50.280
What a colossal let down that game was, because Tetris was so huge at the time, you know,

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.320
especially on the NES, and I think everybody very fondly remembers that game, and it's

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.840
been done very well on many platforms.

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.500
The DS has an awesome version of Tetris.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.600
Even Tengen Tetris is pretty good and kind of reminiscent of the arcade version, but

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.560
I'll tell you what, Tetris Plus, which was by, and I remember to this day, Jellico, did

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.200
it on the Playstation 1, and it is horrific.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.600
It is bad, it is terrible, because they changed the game mechanic of Tetris.

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.960
It was one of those things where I spent, like, I bought it, because I was like, oh,

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.840
it's Tetris, how can it be bad?

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.840
I hated it.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.420
I played it once, and I said, how can you fuck with the main game mechanic of Tetris?

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.440
Because what they did, is they changed it so it was like a little professor that would

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.720
walk along the top, and you didn't want him to hit the side.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:28.720
I remember that!

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.720
Oh my god, that was awful!

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.720
Yes.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.720
It was a terrible, terrible game.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.720
That was hideous!

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.840
Yes.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:36.840
Thank you.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.840
I'm not alone.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.840
You know what?

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840
That deserves, um...

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.960
Yeah, I need to, I need to fire up the Price is Right losing horn.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.960
Alright.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960
Or a Dalek.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.720
Yeah, that game is an enemy of the Daleks.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.400
Loki, traumatically bad video game experience, anything you can remember?

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.400
Not really.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.400
Um...

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.400
No.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.160
There's not really anything horribly bad that I played.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.400
I always used to find some sort of good out of it, I guess.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.080
Well, aren't you just like the Mother Teresa of video games?

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.080
I don't know.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.920
Um, there was a game, though it's not that old, that I bought and then sold back like

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.680
within a day, and that would be Bullet Witch, because that game is awful.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680
I have another bad game.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.720
Okay, one more, and then we're gonna go to break.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.080
Dragon Ball GT Final Battle, actually.

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.400
What was so terrible about that?

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.400
Everything.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.920
Um, I was, okay, keep in mind, it was like the first Dragon Ball game that came out in

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.840
the US, unless you want to count, um, what the Dragon Ball RPG that they made into something

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:42.920
else over here, which doesn't count, um, it was, it had the awful, awful American voice

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.320
acting, and it was just hideous.

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.240
But the one problem with that game is that I didn't realize it until a little bit later,

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.280
that because it was out of print, and they only made a few copies, that that game was

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.640
going for bucks on eBay, and you know what I did?

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.240
I traded it for Blue Stinger.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.840
The Japanese version, because I had the Japanese Dreamcast at the time.

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.920
And honestly, to this day, I still never regret it.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:07.920
Never regret it.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.000
I mean, it would have been nice to have gotten some money out of it, but I still don't regret

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
the trade.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.360
I loved Blue Stinger.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.520
Isn't that Twinbee or something?

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.720
No, Stinger was Twinbee.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:24.360
Blue Stinger was the game that came out, the Japanese version of that one was sort of lauded

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:31.960
because it had, um, a movie director directing the cameras and cinematics in the movie, not

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.800
in the movie, in the game, but when it came out over here, they butchered the camera.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.280
Because people were like, oh, you can't control it, and I did just fine.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:43.200
It was a little kind of survival horror type of game, but it was a lot of fun.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.200
I loved it.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.200
All right.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.200
Well, we're going to take a break, guys.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.400
We're going to rest our voices here a minute and, you know, refill our waters and run to

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.520
the restroom and all that good stuff, but when we come back on Orange Lounge Radio,

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.040
we're going to get into Part B. We've got plenty more news for you guys tonight, a lot

01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.000
of rapid-fire news, including some updates on Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2, and so

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
forth.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And then we're going to get into some other stories.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.920
We're going to talk Tron in Part B. I know, so definitely stay tuned for that.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.600
Does that mean when we start Part B, I can just go greetings programs?

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.080
If you really want to, and at the end, you can say end of line.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.960
In fact, at the very end of tonight's show, I want you to say end of line.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960
Okay?

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960
Can we do that?

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.960
Yeah.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:20.960
Like after the credits and everything?

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.960
Yeah.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.960
End of line.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.960
We should do it before the credits.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.960
All right.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960
Fine.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:26.960
We'll do it that way.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960
All right.

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.960
And a proper sequel to Puzzle Quest.

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960
Not Galactrix, but something else.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:30.960
We're going to talk all that in Part B.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960
So stay tuned, guys.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:40.640
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.880
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.240
We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 29th of 2009.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.880
We hope all our listeners here in America had a great Thanksgiving holiday.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.960
And if you decided to brave the Black Friday shopping, then props to you guys.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.760
I know our interviewer earlier tonight, he talked about going out to the old Navy to

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.480
get the copy of Lego Rock Band, so I know some of you guys went out there.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:07.520
By the way, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.760
where there's lots of great programming all throughout the week.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:13.640
Check out the buffet of great game programming they have here.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.640
And you know what?

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.820
And I always say, if OLR you're finding the show just isn't your taste, hey, no harm done.

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:23.080
But there might be a show that is more your taste throughout the various independent podcasters

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.120
that broadcast over there at All Games Radio.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.120
So check it out.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.280
We're going to move on and get into some of the rapid fire news tonight.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.720
And then we'll move into Twitter topics right after that, for those of you guys who asked

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.320
us questions on Twitter.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.160
And then we got some more gaming news.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.280
So Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid fire news?

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.680
Red Dead Redemption, Take-Two's brand new game coming out, kind of think of Grand Theft

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:50.740
Auto in the Old West, is set to come out actually in April 2010.

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:58.040
And funny enough, on the same day as Grand Theft Auto 4 did a few years ago, April 27th,

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:05.000
2010 is when you can expect that game to hit PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
That's pretty sweet.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I'm looking to play that.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.640
Especially since you can probably mod this game just like you can with Grand Theft Auto,

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.600
drive around in a car or something.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:21.240
Uncharted 2 is getting some new download content for the price of free.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.820
And that actually happened last Friday.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:30.520
And it looks like a brand new map called The Fort.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:37.800
And it's a fortress multiplayer map from a chapter of Drake's Fortune.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.440
That's kind of neat.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.640
Well may The Fort be with you.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.640
Yes.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.640
And it's free.

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.480
It can't be free.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:51.440
And then finally, Valve is selling some Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead themed greeting

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.080
cards.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.880
And those look kind of cool.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.440
I wonder if those are actual greeting cards or if they're like e-cards or something like

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.840
that.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.520
Actually they are real cards.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:13.040
So you can actually pick those up at the Valve Software Store at store.valvesoftware.com

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.040
and check them out.

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.400
They are a little pricey.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.600
Looks like 16 bucks.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.200
And I'm not sure how many get in that.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.640
But there's a lot of other neat stuff in there as well.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.120
How many portal jokes in the Christmas cards?

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.120
None.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.120
Really?

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.120
Zero portal jokes.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.120
Okay.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.120
Alright.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.840
Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news I have for you guys.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.680
There's a whole lot of Rock Band news going on.

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.360
There usually is because every week they try to add something new.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.680
And this week there's more Nirvana coming to the 360 Wii and PS3.

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.580
Come As You Are, the MTV Unplugged version, which I think is kind of interesting, is coming

01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:54.240
out for Rock Band as well as Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit, finally, all in Nirvana

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.900
Pack 2.

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:57.560
Also the band Night Ranger.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.320
You can still rock in America.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.360
Don't Tell Me You Love Me and you're going to hear it from me.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.360
Night Ranger.

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.360
Yeah.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.360
You're going to hear it from me.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.360
Hey.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.240
The member of Night Ranger was in Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.240
Wow.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.240
Wow.

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:18.000
The Rock Band platform, by the way, now has over 1,000 songs, 390 different musical artists.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.080
Apparently we have collectively downloaded over 60 million songs from the Rock Band store.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.200
Somebody's making a shitload of money.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:29.480
105 consecutive weeks of new additions to the store.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:31.280
Hey, that's pretty impressive.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.060
And they actually did some math and figured out that if you wanted to play through the

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:39.240
entire catalog, that would take two days, 18 hours, and 40 minutes to play through the

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.320
entire catalog, which I think I wanted to read some.

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.560
I thought I read somewhere some guy was doing for charity.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.560
Yeah.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.360
I saw the whole damn catalog.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.360
Good luck to you.

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.680
Try not to fail on some of those hard songs.

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:55.720
Also the Rock Band Network is being announced that it will finally fully roll out in early

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720
2010.

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.600
You might remember that this is a XNA of sorts.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.820
I guess that's the best comparison I can make to it so that anybody could get their songs

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.920
in Rock Band through the Rock Band Network.

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.880
And apparently this is going to roll out in 2010.

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.720
So that 1,000 is going to jump up to 2,000 pretty damn quickly when this thing is released.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.720
Very interesting.

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.800
Switching gears here a little bit, Atari is now rolling out arcade games on their web

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800
page.

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.440
What I mean by that, if you want to go play Yars' Revenge or other great 2,600 games and

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.680
things that Atari was known for back in the day before they made Driver 3 and all this

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.920
stuff, you can head on over to Atari.com.

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.920
It's a brand new website.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.280
Looks like it also tracks high scores and things like that.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.960
Kind of what GameTap was doing back when they were really good.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.480
Oh, by the way, the games you can play there on Atari, you can play Asteroids, Adventure,

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.800
Battlezone, Crystal Castles, Lunar Lander, and yes, Yars' Revenge.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.800
There you go.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.840
By the way, I used to love Crystal Castles.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.640
That was the best game ever.

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640
Good stuff.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.280
I didn't like the Atari 2,600 version though, nearly as much as the arcade.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280
I know.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.840
I think you'll like it for one thing.

01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:00.120
We've got a trackball.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.400
That's the way it's meant to be played.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.600
We've got a 2,600 trackball.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.880
Lastly, some game controller Christmas tree ornaments are available.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:13.040
I guess they're making their way around the different game blogs.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:17.200
You can get them, it looks like, at ponoko.com, P-O-N-O-K-O dot com.

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:21.280
It's $25 plus $10 for shipping or more if it's somewhere else.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.200
You can get some various game controller themed.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.840
It looks like there's an old school NES controller and a Wiimote, Dreamcast controller, gettin'

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.240
the love, and of course, where would you be without a DualShock controller?

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.600
All of that is there in the game controller Christmas tree for those of you that are gonna

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.600
be decorating.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.200
DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.200
Stuff.

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:43.880
Actually, I've got good stuff.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:52.840
Well, kind of good stuff because there actually is a statement by Harada Katsuhiro, who is

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:58.200
the producer behind Tekken 6, say that there's gonna have more content on its way, download

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:06.480
content, but that they're not going to charge for it or they don't intend to charge for

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.480
it.

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:15.000
There could be, and this is a quote, strong possibility of additional download content.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.520
But then again, they've said that before and have kind of lied.

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.520
That's true.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:22.520
Didn't they say like, oh no.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.800
We didn't put Darth Vader in the Xbox Soul Calibur.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.760
Oh no, we didn't do that.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.760
Guess what?

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.760
Psych.

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:29.760
Duh, duh, duh.

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.760
Right.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.760
Okay.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.680
Well also, about the games convention online, you remember that?

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.640
They're doing another.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.520
And it will be from July 8th through 11th, 2010 at the Leibseger Messe in Germany.

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.080
I hope I pronounced that right.

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.880
I took German for two weeks, sorry.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:55.720
But they got 43,000 attendees last year, so they're hoping that with another day they

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.000
can get more.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.440
So hey, good for them.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:05.360
And lastly, and this is something I'm pretty happy about, Bayonetta demo.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.040
We should be getting it in Europe and North America on December 3rd.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.960
And that will be freaking fantastic.

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.280
Little Birdie told me you can get it early if you know where to look.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.280
Really?

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.960
I think it was through gamespot.com, if you're like a member over there, you can get a code

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.360
generated, something like that, for the demo.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.580
I haven't had a chance to check it out myself, because again, I got a BORT 360 that I've

01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:29.580
been too lazy to replace.

01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:35.320
See, this, folks, is why you need to create a Japanese region account, so that you can

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:41.840
download these region-free demos to your, you know, 360 or Playstation 3 way early.

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.520
I have one for every region on the Playstation 3, and I have one for Japanese in the US and

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.400
my 360.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.400
Just putting it out there.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.240
Anyhow, let's move on to some Twitter topics, and some things that you guys are asking us

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:53.240
on the Twitter.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.840
Of course, if you don't already have us on Twitter, you should really consider adding

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840
us.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:01.520
www.Twitter.com slash OLR, and we always take messages before every show, starting off with

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.440
Spazinator tonight.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:07.640
How about a discussion of some of the better PC exclusives out there?

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.580
Must Owns, for example, Recommendations.

01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:14.120
With me getting a PC not too long from now, I'd like to know what to get above and beyond

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.120
WoW.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.360
Bummer, because WoW would have been the first thing I suggested it would be, but, you know,

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.800
a lot of MMOs, we haven't really seen console MMOs.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.040
Granted, Final Fantasy XI, I know the PS3 has some in development.

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.720
This spring, there's going to be a lot of stuff in the spring, supposedly, unless it,

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.600
you know, gets delayed again.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.760
But right now, you know, the Guild Wars, the City of Heroes, the Ion, the Champions, the

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.240
Star Trek Online, none of those are on the console, nor are they going to be on the console.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.960
So, you know, all those types of MMOs.

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.720
Just a lot of stuff in the pipes, just not quite out yet.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.840
Loki, anything you can think of as far as PC games, though?

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.320
As far as PC MMOs?

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.400
No, just PC games in general that are exclusive that you can't get on the console.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.600
Command and Conquer 4, I think, is going to be exclusively on PC at first, at least.

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.360
I'm not positive on that, but I know that's coming out in the fall, and I haven't heard

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.160
about a console version yet.

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.760
X-Link suggests Civilization 4, and I give that a hell yes.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.760
The Civilization series is outstanding, and they did do, like, kind of a dumbed-down version

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.480
of Civilization called Civ Revolution for the Xbox 360 and PS3, although I will say

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.040
Civ Revolution I liked.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.440
It kind of reminded me of the very first Civilization game, so when I say dumbed-down, I don't mean

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.880
that in a negative way.

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.820
If you like that game, definitely Civ 4.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:35.960
That's a great suggestion from X-Link in our chat room, so.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.880
Let's move on to some other questions.

01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.440
I like this one from Fernando on Twitter, and this is a good one for Loki.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:47.920
Will there ever be an installment of Grand Theft Auto where you play a female, and would

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.000
it sell?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:57.960
I think it would, and I hope there is, because hell, they've done it with Saints Row, where

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:04.320
you can play as a female character throughout that game, and it works pretty well.

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.160
You may remember before when people were putting out fake screenshots for Grand Theft Auto

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.400
4, it had a female wheeling a mace, and that looked pretty awesome.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.720
I don't see why it couldn't happen.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.200
Yeah, I don't see why not either.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.720
I think it's just as long as they can work it into the story, so maybe in the next one,

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.720
who knows?

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:20.720
Yeah.

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.720
Or a future expansion for 4, although, or are they going to say no more?

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.880
They're not going to do any more expansions for 4.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.560
If anything, what they're going to do now is, like, a Vice City or something like that

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.480
using the same engine, but just slightly tweaked, but they have Red Dead Redemption that they're

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.720
going to put out first and probably tweak their engine a little bit more.

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:40.680
If you want to see that, dude, I would say email them, but you know what I got to say?

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:46.200
I think Rockstar's been pretty decent about kind of an equal opportunity, if you will.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:50.280
I'm sure they're about the story and the art they're trying to go for first, and if they

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:54.520
can work it in for a female protagonist, they will.

01:51:54.520 --> 01:52:03.840
Moving on, let's see, looking at this one from Tigerclaw, Nathan Drake gets supersized

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.640
for Thanksgiving weekend and sends us this over.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:13.640
Apparently, the Uncharted developers made Nathan Drake look fat during Thanksgiving.

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:14.640
That's kind of funny.

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.300
They made him gain a few pounds there.

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.200
Was that something that was actually in the game, or is that just screenshots?

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.120
No, I guess that's just something they rendered, those screenshots.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.920
That wasn't actually in the game, or what have you.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:27.120
That would be funny, like if you played it on Thanksgiving, that would happen.

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.240
That would be kind of funny, actually.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.600
So that's pretty cool.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.840
Yeah, it's just the screenshots there on the website.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.840
That's kind of funny.

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.240
Sorry if we didn't read your tweets tonight, but remember, you can always email us too

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.240
at mailbagatorangelandtrady.com.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.360
We'll be getting into the mailbag a little later in the show, and Tigerclaw wants to

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.500
point out it's for multiplayer.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.500
So that's kind of funny.

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.500
I like that.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:48.500
That's awesome.

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.500
Yeah, that's cute.

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.720
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.200
Loki, back to you.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200
Yes.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:53:02.680
So, Obama and apparently the LittleBigPlanet team are teaming up for kids, and the White

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:06.240
House, they basically announced that they're going to have a program to improve science

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:11.040
and math education with a variety of different entertainment software association-backed

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:19.440
initiatives, including a program to put LittleBigPlanet in libraries, as well as $300,000 in game design

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.440
challenges.

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440
So that's kind of cool.

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:27.120
And, I mean, hell, LittleBigPlanet, very flexible with what you can do with it, and it's supposedly

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.280
pretty easy to learn.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.000
I still haven't actually sat down to try and make a level, even though I really wanted

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
to.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
It's fucking hard.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Like, it takes a lot of dedication.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.120
It's just because we're older.

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.120
That's why.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120
Maybe.

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.120
Maybe.

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:43.120
But that's why, you know, I invited the gentleman on the show earlier tonight, because I know

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:45.480
it's not easy to have that kind of dedication.

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:49.520
I thought it was kind of awesome, and then, you know, to have it all take off, and so

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.520
forth.

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:58.720
But anyway, he said, you know, the Sony LittleBigPlanet initiative, Game Changers, is part of a $2

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:05.400
million 2010 digital media and learning competition funded by the MacArthur Foundation, and involves

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:10.120
Sony donating 1,000 PlayStation 3s and copies of LittleBigPlanet to libraries and community

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.120
organizations.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.800
Participants will strive to create levels that involve science, technology, engineering,

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:20.760
and math, well, engineering, health, physics, and LittleBigPlanet.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:27.640
The second program is called the STEM Nation Video Game Competition, and it's a three-pronged

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:34.240
$300,000 contest encouraging entrants to create the best browser video games that teach the

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:41.880
STEM disciplines for a trio of ages 4-8, 8-12, and 12-16, and the competitions intend to

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:47.180
reach historically underserved populations, including girls and minority students, according

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.840
to the ESA press release.

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.320
So that's kind of neat.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.620
Kind of interesting, and this whole, especially the whole fact that video games usually get

01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:58.620
a bad rap.

01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:02.200
In fact, ironically, and I swear I didn't plan this, I'm wearing my ECA shirt today,

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:06.200
the whole, with the controllers on it, that says, contrary to popular opinion, these do

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.200
not make me a killer.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.080
And you know, video games get such a bad rap usually out there that, you know, games like,

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.840
you know, Manhunt 2 are going to turn us all into murderers and all this garbage.

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.600
And if I remember correctly, the unedited, unrated PC version came out, and the world

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:22.600
did not end.

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.160
Yeah, it really didn't.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:28.200
And so, you know, it's kind of neat to see video games kind of being embraced in this

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200
regard.

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.640
So, do you think this is something that people will actually really get into, and it could

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:34.720
be a successful program?

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.720
I don't see why it can't be.

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:41.640
I mean, hell, we had, we grew up on kind of like, um, Oregon Trail and like, Number Munchers

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:42.640
and shit like that.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:45.200
It's just, you know, kind of an evolved version of that.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:51.960
I remember we had, um, in my fourth or fifth grade class, you know, back when, you know,

01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:59.200
they're introducing us to a thing called a mouse for, you know, a PC, um, you know, they

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.720
would, you know, have a program that kind of taught you how to use it and stuff like

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:03.720
that.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.680
And that's why they wouldn't do something like this where, you know, challenge people

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.560
to kind of learn how to use computers and learn how to, you know, build stuff in video

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.840
games and whatnot, um, to kind of help promote education and, you know, their agendas with

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.840
the science and, um, math programs.

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.360
So it sounds like a good idea to me.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:27.920
It's a way to, you know, reach children at a level that they're, you know, going to be

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:28.920
interested in.

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.200
We'll see how this program takes off.

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.240
I do like the comparison to Oregon Trail and Number Bunchers though, because who doesn't

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.200
remember that shit from when we were kids?

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.840
And I know, I realize a lot of our listeners may not have that same memory, although I

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.680
think the Oregon Trail kind of evolved.

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.160
So I think they were still using it, you know, years later, but just not the old school Apple

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:49.740
2e one that we were using.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:50.740
But uh, you know, yeah.

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:51.880
Carmen Sandiego is another great example.

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.800
I think Math Blasters was one that came around a little later.

01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:55.800
Turtle.

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:56.800
Uh, Logo.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.800
Logo.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:58.800
The programming language.

01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.800
Yeah.

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800
Right?

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.800
Forward 30.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.800
Right?

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:03.800
90.

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:06.200
And you know, to draw a square and all that stuff.

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.200
Fun stuff.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200
Hey Jamie.

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.200
Tron.

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.200
Tron!

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.200
That's right.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.400
If you want to see more information about Tron, you're going to have to watch the VGAs.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.400
That's right.

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.880
The Spike Video Game Awards apparently is going to have some new Tron information here.

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.440
Uh, I guess this is not about the movie.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.440
This is about the game.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.840
The game based on the movie I think.

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:27.840
Apparently.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840
Yeah.

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840
The game that's based on the new movie.

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.440
There was a little teaser that went up and it looks like the game might actually just

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.720
be called Tron.

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.880
You might remember they tried relaunching Tron a couple years ago.

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:40.960
There was a Tron 2.0 video game I remember that came out.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:42.200
This was pretty awesome.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.920
It was pretty cool but it was also uh, it didn't do very well at all.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.160
Which is kind of unfortunate.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.480
Um, but yeah.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.760
Uh, there's movie sequels coming out called Tron Legacy and uh, apparently more information

01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.040
is going to come out at the Spike Video Game Awards.

01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.560
So that'll be on Saturday, December 12th.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:02.160
So very, very brief teaser that's hit the internet recently.

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:03.280
I don't know if Jamie's seen it.

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.840
I'm trying to pull it up here in studio so she can kind of get a peek here at what it

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.840
looks like.

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.720
Uh, I don't know if it's going to play very well here.

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:14.120
But it just, you just see somebody, virus detected.

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.120
And remember.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.120
Motorbikes.

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.120
Light cycles Rob.

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.120
Light cycles.

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.120
That's it.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:24.580
And remember the Spike TV Video Game Awards, that's also your chance to vote for the most

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:28.800
anticipated game where you get to write in your own choice and perhaps President Cat.

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.800
That's right.

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:32.400
We did try to start something on the Facebook about trying to get in and Twitter to get

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.880
everybody to write in President Cat.

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:37.780
So uh, hopefully, and we do hope it makes a clip package.

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:41.320
That's what we're hoping for is that when they introduce who wins this award, they do

01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.000
some type of clip package for all the anticipated things and we're trying to get President.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.840
We don't think it'll win, realistically, it's not on the ballot.

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:51.880
But maybe it'll make the clip package and that's really all we ask.

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:57.640
We want it's 15 frames of fame on Spike TV.

01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.580
Because who, don't you want to be the one to send that tweet over to Rina Wee and let

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:05.160
them know, hey, did you know your video game was on TV in America?

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.440
Still been spamming it.

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.400
All right, let's move on, Jamie, what do you got for us?

01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:14.440
Well um, how about some stuff about another game?

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440
Puzzle Quest.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.440
There's a sequel.

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:24.400
I never played Puzzle Quest, so I couldn't really tell you anything about the sequel.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:30.400
But there is a, I actually don't really know much about Puzzle Quest.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:33.680
I thought you had played this before, the Puzzle Quest game.

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:34.680
Not at all.

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:35.680
Huh, okay.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.000
I played, I played Peggle.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.280
There was Galactrix that came out that was supposed to be some type of sequel to Puzzle

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.760
Quest, but it wasn't really because they had this whole, it was based around hexagons.

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:47.720
So yeah, I was looking at the screen capture going, what am I looking at?

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.400
Which immediately, basically, it's bejeweled with, it's ye olde bejeweled, basically.

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:57.600
But then that also isn't 100% fair because they, especially Puzzle Quest, had all these

01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.120
different other elements in it.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.520
I mean, when you first play it, you're kind of like, oh, it's bejeweled with attacks.

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:06.760
But then you have to get into learning the spells, which was, you know, being able to

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:07.780
clear a board.

02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:09.680
You had to get into sieging the towns.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:13.140
You had to get into like just all this kind of almost micromanagement that you got into

02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.920
as well, but people got really into this game.

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:19.960
Like my roommate, who doesn't play a lot of video games, played a shit ton of Puzzle Quest.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.000
I think when I heard about all of that, I said, yeah, I don't want to play that.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Aww.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
My wife did too.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
That's right, yeah.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Your wife was into this too, huh?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Well, I guess now it's...

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.520
I think I was also busy playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.520
Possibly.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:34.720
Well, Puzzle Quest II, I guess, is now going to be a proper sequel to the game.

02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:40.460
So I don't know exactly what type of stuff is going to be in it, but there's an early

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:44.200
screenshot that's leaked out there, and apparently the game is in development for the 360, it

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.200
looks like?

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200
Yeah.

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:51.360
It looks like colors and some ogres and some guy with a sword.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.120
Now it's interesting though, because there's some new icons here I haven't seen before.

02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:57.680
Like there's these different colored skulls, although one of them says plus three, so maybe

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.880
they just changed the color.

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.640
But then there's these fists, and I don't know what that's all about.

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.560
And there's no more gold icons either, so...

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:08.120
Maybe it means a hand comes out of the screen and punches a player in the face.

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:09.920
That would be unfortunate.

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.920
Puzzle Quest is a fun game.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:11.920
Galactus couldn't get into it.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.720
It was just a whole different way of thinking.

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720
So.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:15.720
There you go.

02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:19.160
I saw there was a Neopets one, and I just wanted to laugh.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.920
People still play Neopets?

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.920
I know, right?

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.920
Let me rephrase.

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.920
People over 13 still play Neopets?

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.920
I know, right?

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.000
Loki.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.920
No one plays Neopets.

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.920
It's all...

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:33.920
It's all Gaia!

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:34.920
All a hoax.

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:39.200
Everyone's using Gaia now.

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.400
There is a new game that sort of had a...

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.000
I don't know if it leaked out or if it was an intentional leak or whatever.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.280
Anyways, it looked like a multiplayer version of Mercenaries, the kind of open world action

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.280
game that was once part of Pandemic.

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:03.680
Now it has been confirmed that the trailer for Mercs Inc., the brand new game, is actually

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:04.920
legit.

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:12.320
It's being developed now not by Pandemic since, well, they kind of closed, and EA Los Angeles

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:17.040
is actually going to be working on that game, and it will be a multiplayer, or at least

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:23.440
have multiplayer in it, and it will be kind of a sandbox game, much like the other Mercenaries

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.440
games.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.800
No word exactly when it's going to come out.

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:30.960
It's still a work in progress, and even the title's just kind of a work in progress, so.

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.520
It's neat, and hopefully it does come out, because I like Mercenaries 2 a little bit.

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:39.960
Granted, it was an incredibly buggy game, but that's what made it kind of fun, because

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.680
it was so buggy.

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.080
You'd like to exploit those buggy games, though.

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.600
I would say as much shit as you give a game like Driver 3 here on the show, you'd love

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.280
to play that game because it was so bad.

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.600
And same with Mercenaries 2.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:56.480
It's just so buggy, but it's hilarious, because you'll just be watching, and you'll feel like,

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480
what just happened there?

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.480
You know?

02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.480
I don't know.

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.400
I'm reading some comments from our chat room, chat.orangetontrader.com, and there's a little

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.760
bit of Pagle versus Puzzle Quest going on there, just a little bit.

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:09.040
Rama says, Puzzle Quest got on my nerves.

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.040
I sold it.

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.360
I guess the micromanaging's not for everyone.

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.720
SHJ100Matt says, I've got more non-gamers hooked on Pagle than Puzzle Quest.

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.600
Pagle for the win.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.660
I like Pagle.

02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:19.940
I liked Puzzle Quest, too.

02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:23.120
Pagle is my number one I'm stuck somewhere board game.

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.380
I like Pagle, because it reminds me of Plinko.

02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:26.380
That's why I like Pagle.

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.440
You know, that's actually the same thought that I had about it, too.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.520
Who didn't want to play Plinko whenever you watched that on The Price is Right?

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.520
But Pagle is so fun.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.800
Like, I'm actually working on the challenge modes.

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:37.800
I've beaten one of them.

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.800
Yeah?

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.800
Yeah.

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:40.800
The extra orange.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:41.800
We've got to beat more than one.

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:42.800
I know.

02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.800
Keep trying.

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:44.800
What happened to him?

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.800
After Burner Climax.

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:46.800
Awesome game!

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.480
Hey, guess what?

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.520
Apparently it's been rated by the OFLC and also the Korean game rating board.

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.680
The indication is that it might be coming to the PlayStation Network.

02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:01.200
The rating was applied for by Sony, so possibly this game is actually coming out to the PSN.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.440
But then you also have to think, well, wait a minute, because there was an OutRun game

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.000
that was out not that long ago, and it was both systems, 360 and PSN.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.560
So don't know if this game will hit both platforms.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:13.840
I would assume it would.

02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:16.040
Exclusives are very few and far between these days.

02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:21.720
If they're going to bring, though, if they're going to bring After Burner Climax, which

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.040
by the way, they had it at John's Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.040
I remember that game.

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.040
That was so fun.

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:32.280
But, um, I would wish that they would bring out Planet Harrier.

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.800
And by the way, for those that don't know, After Burner Climax is an arcade cabinet that's

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:38.560
like old school After Burner.

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:39.560
Except better!

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:42.080
Yeah, but, you know, now it was modernized, basically.

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:47.240
Well, yeah, it has like a full hydraulic seat in it that moves and turns and everything.

02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.080
Which sadly you won't be able to install in your chair, although if you're Loki, he'll

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.120
make one out of duct tape and cardboard boxes somehow.

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.320
I will not make any chairs.

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:54.320
And ballpoint pens.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.360
Because you have to use a little spring as the ballpoint pen.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.360
Anyway.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:00.000
But if they can bring this out, why can't they bring out Planet Harrier?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.400
Why?

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:02.400
They hate you.

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.360
Planet Harrier, Sega!

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.360
So check for that.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:12.740
That might be coming soon if the ratings boards are to believed, which they usually are.

02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:13.740
Just so you know.

02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:15.740
Like, are those things ever wrong?

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:16.740
No.

02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:17.740
Redotainment's funny.

02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.740
Why?

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.740
What?

02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:23.240
To quote After Burner Climax, is that what happens when Maverick ejaculates?

02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:28.600
I really should have had that losing horn sound queued up tonight because we've needed

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:29.800
it several times.

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:36.360
Anyhow, let's open up ye old mailbag at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is where you guys

02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:40.640
can email us every week with your thoughts on the program or as we've been getting lately,

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:43.120
stories about your day, apparently.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.440
So Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag and pick some of our favorite emails and read

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.440
them for you here on the show.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:50.080
So Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag?

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.440
Well speaking of Redotainment, dear OLR, first of all, thank you for updating the podcast

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:55.440
feed.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.840
Between these episodes, the other podcasts I listen to, the music I've recently pirated,

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:02.320
I haven't left entertainment to last me for the rest of the year at work.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.800
What a whole month.

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:08.840
Second, can you send me the link for the article from last week about the guy marrying the

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:10.200
DS character?

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.840
Because I call bullshit.

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:18.120
A guy marrying a character from a DS game in Guam, the part about Guam alone screams

02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:19.120
bullshit to me.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.640
Now onto the reason I'm emailing.

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:26.620
Recently many of us have been sick, including Sky Dark Soccer and myself.

02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:29.260
When you are sick at home, you need things to entertain you.

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:31.120
These things can include video games.

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.920
What video games do you suggest for someone who is sick at home?

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:38.180
This game should preferably need little input, doesn't agitate you much, and can be frequently

02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:46.200
paused to enable you to visit the bathroom slash sick room on a frequent basis.

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:49.000
My suggestion is to get to ride on the Xbox Live Arcade.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.160
Little input is required, it's entertaining without being agitating, and can be paused

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:53.160
at any time.

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:57.480
I say peggle on the iPhone because you can take it with you.

02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:03.560
I gotta be honest, when I was home for a week with Swine Flu and all that, I wasn't really

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:06.180
playing video games at all.

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.120
Because I didn't want to think.

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:09.520
I watched movies.

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.320
That was more my time to catch up on movies and TV shows.

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:17.520
When I'm sick, really, I watch The Muppet Show.

02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:20.640
The last time I had, well remember when I had the plague?

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:22.200
And then I thought I had Plague 2.0?

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.800
But it wasn't Plague 2.0, it was just another sinus infection?

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:29.640
I did nothing for three days but sit and eat burritos and watch The Muppet Show.

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.440
Because I also have this thing for Mexican food when I'm sick.

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:36.840
Okay, listeners, I've gotta ask her, did you see the Bohemian Rhapsody video this week?

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:37.840
No.

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.840
Jamie.

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.840
That's, I even reposted it on my Twitter.

02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:43.860
You need to go onto YouTube and look up Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody.

02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:48.200
It's an official thing that the Muppet company did this week, and it's amazing.

02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.520
But, but, but, but Queen.

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:52.200
It's, it's, but it's the Muppets.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.200
It's okay.

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.200
Mmm.

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.200
You like parodies.

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.200
I do.

02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.200
You'll like it.

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.960
Okay, well, also I need a gift for someone who will be approximately five days old on

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.200
Christmas Day.

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:02.200
Diapers.

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.200
No, no, I'm serious.

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.900
I'm serious.

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.100
Buy diapers.

02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:10.280
Buy big, big boxes of diapers.

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:11.880
For a five year old?

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:13.600
Five days old, Rob.

02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.920
Oh, five days old.

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920
Oh.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:21.760
The, the baby can't see shit, except maybe read, seriously, and is gonna be eating all

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.600
the time and shitting.

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.960
Buy the present, buy, eating, shitting, crying, and that's it.

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.120
And trying to figure out what this big blur in front of its face is.

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:35.200
Do a favor.

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.720
Buy diapers.

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.580
Buy diapers.

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:40.120
For mommy.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:41.120
For baby.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:44.280
Because diapers are expensive and you need a lot of them.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.160
And I only know this because I know mommies.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:49.160
Buy diapers.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.360
And butt paste, just because it's funny.

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.400
No, seriously, whenever I go, whenever I go to a baby shower, I make sure that I do like

02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.480
a care basket and put butt paste in it, because I just want an excuse to buy something called

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:01.480
butt paste.

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.160
It makes it sound like you're, it's gonna glue it shut.

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:06.160
It's for diaper ash.

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:07.560
I know what it's for, but it's just funny.

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:08.560
The name is hilarious.

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.560
Butt paste.

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:10.560
I mean, just the way it rolls off.

02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.200
Can you say it anymore on the show tonight?

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.240
Rob, give it a try.

02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.240
Butt paste.

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.240
See?

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:17.240
Isn't that great?

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.240
Knock knock.

02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.240
Who's there?

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:20.240
Butt.

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.240
Butt who?

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:22.240
Butt paste.

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:23.240
See, that's funny.

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:24.240
No, it's not funny.

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:25.240
It's just not, sorry.

02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:26.240
Butt paste.

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:27.240
It's just hilarious.

02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.240
Moving on.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.240
Okay.

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:33.840
This was brought to you by, oh, sorry, Stay Care Entertainment.

02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:37.320
This message has been brought to you by prayer, the preferred birth control method of the

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:39.520
state of Utah.

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.520
That's funny.

02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:41.520
It is hilarious.

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:42.520
Ooh.

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:44.520
A long one from Spazinator.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:45.520
Hi, folks.

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.520
Hi, Spazinator.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:54.320
I just thought I'd send you through this email just in case I accidentally fall asleep like

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.200
I did last week, dammit, and end up not calling as a result.

02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:02.000
I initially intended to pass the following information along to other listeners out there

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.240
who have been following my situation for the past two weeks.

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.920
I just thought I'd give a little detailed information.

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:14.320
Well, the Monday afternoon after OLR's episode 244 aired live two weeks ago, I placed two

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.960
phone calls to Sony's customer service number.

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.840
The initial call, as you may have suspected, didn't go well.

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.720
I had explained my situation as clearly and calmly as I could.

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:30.720
After bring, oh, must be being put on hold for an insanely long time, I was told that

02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:32.340
they couldn't do anything for me.

02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:35.700
It goes without saying that this tidbit of info did not sit well with me, and I was not

02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:37.240
about to let it just drop.

02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:41.280
If need be, I was prepared to be a major thorn in their sides until something was done.

02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:45.840
A short while later, I had placed a second call to Sony and had asked to speak with a

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:46.840
supervisor.

02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:51.440
The customer service rep that initially answered the call took down some basic info and connected

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.320
me with a supervisor who, if I remember correctly, was named Gerald.

02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.560
Can I just intervene real quick and say, usually when you get put on hold for a long length

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:03.360
of time, and you would know this too, Jamie, I know you worked in a call center for a while

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:05.920
and I trained for one and a half for many years.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.080
Usually it's not because they just want to sit there and not do anything while they have

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.080
you on hold.

02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:12.240
Usually they don't know the answer or they're trying to find out.

02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.640
That's usually why you're on hold for so long, not all the time, but usually.

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:21.120
No, well, I'll tell you, where I worked, we actually would have, and reps would be marked

02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.840
down for this, that they'd have a two-minute hold time maximum, and, well, we don't do

02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.000
it like that anymore, but we used to have a training queue that we would answer training

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.720
calls to our reps on the phone, or we would also take the escalated calls, you know, the

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:39.360
pissed off people, which I loved.

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.360
I was good at it.

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:47.360
But anyway, we, but we'd always go back and say, hey, you've had this person on hold for

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:50.560
this long, go let them know that you're still talking to somebody.

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:54.400
Yeah, and any call center I've been in contact with has a very similar policy.

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.160
Sony probably doesn't need one, because customer service probably isn't their top priority.

02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:00.240
Hate to say it, but, you know, they don't need it.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.840
Sadly, they're the only people to make the PS3, you know, customer service is not probably

02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:06.480
their forte, although.

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:13.120
But in some cases, too, like when I was actually on the floor doing calls, I would actually

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.320
run and go to the source of something, which we weren't technically supposed to do, but

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:20.800
I knew everybody in the other department, so sometimes you may have just someone who's

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:23.200
in the know and knows where to go to find out what you need.

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.240
So give them the benefit of the doubt.

02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.240
Right.

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.240
However, moving forward.

02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:32.960
Again, for what seemed like the trillionth time, I explained as clearly as I could in

02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:36.880
detail what the situation was and conveyed how upset I was that I no longer was able

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.320
to use the content that I had paid tons of money for.

02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:44.080
I also mentioned how aggravated I was due to how previous calls went.

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.640
Ultimately, the supervisor agreed to allow me to redownload my paid content, again, as

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:49.240
a one-time deal.

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:52.280
He also made a point to mention that it would take a few days for everything to fully show

02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.880
up on my download queue due to two factors.

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.560
One, I had bought a lot of stuff, and two, they had to go through it all and reauthorize

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:03.040
it manually as soon as the state was going to take some time.

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.360
Considering all that, I had profusely thanked the supervisor and told him that I was thankful

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:07.360
for this.

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.120
Ultimately, everything started showing up on my list late Tuesday night, which I started

02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:13.120
downloading.

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.320
The first wave basically took all day to fully download.

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.720
The second wave occurred roughly at the same time the following night, and again took a

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.400
considerable amount of time, even with high-speed cable.

02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:25.560
Needless to say, two weeks later, I now have all my content back.

02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:26.560
That's good.

02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.560
Hooray.

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.560
On...

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.560
Did you...

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:30.560
I was yawning, but I wanted to say hooray.

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:31.560
Sorry.

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:32.560
I wasn't yawning at the email.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.560
I promise.

02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:34.560
On...

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.560
Well, I...

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:38.680
On a semi-related note, I am still likely to use the service, however.

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.960
The whole incident and subsequent frustration I've had as a result of the initial calls

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.680
will most likely give me something to consider on a regular basis if and when I think about

02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:48.240
using the PSN store.

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.440
I lucked out this time, but if, God forbid, next time, I may not necessarily be so lucky.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.760
So this email was just a little on the long side.

02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:58.700
Considering that, as of late, the mailbag has been a little light, I figured you three

02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:00.880
wouldn't necessarily mind too much.

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.800
Thanks again for your input and help in the whole situation.

02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.320
Believe me, it's greatly appreciated.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.880
And that's from Spaznator.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.920
Also, he typed this whole thing, I think, on the PlayStation browser.

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:11.920
Wow.

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:12.920
Or the PSP, so...

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:13.920
That's impressive.

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.920
So, yeah.

02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:15.920
Very good.

02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:16.920
Very few errors.

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:17.920
I'm quite proud of you.

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:18.920
And last email.

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.840
Um, hey olr, sorry about, oh, this is, oh, this is from the person who didn't sign it

02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.840
again.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:25.840
Um, okay.

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.320
Hey olr, sorry about last week, I didn't put my name on my email last week.

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:34.920
My screen name for my Xbox and everything is DaMoney125, but I'm gonna change it, maybe,

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.240
something Fallout related.

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.240
Okay?

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:41.480
Um, I had that screen name ever since 1998, so it's long overdue.

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:42.480
You know what?

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:45.480
I've had Dark Sakura since, uh, 1994.

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:47.480
So I take that back.

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.480
Ninety-four, no.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.480
Late ninety-four.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:50.480
So.

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.480
Yeah.

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.480
Just saying.

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.040
I've cycled through several, but, um, I landed on Sky, and, I don't know, I kind of used

02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.040
that.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:00.040
But I don't really, I don't even like using online names anymore.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:01.040
No.

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:02.040
Just call me Rob, it's fine.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:05.560
For me, it's a convenient login tool, so I can use it on everything.

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560
Sure, sure.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.560
Yeah.

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.560
Um, my graphics, uh, let me, okay, there we go.

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.960
I had that screen name since 1998, so it's long overdue.

02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.120
Anyway, I was wondering if you guys will ever post another YouTube video.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:20.600
My graphics card from my computer is coming soon, and I'm sure everyone will want to see

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:22.080
the room you guys broadcast from.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.080
No you don't.

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:24.080
No you don't.

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.720
You do not want to see the disaster this room is right now.

02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:32.140
I will say I did take a picture of the mixing board, and I took a picture of the computer

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.280
setup tonight, and put them on our picture feed, so.

02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:41.560
I also uploaded my photos of the cardboard slash cabinet, you know, that's, uh, in the

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.560
process of, you know, work on.

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:43.560
Oh, sweet.

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.080
Not so much yet, because, you know, I just took a few quick pictures, and they're probably

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.760
not even, um, I don't know, I just took a few in case I ever wanted to explain how I

02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.760
made it.

02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:57.840
Oh, God, there it is, your cardboard box with buttons.

02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:58.840
Amazing.

02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.840
Sorry, Jamie.

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:00.840
No, it's fine.

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:01.840
Better in person.

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:03.240
Well, um, you should color it with magic marker.

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.240
I know, really.

02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:05.800
Or a paint pen or something.

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:06.800
That'd be funny.

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:09.480
I originally wanted to just do it just in plain cardboard.

02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:10.480
Electrical tape!

02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:12.000
No, seriously, electrical tape.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.840
Get that cool vinyl look to it.

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:15.800
Well, I have duct tape.

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:18.960
I was thinking of wrapping some of it in duct tape, I don't know.

02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.000
Use colored duct tape.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.040
It's gonna look very ghetto when it's done.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.040
That's gonna be great.

02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:31.340
Anyway, um, yeah, actually this room is ready for a complete cleanup, because, um, I have

02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:35.040
these storage bins that have been sitting here on the floor forever, and I'm ready to

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.440
start using them.

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.920
I just, also, to let anyone know too, this is sort of related, I'm getting rid of a whole

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:46.560
bunch of manga, and different books, including a few, I think I'm gonna get rid of my gothic

02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.920
and lolita magazines, so if anyone wants them, let me know.

02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:53.920
We'll work something out.

02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:55.920
Back to the email.

02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:01.200
Um, also, when Loki's arcade cabinet works, maybe we could see Loki drunk playing Daytona

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.200
USA.

02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:03.200
Haha, just kidding.

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:06.840
Well, I'm writing this from my Blackberry at Christmas party, so I better go.

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:10.200
But before I go, and this, by the way, halfway through the email, before I go, I hope you

02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:14.640
guys check out Fallout 3, or even Fallout 1, I recommend that you guys play Fallout

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.680
1 first, since the third one is in first person, and I know how dark soccer gets motion sick.

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:20.560
Aww, thank you, that's so sweet.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.280
Also, I think it's free to play on gamertap, on gametap.

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:30.920
The third one has a game of the year edition, now with all five download content packs that

02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:33.800
I highly recommend anyone who hasn't played a Fallout game.

02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.560
Actually, I've, Becky's husband has Fallout 3, and I saw him play some of it, and it looked

02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.560
really cool.

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.760
I, you know, like I said, I wouldn't be able to do too much of it.

02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:49.640
Not to mention how much of a deal it is, well I hope you guys check those out now, if you'll

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.440
excuse me, I've got gifts to open, sent from my Verizon wireless Blackberry.

02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:59.840
Wow, we got a crack, we got regular email, a Crackberry, and a PSP all tonight, that's

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.240
pretty amazing.

02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.560
Well, I'm gonna double check and see if we've got any more, just because I'm nice.

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:07.560
Nope.

02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:08.560
Plank.

02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.800
You can send in an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send them.

02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:16.040
But for now, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here on the program, because you

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.200
know, sometimes things piss us off.

02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:21.600
And so a special holiday edition of the FUs of the Week.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.000
Oh, this is bad.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.120
Here is justice.

02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:32.400
Here is punishment.

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.880
Here is a fucked up.

02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.200
DarkSakura, what's on your mind tonight that you want to get out of your chest?

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:46.240
The fact that I still need to, um, FU to me, because I still need to do the faceplate that

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:47.240
we were gonna autograph.

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:48.240
FU!

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:51.720
Yeah, and you know, I had it set out.

02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:52.720
That's alright.

02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:53.720
We'll get it.

02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.320
You know, but still, I feel bad about myself because I just remembered it.

02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:03.160
And also, um, a secondary FU to me for not actually cleaning my room today, or yesterday.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.080
I came home very intoxicated last night.

02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.080
Awesome.

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.680
My car is over at Becky's house.

02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:12.360
She will be bringing it to me, and I will be taking her home.

02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:15.440
So FU to me and Boddington Dale.

02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:18.000
But bless you for doing the right thing and not driving home drunk.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
That was the right thing to do.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Because I'm amazing.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Bogey.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.060
FU to burning myself on my finger with the soldering iron, because I decided for some

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:29.960
reason to grab the tip of the soldering iron to move it to the side.

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:30.960
Not smart.

02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.680
Just like that, and like, OWWW, as it sizzled.

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:40.920
Well, maybe I'm the only one not giving an FU to myself tonight, although it does have

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.240
to kind of do with me.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.800
FU to my back, because I don't know what I did.

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:47.520
I think I might have slept on it wrong or something, but it's been like hurting me for

02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:53.480
like a week, and it sucks, and back pain is never any fun, and it just makes me remember

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:54.480
that I'm getting old.

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.840
FU to getting old.

02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:59.720
I know a lot of you people listening to this show are like, I'm 21 now.

02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:01.440
I'm old.

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:02.440
FU.

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:05.600
Wait about 10 years, then I'll tell you.

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:08.640
Of course, then again, of course, a lot of my friends that are in their 40s would say

02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:12.120
I'm being just as big of a whiner, so what can you do?

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:14.120
Age is just a number.

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:17.520
Loki, why don't you give us another story, and then just a couple more stories here.

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:22.360
We're going to make our way to the Skype line, where you guys can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:25.680
or of course our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:29.160
So we'll have that open very soon, just after a couple more stories.

02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:39.920
Now, apparently, not to delay themselves from jumping on the bandwagon too late, Microsoft

02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:45.240
has decided to go ahead and patent their own Xbox 360 hint system, very similar to what

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:50.160
we saw with the Super Guide on the Nintendo.

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:51.160
You may remember that.

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:55.320
The first game that had that was New Super Mario Brothers.

02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:00.000
This new patent, though, it doesn't really say what they're going to do exactly, but

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:09.960
it's going to have some more guides and digital, kind of like brief audio commentaries or stuff

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:14.780
that adds portions of the screen that kind of give you hints and stuff like that.

02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.920
So it's just kind of a generic system that maybe they're going to include in some games

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:21.680
going forward to make them more approachable for casual gamers.

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:26.280
Gene, have I heard this before?

02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:28.680
I guess it's a neat idea.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:37.200
We kind of gave the whole hint system crap for the Wii and stuff like that, and it really

02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:45.480
ended up that it was so behind the scenes like stuff that really shouldn't have been

02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:46.480
brought up.

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:51.920
And in other words, people were reading way too much into the trademark and the patent

02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:57.000
documents, but to be fair, we've also only seen it implemented in one game.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.600
We don't know what it's going to look like in the next Zelda game or some other games

02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:03.080
that Nintendo might have in the future, just saying.

02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:09.260
But yeah, maybe a lot of us jumped the gun, and that's what happens.

02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:12.760
So I don't know, do you think Xbox 360 is just like, hey, Nintendo's got a good idea,

02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:15.360
let's copy it, or do you think they're really going in a different direction with this?

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:20.360
I don't think they were just trying to take the same approach, not necessarily just because

02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.760
Nintendo did it, but maybe had the same ideas.

02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:29.080
To be fair, Microsoft does this sort of thing very well, where if somebody's got an idea,

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:31.000
they sort of take it and make it better.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.440
Well, also they're trying to broaden themselves out.

02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:39.200
They kind of have the opposite problem as Nintendo.

02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:42.920
They're really trying to broaden the audience so much so that they don't really have any

02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:46.800
core games for the core gamer, I guess.

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.080
But Microsoft has a lot of core games, but they're trying to broaden themselves out to

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:53.440
more of a family audience.

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:58.920
And you might say that the Xbox 360 is probably a little bit more daunting for someone that

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:01.080
hasn't played games so far to pick up and learn how to play.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:02.880
Too many buttons!

02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:05.440
That's a retarded excuse, but I've heard it.

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:06.880
I know, yeah.

02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:09.560
Too many buttons, hey, you use a keyboard at work, do you?

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:10.560
Well, yeah.

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.040
Well, how many buttons are on there?

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.040
Yeah, I thought so.

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:15.040
Shut up, bitch.

02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:21.760
All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and it has to do with Alienware computers.

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:24.480
Alienware computers are coming now preloaded with Steam.

02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:27.800
Of course, those Alienware computers, those are those high-end gaming machines that they

02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:28.800
sell.

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.040
Think like a Dell or an HP.

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:32.520
In fact, didn't one of these buy Alienware?

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:33.520
Dell.

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:37.280
Yeah, Dell bought Alienware a couple of years ago, so it's everything in a box, which is

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:41.440
perfect for the non-lokies of the world, the people that can't build their own machines.

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:46.160
I know we have a mixture of people that listen to this show, but Alienware is also known

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:47.520
for being very expensive.

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:53.000
Well, Alienware is now actually bundling with their all-powerful systems.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.960
These actually, I got to admit, they're kind of cool-looking, the whole black and red thing.

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:59.760
I mean, if you're going to pay that much money for a system, it might as well look kind of

02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:00.760
awesome.

02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:06.080
So if you buy one of these all-powerful systems, they're actually shipping with Steam.

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:09.020
Steam comes on these systems.

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:12.560
Part of the reason why is because Portal is a free game that's included, which of course

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:15.360
was a Valve game that they did release through Steam.

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:18.880
I actually bought, that was the very first game I ever bought through Steam, was Portal.

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.000
So no, second game, because I bought AudioSurf 2.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.960
But regardless, Steam is now coming in bundled with these systems, which for these box systems

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:29.240
is not really new news.

02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:32.660
I know I talked about earlier, and it's funny kind of to bring this full circle because

02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:36.660
Jamie had a story earlier about Steamworks, and I was saying, aren't those Google toolbars

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.260
and all that other crap that tries to install with the program kind of annoying?

02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:45.080
But this, you sort of grow to expect that when you buy these computers in a box, they

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.200
come preloaded with tons of crap.

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.200
Bloatware.

02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.800
Yeah, it's, what do they call that?

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.800
Bloatware.

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:53.300
I've never heard of that, bloatware.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:54.480
That's a good term for it.

02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.680
But yeah, the antivirus demo is installed, and the trial of Microsoft Office is already

02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:01.680
on the computer.

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:04.880
So this honestly just seems like another logical step to me.

02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:08.760
It is kind of a kick in the groin to the competitors, like direct to drive and so forth.

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:11.400
But what are you going to do?

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:15.320
I guess you could say the Microsoft Office has its competitors too, and they get to jump

02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:18.400
up on some of these systems and so forth.

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:23.800
Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangelaunchrater.com, Salacious Pop

02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:27.880
says, Alienware has a build your own shopping cart, a la the Apple site, where you can build

02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:31.200
a system for $7,000 without really trying.

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.240
Pleasurezaco says, Skyit is hella cheaper to build your own PC than to buy from Alienware.

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:37.240
Can they be as pretty though?

02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.080
Because I gotta say, those systems are very nice looking.

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:41.120
You'd be surprised what you can find in cases nowadays.

02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.680
Although I gotta say, the new computer we've got for the show is pretty sleek looking.

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:46.680
That's a nice looking little box.

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.120
And they didn't, that wasn't even trying.

02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:49.440
I mean seriously, there's a lot of nice...

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.160
It doesn't light up pretty, but it looks nicer than the one I've got for myself.

02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:55.840
Nowadays, it's almost hard to find a case that doesn't light up.

02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:07.280
I mean, seriously, my computer at the time I think cost me $1,700, and I put in not entirely

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:12.840
top of the line stuff, but I put in stuff to overclock a dual core processor pretty

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.840
heavily.

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:20.640
I mean, so it's not top of the line, but it's not bottom of the line, that's for sure.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:25.080
And it still runs stuff nowadays pretty well.

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.920
Without $1,700, if you're spending like $7,000, holy shit.

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:32.480
I mean, there's no way...

02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:34.800
I don't know if that was an exaggeration or not.

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:37.300
Part of me says it probably wasn't.

02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:42.420
You can, I mean, even if you bought all the top of the line stuff, I still don't see how

02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:43.680
it costs that much.

02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.240
I mean, I really don't, I don't know.

02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:50.680
I'm looking at some of the other comments here.

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.800
Act Def says, the general consumer doesn't know how to build a computer and will go for

02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:55.720
something that's already built.

02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:57.640
That's clearly where they're making their money.

02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:59.040
Tiger Claw says, here's the thing.

02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.840
What is more important, the way the case looks or the performance of the system?

02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:03.060
I choose the latter.

02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:07.960
And no, in all seriousness, and for myself and not playing devil's advocate here, obviously

02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:10.000
you're not staring at the box the whole time.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.760
You're staring at what's on the monitor.

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:16.080
The box is just for impressing people at landmarks.

02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:17.120
My computer lights up.

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:18.120
My power supply lights up.

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:21.200
Mine lights up like a bluish color, but it's nothing special.

02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:28.200
My favorite, I think, computer that anyone ever built was the one built into a tall tackle

02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.840
box, a metal, no, a tall metal toolbox.

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:36.640
And I got to say, maybe lesson learned here, I didn't build my own computer the last time

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:41.380
I bought a computer because I'm not quite as talented as Loki or whatever.

02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:45.500
And I thought maybe I was getting a really good deal because I bought my computer for

02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:49.960
a certain price that was kind of low to me, but now I'm learning, should have got a better

02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:54.120
video card and some of these other things I should have considered better at the time.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:55.120
Well, lesson learned.

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:58.680
You know, one thing I would change if I were to go back and actually make my computer again

02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:04.960
is I would not buy another graphics card to run SLI, because I have two graphics cards

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:05.960
in mine.

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:14.240
And they're both EVGA, GTS, 8800 graphics cards with a half gig RAM in each one.

02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:21.860
I mean, in the games that run SLI, it's awesome, but most stuff out there does not support

02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:22.860
SLI.

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.920
So it's kind of pointless.

02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:30.960
I did it for Crysis, but Crysis got boring really fast.

02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:31.960
Bummer.

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.960
But it ran well.

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:33.960
All right.

02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:38.600
We're going to open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:39.600
OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.040
We're going to take your calls live here for a little bit, and then we'll start to wrap

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:44.040
up the show.

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:46.360
Meanwhile, while we wait for the calls to come in, because there's a little bit of a

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:52.800
delay from studio to encoding to the all-game server to you guys hearing it, let's see if

02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.160
there's any last-minute stories.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:59.480
There's a rumor that there's going to be some exclusive characters for Sonic and Sega All-Star

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:05.440
Racing, including for the Xbox 360 that Banjo-Kazooie might be in.

02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:12.520
That's from some work-in-progress box shots that are appearing, I guess, on their UK site.

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:16.080
So that's kind of interesting.

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:23.680
Also there's a fun little website I was looking at earlier that you can create your own Zelda

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.640
scenes with the Zelda II text generator.

02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:33.400
And if you go check it out, it's at ZeldaPower.com, and it's under their features, the Adventures

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:35.440
of Link text box toy.

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:38.520
You can make all sorts of weird scenes.

02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:41.320
But it's not, you can't actually put them in the game, right?

02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.320
No.

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:46.480
Just to make little web pages or stuff for forums and stuff like that.

02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:49.680
So it's kind of neat.

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:54.400
Great, more forum macros, just what we needed.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:59.440
And then also there is a rumor that apparently you're going to be able to attend some of

02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:03.480
these gaming conferences through your Xbox 360.

02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:10.800
One of the, I guess, new things they're talking about is, imagine an interactive online version

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:17.280
of E3, BlizzCon, Gamescom, Comic Con, and every other major video game convention were

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:20.460
made available through Xbox Live.

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:24.080
So it's something that is being put out there.

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:30.220
I guess it's coming from some guy who works in the game industry, VG Market, I guess.

02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:36.600
They have a, looks like it's another survey, a market research survey.

02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:38.800
And we know about those market research surveys.

02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:42.600
They end up coming true.

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:45.240
There's a lot of comments there in chat about the SLI.

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:48.000
Danger Skew in our chat says, I agree with the SLI argument.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.280
You should never build a computer with SLI from the beginning, only if you need more

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:54.280
power later.

02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:58.040
And Tiger Claw says, you only need SLI if you have a huge-ass monitor.

02:30:58.040 --> 02:30:59.640
It's meant to handle graphics at higher resolutions.

02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:03.600
If you have a 19-inch widescreen monitor and only one Nvidia card, you're good to go.

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:06.240
Again, those comments are coming from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:09.920
Especially nowadays with the Nvidia cards are actually multi-processor anyway.

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.600
So it's like having two cards already.

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:16.320
So probably no need to have more than that.

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:19.080
Still waiting to see if any calls come in at 1877 Game OLR.

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:20.400
Is Skype all fucked up today?

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:21.960
Is that what's going on?

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:24.520
I had something awful linked to me, Rob.

02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:27.160
Skype was acting weird earlier, but yeah, what's that?

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:30.100
A trailer for New King of Fighters movie.

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:31.100
And it...

02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:32.100
Like a real movie?

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:36.060
Yeah, and it has Ray Park in it, and I watched some of it and I wanted to cry because I'm

02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:38.960
like, where's Q?

02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:39.960
Is it an American movie?

02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:40.960
Yeah, it's American.

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:41.960
Or is this something that's being made overseas?

02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:42.960
Really?

02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:43.960
I didn't know they were making that.

02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:44.960
I think...

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:45.960
Ugh, God.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:46.960
You would think I would have heard about this sooner.

02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:48.720
Why don't I send you the link?

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:49.720
Okay.

02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:51.840
So we can play how awful it is on the air.

02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:52.840
Hold on.

02:31:52.840 --> 02:31:53.840
We're getting a call.

02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:54.840
Hi, you're on Orangelaungeradio.

02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:55.840
Who's this?

02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:56.840
It's Legend of Zaku.

02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.840
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

02:31:57.840 --> 02:31:59.840
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:00.840
Nothing much.

02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:05.960
Just trying to get over this whole Thanksgiving ordeal.

02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:06.960
I know.

02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:07.960
Go behind.

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:12.360
It's a bummer we all have to go back to work tomorrow, but you know, such is life.

02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:20.440
Well, yeah, basically, I know we barely cover the DDR and Bomani scene, but I figured you

02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:24.720
already know by now that DDRX2 has an arcade release.

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:27.000
Well, it's going to be released in Japan.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.620
We'll mention it once in a while.

02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:34.560
We don't mention every little story like we used to, but any of the big things will come

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.560
up.

02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:37.960
There was a location test last week, and I did read something on the internet this week

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:43.720
that somebody out there in Japan was bringing back reports of what was in the location test,

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:49.840
which was a lot of your BeatMania 2DX-style artists and a lot of the Konami house originals,

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:55.080
which I think is DDR's biggest problem right now in cracking the mainstream is that I realize

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.560
people love their Konami originals.

02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:57.560
I do, too.

02:32:57.560 --> 02:32:58.680
There's a lot of talented artists.

02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:02.320
It's never going to break into the mainstream unless they start building some good licenses.

02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:07.440
That all depends on what licenses they end up including in the final version, but right

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:13.000
now, apparently, a lot of the community, from the consensus I'm hearing right now, is that

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
they actually...

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.280
Yeah, I'm actually hearing good consensus from them.

02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:22.200
I'm actually hearing a lot of good things in terms of the song selection, but that's

02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:23.200
pretty much it.

02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:30.200
They may be skeptical as to whether or not they could execute the same version, the same

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:35.280
Japanese version, to America, which we already know how much of a disaster DDRX was.

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.080
Was it?

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.080
I didn't really...

02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:41.080
I have to admit, I haven't been following DDRX closely.

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:47.520
Yeah, the fucked up pads and the countless number of fixes afterwards.

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:52.200
Even my pads, even my Dave and Buster's managed to get a DDRX cab that couldn't even last

02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:53.200
a month.

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:55.720
It was not even playable.

02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:59.400
The fact that there's not that many machines around.

02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:04.240
The fact that they killed off our free kids made it even worse, so I pretty much consider

02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:07.640
that a failure.

02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:12.480
The way I see it is that I think Supernova is a baseline, because that managed to spread,

02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.600
and that managed to have good coverage all around.

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:20.720
Just about most of the places I could think off the top of my head that had Supernova

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:25.800
at one point, but then when I try to do the same thing for DDRX, it's just I can.

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:28.960
I can only think of one place.

02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:33.600
One place that wasn't Coney Island that no longer had the machine, but that's it.

02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.120
Honestly, Zaku, I just want to play Fourth Mix Plus.

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:40.840
I already had that chance.

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:47.880
I've already played that last summer back on 8 on the break, when they basically threw

02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:48.880
it on their machine.

02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.400
Well, no, I mean, I've played it before, but I'm just saying, with all these fancy new

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:57.200
mixes and all that stuff going on, I miss Fourth Plus.

02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.640
Fourth Plus was the bomb, that was the best mix they ever did.

02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:05.280
On the 8th on the break, apparently they're doing, they've been throwing Fourth and Fifth

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.840
Mix around pretty recently.

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:10.760
I don't know if they're still doing it now, but that's what they were doing a couple of

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:11.760
months ago.

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.640
I'm pretty sure Milpitas Golf Land here locally, I haven't been there in a couple years, granted.

02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:18.160
Well, maybe not that long, maybe about a year.

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.080
They still had a Fourth Mix Plus last time I was there, so props to them.

02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.160
And now, of course, I've started the classic amongst the longtime listeners of the show

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:28.000
that are DDR nerds from the beginning.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.960
The Fourth Mix Plus versus Fifth Mix debate.

02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:31.960
My bad.

02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.160
Fifth Mix was pretty badass, too.

02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.280
Where else can you play Moonlight Shadow?

02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:35.280
I'll give you that.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:36.280
Fifth Mix was awesome.

02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:37.280
All right.

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.280
Yeah.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.280
All right.

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:45.200
Look, please, is there anything else on your mind this week besides just the DDRX2?

02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:49.800
Basically going on what you said about Alienware, you can build yourself a PC for less than

02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.680
a thousand, a really good gaming rig for less than a thousand clocks.

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:59.080
You just have to look hard and deep, and you've got to really consider what you prioritize,

02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.280
graphics, sound, or both.

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:04.280
That's pretty much it.

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:11.280
I've managed to get mine for $1,700 and change when I built it, but it still runs pretty

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:12.280
good as of today.

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:18.760
Obviously, it can't do 60 frames per crisis, but it can play stuff like Left 4 Dead, Team

02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.080
Fortress 2 pretty well.

02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.080
Just the better of how much you're willing to spend on something like that.

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.760
I think that's important, too, is prioritizing.

02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:31.200
What do you really want out of your machine?

02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:35.800
If you buy a cheapo graphics card but buy a bit monitor, it's not going to do a lot

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:36.800
of good.

02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:37.800
Right.

02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.200
You've got to get at least something, at least Geforce 9 or better right now.

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:47.240
That should do you good for another year or two before you have to refresh.

02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:48.800
All right.

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.520
Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, see if anybody else

02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:53.520
is trying to call tonight.

02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.520
Have a good one.

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.520
Okay, buddy?

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.520
All right.

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:57.520
All right.

02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:58.520
Later, buddy.

02:36:58.520 --> 02:36:59.520
All right.

02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:03.440
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:04.440
Either way will do it.

02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:08.560
I will keep the phone lines open a little bit longer to see if anyone wants to get through.

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.440
I know some people told me earlier they wanted to call in.

02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:12.480
I'm not sure if they're going to try to get through or what.

02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:13.680
Do we have any other last minute stories?

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:14.680
I sent you the link.

02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:15.680
Oh, yes.

02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:16.680
Oh, thank you.

02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.680
I forgot about it.

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:18.680
Oh, and of course, we're getting another call.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:19.680
We'll bring up the link for after this, though.

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:20.680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:21.680
Who's this?

02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:22.680
Hey, this is XLink.

02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:23.680
Hi, XLink.

02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:24.680
How are you doing?

02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.680
Hey, doing good.

02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:30.960
I was playing a game recently that I'd like to talk a little bit about, if it's okay with

02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:31.960
you.

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:32.960
Of course.

02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:33.960
What's up?

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:34.960
I was playing a game called Gyromancer.

02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:38.000
It was the new one from Pop Games and Square Enix.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.240
Yes, the Marriage of Popcat Games and Square Enix.

02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:42.760
I played the demo for this.

02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:44.240
Have you played the full version?

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:47.600
I've been playing the full version, and the full version is not that much different than

02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:48.600
the demo.

02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:53.400
You can level up your monsters a lot more, and I've been playing just a little bit.

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.320
I haven't gone through the whole game exactly as of yet.

02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:57.480
I've been playing during downtime for a while, so...

02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:58.480
I imagine it takes some time.

02:37:58.480 --> 02:37:59.480
PC or 360?

02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:00.480
PC.

02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:01.480
Okay.

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.480
What do you think?

02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.480
What are your thoughts on it?

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:04.480
I like it.

02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:09.200
I like, because I'm a big Blitz, Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz fan, and I think they're

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.280
taken more after Bejeweled Blitz, because the fact that you have to rotate the pieces

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.520
to make the lines this time around, I like it a lot more.

02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:22.640
It's a lot more difficult than going, okay, well, I'm going to take this and switch these

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.640
two around.

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:24.640
It's not like two pieces.

02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:27.940
You have to switch actually four around in a counter-clockwise position.

02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:31.560
It's so funny you compare it to Bejeweled Blitz, because I was literally, literally

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:37.080
having this conversation last night with somebody about Bejeweled versus Bejeweled Twist or

02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:41.600
Gyromancer or what have you, that for me, when I tried to play the demo for Gyromancer,

02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:47.380
I was having such a hard time conceptualizing the twist, because I was so used to playing

02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:53.680
Bejeweled Blitz and just regular Bejeweled 2 and so forth, that I kept wanting to swap

02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:57.600
the gems to make lines of three, like it was very hard for me to kind of change that and

02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:58.880
do the twist.

02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.720
And then the other thing that really messes with me is that in Bejeweled Blitz or any

02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:08.920
other version of Bejeweled, you have to make a move every turn that causes gems to disappear.

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:15.160
In Gyromancer, your twists do not have to cause three to line up.

02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:19.080
People get higher scores and even penalized, you know, if it doesn't, and higher scores

02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:23.800
if they do, but I just had such a hard time kind of getting used to that idea.

02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:27.000
I mean, it didn't ruin the game for me, I still think it's kind of interesting, but

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:31.400
I just think I'm going to suck at it, because I always play Bejeweled Blitz, because I want

02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:35.040
my E-peen to have me at the top of the leaderboard, even though that never happens.

02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.040
Most definitely.

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:39.080
You get more points by doing that, but also at the same time, though, like if you do a

02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:45.000
move and you don't make three, it would cause the enemy's power to grow a little bit each

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.760
time, so you want to make those lines, you want to make the ones, because you get like,

02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:52.680
for each of your characters, you get like a certain color, so you want to make those

02:39:52.680 --> 02:40:00.640
lines with the color that your creature represents, so that way you can use your powers and take

02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:01.640
more.

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:05.960
It's cool because it had like a life, it added more of a really role-playing element

02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:11.240
to it with the hit points, so like you do certain moves and it'll take away hit points

02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:16.120
away from the other enemy, depending on how many was chained or what was happening, you

02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:17.120
know.

02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:23.360
It has a lot of the element to Puzzle Quest to it, but it's a lot of fun, though.

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:24.360
Good thing it fucks.

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.960
I was going to ask, did you play any Puzzle Quest previously at all?

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:28.960
I did.

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.680
I played the original Puzzle Quest.

02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:34.600
Not the galaxy, because it looked a little too sci-fi, and the way the board was set

02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:36.400
up was like, oh my god, what the hell.

02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:40.280
Yeah, the hexagon thing was too much of a departure, I think, for some of us, which

02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:44.680
in a way is similar to the whole thing that bugs me about the twist, but that's okay.

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:49.520
So how do you feel about this game compared to Puzzle Quest?

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:50.520
I like it.

02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.320
It has a lot of the Puzzle Quest-type feel to it, but it's more story-line driven and

02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:59.920
more, there's a little more interaction that I would say than that, so.

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:05.280
But like I said before, for a puzzle game, $15, it was Pop Game and Square Enix.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.700
You can't really go too wrong with it, so I mean.

02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:08.700
That's true.

02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:13.960
It is a damn good price, so it's pretty cool how there's been all this puzzle game resurgence

02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:17.440
in the past couple years, especially these very, very fleshed out type of puzzle games

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.920
between what Q Entertainment has been giving us with Luminous and so forth, and now, you

02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:25.460
know, these RPG meets PopCap games.

02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:26.460
It's pretty fascinating.

02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:29.120
I just use it mostly, like I said before, as a time killer.

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.100
If I want something to fill in at 15 minutes, I usually just load it up and then play it,

02:41:33.100 --> 02:41:37.720
you know, or maybe play like one level a day or something, so that way I don't get overkill

02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:38.720
of it, so.

02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:40.880
I'm surprised this game hasn't shown up on every platform.

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:43.040
I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it's on the iPhone.

02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:47.120
Well, right now, I know it's for the Xbox and PC, but I don't know if they're going

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:48.120
to expand it over that.

02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.280
I think they're trying to wait to see what happens first beforehand, so.

02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:52.280
Right.

02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:53.280
Very interesting.

02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:55.280
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, XLink?

02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:56.280
Not really.

02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:01.920
You know, that, I mean, I got confused a good deal from Steam when it was doing the Black

02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:02.920
Friday stuff.

02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:03.920
Well, yeah.

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:04.920
What did you jump in on?

02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:05.920
Oh.

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:06.920
Knights of the Old Republic.

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:08.680
I definitely picked that up for 250.

02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:10.200
I heard about that.

02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.200
250.

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:12.320
That's an amazing deal.

02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.720
You know, and you've got to wonder how Steam makes money off of it.

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:18.360
My thought is they're selling these games at cost, and they're just getting people

02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.880
to install Steam to get these hella good deals.

02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:24.220
And maybe even, you know, kind of the idea behind the consoles, they're taking a little

02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:28.480
bit of a loss over these games, you know, especially a game like Knights of the Old

02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:31.880
Republic that hasn't really generated buzz, well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't put it

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:32.880
that way.

02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:33.880
But, you know, it's years old.

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:34.880
It's years old, so.

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:35.880
Well, you had to think about it this way.

02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.320
If something was sitting around, like, say, for example, even in the video store, a game

02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:41.880
was sitting around, and it wasn't doing anything, and they're going, they put a price

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:45.400
of 250 on there, and they know it's going to hit, then they, you know, at least they're

02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:46.400
making something out of nothing.

02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:48.320
So, I mean, they're making money somehow.

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:49.320
So, I mean.

02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:50.320
True.

02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:51.320
True.

02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:52.320
So, maybe it's arranged with these companies.

02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:53.320
I don't know.

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:55.920
I'm holding out hope that Torchlight is in tomorrow's deals, because I really wanted

02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:56.920
to pick that up.

02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:57.920
So, I'm waiting to see them.

02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:58.920
Yeah.

02:42:58.920 --> 02:42:59.920
Well, you know, you get what you pay for.

02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:04.440
Kind of like I kind of kicked myself in the ass for picking up Fallout 3, and then two

02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:07.120
months down the road, they're like, oh, by the way, the Game of the Year edition, same

02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:08.120
price.

02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:10.360
And you get all the downloadable content to go with it.

02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:11.360
Oh, bummer.

02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:17.040
But I did pick up Civ IV also from Go Gamer when they're doing their Black Friday deals

02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:18.040
for 10 bucks.

02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:19.040
Nice.

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:20.040
Which was the complete edition.

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:21.040
So, that was very nice.

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.040
Very nice.

02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:23.520
Compared to that of five bucks from Best Buy.

02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:24.520
So.

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.520
All right.

02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:26.520
Well.

02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:27.520
We'll see you in the game.

02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:28.520
Excellent.

02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:29.520
We're going to let you go, so we can try and get maybe one more call in.

02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.520
But have a great night, okay?

02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:31.520
Definitely.

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:32.520
Thank you.

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:33.520
And thanks for the review on Gyromancer.

02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.840
One eight seven seven Game O-L-R, or his name on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.120
I did get that video brought up here that DarkStalker was talking about earlier.

02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:44.720
Let me look at a little bit of a clip here.

02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.280
It does look like an actual, like, movie.

02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.240
I just never knew they were making a movie out of King of Fighters.

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.240
Or maybe.

02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:53.240
Is that mine?

02:43:53.240 --> 02:44:01.120
Yeah, this definitely looks direct to video.

02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:02.120
No?

02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:03.120
Okay, whatever.

02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:18.240
It'll be fun for Phantom Martial Arts movies and stuff, I'm sure.

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:19.240
Part of my soul cried.

02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.800
Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:22.800
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:23.800
Who's this?

02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:24.800
Hey, hey.

02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:25.800
It's Ronma.

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:26.800
Hi, hey.

02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.800
What's up?

02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:28.800
Not too much.

02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:32.080
I'll make this brief, because, um, since you guys are talking about DDR and so forth,

02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.240
funny little anecdote popped up in Anime USA that I have to share with you guys is

02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:37.760
the funniest thing I've ever heard.

02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:38.760
Alright.

02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:43.760
Okay, um, I'm not sure if you guys covered this about the whole, think you guys did the

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:46.800
whole Konami DDR tournament that was going that they were having?

02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.000
Yeah, I came up on the show, people emailed us about it, and, you know, we were kinda

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.520
giving our spin on it.

02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.600
Not enough notice on it, I think, for it to be taken as seriously as they wanted it to

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:56.600
be.

02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:57.600
Yeah.

02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:02.640
But, if I'm not mistaken, I believe there was also a cutoff point for the tournament.

02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.960
You had to be under a certain age to compete.

02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:10.320
Yes, I remember that, like, so officially DDR has turned its back on me.

02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:11.320
Yes.

02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:15.520
Yeah, from what I understand, they're saying the cutoff date was like 31 or 32, which I

02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:23.520
call shenanigans on, but, um, one of the people I know in the DDR fandom community, um, I

02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:28.160
believe it was DDR.O Bill, he told me how it was crazy that they were having this, and

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.560
I ran to another friend of mine, Jim the Fly, at Anime USA.

02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:38.040
He told me that the guy that was hosting the tournament, who more or less put the rules

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:41.880
together, he himself had a heart attack.

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:42.880
What?

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:43.880
Yeah.

02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:48.840
Wait, the guy who, wait, are you, like, a heart attack, like, literally had a heart

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:49.840
attack?

02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:50.840
Yeah.

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:53.880
Was it- That's a hardcore tournament.

02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:58.680
Was it related to this, or was it just unfortunate timing?

02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:03.520
It's just odd timing, because everyone's saying he was, like, 33, 34, something like that,

02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:04.520
you know?

02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:05.520
Oh, God.

02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:06.520
Wow.

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:07.520
That's a, yeah.

02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:08.520
Yeah, wow.

02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:11.520
That's a little close to home.

02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:12.520
Wow.

02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:13.520
That's-

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:14.520
Karma's kind of fucked up, isn't it?

02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:15.520
Well, yeah, hold on.

02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:19.940
I would never, you know, even if it was, let's say, it's just, like, the worst of the worst

02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:24.600
bottom of the barrel video game personality, like, for instance, this guy who's suing all

02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:29.000
the companies for these ludicrous reasons, I would not wish a heart attack upon them.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000
I would wish-

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.120
Neither would I, but I just find this, just, odd, it's, like, he's about, you can't be

02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.120
over a certain age to compete, this, this, and this, and then, boom, he has a heart attack.

02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:39.120
I'm like, what?

02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:42.780
Well, you know, I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence, you know, people get sick as

02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:43.920
they get older, and-

02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:47.320
You have to be this age to compete, because this is what, ugh!

02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:56.600
How about you have to have a blood pressure under a certain, you know, instance.

02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:01.080
Well, I think it's sad, and I don't want to make jokes about it, you know, and I don't

02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:05.360
care if you all hate the fucking rules, or whatever, but I just don't think we would

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:09.280
ever want to wish that upon somebody, and I hope he gets better soon, but I think what

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:14.040
I can speak to is the tournament itself, and, you know, the rules and the tournament itself

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:18.760
seemed a little silly, and was just hastily thrown together, and I think that's why it

02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:23.160
didn't get probably the type of coverage that hopefully Konami was going for.

02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:24.280
Perhaps so, but you know what?

02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:29.280
I think I'm gonna host my own National DDR tournament, and you can be up to whatever

02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:34.760
age you want, if you need to bring your walker, your wheelchair, your cane to compete, that's

02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:35.760
fine.

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:38.860
Hold on, though, hold on, though, because, like, you know, then I'll bring a cane and

02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:42.400
use it to hit the arrows and, and so forth, that would be cheating.

02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:45.880
There was the guy, though, who, uh, who, uh, played on crutches.

02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:46.880
Freestyle's different.

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:48.880
And he mostly PA'd, too.

02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:50.200
Did he?

02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:51.200
Wow.

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:52.200
Yeah.

02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:56.040
I don't, is, is playing with crutches, like, holding the bar, though?

02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:57.040
No.

02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:58.040
No, he had one leg.

02:47:58.040 --> 02:47:59.040
Did he really?

02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:00.040
Yeah.

02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:01.040
Well, that's, I'm, we're not thinking-

02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:02.040
There's a video up on YouTube.

02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:03.040
We're not thinking of the same guy, then.

02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:04.040
So.

02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:07.840
And if it might, I think he's actually from New York.

02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:10.440
It's been a while.

02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:11.720
Does Ramen know him?

02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:12.720
I don't know.

02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:13.720
Probably not.

02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.720
No, but Zaku might.

02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:15.720
All right.

02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:18.720
Well, Rama, we're gonna let you go and, uh, you know, be safe, us 30-year-olds.

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:19.720
Oh, I am.

02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:20.720
Clearly.

02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:21.720
I just have my Geritol Shake.

02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:22.720
I have saved some for you.

02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:23.720
Yeah.

02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:24.720
Thank you.

02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:25.720
I use Insure, but thank you.

02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:26.720
All right.

02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:27.720
All right now.

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:28.720
Bye, Rama.

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:29.720
All right.

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:30.720
Later.

02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:35.800
Well, that, I mean, that's unfortunate, like, you know, I don't care what fucked-up tournament

02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:36.800
he planned.

02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:40.400
I mean, heart attacks suck, you know, that's, that's, that's, I hope he's okay, for God's

02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:41.400
sake.

02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:42.400
Yeah.

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.840
I hope to hell we didn't get a call like that if the poor guy passed away, but I doubt that's

02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:46.440
the case or we would have heard more about it.

02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:47.440
All right.

02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:51.000
So, get well soon, guy, and, and, and plan your tournament six months in advance next

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.400
time and maybe we'll have, be able to actually, uh, save the money from the change in the

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:55.400
couch to go.

02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:57.960
Anyhow, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight.

02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:01.520
If you guys didn't get through, please, you can always feel free to leave us a, um, message

02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:05.960
at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or, of course, the Twitter and, of course, the Facebook and

02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:08.040
all those social networks we interact with.

02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.960
We have eyes and ears everywhere.

02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.560
But for now, it's about time to wrap up the show.

02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:15.760
But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:17.200
Um, I'll start tonight.

02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.720
My final thought is I need Advil or something that will make my back feel better because

02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.720
it sucks.

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.960
I, I have some.

02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:28.680
I might take you up on that or just get, do it when I get home.

02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:31.320
It's, it's not like killing me.

02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:33.120
Otherwise I'd like be going to a doctor tomorrow.

02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.120
But it's just annoying.

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:35.120
It's annoying.

02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:37.400
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:43.240
My final thought is this, um, Doom with, uh, Mega Man looks kind of interesting.

02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:44.240
What?

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:47.960
It's a, uh, Doom mod with, with Mega Man.

02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:50.640
It's got, like, all the 8-bit sprites and everything.

02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:51.640
That's fantastic.

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:52.640
Kind of amazing, actually.

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:54.560
I'm so downloading that.

02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:55.560
Is that out?

02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:56.560
Like, released publicly?

02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:04.640
Um, it's, uh, it's a Deathmatch mod and, um, I'm not sure if it's out yet to download.

02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:13.800
The official website, um, cut, looks like, uh, cutstuff.net slash blog slash question

02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:16.240
mark p equals 1677.

02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:21.680
That'll, uh, pull it up for you and you can check it out.

02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:27.440
And it's, um, it's got a public alpha version right now.

02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:29.080
Mega Man Deathmatch.

02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:32.120
Um, DarkSakurai, your final thought tonight?

02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.600
End of line.

02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:40.200
And, uh, my final thought tonight would be, um, I, oh, no, I already said my final thought.

02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:41.920
I was like, wait, I already said something.

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.640
I thought I was last for a reason.

02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:44.640
Clearly, it's old age.

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:51.000
If you want the direct download, because that URL's kind of hard to find, it'd be cutstuff.net

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:58.880
slash file slash mega DM alpha dot zip, and that'll get you the, um, zip file for that.

02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:02.640
And for the record, I used to play Gotcha Mon Doom.

02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:06.360
You could, like, throw the, the feather and the yo-yo and everything.

02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:07.360
That's cool.

02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:08.360
Wow.

02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.160
That takes a lot of dedication to make something like that.

02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:11.160
It's pretty impressive.

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:15.720
I was, this was years ago, like, before I moved out here.

02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:19.920
Uh, and I also need to say, as I do every week, thank you guys very much for tuning

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:23.200
into Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.

02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.160
Without you guys, this would not be possible.

02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:29.520
Remember, we don't have any fancy website, multimillion dollar magazine or game company

02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:30.520
backing us up.

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:34.520
There's three of us do this because we love you and we love doing this broadcasting thing.

02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:38.600
So all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show and how to spread the word.

02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:40.120
And pizza would be nice too.

02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:41.800
Order us pizza for next show.

02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:42.800
So we'll see.

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:46.240
I like vegetarian, just letting you know.

02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:47.240
We'll see if that happens.

02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:49.640
Anyhow, we'll be here to do it all again next week.

02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:52.000
Uh, in the meantime, I'm Rob.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000
She's Jamie.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
He's Loki.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.180
We're out.

02:51:55.180 --> 02:51:58.120
But Jamie has to say, end of line.

02:51:58.120 --> 02:52:02.320
