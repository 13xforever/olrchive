Tonight, November 22, 2009, both Sony consoles get some new firmware, will Microsoft face a lawsuit over their recent bannings, or will you soon get to simulate Sonic the Hedgehog
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me every week, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How are you doing?
My hands are sore.
From what?
From crocheting.
Crocheting?
Yes.
Is that what they're calling it now?
Oh no, I see you actually have yarn there that you are crocheting something.
What is that?
I'm making a potholder.
Are they kitten mittens?
No.
Oh, okay.
Actually, this is just my practice sheet because I'm probably going to put it over there with my dolls or something.
My mom...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, now, though, I found tutorials on how to do, like, hats and stuff.
So, I think I'm going to make hats for everyone for the holidays.
Oh, fun.
So everyone gets a hat.
Everyone gets a hat!
I'm poor.
Everyone gets a hat.
I wish I could say that OLR was started out of spite, but OLR was started because we were really bored.
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
How are you, Loki?
I'm good.
Any knitting going on in your neck of the woods?
Crocheting?
Sorry, excuse me.
No.
By the way, though, I know you catch that Kitten Mittens reference, and I watched that episode last night, finally, because they have that on the... It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on On Demand.
I was watching it.
LOL.
That's all I have to say.
LOL is all I have to say.
They're selling them.
Is that a real website?
Yeah, it's a real website.
You can buy dick towels.
Love it.
Do your cat make too much noise?
Modern Family
I love.
That show is hilarious.
Glee is great.
It tickles my gay fancy.
There's just been a lot of great shows this year.
V has been pretty cool.
I hear it's sacrilege to the original, but since I didn't watch the original, I'm not as attached.
I don't know how DarkSakura feels about the new V, but I'm loving it.
I like it okay.
If I had never seen the original, then yeah.
But I actually watched the original, all of them, when they aired.
I hope Sci-Fi Network airs them or something so I can go back and watch it.
I've actually got DVDs.
So if you ever want to have a V-party.
That would actually rock.
My roommate is really interested in watching the old one too.
One of the aliens was played by Robert England.
Nice.
The funny, silly one, Willy.
I heard about that.
Yeah.
I heard about that.
His first thing he says, can you help me?
I am just.
There's a clip on YouTube of the hamster scene.
Diana opening her mouth up and swallowing the guinea pig.
Yes.
Amazing.
I hope they reference that in the new one.
Anyway, sorry.
OMG spoilers!
Not really, though.
Because we don't know what's going to happen in the new one.
The new one's taking a lot of liberties with the old one.
But if I'm right, it's the same guy doing some of the writing.
Yeah, and the other half of the creative minds behind the new V is the folks that did the 4400, which was a pretty good sci-fi show on USA, if you ever saw that.
And one of the lead actors is from it, too.
But I'll tell you what, though.
If I sit you down through the original series, then you have to read the book that I got, the guy who wrote the original series.
And you can tell he's obviously a screenplay writer, but he wrote a book finishing it the way he wanted to finish it instead of how the final battle was.
This would be the perfect post-Thanksgiving plan if I didn't already have plans.
Well, I have plans on Friday night anyway.
Don't.
Yeah, me too.
Saturday.
I can't.
I'm going to be gone for the weekend.
Well, you're no fun.
I know.
I know.
Monday.
But I'll be back Sunday.
But we have the show.
Sunday morning.
We'll figure something out.
Sunday morning, bagels and V. We'll figure something out.
Maybe.
If I'm back in time.
We'll see.
We'll get jelly donuts and pretend that they're hamsters.
Okay.
and watch our lizard people.
I would say this, though.
V would make a pretty kick-ass video game.
Spoiler!
They're lizards!
V would make a pretty kick-ass video game.
I think there was one.
Was there really?
I think that there was one on... I bet there was one on the Apple IIe or some shit.
That's what I want to say.
Let me find out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I actually did not play any well.
Because, again, I have to remind myself that I still have the game.
Actually, no, I take that back.
I did pull it up.
And then I had to go somewhere.
I played some Sims.
I've watched Dan play through some Modern Warfare 2 and ODST.
And he got these awesome headphones.
I love them.
They're the best present he ever got himself for me.
Because I can't hear a damn thing that's going on on the TV when I'm trying to sleep.
No subwoofer going BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM Whenever I'm trying to go to bed Especially now since I have to go back to being at work at 6am But I've been playing a lot of Peggle I've actually really gotten back into playing a lot of Solitaire
I'm trying to learn how to play the Baker's Game on Solitaire and Spider Solitaire, which I kind of don't like.
And now I'm crocheting.
Isn't Spider Solitaire included with Windows XP?
Yeah, but whatever.
They only have themselves to blame.
They should have called it Solitaire 2.
I also... Now this is something I'm going to try to do because it is kind of gaming related since I miss playing Breakout on my Linux box.
Because you can play Break... You can just download it.
I sent my laptop back to be fixed and I swear if they put that Windows shit back on it...
I am going to start off that laptop booting Linux, installing Linux, and then asking them for a refund of my Windows license.
I found out you can do that.
If you never boot up Windows, when you order anything from Dell and put in a different OS on it, you can put in, as long as you've got proof and everything, you can put in for a refund of your Windows license so that you do not have to, if you're not paying for Windows, if you're not using Windows, why should you have to pay for it?
Interesting.
I just always assumed because it was part of what you were buying.
Sometimes you buy maybe a bundle of movies.
For instance, recently I bought the Star Trek Next Generation bundle of Blu-rays because I wanted all the movies on Blu-ray.
I didn't really need Nemesis, but it just comes with it, so I might as well take it, right?
That's kind of a different thing because you pay, I think, $150 for a Windows license when you get Vista.
and Vista XP.
XP came on my laptop.
I didn't use it.
I actually, I never used it.
Quick side question.
What do you think of Google OS?
Because there was a lot of news about that this week.
I'm not using that shit.
Kind of based on Linux.
Really?
It looked interesting.
I think what they're going for with the whole netbook thing, I could not see myself using it on a desktop.
I might give it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I am as happy as I could humanly be with Linux Mint on my laptop.
DarkSakura.com
I remember that was funny.
But no, in this case, it's like you could have multiple monitors hooked up or you could just go slide.
Hold it down and slide it over and it's like, gives you a little arrow, pick your desktop.
You can have it show up in a cube.
So you can rotate your cube and pick the screen that you want.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Doom
Doom and Doom 2 they opened the source code so they actually have them on Linux and so I was thinking about going back into Hurt Me Plenty mode just because I love the name of Hurt Me Plenty and Ultraviolence
All right.
Comments from chat.
Got to start reading some comments from chat because there's some good stuff here.
They built this into the app now.
If you click on the schedule button, connect to chat, there's a new function.
Now, allgames.com has their own chat room.
And for whatever reason, I can't even explain this.
It's a historical thing.
I don't know.
We have our separate chat room from Orange Lounge Radio.
But they actually built it into their chat room.
So if you type slash OLR, you join our chat room.
Isn't that neat?
I thought that was very cool and they didn't have to do that.
So whatever you want to do to connect to the chat room, do it.
I think I might have to just randomly hop into the chat room while I'm at work.
I got Linux Mint because of Jamie and so did my best friend and it's a great alternate OS even for us PC gamers
So there you go, a little endorsement there.
Another thing too that I really like, since we're kind of on the subject of games and Linux Mint, is that a lot of PC and Mac environment stuff, they actually do have clients that you can run within Mint to sort of emulate Windows.
Basically,
I'm trying to remember what exactly it's called I want to say the wine environment and there's a few others but like I've seen screenshots of people playing you know Sims on Linux and so there's all kinds of ways around it so you can actually I think with Linux you can have the best of all the worlds but the best thing about it is that you really don't run into having to worry about spyware or all this other crap because people are like well fuck it's Linux who uses that
And I got to say this, Linux Mint, it's a nice little friendly sounding name too.
It's much more friendly than say like Linux Anchovies or Linux Meatloaf or Turkey Surprise.
Another good thing about it is that it is made understanding that you're going to have users coming from Windows or Mac backgrounds and that it's very easy.
In fact, when you have to do a kernel update, I've done two kernel updates and it's
Freaking easy.
And if you have a problem with one, you have the option when you boot up of picking an earlier kernel so you can go back and modify it.
So if you get something that may say, oh, well, we'll optimize your memory better, then you can download that one and run it.
Or we'll optimize your graphics better, then you can download that one and run it.
It depends on what you want to do.
It's like super customizable.
I love it.
Alright, other comments from our chatroom.
TigerClaw was unable to find anything on a V video game, so I'm convinced it doesn't exist, because TigerClaw has the best Google Foo skills of, I think, any of our listeners.
However, uh-oh, Jamie's ready to throw down.
But, TigerClaw does say, I saw a Q&A from the VentureBeat site about video game creator Jace Hall, and it does mention about a potential video game based on V. And he links to an article over there in our chatroom.
So, there you go.
All right, more gaming weeks.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Still very slow.
Just playing Grand Theft Auto still.
Actually, haven't really played a lot of other stuff.
Still trying to get a chance to play Borderlands, but I keep getting distracted by working on the arcade cabinet, which is coming along quite well.
It's actually... I got all the ROMs on there, all the themes I could find for Hyper Spin on there.
Now, I was actually this morning going through and taking out some of the themes that are for clones and stuff like that, because I'm...
I'm going to try once I get everything on there because I just kind of downloaded all the ROMs for MAME all at once because I didn't know really what I wanted.
So I'm just like, okay, I'll just get everything.
Makes it simple.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That's why I started today and just had to compile a new version of MAME that actually gets rid of the NAG screen and that kind of stuff.
But I got to test a few things out.
I tested a little bit of Street Fighter this weekend.
I tried a little bit of King of Fighters because I'm trying to do a different setup for my Neo Geo stuff.
And...
I don't know, it all seems to play very nice, so that'll be cool.
Just really kind of working on that for now, I guess, until I, I don't know, move on to something else.
Hold on, Jamie wants to butt in here, because Jamie, what'd you find?
You found something on the internets?
DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
And then... Funny.
And then there was this one, also in the ZX Spectrum 48k.
But the one in 1986 was the better of them.
I will link this other link in the chatroom.
Alright.
Because it has the picture of the lizard person face.
Better luck next time to our dear pal, Tigerclaw.
Alright.
Sorry, Loki.
Anything else for your gaming week?
No, that's pretty much it.
Yeah.
Alright.
My gaming week was more of the same.
I've still been playing WoW and all that other crap I play week in and week out.
But I did spend some quality time with a new game that I decided to check out this week based on some happy, positive things I was reading around the internet.
And that game is Torchlight, which is a game that is by some of the team that worked on Diablo and Diablo 2 back in the day.
Diablo Xenoblade
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then you can step it up to basically you know hurt me plenty and so forth like there is in Doom although of course they're called other things in this game you know again I honestly I couldn't even really pay attention to what the plot was in the game because I just kept thinking this is this is so much like Diablo but it feels like you know kind of like a new
Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 5
I think it's worth just trying the demo, because the demo will entertain you for like two hours at least, and it's free.
So go grab it on Steam and see if you like it.
You've got no reason not to.
Again, I really want to encourage, even though the game does have its drawbacks, that there's no multiplayer, and that was what made Diablo 2 such a huge thing, for $20, the value is awesome.
Because Diablo 2, they still charge...
Thanks for watching!
I'm going to co-host a radio show about video games.
I probably need to make sure I play a lot of games.
But it can be an expensive habit because remember, video games, unlike your favorite websites out there, video game companies do not send copies of games to us for free.
Very rarely.
It's happened before, but very rarely.
So usually that type of game playing is coming out of our own pockets and the economy is taking its toll on us here at OLR just like it has anyone else.
So we'll try our best though.
We certainly will try to play as many demos and all that fun stuff as we can.
Thanks for watching!
Let's see.
Questions from the chat room at chat.orangezonsradio.com Ricky GoMac asks, does WoW work on a Mac?
Yes, it works on a Mac.
World of Warcraft works on a Mac.
In fact, Blizzard is one of those companies that's always been very good about getting their games to work on PC and Mac.
I want to say, I don't know so much about Diablo.
I can't state for sure that one, but I think like Warcraft 3 plays on both and all the future WoW expansions play on both.
So there you go.
Deekman in chat says, loving Torchlight.
It's the first Diablo-like game I've ever liked.
Before we get into gaming news tonight, and speaking of Deekman, I do want to take a minute to acknowledge and further thank the masterminds behind our website, and that's Deekman and VXJasonXV.
They both do kind of separate stuff for our website.
VXJasonXV kind of does the server admin stuff, whereas Deekman's kind of like in charge of the actual website itself.
And both of them...
DarkSakura
Album Art for Us
that's great because I was just thinking earlier this evening and to segue into this we now have a Facebook fan page an official Facebook fan page is out there now although we've always had a Facebook group um Facebook about a year ago we really should have jumped on this when it first started made it a lot easier to make like a fan page where we can deliver updates to your feed and we promise we're not going to spam like crazy you know we'll do it tastefully uh
and just kind of have a central hub that I think will work a little more better functionality-wise to have like an OLR fan page.
So we've added that on Facebook and we're trying to get up to 100 fans because once we get 100 fans, that's when our little like, that's when we move into the next stage of having a fan page.
We can have like a short URL and all the statistics.
It's kind of like in Spore, how you have different levels.
You know, your little cell becomes a living creature.
See, we're in the cell game right now.
Once we get up to 100 fans,
fans will actually get to build a creature.
That's basically what we're waiting for.
So check that out on Facebook.
It's awful.
It's awful, awful, awful.
I was such a big Dragon Ball Z fan back in the day that when you said Cell Game, I instantly started thinking of that.
No, not Cell Shaded.
But you know the game that's like Flow?
No, Cell Game.
There was a whole arc called the Cell Game.
Oh, okay.
Gotcha.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, I'm considering ripping off one of my favorite bands.
TigerClaw in chat says, it won't be long until someone makes an official OLR iPhone app.
You know, I don't have the first idea how to do something like that.
But hey, if you're interested in that sort of thing, you're into development, we can give it our blessing.
Just show us what your ideas are and we'll help promote the crap out of it.
All we ask is that it's a free app because, you know, the show's free.
So we'll have to figure out other ways to pay you, such as love and adoration.
I don't know.
Anyhow.
Porn.
We will pay you in porn.
We'll pay you in porn.
Tribble porn.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Tribble porn is just watching them eat.
I think that's all the housekeeping I wanted to get into tonight.
Facebook fan page, which I'll link in chat shortly if someone else hasn't already done it.
And all that fun stuff.
And Twitter, of course, we're on there.
OLR and all that great stuff.
Let's get on.
Did you drop your yarn?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, we had some updates from Sony Online.
They were covering the PlayStation Network in a big ol' presentation, which of course they put out on the internet as well.
There's some interesting changes that they're talking about making and some other ways they're planning on expanding the Sony online brand.
One of the things that they're planning on doing, of course, is expanding the PlayStation Network infrastructure to non-gaming devices.
And what that means is you may see connectivity with, say, Sony-branded TVs, perhaps, Sony VAIO computers, who knows, mobile devices, possibly Sony phones.
So, you know, it's interesting, I guess.
And they're going to try to kind of connect everything together that way.
I'm always wondering if they should just change the name of the PlayStation Network since, you know, like maybe Sony Online Network or something like that.
I don't know.
One of the other things that's also going on is they're trying to also kind of create a brand with this, you know, online network as well.
And...
They're saying that one of the major selling points of the PlayStation Network is also all the features like downloading games, music, and movies and whatnot.
And they're thinking that expanding that to all their devices would be a good value for the customers.
Kind of a little bit like how iTunes works and stuff where you can download stuff to your... What is it?
The...
I think your media center for iPhone... Apple TV, is that what they call it?
Yeah.
You can download stuff to that.
I don't know.
It's interesting.
Well, I mean, this is Sony's whole thing this year is this whole it only does everything.
Well, that whole thing, it only does everything, you know, is that they're trying to sell this machine based on only game.
It will not make me waffles.
I've tried.
It looks like a Foreman grill and it doesn't make me waffles.
It does look like a Foreman grill, so it'll at least look like a grill.
But not so much now, though.
It's slightly slimmer.
It's like a Foreman slim, you know.
But this is their whole marketing thing this year, which, you know, to be fair, we've given Sony its fair share of shit on this show.
And, you know, like I always say, and like we always say, we will razz a gaming company when they deserve to get razzed, but we'll give them praise when they deserve to get praised.
And I think Sony is finally getting it this year.
You know, they've done a lot of smart things this year, and one of them is this whole It Only Does Everything campaign, because I think that's really the PlayStation 3 strength.
I think it really does do everything.
I want it to play good games.
Which it doesn't really do.
No, there's a lot of good games on PlayStation 3.
I don't know.
It doesn't do everything, but it does do a lot.
So...
I want it to do things well.
I still say Blu-ray is worth more weight than I think a lot of people gives it credit for.
I'm not trying to be a Sony fanboy.
All I use my PS3 for is the Blu-ray.
It doesn't have any games on it that are really good that we can't already get on Xbox 360.
LittleBigPlanet, Demon's Souls, some of the PlayStation Network games like Fat Princess, PixelJunk.
Oh my god.
That was my favorite game that came out last year.
But then now, a few years later, like, hey, wait a second, I just bought a bunch of DVDs.
Why am I going to go buy Blu-rays?
So they haven't really adopted it as much.
It does help sell the system, but it's also not really something that kind of, I don't know, it's not a huge driving force for it.
Well, on top of that, you can also, for people who want a Blu-ray player, you can get better Blu-ray players for cheaper than a PS3 costs.
But, that being said though, it's a lot easier to update your Blu-ray player or even with the PlayStation 3 firmwares and stuff.
I hear a lot of complaints from people, oh yeah, I bought this Blu-ray disc and I went and popped it into my player and I need a new firmware update.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I'm thinking, well, that's cool for people that want to get into Blu-ray.
You know, certainly that's much cheaper than a PlayStation 3, but I'm thinking in the back of my mind, does this thing connect to the internet?
Is it going to have Blu-ray Live?
And you know, granted, how many people really use that Blu-ray Live stuff?
Probably a minority.
So, you know, the average family will probably be able to do just fine with this player without it, but you make a good point about the firmware, is that unlike DVDs,
Thanks for watching!
and DarkSakura.com.
I don't think they're going to just all of a sudden change the whole service to being paid, but there may be certain aspects, optional aspects that you may have to pay for later on down the road.
But of course, they haven't announced anything officially yet, but it's something that's probably going to come.
And then finally, Sony's expecting the PlayStation Network to pull in 50 billion yen in their 2009 financial year.
and of course they're saying that right now they've got 33 million registered accounts on the PlayStation Network which is a lot more than they have actual systems out there so of course people have multiple accounts because you can make as many as you want.
I have four.
They have a high ratio of active users about 5.4 million daily unique user sign-ins and 1.4 million daily PlayStation Store visits.
And of course, downloading volume has been increasing.
25 petabyte downloads a month.
That's a lot of downloads.
And of course, their digital sales is really growing.
Go into some comments from our chatroom.
DJ Ranma S is actually correcting me.
The Black Friday Magnavox player that's at Walmart, $78, not $98.
It's a good price.
It's not bad at all for a Blu-ray player.
You have to make sure it's a good...
And, you know, it's going to be bottom of the barrel if it's $78.
Let's face it.
Come on.
I mean, get what you pay for.
GameGuru says in chat, this firmware junk is going to kill Blu-ray.
It just makes Blu-ray more complicated than DVD.
You know, I got to be honest.
I don't know if I see it that same way because I don't, you know, that whole firmware thing is not very well advertised.
I think a lot of people don't know.
You know, I put it in the same vein as HDTV.
That's even worse, though, if they don't know because then they're going to pop in.
Say they go rent a movie and they pop it in.
They're like, what the fuck?
I can't play it.
and then they're pissed off.
Yeah, but they've already bought the Blu-ray player.
It doesn't matter.
They're still pissed off, though, and now they're just like, fuck it, I'm just going to buy my movies on DVD.
Well, okay, my other thought, though, is that...
The HDTVs.
You know, a lot of these, this is going to be a huge thing this holiday season too, is HDTVs.
And you see this in a lot of Black Friday ads, is that HDTVs are coming as low as like $200, $300.
But what a lot of people don't realize about those very cheap HDTVs is that a lot of them are 720p.
Those TVs are only capable of 720p, which is considered high def.
And to most people, they're probably never going to notice the difference.
Like, Grandma...
is going to notice the difference from her old TV, but she's not going to know that she's missing 1080.
She's not going to notice that that's missing.
Like, for instance, even the HDTV I own, because I adopted kind of early and still try to keep it cheap, my HDTV won't do 1080p.
It'll do 1080i, but it won't do 1080p.
And I'm kind of at that point where I'm like, dang, I wish I'd gotten a TV that did 1080p.
Honestly, you're not going to be able to tell unless your TV is like 60 inches and, I mean... Which it's not.
And so that's why I haven't replaced it, but, you know.
But the reason why I bring that up, I think a lot of people that go out and buy these deals and buy these TVs don't know that what they're getting is not the, I guess you could say, quote, quote, real high def or the high, high def or whatever you want to call it.
And, you know, folks in chat are saying, do you really need 1080p?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just weird.
I can tell the difference, but just barely, but I can tell.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
PSP, PSP, PSP, PSP
and so forth.
Japan will get their manga service very soon.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
PS3, I would say, got a significantly bigger update, unless, of course, you're a big comics book fan.
PlayStation 3 got firmware 3.10, and some of the big changes they made in this is that now you can pick a color for your little friends card, or whatever they call it, and that's also what shows up in the bar as you scroll through your friends list, and you can elect your own color.
This took me a little while to find how to do this, so just a tip from me to you.
Go in and view your own card on your own friends list.
And then you'll notice on the side is a little color swatch thing.
And you can pick that, and you can pick between 20 different colors.
I picked green, of course, because my PlayStation 3 name is Green Sky, so it would make sense to pick green.
And then some other folks picked other colors.
I see my friends list filling up with colors.
And of course, the other big, big change is that they now have Facebook integration.
And
This is where now you can't really view Facebook on your PlayStation 3 unless it's through the web browser.
And they do say they made changes or updates to the web browser to make Facebook more friendly.
But don't expect to see it streamlined in your cross-media bar or anything.
No, I would say your PlayStation 3 will now serve as Bejeweled Blitz.
Farmville, Mafia Wars.
It will now publish to your profile.
The nice thing is, though, there are different settings, so you can set it, and you can turn them on or off, whatever it's going to do.
So you can set it to publish trophies to your profile.
I think that's the one I have turned on.
You can set it to publish whenever you download things from the store to your profile, and that would include demos.
I turned that one off because that's kind of private.
I don't want anybody...
Porn!
Yeah.
More stuff for me to block.
And that's what a lot of people are saying.
More stuff for me to hide.
I went ahead and turned on the trophies because I said, okay, this isn't much different from the Bejeweled Blitz trophies.
And if people are going to publish those, then I can publish my trophies.
But the rest of it I turned off for now.
By the way, also, one other non-advertised update in firmware 3.10, now you can actually report your errors directly to Sony.
Kind of like when your Windows system crashes in a program, you can click a button to submit information to Microsoft, that whole type of thing is built into your PS3.
It's been hard for a lot of the gaming blogs to test, because you can't really force your PlayStation 3 to crash very easy, but Sony assures that that functionality is in there.
So maybe you'll hear more about that later.
Also not widely talked about, there is a new photo application that you can download into your media bar.
I haven't played a whole lot with this, but it basically kicks your photo viewing up to the next level.
It does some different things with the gallery and the viewing.
And one feature of your PlayStation 3, maybe you've never thought of before, you could have it cycle through photographs while you're at a party or something and be a virtual picture frame.
If you're into that.
I don't know.
Not everybody wants to show off their pictures like that, but just an idea.
of how you could use that.
So lots of updates to the various Sony platforms this week.
Well, in Virtual Console there's been some updates that I'm pretty sure are making people happy.
Coming on the 23rd, we get to see the SNES Mario Kart for 800 points.
That's pretty cool.
I guess they're trying to give us more things to be thankful for.
Also coming out, even though there's not a date for it, is the SNES version of Pilotwings and the N64 Smash Bros.
Prices and dates are pending.
That's pretty cool.
Do you guys notice a trend here with Nintendo like in the past month?
I don't know if anyone else has picked up on this, but they've been really trying to do a lot of this fan service in the past month.
And I'm not sure if this has any correlation to the holidays or what's going on.
Loki, I'd be curious your thought on this.
I mean, look at this.
You have all these fan games they're promising to deliver now.
All the games we've been wanting since Virtual Console first launched.
Pilotwings, Mario Kart, Smash Bros., etc.
And, you know, we just got Final Fantasy last month and so forth.
We're getting a lot of these big, big games on Virtual Console.
and we're finally seeing awesome updates to 8-bit games like we wish they'd done a long time ago with Excitebike.
And finally, demos for WiiWare games.
All this happening in the past two months.
What gives?
Well, I think it's just about time that they put them on there and also just some stuff for Christmas that kind of people, you know, get people interested, especially people that just buy new systems, you know, they get them interested in what's coming out.
So maybe to kind of entice these people that are jumping ship to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this Christmas.
I think it's just a matter of time that they've released this stuff.
I don't know.
Comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com Actdeft says, yeah, Super Mario Kart, Pilotwings sucks though.
Bite your tongue, I love Pilotwings.
Now, didn't they have Pilotwings 64 on there?
I don't know if that's on Virtual Console.
I have yet to check that out, if it's there.
I never played Pilotwings 64.
I just remember the old school one.
That was a launch title on Super Nintendo, if I remember right.
They should do some new, like, Mario Kart games.
Like, do a new Mario Kart game done the Super NES way or something like that with, like, you know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I love Pilotwings.
Even though there was only maybe five or six different sports you could do in there, the game went on for a while, and it was a very, very hard game.
I loved Pilotwings.
That was one of the best Super Nintendo games.
I think that's one I don't have, actually.
The launch games on Super Nintendo all held up really freaking well.
Like, amongst almost any console I can think of, I think the Super Nintendo has had some of the best launch titles.
I mean, think about it.
Mario World, F- No, actually, I don't think Mario World technically launched for the console.
If I remember right, that came out a couple weeks later.
It was a holiday bundle.
I think the only games that launched with the system were F-Zero and Pilotwings.
I could be wrong on that.
It's been many, many years.
It's been a good 15-some-odd years since that console launched.
But I seem to recall that F-Zero and Pilotwings were the launch titles.
And they were both awesome, awesome games.
Loki, let's move on with some more news.
Yes, and it's kind of funny, though.
No, we...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And of course, you know, as you would expect, because it is a PC title, hackers have already gotten their hands on it and have pretty much fixed the problems, actually.
They have actually enabled their own dedicated servers and also some other cheats or whatnot or fun stuff to play around with on the dedicated servers as well, including like super jumps, you know.
Infinite Ammo, Rapid Fire Grenades, all sorts of crazy stuff.
But it's actually pretty awesome, at least now that you can actually play your own dedicated servers.
And that should make a lot of fans happy as well.
In fact, I remember seeing they were showing the sales for the PC version of Modern Warfare 2.
And actually, it didn't seem like the sales were affected too much by any sort of boycott.
And that's kind of also...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and one of the other things that they've found out as well kind of with all the hacking and stuff is that there's some new game modes that haven't quite been unveiled yet possibly stuff that they're going to patch in later on including
New mode, VIP, which apparently is very similar to Counter-Strike.
Capture the flag with, I guess, a single flag between two teams.
And Global Thermonuclear War, which one side has to capture the nuke and hold it for a certain amount of time in order to win.
And, of course, this stuff you can enable using the...
Hacked In, Debug Console which is in there which is kind of cool and the thought is that this is going to come out later on as possible download content perhaps maybe even on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions as well so it makes sense that they would add value to it later on but it's kind of neat though that this stuff is already there I guess, I don't know, people don't like pay to unlock content too much but if this is going to be a free patch later on that might be kind of cool
But if we gotta pay for it, that kinda sucks.
I don't know.
Didn't we already kinda suspect that this was where the game was going, is that we're gonna have to pay for all this extra stuff, which is why they locked it out in the first place?
Yeah.
And I kinda think it's funny, it only took them like a week or two to actually unlock all this stuff that's on there.
I mean, it just goes to show you, you piss people off enough, especially in the PC versions, you know, there's hackers out there that will find a way around it to get the game to do what they want.
And, you know, that kind of
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and it's just one of those things with the technology the way it is now it's just not possible it is not possible to keep this stuff hidden from hackers especially you know and a lot of this sometimes comes to you know I hate to revisit a topic that's years old but I think it's partially relevant
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and lo and behold, if you left the data on the disk, it was going to be discovered.
All a hacker had to do was put that pointer back in.
And go into Rockstar.
I mean, all their stuff's kind of lazy coding anyways because everything is in text files.
They're easily editable.
I should know.
If you want something taken out of your game, you have to take it out of the game.
It's crazy.
Toa Gak and Chad ask a question.
Wasn't there like porno hidden on a disc for some console and the author got sued?
I don't remember.
There was one, I think it was like Bloody Roar 2 on the PlayStation 1 had some sort of like erotic pictures or something like that of the actual characters or something like that in there.
I want to say that was the game that had that.
And then of course there was, you know, SimCopter with all the, you know, gay sex or whatever.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I remember.
No, SimTower, wasn't it?
No, SimCopter.
Was it Copter?
Yeah.
Funny.
Well, anyhow, moving on to something not so funny.
Lawsuits, and what some might actually consider a frivolous lawsuit.
I don't know.
You be the judge.
Apparently, there is a law firm out there, Abington IP.
They're investigating what they call a convenient...
Waves of Xbox Live Bannings
and well after Halo 3 ODST came out this was to make Microsoft as much money as possible because clearly that was the motivation behind this whole thing.
Now, this is weird because they're trying to do this class action lawsuit here that apparently they're going to try and get a refund for the pro-rated what was left on your Xbox Live subscription.
But it's weird because they didn't really ban the accounts, did they?
No, and that's the thing is they didn't understand it.
What they thought was their thinking behind it is that people expecting to play these games online or whatever bought more of a subscription for their accounts in preparation for these new games coming out.
And because of that, then Microsoft went ahead and decided to ban consoles Well, they're totally ignoring the fact that, one, these people modded their consoles in the first place So, you know, they're responsible for it You know, they need to know what's going on and, you know I mean, come on, if you mod your console, you know at one point or another Especially if you're playing it online, that you're going to get banned eventually
By the way, Microsoft responded this week, or just actually today, I should say, made a response to this whole thing.
Basically, to sum it all up, they say that they have every legal recourse to do what they did.
They were well within their legal rights.
That's a quote.
Well within their legal rights.
Of course they were.
And that's why this whole thing is really retarded because, once again, they aren't banning their live accounts.
They're just banning the console from connecting on live.
And at the same time, kind of removing a little bit of the features of the console, but nothing major, like you can't install your games to the hard drive anymore, which, whatever, that's fine.
And also that, obviously the console can't connect to the live anymore, and you can't take your profile from the console or whatever to earn achievements offline and then move them and connect them online, whatever, because it's corrupt.
Although there is a workaround for that.
but isn't this all in the agreements that you accept when you play games that you're not going to fuck around if you have your console modded you're playing burned games whether it be a backup of your game whether it be a modded copy of the game or a pirated version of the game you're playing burned games and that's unfortunately you know
They're just assuming that you're a pirate.
And I mean, probably 99% of the people out there are pirating games.
Especially if their console's modded.
Now what sucks is the people that say didn't know their console's modded, bought it, used, and then they get banned.
That kind of sucks.
But then again, once it, you know... But that would be a reason to sue where you bought it from, not a reason to sue Microsoft.
Exactly.
Buyer beware.
Buyer beware, and then... Although I'm sure, yeah, and I'm sure a lot of these used places probably have clauses in their contracts too that protect them.
Yeah, and people also trying to return these consoles, you know, to stores or whatever, trying to exchange them out for a good one.
Of course, you know, if that security seal is tampered with that, you know, you can't return it.
Of course, you can always buy a new security seal to throw on top of it and then return it, but hey, that's another story.
Dirty, dirty.
But yeah, there's a lot of things out there that you can do.
But really, it comes down to it's the user's fault.
They knew what they were getting into.
And you know what?
If you really want to go legit and buy another console, you can do that.
And then you can take your account, restore your account to the new console, and you're good to go.
I had two consoles banned this week.
We used to play modded Grand Theft Auto games.
So all four of our consoles are modded.
So far though, only two of them have been banned.
And that's fine.
I mean, because I knew that was going to happen and we have preparations for that.
But the thing is, I went and bought a new console, restored my account, took like a few minutes, and I was good to go.
I mean, there's no real issues.
I mean, later on I have to actually go through there and change the...
So that all my download content works on my new console without being logged in live.
I'll eventually do that, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
This almost sounds like a game to you.
This whole getting around it and everything.
You're definitely not pissed off about this.
You knew the risks going into this.
I knew it was eventually going to happen.
We were playing a modified game, so basically all the stealth crap...
And to be clear, this is the number one reason why you're doing this in the first place, is not to pirate the games like crazy, but because you are modding the Grand Theft Auto games for lols.
And it's not something you typically take online, although it sounds like you did, and that's what got you in trouble.
Well, yeah, because we had to play, you know, we played against each other.
And you can only play that online.
If it was a System Link game, like say if I could do that with Saints Row, we would have never taken it online.
We would have just been playing, you know, via LANs.
and I wish I knew how to mod Saints Row 2 because I'd do that.
But we can't.
And that's also funny too because when our consoles got banned we played Saints Row 2 because we didn't have to connect to live.
We've got a backup game for everything.
So it's an inconvenience but I know what I'm getting into and whatever.
Luckily my first console got banned.
My sister has a modded console.
She doesn't play online because she doesn't have internet.
So I...
I get her games and I gave her a modded copy of Grand Theft Auto and she plays that, but hers is red-ringed and I haven't got a chance to fix it yet, so I just gave her my band console and it works just fine for her because she doesn't give a crap.
She doesn't know anything about connecting to live and whatnot.
She just wants to play a game where you fly around in a police car.
Quick question from Togak in our chatroom, chat.orange.com and I don't even know if he can answer this, Loki.
How do they know if your console is modded?
Has it been revealed how they're catching it?
Um, they, they can tell, basically, it doesn't matter how, if you're playing a burn game or not, because, you know, we, honestly, we haven't played Grand Theft Auto, the modded game, since...
August, I mean, whenever they patched it last.
They can tell because the modded firmwares or whatever, they don't return the same values for some of the security checks or whatever.
They aren't sure what exactly is going wrong, but there is something in there that is not returning the exact value or something when they're doing a check of the disk.
So they can tell what firmware you have on the drive.
They can't actually read the firmware on the drive,
They know, because they're fucking Microsoft
I got a quick question for you though, because you work in retail and all this stuff.
Have you had people try to return Xbox 360 consoles that have been banned to you?
No.
Do you have a way to catch them?
They know that I would pimp slap them.
You're well known in your retail company's business for pimp slapping people that try to do that.
For slapping the hoes.
Honestly enough, if somebody brought me a console that was banned, and I tested it, and it worked, since we don't connect the consoles to live as part of the test...
we wouldn't know but just take them to GameStop they can't fucking tell they're too stupid to be allowed to live
The views and opinions expressed by Dan do not necessarily reflect those of the staff at Warren's On Radio.
Yes, they do.
You can tell because what they do is they can connect to Xbox's website.
There's the whole repair thing that you can connect to, and you can actually put in your serial number and you'll see if your console's banned or not.
Because when you try to enter your console's serial number in there, it'll say, sorry, your console's banned, fuck you, and that type of stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Steam actually now has approximately 70% of the overall digital distribution of PC games.
And that's actually quite a bit.
And they're actually saying that the other ones like Impulse is 10% and others combined are 20%.
So that's in terms of actual revenue.
It's pretty crazy stuff.
Half-Life, you know, all these huge PC games.
I mean, that's clearly got to be part of the contribution.
Whereas I think all these other companies don't quite have the same tie-in like Valve and Steam do.
Well, the other thing too is that they're also saying that a lot of the games integrate the Steamworks tools into their games early on so that they can lock them out from other distribution platforms.
And also, it's because of how successful their DRM solution is.
So, it's pretty big.
Yeah, because Steam's whole thing, and I haven't played a whole lot with this, but apparently it's very easy to take what you've kind of downloaded and go to another computer and install the software.
I don't think you could do it unlimited, but it gives you somewhat some freedom onto how many computers you can do this with.
Because it's set by your account.
Yeah, exactly.
My only thing is that...
My only complaint about Steam, being a long-time user of it, I'm not a big fan of the interface.
I kind of wish that demos were easier to find.
I don't know, the layout of the store is not exactly eye-catching or appealing to me.
I don't know, it's hard for me to put my finger on, but it's just not the most user-friendly front-end, the store anyway, to me.
I think it could be a little flashier.
I don't know if what I said makes any sense at all, but that's just kind of my thoughts on Steam.
It's kind of sometimes hard to find things.
Sometimes, yeah.
I think it tries to be cut and dried, but in some cases it does overcomplicate a few things just with the demo mixed in and everything.
You know, how they have everything just mixed in and you have to really filter it.
Bond in chat says they make you jump through hoops to get the demo.
And I think it's related to this.
Oh, talking about like audio surf specifically.
You know, I didn't have a hard time with the Torchlight demo at all.
There's a little button there on the side.
But I think it would be neat if they just kind of like just had a screen.
You know, new demos to check out.
You know, and I don't know.
Like, I don't know.
I would just lay it out a little differently.
That's all.
but otherwise I love the idea that they took that whole what was that other gaming platform that you could bring X game or something what was that called X something there was something that you could bring up inside other video games and chat with people yeah I remember the X-Fire X-Fire thank you that's what's called X-Fire they kind of molded that with a video game store and that I think was a smart idea so
Anyhow, those are my thoughts on Steam from being a user as long as I have.
By the way, there is an unofficial, well, no, it's really official, I guess, you know, because I'm on it and, you know, I don't think there's any other OLR groups.
And if you want the link to that, just go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
There's a whole little box on the side where you'll see the Steam logo among other big websites like Facebook and Twitter.
And you can click that and join our Steam community.
It's pretty cool.
Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates
Hello Kitty Party, Fighting Fantasy on the DS as well.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii with very little fanfare, Karaoke Revolution.
Hurrah.
Your Shape featuring Jenny McCarthy and it comes with a camera.
Wait, wasn't that supposed to be last week?
Because I seem to remember making fun of this game previously.
I think I may have talked about it last week, but yeah, it's being delayed.
Seeing it's Sparkle Vampire Edition coming out on the Wii.
Tekken 6 coming out on PSP and on PC Twin Sector.
And Rogue Trooper is being released on the Wii, kind of a port of the PlayStation 2 game.
And that's it.
Mushi Hi Messi...
Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari Mushi Haime-sama Futari
So it looks like you only have this game in original mode and some upgrades to that as well.
This is a big release over there because there's a specific fighting stick coming out for it and all this stuff.
Sorry, shooter stick or whatever they call it coming out for this as well.
Arcade stick.
On the PlayStation 3, just some price reductions.
Fallout 3, Mercenaries 2, and Mirror's Edge get some price reductions this week.
Again, all of these games coming out on the 26th.
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii...
Uh, Naruto, Shippuden, Ryu Jinki comes out this week.
As well as, DarkSakura, Puyo Puyo Version 7.
Puyo Puyo!
I know you're a big fan of Puyo Puyo.
Sim Animals Africa also makes its way to Japan this week.
Um, sadly though, not a lot of big releases there.
.hack, the GU, uh, series is getting a big price reduction.
So if you haven't checked that out in Japan, now's your time to do that.
and that's on the PlayStation 2 on the DS, Cooking Mama 3 comes out in Japan this week yes, there's a third Cooking Mama game and it comes out this week in Japan as well as a game called Roller Angels go figure, and then lastly on the PSP this week Gakuen Heaven Boys Love Scramble Gakuen means high school
So that's what it's called Boys Love Scramble I'm not sure what type of game this is It's an adventure game
I do love scrambled eggs.
It's a Yowie game.
I was thinking, does boys love me?
And then the picture came up.
Oh yes, it is that kind of boy love.
So if you want a Yowie game, here's the week to get it on PSP.
Come on, Loki, look at that screenshot right there.
Tell me you're not interested in that game.
That's on the PSP.
I'm not interested in that game.
It's a dude nibbling on another dude's ear and he's all blushing.
Oh, well sign me up then.
No thanks.
I'll link that in chat.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
27th Just Dance, Karaoke Revolution, Lego Rock Band, Muramasa, The Demon Blade, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja 5, Resident Evil, The Dark Side Chronicles The End
Alright, back to more gaming news and then the Classic Game of the Week coming up in just a few minutes.
Yes, lots of fun stuff.
So it's interesting.
You may remember with the DS, Disney, they're doing something very similar to this called, I think, D-Gamer.
Well, Ubisoft, not to be outdone by them or I guess even EA, have a new service called Uplay.
And this is going to be something that's going to be coming out starting with Assassin's Creed 2.
And it's going to tie in with all the other games that are available now.
and DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Right now, Win is currently in beta and Ubisoft is saying that Uplay Win is enabling players to collect units based on their actions in games and exchange them for rewards such as exclusive in-game content or other digital items.
The first of which is an Altair outfit and access to the Auditor family crypt.
So that's kind of cool that you can earn stuff in games and unlock rewards in your games as well.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
With this, you would get a unique code that would be, I guess, in your manual or something like that to prove that you own this game.
Or buying them used.
or buying them used.
Console piracy doesn't strike me as big a problem as it is on PC or other platforms.
It's a lot harder to do, and so I don't think it's as impactful.
I'm not trying to belittle it, but it doesn't seem like it's as impactful.
But certainly the used game market, if you have a code in the manual, well, there you go.
That's what they're really going after is the used game market.
I'm not sure.
I haven't gotten...
a copy of Assassin's Creed 2 though I'm expecting one to be coming soon Ubisoft usually hooks me up but I guess we'll find out when I play that I do like how you can have a rabbit as your icon because rabbits are awesome I still gotta play Rabbids Go Home man that looks funny
Well, in other video game news, especially in time for the holidays, something that's being popular this year with the economy, kind of in the state it's in, and people making less money and all that unfortunate stuff, is that layaway is becoming a little more popular.
I was actually seeing a news story on this not that long ago about how layaway is kind of making a comeback.
And layaway, in a nutshell, for those that don't know, is a way for you to kind of
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Toys R Us Toys R Us
Apparently if you deposit 20% of the console's purchase, including tax, and what they call a $10 service charge, because they are going to hold the item for you in the back, so think of it as a storage fee I suppose, you can do this cash check, credit card, whatever, and then as long as you make payment in full before December 6th, then you can guarantee that you're going to have a copy of this.
And you know with Black Friday coming up, this is a good way to...
Check out what other retailers are doing though because I know Kmart
Toys R Us is also expanding their video game trade-in program.
Now it will be including video game hardware, and it just began on Friday.
You go to the guest service desk, and then they're going to scan your items, and they'll make an offer, and if approved, you get a little gift card for the value.
So lots of folks wanting to get in on that used game market, and now it's used consoles as well, although I highly doubt you could put a used console on layaway.
So there you go.
Going into some comments from chat, Alpha Cananogram says, Layaway equals an ancient Walmart version of pre-ordering.
Frisbee says, Layaway is also a good place to hide gifts from people.
That's a good thought.
I never thought of it that way, but that's really cool.
Actdeft, you might want to double check because I hear it's making a comeback at a lot of stores.
I don't know if Walmart's one of them.
I know Kmart was the one that I saw on the news this week, but I wouldn't be surprised.
If Walmart does it to some extent.
And it might depend also on your store, Actdeft.
I know you're in Mexico and things might also be a little different down there.
But I want to say I've still seen the layaway department at stores here.
Also, there's actually a lot of doll sites, actually.
Like one of the ones I go through, Junkie Spot.
If you're into the ball jointed dolls, they've had a layaway program forever.
Specialty stores will also do layaway.
Hey, if they can make a sale one way or another, even if they have to hold on to the merchandise a little longer, they're willing to do it.
You're also dealing with vinyl resin dolls that cost upwards of $700 sometimes.
Wow.
Expensive hobby to have.
See that big one there?
Yeah.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
I pulled out a sticky one.
I pulled out Ergeis.
Ergeis.
Or as it came out in America, God Bless the Ring.
Ergeis.
Let's take a listen to some of the music from Ergeis real quick.
Sorry, that's extremely loud, I apologize.
That actually sounds like you're doing this while looking at the cloud.
Okay, so Air Guys, um... The big thing about Air Guys when it came out... Now, keep in mind, I actually did play this in the arcade.
Um... But the big thing about this one is that, um... For the home version, you could play as a bunch of Final Fantasy VII characters.
You could play as Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Yuffie, Vincent, and Zack.
Well, the arcade still had, um... Cloud and I think... Tifa.
Tifa, yeah.
Yeah.
I played that in here.
But, um, yeah.
But the home version had the, uh... Other unlockables.
Um...
This is actually now a fairly rare game, because it didn't get a Greatest Hits release, and it's not being re-released.
So this is one of those ones, like Einhander, that you're just not going to be able to find, I'm sorry.
But anyway, the game actually has the same fighting system as the Tobal series.
Um, so it, it kind of plays a bit more like a, like a grappling type of game.
Um, you have your fixed view from one place, you can actually get behind characters and stuff, it's pretty neat.
Um, but it, it actually, because it was, uh, done by, uh, Dream Factory, it was developed by Dream Factory, which is the same group that did the Toe Ball series.
Um...
It was put out by Namco in the arcades and then published by Square in the US for the console release.
And actually it is on the PlayStation Network, I forgot to say.
But yeah, it's a big fighting game.
Is it really on the PlayStation Network?
Yeah.
In America?
It came out last year.
Oh crap, I didn't know that.
That's cool.
I don't know if it's in America, but it says it was.
Maybe one of the chatter zones.
The other cool thing about this, though, is that you actually have a quest mode in it.
And the quest mode is actually really in-depth.
Like, you go through and...
It's like a hack and slash kind of action RPG sort of thing where you can go and smack things around in a randomly generated dungeon and then go to town and sell stuff and do things.
It's the full-on action RPG mode.
And then you can do your character development by one of those little five-point charts that raises attack, magic, dexterity, defense, and speed.
Which you can actually raise by consuming protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, or lipids.
So I would build those.
I don't really get it.
Anyway.
So you can adjust your skills that way by what you consume.
And then you get recipe books and you can trade wine for recipes and buy stuff that way.
You get kind of like a stock market sort of monetary system going on here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and thinking it was awesome, although I have to admit I never bought it.
I think I rented it or something.
But I'm just surprised it wasn't a huge freaking deal.
What do you think made this game kind of slip under the radar?
Is it because maybe the rest of the characters weren't as recognizable, or what?
I think that might have been part of it, too.
Now keep in mind, the place that I used to go play this in the arcade was at Crestview Lanes.
If you remember back in the days when they had a cool arcade.
It's the same place we used to go play Blazing Star and all those.
And Dan and I used to just go and play this all the time.
It was really cool.
So we got it because we already knew the series.
And I think that the people that did get this game got it for the Final Fantasy VII characters, but I don't really think that it was promoted the way that it needed to be promoted.
And on top of that, it really, as a fighting game, is not...
I would say spectacular, nothing outstanding.
It's interesting, though, because now we have Dissida out on the PSP, which is basically a Final Fantasy fighting game, and from what I understand, that game's doing much better.
Dissidia plays a lot different, though.
It's a big battle game, is what it is.
And it's also, keep in mind, it's on PSP, so the expectations are a little different.
PSP hasn't penetrated the marketplace quite the way the PlayStation 1 did, which was epically bad.
Anything else to say about your classic game of the week?
Well, her name is, let me go through the names.
Yoko Kishi Bojin.
You've also got Ken Mishima, which always makes me think of Tekken.
Although he looks like Ryan Fury in Tekken.
Han Daehan, who's a Taekwondo guy, Prince Doza, who I always just laughed at his name, Lee Shuen, Sasuke, who's the ninja, because I mean, his name's Sasuke, Dasha Inoba, and Wolfgirl Joe, who was raised by wolves.
Oh, and you also have Koji Masuda, Clara Andrews, who I guess is the token, I guess, gaijin of the game, and Diango, who
who's a sub-boss.
So yeah, it's pretty cool.
It has a cool soundtrack to it too, I think.
And Air Guys actually did get a re-release in Japan in 2000 that had a digital clock and a character diorama and it came out with the Square Millennium Collection.
And this is...
It was also one of the joint ventures that spurred it.
One of the only ones, I can think of.
Alright, well there it is, your classic video game of the week, Ergeis.
Available on the PlayStation 1.
And certainly for a lot of Final Fantasy fans, this game holds a place near and dear to people's hearts.
Weren't you a big fan of this one, Loki?
I seem to remember you talking about this one.
Yeah, it was awesome.
In fact, I have it on my cabinet, so I just have to see if it actually plays in MAME.
Very nice.
Alright, well, now that we've covered our classic game of the week, it's time for us to bring Part A to a close.
But don't worry, we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Part B is coming right up, and in tonight's Part B, we'll take your Twitter topics.
So if you have anything you want to fire at us, quick, get to the Twitter and send us a message at OLR.
And then, of course, our rapid-fire news tonight, and we're going to talk about the Video Game Awards, the nominees were released, and some Phoenix Wright coming to WiiWare.
Sounds pretty exciting.
So we will be right back in just a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 22nd of 2009.
A happy early Thanksgiving, of course, to those in America that have the Thanksgiving holiday coming up.
And good luck on Black Friday, you guys, if anybody's actually going to brave it out there at these stores.
Be safe, for heaven's sakes.
Don't step on anybody and kill them.
Although it sounds like a lot of stores are taking a lot of precautions with all that this year.
Also, people in retail, I'm sorry.
I'll help you reach at least 100 fans if you mention me on the next show.
You're welcome, lol.
So there you go.
I did it.
So now, hopefully, I don't know what magical, mystical powers he has over Facebook, but we'll take a chance there by giving a shout out.
Rob, you have now made us whores.
Although he does post a follow-up, I just sent out over 650 fan suggestions.
Awesome.
But, careful guys, just make sure you're not spamming.
As long as folks you think would be truly interested in it.
But just, I don't even really know what the fan suggestions thing is.
So just, you know, just want to check.
Just making sure.
Anyhow, we're going to get back into tonight's show with some Twitter topics.
Heading on over to the Twitter, looking at our messages at OLR.
Just a couple of them tonight because stupid me forgot to ask for them until just before tonight's show.
But let's see.
Lots of...
comments, random things.
Actdeft made some sandwiches to eat while listening to OLR.
Ironically enough, Loki had some sandwiches before the show tonight, didn't he?
So, delicious.
Yes, delicious.
GamerGirl wants to know, what's better, Super Mario DS or Super Mario Wii?
This is hard for me to answer because I haven't really played the Wii one yet, and I don't know if any of us really have.
I did play it a little bit at E3.
Um...
I think they're just different.
And I hear that Super Mario Bros.
Wii is a great multiplayer game, but it's okay as a single player game.
Whereas I think Super Mario DS is a great single player game, and I have played that one, and it's a lot of fun.
Maybe that's the distinction you want to make, is that if you're into a single player game, get DS.
But if you want to get a multiplayer game, get Wii.
Although at the same time,
Keep in mind, the other big difference is that the DS one can go with you anywhere, and it's probably a little bit cheaper, too.
So, I don't know.
For those reasons, the DS one might have a slight advantage if you haven't either one of them yet, but if you have some brothers and sisters or other family members, people that live with you, whatever, significant others that would play this game with you, then maybe Super Mario Wii would be awesome for you.
And the last question tonight from Scoop20906 on Twitter says, Microsoft's new Zune Marketplace on Xbox 360 looks pretty cool and makes me consider getting a Zune HD.
Loki, have you checked this out on the Xbox 360 at all?
I know it was in the latest update.
Mine is still borked, so I haven't got a chance to look at it.
No?
I have not played with anything except for that one time that I tweeted on my 360, and that was the end of the update.
Which, by the way, I don't think I have seen a single tweet from the Xbox 360 from anyone outside of, Hi from my Xbox 360, or LOL tweeting on 360.
I don't think I've seen anybody post an update from their 360 that wasn't about the fact that they're posting from a 360.
Because it's a pain in the ass.
Actually, there is something cool.
Speaking of tweeting on something other than your computer or your phone, they created a way to use brain impulse to tweet.
What?
It's on Times 50 Inventions of the Year.
Now, it takes a full, I want to say, 15 minutes to do an eight-character tweet.
But they're working on technology so that quadriplegics or amputees can use the internet.
Wow.
That's crazy stuff.
But it's not the type of thing where it's like reading your brain and...
It works on the type of impulse that you get when imagining something.
Well, wouldn't you be nervous about a tweet going out like, I just pictured this chick naked?
You picture it by letter, by character.
That's still creepy.
Yeah, it's on Time's webpage.
That's kind of creepy.
I don't want my thoughts tweeted, even letters that I think about, because what if I'm having a dream about Sesame Street?
Nevermind.
Alright.
I'm sorry.
It's just a little creepy for me.
Like, you know, if we're reading people's thoughts about letters, I mean, although I appreciate that they're trying to think of ways to get, you know, handicapped folks that have severe handicaps to be able to do that stuff, that's just a little creepy to me doing it through the brain because it's just a matter of time before the government installs a chip in the back of your brain and they know everything you're thinking.
Ah!
What, a matter of time before Johnny Mnemonic becomes real?
Yes.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Dude.
Reading some comments from chat.
Alpha Cananogram says, as long as it doesn't bring thought police any time in my lifetime, I'm okay with it.
Wasn't that like the plot of Minority Report or something?
I don't remember.
Or 1984, thank you.
AJ Mix in chatroom says, wait, I'll guess.
I can read your brain.
Oh my, is that true?
Did you fall in love with some pretty girl?
DarkTituya says, OLR is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
I see what you did there.
All right, anyhow, let's get into some fast news tonight.
We call it rapid fire news because they're just little things we want to talk about before we get back into some discussion.
Loki's going to kick it off tonight.
Monopoly is coming to the iPhone.
It's actually the regular version of Monopoly.
I didn't know there was another version of Monopoly, but apparently it is.
A version called, or I guess the version Monopoly here and now, the world, which was the one that came out originally.
This is not.
So the original Monopoly, $5 in the App Store, and...
Yeah, so if you want to play Monopoly on the go, there you go.
3D.GameHeroes is coming to the US, which is awesome.
Atlus is bringing it over, and it will be coming out over here on May 11th.
So no need to import it, although I know some people will.
Although I don't know if I'm one of those people that will do that.
Keep in mind the PS3 kind of encourages it by being region free, that's all I'm saying.
True.
American Girl, Even the Losers, Here Comes My Girl, Mary Jane's Last Dance, and Refugee.
Aw, who doesn't know The Last Dance of Mary Jane?
That song was awesome.
Isn't that the one where he's dancing around with the dead body in the video?
That's Kim Basinger.
That's what Rock Band needs, music videos.
Like, don't get me wrong, I like the epicness of the, you know, but remember how like Amplitude and stuff would play music videos in the background while you were playing some of the songs?
Like, Rock Band needs that a little bit, I think.
That'd be kind of neat.
And those are available, of course, for $2 each or the equivalent on your...
System, of course, you can get them in a pack, save yourself two bucks, and it's for 800 Microsoft points or $10.
And then individual songs coming out this week as well, the Go-Go's with Our Lips Are Sealed, Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent,
Why are they releasing that song and not Since You've Been Gone?
Like, talk about an epic karaoke song.
I haven't been to karaoke in a little while, but I'll tell you, you know, I used to go to gay karaoke all the time.
You know, a little gay bar did karaoke all the time.
And I'll tell you what, some diva, male or female, would always be up on that stage singing, Since you've been gone, I can't breathe.
I can't believe this.
That diva was you, of course, right?
Usually.
But I can't believe, when I wasn't too busy doing ABBA, when I can't believe that that epic karaoke song is not making its way into Rock Band yet.
Maybe it's coming to Lego Rock Band.
I don't know.
Maybe.
And then also Pink Who Knew.
All of those are available for 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $2.
All right.
Well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news tonight.
Talking about Dragon Age Origins, which has been getting quite a lot of press lately, there is some download content called Return to Ostagar.
It's coming to the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
It's only going to cost you $5, and they're saying it's coming out during the holiday season.
This will allow your character to revisit Ostagar, the site of the Grey Warden's darkest hour, to reclaim the honor and learn the secrets of Ferelden's fallen king.
So...
Nice to see that there's expansion From what I hear, the game itself is like epically long So if you're already bored with Dragon Age Maybe you gotta go outside, I don't know, I'm just saying Alright, hey, Cooking Mama is coming to arcades That's right, Cooking Mama is making its way to arcades And it's using a touch screen That kind of reminds me a little bit I don't know, when I'm kind of looking at it It looks like, um, um
Oh god, the name escapes me.
The big PSP game that made its way to... The PSP beat-matching game that's like 2DX that made its way to arcades.
DJ Max?
Thank you, DJ Max, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey, this week, by the way, was a big holiday for fans of Bomani, Konami's series of music video games, which, of course, this show started all about.
One of the big ones, Dance Dance Revolution.
Well, it's still alive and kicking, and 20 November was the perfect opportunity for Konami to announce...
Dance Dance Revolution X2 and the location tests that are happening in Japan it looks like the first one scheduled for November 25th through December 3rd is when the first location test is happening there in Japan for more information you can head over to Konami's Japanese website konami.jp although if the last few iterations of DDR are any indication these games will make their way over to North America eventually but they will be subpar oh I went there
He did.
I sure did.
How about more rapid-fire news, DarkSakura?
Sorry, my needle was stuck.
Well, Brazil, guess what?
You got a PS2 now.
The PS2 has finally launched in Brazil.
PS2.
The PS2.
Okay.
Yeah.
and it's actually out for $7.99 I'm not quite sure what BRL stands for I know it's their monetary system but the equivalent is $461
Super Monkey Ball 2 is coming to the iPhone.
It will have 115 new levels, local multiplayer, enhanced controls, improved graphics, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, and Monkey Target.
and, um, actually the former three are going to be free updates in 2010, but it will be, um, actually, um, out for, uh, two, uh, two pounds, 39 pence.
So over in UK.
So, um, and Star Trek, um, online, the open beta is, uh, going to be starting on, um, uh,
It looks like from the 12th to the 26th of January next year, keys will be first come, first served.
You can get them on StarTrekOnline.com.
And you can actually still apply for a closed beta spot, but the closed beta is, of course, I don't think going to be lasting much longer.
The actual game, though, comes out on February 2nd.
Sorry, February 2nd in North America, the 5th in Europe.
Pardon me, can I fanboy for a minute?
I'm looking for... I am so excited for Star Trek Online, you don't even know.
That's how big of a colossal nerd I am.
Oh, I'm going to be on this, waking up early in the morning to get my...
I'm so excited.
The more I watch Star Trek, the more I love it.
I watched the new movie again over this weekend, and it was a bunch of us gay nerds getting together to watch the Star Trek movie, and we were basically mystery science theatering it, making fun of it and stuff.
I just had so much fun.
And I love Star Trek, and especially the new one.
And hearing that this is going to tie into the new one a little bit is very exciting.
So I'm very excited for Star Trek Online.
I think it's the one thing that will finally tear me away from WoW.
For good?
I don't know.
and you know we've had listeners call in from some foreign countries that aren't often well represented in video gaming you know kind of talk about this that this is you know a problem and why piracy runs so rampant in their countries is that unfortunately there's not a lot of official support in their countries for this but you know a lot of the reason for that is again gaming is expensive and often there aren't enough people to maybe support the launch of these systems so it's
Even though we kind of sit here and lull at the PS2 just now being launched in Brazil, I guess maybe it's just because economically and, you know, the demand-wise, it makes sense.
Although, it is weird to hear, and I was seeing some comparisons, that to buy an official PlayStation 2 costs more money than it is to just, like, import one from the U.S.
So, WTF is the point.
I don't know.
But, regardless, one way or the other, it's out.
I guess they can play games in Portuguese?
I don't know.
I am officially making the OLRE in race though That's awesome, but I think I just want to play a Vulcan
I wanna be a sassy Vulcan Yo, logic is shit Anyhow That's just wrong So wrong What the hell you thinking, bitch?
Anyhow And Actdeft says The USS Ferret
DarkTetsuya says the OLR prize I'm so excited about Star Trek Online you don't even know this is going to turn into the Star Trek podcast Loki is going to have to be the one that keeps us grounded when this game comes out I signed up for the beta but I'm probably not going to play it give me your key I signed you up too I signed you up first
Brad from PodCulture says, Sassy Vulcan, isn't that just a Romulan with PMS?
You know, I should just be a Klingon.
Honestly, if I'm going to be sassy, then I need to just be a Klingon.
Just go around calling everyone a patah!
I totally want to swear at people in Klingon.
That's amazing.
I just know that's a... I used to know how to say your mother has a smooth forehead.
For your sake, I hope you are initiating a mating ritual.
Anyhow, sorry.
I watched all the Star Trek movies when I was sick with swine flu, okay?
Leave me alone.
I'm going to try to find it.
Everyday Klingon Phrases.
Loki News, quick!
Save us!
The Spike Video Game Awards are going to be coming soon.
And, of course, the nominations are out.
With Uncharted 2 getting 8 nominations, Batman Arkham Asylum getting 7, Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead both getting 6.
Let's go through some of the nominations, shall we?
And see what we've got here to start with, of course.
Game of the Year.
and the nominations are Assassin's Creed 2, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and Uncharted 2.
Interesting enough, all but one coming out within the last month or so.
No President Cat.
I am most disappointed.
Exactly.
No write-in nominations either.
That's kind of sad.
Studio of the Year.
Infinity Ward Naughty Dog Rocksteady and Valve Best Independent Game
Explosion Man, Flower, Osmos, and Trials HD.
Those are all actually pretty good.
Yeah, those are all actually pretty good.
Those are some good picks.
Out of curiosity, what do you think is going to land Game of the Year?
Modern Warfare 2.
You think?
Yeah.
You don't think they'll go a little more avant-garde?
Uncharted 2?
Is Uncharted 2 getting the highest scores?
It's by user vote.
Modern Warfare 2.
Best downloadable game, Battlefield 1943, Fat Princess, Plants vs. Zombies, and Shadow Complex.
I'm thinking Plants vs. Zombies is going to win that.
Yeah, it's kind of crack.
Ricky Go Mac in our chat says, Jenny McCarthy, as far as celebrities go.
I said celebrities.
Since when has Jenny McCarthy been relevant?
Oh wait, she has a game to promote, huh?
I guess she's been a guest on Oprah, so that makes her relevant, I don't know.
Best soundtrack, Brutal Legend, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, and the Beatles Rock Band.
I hope DJ Hero wins, but I have a feeling the Beatles Rock Band's gonna win.
That's, you know what, I gotta say this though, as much mad respect as I have for the Beatles Rock Band, that's kinda cheating.
Come on, that music's like 40 years old.
And granted it's timeless music, but...
Come on!
And it's not really a soundtrack so much as it's just their entire music album.
Their whole catalog.
I would say, though, DJ Hero by far has the best soundtrack.
I mean, if you throw out the Beatles, because that's cheating.
And of course, best music game, they have DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, Lego Rock Band, and the Beatles Rock Band.
No surprises there.
Have there been other music games out this year that have been as notable?
Borderlands, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age Origins, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story
Congratulations, Dragon Age Origins, for winning that category, because it will.
Although, neat to see Demon's Souls... Borderlands, I don't know, Borderlands is pretty fucking awesome.
But it's kind of like, huh?
In the RPG category, it's a little weird.
It's more of a shooter, I think.
One more category, then I want to move on with other stories.
We'll do Best Performance... Oh, let's see here.
Best Game Based on Movie Slash TV Show.
Best Graphics.
Let's do one of the weirder ones here.
How about... Oh, God.
Most Anticipated Game.
Really?
That's an award?
Interesting.
And I'm anticipating it loading.
And the nominees are, for games that no one's played yet but are wanting to play, Bioshock 2, God of War 3, Mass Effect 2, and StarCraft 2.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I have an idea.
I have an idea.
You know what I'm going to say, right?
Oh, wait, wait.
Guess what?
Yes.
Write in your own choice.
You know what I'm going to ask, right?
You know what I want, right?
Star Trek?
Nope.
Sukibanshoa Renawi.
You need to go on to... This is what I want the OLR me to do.
Sukibanshoa Renawi.
This is what I want the OLR fans to do.
I'm going to tell the people there.
Although... Oh, doesn't it say something about it has to be an already announced game?
An already announced as it's coming out.
Well, hold on.
That's just that category.
What about best Wii game?
Flutum, anyway.
Maybe... You can't write in that.
But you can write in the most anticipated game.
So if we do that, I guess...
Why not?
Why not?
We'll do it anyway.
So I want folks to go and write in, to write it in and then put in parentheses President Cat.
And if enough of us do it, here's the idea behind it, guys.
Here's the idea.
If enough of us do it, they'll show it in a clip compilation.
So our goal here, guys, here's the goal.
To get President Cat to show up for half a second on the VGAs.
That is the ultimate goal.
Okay?
So in order to do that, we need like 500 of you to submit that as your vote.
Yeah, so you can go to Spike.com slash event slash VGA 2009.
And I'll be on there.
I will post the link in chat where you can actually submit your vote for...
Chatters, damn it, no, you don't write in Boys Love Scramble.
You write in President Cat.
Damn it.
Have I taught you nothing?
Make sure you put in, I'll put it in the chat room, Sukibanshacho Rena Wee, parentheses, President Cat.
And I'll post this to the Facebook and the Twitter, too, before the night is over.
It'll never happen.
It will never.
No, this is all we want.
Maybe they'll go, like, who hosts this?
Samuel L. Jackson or whatever?
The fuck is President Cat?
No, is that he'll have to get up there and show, you know, well, Bioshock 2 is the game, most anticipated game of the year, but let's take a look at some of the stuff that you want to see in the write-ins, and they'll show, like, a little compilation of all these other things, and then all we want, President Cat, half a second of airtime.
That's all we want.
All we want.
Finds it.
It's in there.
Just done.
Now to do it through Internet Explorer.
All right, moving on.
While you guys are furiously submitting your votes for the VGAs, and I'll put that on Twitter and all that fun stuff later, Phoenix Wright, now this is also an awesome series, is coming to WiiWare.
It's a courtroom battle game coming to the WiiWare, and this was revealed in Famitsu Magazine.
Apparently it's going to be like an episodic thing because they're going to start in January in the U.S., and they're going to come out every other month for $10 apiece.
Rise of the Ashes, which was the extra case that was added to DS Ace Attorney...
will be coming out in May, I guess, for just a buck.
Go figure.
So these games are going to come out, and I guess you actually get to swing the Wii Remote to present evidence or something.
I don't know if this is a mock-up somebody did or the real deal, but I could totally see this being the real deal.
That's the real deal.
Oh wow, that's awesome.
So you'll actually get to throw out the Wii Remote.
Well, not literally throw it, but like you're objecting.
So this is going to be pretty epic, especially for those that maybe didn't get into the DS ones.
By the way, the very first game is just a port of the original Game Boy Advance title, but enhanced for the Wii, of course.
Lots and lots of screenshots already being leaked, so I guess this is the real deal.
Awesome. $10? !
DarkSakura, moving on
Well, for people who are fans of LittleBigPlanet, there's something pretty cool for those people.
As soon as I close down my 50,000 submissions of President Cat.
Yeah, there are going to be...
Sonic the Hedgehog themed outfits for LittleBigPlanet.
You have looks like Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, I guess that's supposed to be Shadow, and Eggman, or Robotnik, sorry.
Dude, they need to have a Mecha Sonic one.
That would be cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you know, they still have to retain that little big planet sack boy look.
They look like big monkeys.
It's just going to be hilarious for all those people that make knockoff levels from Sonic.
Okay, listeners, I challenge you.
Make a really kick-ass casino night.
And then show us.
They do have some levels that are in LittleBigPlanet that are basically mock-ups of Sonic the Hedgehog already.
Too bad they don't have Super Speed with those costumes.
That'd be kind of cool.
It would be cool, yeah, kind of like how they implemented in the Metal Gear you had the gun, like maybe implement Super Speed.
We'll see.
Well, something not quite that cool and actually quite disturbing.
Apparently...
There's a guy who's really into his dating sims, including the dating sim Love Plus, so much so that he decided to get married to it.
Yes, that's right.
You heard me right.
A guy got married to his DS game.
And you can only do this in one place, apparently.
Guam.
The guy was pronounced man and wife with his copy of Dating Sim Love Plus, and apparently he married one of the characters in the game, Nene Anegasaki, and one of the three virtual girlfriends in the game.
And apparently he's having a reception and everything, he's invited the media...
It's just ridiculous.
Come on.
Are you that much of a loser that you married a video game?
And Guam, what is your problem?
You're actually performing a ceremony for somebody that wants to marry a video game?
I don't know.
I just don't get it.
Like, really?
He married his video game?
How does that even work?
I need to see what the honeymoon night's like.
This is in Guam.
Is there gay marriage in Guam?
I don't know.
But it's just the whole thing's just like, what?
I think the guy did it for attention.
Attention whore.
Yeah, apparently, I don't know, they're...
I'm not sure if this is the same guy, although I find it a little odd if there's someone else in Guam that's also walking around with his DS.
But apparently some guy, I'm thinking the same guy, also went and visited the Love Bell, which apparently brings good luck to couples.
And you're supposed to pull the rope together with the couple, or both of you are supposed to pull the rope together.
And of course he had his DS in his hand and pulled the rope with the DS in his hand.
Loser!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Alright, well, things are just going to go from bad to worse here in a minute here.
You might remember there was this attention whore out there, Eric Estavillo, who was banned from the PlayStation Network and he ended up, because he made some hateful comments in the resistance community, he actually sued Sony twice.
And it got shot down by Judge Ronald White because Sony is not part of the government, you know, the free speech First Amendment doesn't apply.
So what does he do?
He decides that in order to find fairness and right in this world, he sues Microsoft and Nintendo.
That's right.
He's suing $75,000 to Microsoft for the undue stress and sadness caused by the Red Rings of Death.
Quote, Microsoft should have to bear the burden that is now put on the shoulders of this disabled plaintiff.
Nintendo is being sued for interfering with the, quote, pursuit of happiness by deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the Homebrew channel and Ocarina applications via a system update.
You know what I have to say?
You!
Out of the gene pool!
Right now!
Like, really?
Really?
I mean, talk about attention whore.
These are the very definition of frivolous lawsuit.
First off, neither of these systems owe you anything.
I mean, the Red Ring of Death thing we've seen before.
I mean, get a new cause.
But the one that really jumps out at me is that Nintendo deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel.
So protecting their rights to people modifying the console means you should get to sue them.
DarkTetsuya says, where are the FUs of the week when we need them?
Funny you should mention.
and of course we dedicate our FUs of the week tonight to said person and previous story Loki, why don't you start us off tonight FU to people that don't know how to turn on their headlights in the dark yes, I see people driving around in their cars it's pitch black outside, no headlights on or even better, they have their parking lights on I'm sorry, parking lights are not headlights they need to be eaten by a grue learn to drive safely
My FU of the week just goes to the fact that the weekend has been very, very short and that I have to go back to work before I'm ready.
I'm just not ready.
The weekend's already over.
Poor baby.
Poor me.
Well, FU to number one, me going back to work full time now that I am officially off of my leave now that my hand works.
And also to getting this stuff all over my hands.
Acrylic medium for textiles.
Gross.
By the way, the chatters think that this is how the judge should react in that case when the guy walks into the courtroom and suing Nintendo and Microsoft, that this should be the judge's response.
Check it out.
Let's see if you guys would agree with the judge's stance if this were it.
God, I hope that's exactly how it goes.
Let's get to the mailbag, something a little more pleasant.
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some of our favorites or read them here on the air or we pick some of our not-so-favorites and read them on the air anyway to make fun of them.
DarkSakura, why don't you dive in the mailbag headfirst, pull out some emails, and read them.
One's from Spazinator.
And actually, I'd like to go ahead and say that because I've been following up on Twitter, the situation was resolved.
We followed our advice.
I remember this whole thing from last week, and hopefully the listeners do too.
I know the podcast hasn't hit the feed yet, but in a nutshell, Spazinator lost the rights to his video content.
I think it had something to do with when he backed them up to his drive or something.
He had to ref...
He had to reformat because of an install error that caused his game to glitch or something.
And Sony basically told him, you get nothing, you lose.
Good day, sir.
And we said, you need to call back and speak to a supervisor, escalate it, figure out what part of the policy this falls under.
And so the situation was resolved.
Well, he says, hi, I'm writing this early as 11-16-09's show is ending.
I tried to call in but couldn't get through.
We actually did talk to him, didn't we?
Not on the phone, only email last week.
I just thought I'd give you some additional info regarding my last email and answer some of the questions and whatnot.
Firstly, I think either Xlink or Akiripper asked why I didn't back up the stuff.
I did on two Western Digital Passport external HDDs.
I don't own a PC yet, by the way.
I do the same for my game saves and music.
Video store works a bit differently from the game store.
Thanks for watching!
And that happened after this email, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I'm sure he likes to call us a lot, so I'm sure he'll be on the phone later on to tell us more about it.
So let's just go ahead and go to the next call.
Hopefully he gets through.
Okay.
The next one up is from someone who didn't name themselves, so I'm just going to say Brandon.
Because that's the first name.
Anyway.
Okay.
I know, I know, I know what the living hell is.
17-year-old boy playing a game for little tween girls that's only the audience.
The sound is mp3 quality.
It gets a 3.
Okay.
Dude.
Grammar.
Next, DJ Hero.
Okay, is does not have a Z. It's I-S, not I-Z.
Gosh.
Alright, this is the ultimate DJ sim.
The genres range from rap to Motown, easy learning curve, and great, great does not have an E at the end.
For music and gaming fans alike, I give it a 10.
Peace out, oh, DS Lover.
No wonder.
This is sponsored by Beatmania, the Losers DJ.
Losers is not spelled L-U-Z-E-R-S.
I'm not reading anything else from you.
Let's go to the grammar judges on that email.
Sorry.
Hi, this is my first email, so let me start off saying I love the show.
It's pretty much the closest I get to a video game discussion.
Most of my friends play Wii Sports and minigame collections.
Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys a question.
What was your first midnight release game you stood in line for?
What was the longest you waited for?
My first was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which was interesting because I was only 14 and they didn't ask for ID back then.
It was okay, though, because my mom and dad watched me play Vice City and said they would answer any questions I had.
The longest wait was when the Wii was launching.
Three friends and I waited 33 hours in 20 degree weathers to buy it.
The only reason we had to wait outside was two days earlier people were waiting in the store for PS3.
and we're opening toys and trashing the store.
I mean, why would you do that?
I'll say people should not be jackasses and smoke in line.
Amen.
I was in line for Modern Warfare 2 and these people were smoking joints.
I'm not against weed.
Wow.
But seriously, do that in privacy, not in public.
They did have a sober driver at least.
Well, I look forward to your answers.
I hope the podcast feed is updated soon because my computer has been fried for a month and I'm using the PSP to listen to you guys.
Two episodes went up today.
Go get them now.
By the way, this email is brought to you by Lil' Cats, where you can hash cheeseburger and invisible items.
I have to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the midnight releases.
It's usually freaking cold out.
The last one I can honestly remember going to, actually, I think the first one I went to was when the Wii was released.
My first was the Dreamcast.
and even then, I didn't wait in line all night.
We went out to go take, remember we did this whole cute little promotion thing where we took cookies and orange soda to people in line.
Chris and I were taking donuts and coffee.
Yeah, it was like a cheap promotion for our show, basically.
But people seemed to genuinely appreciate it.
At first, people were kind of weirded out by it.
Like, whoa, people are bringing us stuff.
We're like, no, we're just trying to promote our show.
And people were pretty cool with it.
In fact, remember that?
Some dude at Target was listening to our show on his iPod.
Yeah.
That was such a trip.
He knew who we were.
So that was awesome.
So yeah, that was cool.
And you guys ended up staying at Target and got your Wii.
And then I sent my roommate, Christopher, to go so I could sleep in my nice warm bed and I didn't have to wait all night for a Wii.
Well, my first midnight lunch that I think I went to was when the Dreamcast came out.
September 9th, 1999.
We had already had a Dreamcast by then, for the record.
Because we had an import Dreamcast.
But Dan and I waited in line, and we were really only there for about maybe three, four hours.
My friend Mel, not Mel as in Mel and Melody, but Mel that manages the GameStop.
Yes, I know Mel.
She and I actually sat in line, and we actually walked over to Barnes & Noble, bought cheap books, and just sat in line reading cheap books off the clearance shelf.
I usually don't go to midnight releases.
I'm patient enough to wait until the next day.
With my job, I can't stay up all night playing a video game.
I have to go to work the next day.
The launch for the Wii, though, that was over a weekend.
Because I remember Marissa was in town.
Yes.
And we went to see Marissa for our buxom friend Marissa at some music convention, like for indie artists or something.
And it was a pretty cool thing.
And then you called us to let us know what you and...
We'll see you next time.
If you let us get in line.
Okay.
So we got in line.
So they held your place, basically.
They held us a place in line.
And from what I remember at Target, anyone that was in line before like 5, 6 a.m.
ended up getting one anyway.
Well, this one woman walked up just as they had given out all the numbers.
And everyone who was there got a number.
Except her.
She comes prancing her little butt up at 7 in the morning going...
So where's my number?
Um, you missed out, ma'am.
Ah!
And this was, of course, when the Wii was still hard to get, so it was... I think that we were smart.
We, we, we, we took the, uh, Ferengi rules of acquisition to heart.
And, uh, swallowed, uh, I think, was it, uh, uh, dignity and an empty sack is worth a sack?
Can you believe that was three years ago?
Yeah.
And then I went down.
Whew.
All right.
Anyhow, I guess any other emails tonight?
No!
Loki, did you ever do a midnight launch?
You don't have to because of your industry.
You get them early anyway.
Not always.
Not always?
A lot of times I do.
Now I get to end reserve stuff.
I think I did with Grand Theft Auto 4.
I think I went and picked it up at midnight.
I went to a Final Fantasy XII midnight launch.
There was hardly anybody there.
I used to, for all the other Grand Theft Auto games, used to go there and pick it up at midnight.
Alright, we've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Just a tip, folks, if you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please, please, pretty please, call the Echo Test Service first.
That's Echo123 is the username, and make sure you can hear yourself and the nice little British lady that does the little voice check with you.
It will help save the pain of us having a failed call.
Yes.
Left4Dead1 into Left4Dead2
and although Valve hasn't released a software development kit yet for Left 4 Dead 2 they had to do some workarounds in order to get it to work.
So basically it just requires you to change some files in the original game and of course you have to own both games for it to work and then you can go ahead and play those maps in your new game.
That's kind of neat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
By the way, speaking of editing levels, and I suppose this was inevitable as well, whenever there's a way to edit worlds in a side-scrolling game, it's inevitable that someone is going to make World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
But has it been done in a Super Mario Bros.
game before?
I don't know, but it's been done with Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
Within 48 hours of the game release, there were level editors already out for it, and sure enough, somebody made World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.
Now, we're looking at a video here in studio.
Thank you for watching!
They'll have this up to full speed
When there's a will, there's a way.
Somebody figured out how to do it.
Now, my question is, I guess you can't really actually play this on a Wii yet, because there'd be no way to burn the disc and it would run, right?
You have to use an emulator for this.
Yeah, because this stuff is signed.
There may be a way, because you can do... Well, that might have been with... So now you can create hacked...
Smash Bros.
games, so maybe you could do that with New Super Mario Bros.
I don't know.
I think a lot of this stuff needs to be trunk-shined.
I don't remember how they pronounce it.
It's some sort of signing that they have.
Some user created a program to re-sign everything in there because everything's encoded, of course.
It's just a matter of time before the hackers figure it out.
It's time for you to give us a call.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
If there's a particular news topic that we didn't talk about tonight that you think we should give a little time to, now's the perfect time to get through.
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Keep in mind our number is toll free in the U.S.
and Canada, but if you're in another country besides that, you want to play it safe and use Skype.
While we're waiting for some phone calls, oops, I think we might still be in do not disturb mode.
Oh, we're getting a call.
I guess we're not.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Actdeft.
Hi, Actdeft.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much, but I want to talk about the PS2 launching in Brazil.
Please do, because I know you have probably a unique perspective on this because you live in Mexico, which is closer than we are to Brazil.
But all joking aside, you live in a country that isn't always supported by the game companies, correct?
True.
So what's your thoughts on the game launch in Brazil of PS2?
Basically, just government just doing the wrong things when importing electronic stuff and new technologies.
Here in Mexico, we have the problem.
It's not very big as Brazil since we already have PS3s, 360s, and Wiis here.
But there in Brazil, they charge...
And that's a tax?
That's just money that is collected as a tax for whatever purpose?
Yes.
That's crazy.
The Beatles Rock Band, it cost $60 in the U.S.
It cost Mexico like 1,000 pesos, which is around $70 for a game.
Though we have the consoles, we cost here 4,000 pesos, which is around $350 U.S.
dollars.
Wow.
But to be fair, a lot of this happens when you import from country to country too.
For instance, if we were to buy stuff from Japan, we'd be looking at very similar overheads.
But at the same time, and help me clarify this, when we import stuff from Japan, it's because we're paying a fee from whoever is grabbing it from Japan.
But are you talking about that even when the companies release things directly in Mexico, that there's still this overhead?
Or are you paying an overhead because your Beatles rock band copies are coming from the U.S. ?
Yeah, we basically pay the import fees because it comes from the U.S.
They sell it in official retailers here, and it's official software and merchandise.
Because it doesn't get made here exactly, it gets imported from the U.S.
We get charged that much.
The only company that does...
Distribute officially here in Mexico and mix their games in Mexico's Microsoft.
Like, for example, Halo 3, Gears of War, Forza 3, all cost around 600 pesos, 700 pesos, which is maybe even less than it costs in the US.
Interesting.
Describe briefly for our listeners before we have to go to another call how big the gaming scene is in Mexico.
Is it something that's only for the rich people can get into or is it something that it seems like it's pretty commonplace or does Mexico seem kind of behind where maybe everyone owns a Super Nintendo because those are easier to get now?
You're not that behind on hardware.
Like I said, people have here PlayStation 3, 360s, Wiis.
Maybe the people that don't have that kind of money to purchase a console from this generation have a PS2.
Which also costs a lot, but it's cheaper considering we cost over 1,000 pesos more than a PS2 I gotta say, that's not too dissimilar from what happens here Because even though I'm sure, you know, listening to the show, it sounds like we all have PS3s Because, you know, the host of the show, too You know, I know a lot of people that haven't taken that plunge to the 360, to the PS3 In a lot of cases, even the Wii, because they just can't afford it Starving students or what have you
in this day and age economy that PS2 is a lot more lucrative when it's only 99 bucks.
Yeah, it's not that different from the US.
Like I said, in Brazil, the official release this year after the official release and pretty much everyone else is just crazy.
Like,
That's why the Mega Drive or Genesis systems is pretty big over there because it's cheap.
It's cheap and also it's affordable for everyone there.
And you know, if it's cheaper to pirate it, or import it, or if it's cheaper to get it not the official way, that's what people are going to do, sadly.
Well, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you as always for the worldly perspective.
We appreciate it.
Thank you, you too.
I'm good.
How are you guys doing tonight?
Good.
Hey, real quick.
This is why they don't give us virtual console on the DS.
Because if they gave us virtual console on the DS, they couldn't be making the Sonic Collection.
Just saying.
Very true.
Just saying.
Hi, Rama.
Sorry about that.
Just had to get that thought out there.
What is on your mind, my friend?
We haven't heard from you in a few weeks.
I have to say I've missed you a little bit.
I just got back from another convention.
Last week, I was at Nintendo World for another special event.
And what was that?
The release of New Super Mario Bros.
for the Wii Of course, of course, how did that go?
It was fun, despite all the rain and the wetness You didn't have to compete with the tree lighting, did you?
Nope, but the tree was already there, but mostly everybody was there to check out New Super Mario Bros.
Wii, believe it or not Wow, okay Even though this makes for great radio, I am posting a link in the chatroom where they can check out pictures May I plug my website?
Of course you may
DJ Ranma S
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, there's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on all the broken links, there are actual images there from the event.
Okay, I believe you.
By the way, now that we have the whole Facebook group, go ahead and feel free to post the link there, too.
Oh, that I will do.
Yeah, see?
It has a practical purpose.
We should have had this a year ago.
That's all right.
Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the event.
You were at a convention this weekend, right?
Yes.
Okay, tell us about it.
or is it worth talking about?
That was fun.
Leaving, and half the fun was leaving, trying to find water, and if we couldn't find water, trying to find cups for water.
Now, I always ask this about conventions, because I know a lot of you go for the anime, but, you know, we talk about the games here, so what kind of, like, gaming room setup did they have?
Or any tournaments or anything?
I didn't get you to check out the tournaments, but the gaming rooms were slightly different.
I remember I had mentioned how one convention I went to, they had a dark room just for Rockman.
They pretty much had that for all the
and DarkSakura.
Not thoughts per se, but I wanted to know, did you guys try New Super Mario Bros.
Wii?
Because I wasn't able to listen to the show last week.
You know what?
Sadly, I haven't been able to pick it up yet.
I played some other games this week instead.
It seems like nobody here has the incentive to run out and get it.
The economy's taking the toll on us all, DJ Ranma.
We have to pick and choose our games carefully.
We can't run out and buy things and game companies don't send us stuff for free because we're just some shoddy little independent podcast.
I hear you.
I hear you completely.
I still did play it at E3 and I would like to play it because it's so different.
Playing things at E3 is not the same as playing them in your living room.
True, true.
But I will say this much about Super Mario Bros.
Wii and I'll be on my way.
If you liked Super Mario Bros.
3 and the elements of Super Mario World, you're definitely going to like New Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
Simple as that.
Well, those are two very, very big Mario games near and dear to my heart.
You know, I am hearing, I have heard glowing reviews from, and this is important to say, not just you and the folks who listen to this show, but the day the game came out, my Facebook page was littered with people that I sometimes forget play video games because they don't really talk about it very much that were excited about this release.
For instance, Ranma, you met her when I went to New York.
You know my friend that I go to visit in Brooklyn who I knew since college, right?
Right.
Who thought it was a little silly that we were all getting together to go to that video game store, right?
She's one of those people that posted that was all excited about the release of New Super Mario Bros.
Wii because she loves the old school one.
And didn't we all go to that game show just to get her a copy of The Guardian Legend or was it just for yourself?
That was for me to buy for her because she had recently hooked up her 8-bit Nintendo and I said, if you're going to hook up your 8-bit Nintendo, you need a copy of The Greatest Game Ever Made.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Fanime 2010?
Maybe?
Possibly.
I already have plans that weekend, but I do believe there's talks of OLRGCon, something like that, around 4th of July weekend, something like that.
I'm all for that.
You know what?
We need to set up some type of mini-con.
We just need to make it happen.
I don't know how to do it, but I have a friend who's into event planning, so I might have to seek some outside help, and we have to have ourselves an OLR mini-con.
I don't know how many people will come to Sacramento for it, but hey, if we can get like 30 people to show up, I'd call it a success.
Hey, if Jamie can get me to travel 3,000 miles and twist my arm to make it out there, it won't be hard to get everybody else to do so.
We'll try our best.
All right, take care, Rama.
Have a good one.
All right, later.
Later.
1877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Other last minute stories tonight, Loki.
Yeah, they're actually doing a dedicated store for EA Sports Active.
There's actually one that they opened up in Boston and San Francisco, which seems kind of odd.
I don't know how you could have a whole store for EA Sports Active.
Well, I mean, you know, if Wii Fit is doing as well as it is with its storefront setup and so forth, I'm kind of not surprised.
Yeah, but it's a dedicated store, though.
It's weird.
Okay, hold on.
We got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Deathwishing.
Hi, Deathwishing.
Another caller we haven't heard from in a while.
What's on your mind?
Well, I heard from you on a concert venue, but it's all about...
Modern Warfare 2
No, it's, I love, I just do it because I like to sing.
Well, I just, I love Glee, that's alright.
Anyway, what was I going to say?
Well, if you want me, I can show you a couple things, because I went to them in that release and won a thing, so if I can, if you guys can see the video feed on Skype.
Um, no, we don't have video, sorry.
I have a poster and a big cardboard cutout that I won from a GameStop.
Modern Warfare
Call of Duty MMO
Now, here's the thing.
This came up on last week's show, and we didn't get a whole lot of feedback on this, but this is what I want to ask.
You know, obviously we here at Orange Lounge Radio, this isn't usually the type of game we get into.
And it's not to knock on the game, it's just that I suck at first-person shooters, so I don't really get into these games usually.
What is it about Modern Warfare 2, as opposed to all these other types of shooter games that are out there, the Halos of the World and everything else, what is it about Modern Warfare 2 that is making it the must-have game of the year?
because it's borrowing aspects from just all these other games like it's borrowed aspects from what's it I want to say Halo because it has like medals and stuff now you earn it actually funny see here's the thing it borrowed stuff from Street Fighter with the titles and emblem system and it's exactly like Street Fighter for titles and emblems and like when they interviewed them about the emblem system I guess the Infinity Ward guys they played a crapload of Street Fighter they kind of
It's really, if you kind of want to look at it, it's really, you could say it's just another copy and paste, but the thing is they do it more well.
It's like a lot of underlying stuff you have to do with like the different, the way guns handle, it's really balanced.
Like if there's a guy that's really good, you can still find a way to take him out.
It's not like, it's not like on Halo where you have to be skill based, you know?
I really wish Microsoft would make Halo Remedial Edition for people like me.
What they shouldn't make really was like what they said they'd do in the first place was have skill matching so you play with people your skill level, which I never saw on Plenty.
That true skill thing, that was complete bullcrap.
Because a lot of people reset their skills or create new profiles and then you get all these really skilled people that are starting from ground level one.
They couldn't just made it for the console.
I wish, but sadly that feature doesn't seem to work too well.
And
The funny thing you should say, you remember how you were talking about that global thermonuclear warfare thing?
Yeah.
That's also a call sign in the game, so that kind of was a little weird.
Do you want to play a game?
Okay, dude from Sol, I forgot his name.
No, it's let's play global thermonuclear war.
Do you want to play a game?
I know, the kid wasn't even born yet, probably.
Alright, DeathWishing, do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
Are there any good fighting games coming out?
Super Street Fighter 4.
If you don't really want to take the plunge on that, Street Fighter 4 has gotten a big price reduction at a lot of retailers.
I've heard mixed things on Tekken 6.
I've never played a Street Fighter before.
It's Tekken, therefore it's worthy.
You might want to rent it first.
I don't know of any other big, big fighting games that people are very excited about right now.
I think Tekken 6 was kind of the anchor for the year.
I would bet there's a new Soul Calibur announced pretty soon, and some other games we'll be looking at next year.
But nothing outside of Super Street Fighter 2 that I, or sorry, Super Street Fighter 4 that I know of, unless somebody in chat happens to know.
Don't know.
So we'll see.
Alright, well, Deathwishing, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls.
Thank you so much for the call, as always.
Later!
Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
We'll take one more call.
What the hell?
1-877-GAME-OLR No last minute stories.
That's it?
Well, there's not much I want to talk about.
Holy crap.
Alright.
Somebody in chat is saying, did you notice your Skype hit 250 contacts?
No, I don't think we have 250 contacts.
Do we really?
Maybe.
I've never bothered to check or
Count them all up.
We'll see if we get any more calls here.
And then we're going to call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Of course, we still have the afterbirth for the live listeners.
For the podcast listeners.
Tune in live sometime.
Chatters, by the way, Actdeft in chat says Blast Blue for the PSP.
Aren't you going to introduce me first?
Hello?
This is Legend of Zaku.
Hi, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much, just killing another Sunday evening with my MacBook trying to, you know, do the ritualistic whittling of code and listening to your show.
Um, yes.
So, I kind of realized that, um, that, you know, that certain companies in particular kind of starting to hate on certain platforms.
Case in point, Gameloft.
You may have heard of them from such, uh, from such mobile games as, um,
I'm trying to think of a good game, love game.
What the hell are you typing onto your Skype headset?
It's as bad as Jamie when she puts the mic down next to her keyboard.
Long story short is that they're giving up on Android even before it's even hitting its peak.
The reason I'm bringing this up is because this proves that the sheer number of the fact that iPhone is so prevalent and
People are basically using it as a massive baseline, like some unreachable bar for other platforms to jump over.
In this case, they're just saying because we can make 400 times as much on the iPhone store with Apple's bullshit, in terms of going through the approval process, they could easily just kill funding for Android.
I mean, I can understand the rationale.
Money comes first to them.
I mean, in that sense, they have every right to make as much money as they please, but, you know, they kind of gave up.
They're acting a bit premature by just trying to, like, not give it a chance.
I guess it's because of the fact that in Android, you could actually get a refund and, you know, and all the try before you buy.
So that's really scaring them off.
You know, there's a comment in chat, fuck Apple in the ass, from Togacac.
You know, there's a lot of people that are of that mindset, but the problem is, Apple has a lock on this shit right now.
Like, seriously.
People, lots and lots of people have iPhones.
Well, one could argue that the way they...
you know the way they set up their their store you know their platform is you know the fact there's almost video game like where you need like a to pay licensing just to get it up it's kind of more streamlined granted you do have its growing pains with the approval process
Well, I'm not going to disagree with you.
I think Apple's approval process stinks, but at the same time, I don't think there's a lot we can do about it, especially when they're larger in charge.
If another phone steps up and actually gives them competition, but as of right now, there isn't anybody even close.
Except maybe Crackberries, the Crackberry Storm, but even then... I mean, I worked on Blackberries, and even then, you could easily distribute your apps on your own.
I mean, it's just now that Rin managed to get a BlackBerry app store.
But let's divert our attention.
I think we're deviating a bit too from the actual nature of this show.
Basically, I'm trying to bring up a little story that I saw on Kotaku about how Team Fortress 2 managed to get a lot more updates than any other Valve game to date.
I want to play as the sandwich.
I guess people, you know, have thrown the argument that
Maybe it's because they actually care about their platform.
I actually saw a little tidbit from what they actually quoted is that every time that Valve releases an update for Team Fortress 2, their sales go up 20%.
Whereas when you have Modern Warfare 2 where Activision is planning to sell you DLC that's already in-game and it may not be worth the
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It was a way to keep the game relevant and newsworthy and continue to get it on all the blogs and create awareness for the game.
And I'm sure it's a similar story.
But the fact of the matter is that Valve basically put those T4 just to updates for free.
And I mean, you're talking about class updates, new game modes, literally for free.
and you see, you know, you see where Activision's, you know, and Microsoft's also guilty of this as well for just, you know, trying to build up, trying to like nickel and dime people.
Well, money talks, my friend, and if people say that they're not going to get nickeled and dimed by the Modern Warfare 2 DLC and they switch to hacking, as a lot of people are doing, then somebody's going to get the message loud and clear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, for the $60 you're paying for the PC version, it's kind of like you're getting ripped off for the fact that even in Call of Duty 4, you got the maps for free.
And console players had to shell out money for it.
I don't know, I guess...
I guess it keeps in line where Activision is starting to come up with these crazy methods of trying to maximize profit on just about every game they release.
But that's them.
I guess that's their rationale for trying to be like EA in the middle of this decade.
Gold EA.
Saku, I've got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call and getting us to talk about topics that we might not otherwise talk about.
Have a good one, buddy.
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Apologies to those that didn't get through.
It was a pretty busy night on the phones tonight.
You can always send us, of course, an email mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or you can send us a message on Twitter or now we have Facebook and the official Orange Launch Radio fan page on Facebook which I'm going to give one more link to in our chat room
and hope that maybe we can get 100 listeners by tomorrow.
I'm sorry, 100 fans by tomorrow so that way we can grow our Facebook page into the next evolution of Facebook pages where we get our short URL and not an ugly-ass number there.
Anyhow, if there's no other last-minute stories, DarkSakura, Loki, nothing, I don't think I have anything either.
And nothing is I like fire.
Well, that's not news.
They have a Neo Geo two-slot system over here, full-size arcade.
Some guy is moving.
He's already sold his house.
Wow.
Wow.
Nice.
If you need one for your garage.
I'm tempted, but there might be some changes going on in Rob's life that I can't get into right now, but maybe later.
All right.
Anyhow, I'm going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.
Thanks, everybody, as always, for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
Independent podcasts rely on word of mouth, and so we really appreciate it when you guys do tell your friends about the show, such as the dude who told all 650 of his Facebook friends.
But just keep in mind, again, don't spam it.
What are we at now?
DarkSakura
Loki, your final thought.
I guess we'll sign up for the fan page.
You haven't done it yet?
I'm not going to go do that, Matt.
I know you might not be a fan of the show, but you should probably go do that at some point.
And my final thought is...
I don't want to have to grade the big stack of papers that's sitting at home waiting for me.
So anyway, that's going to do it.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us.
Even though it is a holiday weekend, we will still be back here next Sunday, right?
Nobody's got anything planned.
So we will be back here next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio to do it all over again.
So until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.
