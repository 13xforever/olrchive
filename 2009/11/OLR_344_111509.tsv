15308	17712	Final Fantasy XIII finally gets a release date in the U.S.
17772	17972	and U.K.
31485	36330	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36871	39153	Now with 75% less sickness.
39774	45600	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
45700	46741	My name is Rob Roberts.
46781	50105	I'll be joining you for the next three hours with my awesome co-host, always here with me.
50165	52808	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55100	56101	Hack, hack, cough, wheeze.
56281	56601	Not really.
56942	63847	Actually, you're feeling much better this week than those that heard the show a couple weeks ago, which we'll get into because the story is actually kind of funny.
64347	66069	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
67710	71053	But first, I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
73155	73395	Hello.
73615	74235	How are you doing?
74315	77798	Techmaster Loki, who has to learn how to turn his mic off before we start the show.
78139	79540	I had the mic off earlier because...
80270	81191	I don't know why I just turned it off.
101403	103164	Travis had that whole setup in his house.
103264	107826	I don't know what Bobby has in his house, and he does, of course, the show before us, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf on all games.
108706	110027	I don't know if he has the whole thing.
110387	124473	We have wired mics that just plug into this mixing board very crudely that Shermie the cat has to walk through like she's Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment to get through the cords.
124493	127895	She seriously looks up at me and goes, meh.
128015	130296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
147705	148786	Thanks for watching!
162867	164269	Gremlins Live in Those Little Boxes
178109	178609	Thanks for watching!
202037	207480	Dude, we've been doing this ghetto style for seven years, and it's one of those things where if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
207540	208561	If it ain't fixed, don't break it.
208761	209201	Exactly.
209601	224170	Anyhow, so why we weren't here last week, which is funny because I had promised a couple weeks ago on the show that we weren't going to miss any more shows in 2009, which is also funny because you haven't heard the last month worth of podcasts, and it all ties into the same reason.
224270	227632	Well, also, it's because Rob had diphtheria and I had malaria.
228032	229212	No, but it's close.
229432	229833	It's close.
230413	230893	Here's the deal.
231233	239035	If you were here live a couple weeks ago, and you will hear this on the podcast eventually, we're going to have a big dump this week like we had last month where we'll get all the shows up.
239055	243997	But if you were here with us live a couple weeks ago, DarkSakura was very ill during the show.
244417	250619	And we kind of all chalked that up to, well, she has the plague again, which she always seems to get once a year, or a sinus infection.
250639	251999	My annual sinus infection.
252359	253960	And I kicked up all that dust earlier.
254180	254340	Yeah.
254440	257221	And so we figured, okay, Jamie is just the sick girl.
257681	259682	Everybody went to high school with one.
260042	264243	There was that girl who just seemed to get sick all the time, just no matter what.
264583	270905	My sinus infection is literally an annual thing, and it's always right in the start of November I start getting sick.
271025	272545	We love you, Jamie, but you're the sick girl.
272705	273426	You're the cootie girl.
274306	274586	All right.
275183	276284	Yeah, we'll hear some cooties.
276684	277424	Shove, shove.
300296	300957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
314289	317351	And she says, oh, what's wrong?
317391	318691	And I'm like, I don't know.
318832	319712	I'm just really sick.
320512	323574	I want to just make sure I don't have H1N1 or something crazy like that.
323614	328477	She's all, oh, my dear, because she's an old Filipino lady, so she always says my dear and honey and all those things.
328937	330598	Oh, my dear, open your mouth.
331158	332579	Oh, you have a very red mouth.
332679	334000	Oh, I think you have laryngitis.
334360	335601	You do not have H1N1, my dear.
335621	337222	Do you want me to give you the test anyway, my dear?
337822	340484	And I said, yeah, just for peace of mind, give you the H1N1 test.
340784	343085	So they shoved the Q-tip up my nose and all that fun stuff.
343185	346727	And yeah, it still hurts, but no, it wasn't that bad.
348428	350930	So I did all that and I'm thinking, okay, whatever, I have laryngitis.
350970	355433	And she says, if I'm still sick on Thursday, call her and she'll give me an antibiotic.
355713	356974	I'm still sick on Thursday.
357034	358334	I've missed two days of work at this point.
358715	361877	So I get an antibiotic and Thursday night was really the worst of it.
361917	364738	That was the night where I lied down and I thought, oh my God, I...
365939	368201	Like literally, I saw the light.
368501	380869	Like when I closed my eyes and was lying there on the couch in my Snuggie with my Star Trek Next Generation movies playing on Blu-ray because that's what I did when I was sick is I watched every single Star Trek Next Generation movie on Blu-ray in my Snuggie.
381770	384111	I literally shut my eyes and I started to see the light.
384332	387554	And I'm just lying there going, this is awful, this is horrible, whatever I have.
388314	392417	But finally it started to go away and I'm thinking, oh, antibiotics got rid of what I had.
392857	394378	I must have had a strep throat.
394658	397360	That seems to be the most obvious thing that I have.
397940	401082	So finally Saturday goes, Sunday goes.
401242	404224	Monday I go to work because I'm thinking, I've missed four days of work.
404304	408606	That's a lot of work for somebody who's a trainer, for somebody with, I have a very high work ethic.
408666	409487	I don't like to miss work.
409747	410788	So I go to work Monday morning.
411528	412410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
423923	426124	Oh my dear, you have H1N1.
426184	427404	Your test came back positive.
427884	429184	And I'm thinking, what?
429945	433466	Here I am back at work sick and I had H1N1 this whole time and I didn't even know it.
433986	437767	So it turns out that H1N1 test that she didn't even think I needed came back positive.
438127	443088	And I think part of, you know, and no disrespect to my doctor, I didn't have a fever when I went in there.
443909	444949	But apparently I had H1N1.
446107	447530	Prisby asks if your doctor is Ms.
447570	447951	Cleo.
448211	450556	Yes, actually, she apparently sounds a lot like Ms.
450576	450856	Cleo.
450897	452720	I don't know how old Filipino lady sounds like Ms.
452740	454484	Cleo, but just work with me on this.
455466	456666	Next up, Rob calls me.
456806	460427	Yeah, one of the first people I call is Jamie because I start to piece it together in my head.
460747	462468	I'm like, how the fuck did I get the swine flu?
462868	465029	Nobody else at Rocky is saying anything about it.
465089	466169	Nobody else seems to be saying it.
466189	469610	And I'm thinking, oh my god, Jamie has these signs.
469910	470890	Jamie gave me the swine flu.
470990	471930	And I knew it in my mind.
471970	473531	I'm like, Jamie's the one that gave me the swine flu.
473811	477752	And then I'm also thinking, oh my god, Matt has a swine flu too and he doesn't know it.
478132	481753	So the first people I contact... Yeah, I'm so swine flu-ed out right now.
481913	482473	I can't tell.
484016	487017	So, Matt, were you sick at all the past couple weeks?
488198	491379	My throat was kind of scratchy for about five days.
491759	496980	But kind of scratchy as in, hey, that kind of feels scratchy and I get distracted by something else and don't notice it.
497460	499081	That's really, though, how it starts.
499481	500161	It starts in the throat.
500181	501442	Yeah, it was the same with me.
501542	507424	So somehow Matt, with his Cylon genes or something, was able to avoid the swine flu.
507564	510505	I'm still saying it's because he eats enough meat that it gives him an immunity.
511385	511565	But...
512409	513550	I ate enough swine, see?
515271	521735	Well, I actually ended up calling my doctor, well, I talked to the advice nurse at Kaiser.
522136	524757	She's like, oh no, you're coming in, you're coming in.
525378	535725	So I finally actually talked to my doctor, and we go over all of the symptoms, because he had actually seen me a week before for my sprained ankle, which still, by the way, hurts like a bitch.
537666	560897	and we know he's like well you know you had all of these symptoms you know you're you had that with your throat you started off with a dry cough you know it's like that's not how your sinus infections tend to go you know he's and a lot of times now they know by the symptoms because they're pretty standard and I ran a fever for me I actually got up to a hundred but that's high for me
561397	562918	But I kept running a fever after the fact.
562958	574902	And the whole big thing for me, what my plague usually is, is if I don't treat a sinus infection or anything sinus related right away, I will always get bronchitis.
575482	578463	And the last time that it got really bad, I got pneumonia.
579024	580184	And I was sick for three months.
581525	583405	And it was a nightmare.
583485	587667	But now he put me on like a week of antibiotics to make sure that I don't get pneumonia again.
588120	591421	Well, the interesting thing is my doctor's approach was very different than yours.
591742	594523	I mean, they put me on Tamiflu, which a little late for that, right?
594603	595103	But whatever.
595623	597904	And I got pulled out of work for a week.
598684	600605	I was already over it.
600665	604107	So was I. Yeah, but I was already two weeks over it is the whole thing.
604947	605347	I don't know.
605707	608609	And I think a big part of it, too, because you kind of talk about that.
608669	612010	And we will get to talking about video games, but I think this story is hilarious.
612070	613471	I was hoping I'd get pulled out of work so I could go.
613551	614031	Dan was sick.
614391	614751	Stay home.
615051	616552	Two weeks before me, Dan was sick.
617403	621484	And I was like, you don't catch a sinus infection from somebody.
622004	623285	They're not contagious.
623385	625505	So maybe Dan started this whole thing.
625545	626506	I don't know.
627186	633827	But I got pulled out of work for a week and I was pissed when it happened because I'm thinking like, I'm going to miss nine days of work and I'm trying to teach a class, right?
634128	634948	And I'm like, what's the point?
634988	635668	I'm already over it.
636072	636972	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
655381	660163	I miss her dearly, I wish she was still here She didn't get to the doctor early enough, did she?
675057	676198	I don't think so, no.
677038	677979	She didn't have insurance.
678059	681862	Yeah, I think you mentioned that she eventually was pulled to the doctor to go.
683102	686765	But yeah, I mean, that's why my grandmom started having the same symptoms.
686805	689767	I talked to her on Wednesday, and I was like, you go to the doctor tomorrow.
689847	690287	You go.
690647	691148	Tomorrow.
691748	693769	And as far as I know, she's okay.
694170	695711	And let me read this from chat here.
695831	699213	DangerSkew in chat says, H1N1 is the most overrated disease ever.
699233	700714	And this is from chat.orangeonsradio.com.
701354	701895	Yes and no.
718030	720912	The number one killer of people with AIDS is pneumonia.
741923	742985	I actually described it.
743165	744147	I was trying to describe it to somebody.
744167	746630	I said it's kind of like having 24-hour aides.
746670	756444	You don't want to catch something secondary in that window, and I don't mean to speak so nonchalantly about something serious, but if I could explain how H1N1 is dangerous, that's why.
757024	758165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
782539	786322	So to kind of wrap this all up, because we've been talking about this for a while here, and I know folks want us to get to the games.
786382	788343	Pneumonia is H1N1's mother-in-law.
790565	791805	You just don't want her to come visit.
791825	792106	I don't know.
792446	796288	No, but to wrap it all up, you know, again, the moral of the story, you know, I'm fine.
796709	797749	DarkSakura's fine.
797930	800371	If you get H1N1, you'll probably be fine, too.
800391	801472	You probably won't even know you had it.
802312	804214	But please see a doctor.
804714	805935	Go to urgent care.
806555	830135	or not necessarily the ER because ERs are really bombarded they're very expensive keep in mind there's a lot of urgent care clinics that can do the same thing a lot cheaper a lot of free clinics as well if you don't have insurance at all just see a doctor get treatment get on some type of medication that will build up your immunity so that way you don't catch something secondary so is it that bad no but should you take it seriously absolutely so that's kind of the moral of the story
830916	836479	Now that we've talked about our sickness and why we've been gone... And by the way, because again, this kept Jamie down for two weeks.
836499	837599	This kept me out for two weeks.
837879	840581	This is why things have fallen behind with the feed.
840621	841521	Yeah, I still have a cough too.
841621	843082	You might hear me cough.
843182	845563	Now it's, I think, officially three and a half weeks later.
845943	847524	I'm still having to...
849805	858398	The same type of, you know, that same cough that I had when I was developing that bronchitis back then, so I still have to be careful.
859039	859940	I'm living on Ricola.
860361	861443	A steady diet of Ricola.
862204	863185	And apparently Chinese food.
863325	863786	Good times.
864127	864647	Alright, anyhow.
865268	892505	enough about flu chat let's get into actually our gaming weeks as we usually like to start the show off with talking about the games we've been playing funny enough you think with nine days out of work I'd played a lot more video games but that's kind of not the case I don't know if that's true for you too DarkSakura but what kind of games you've been playing for the past couple weeks well I um excuse me I did something bad Rob what'd you do I've been a bad girl
893097	893217	Maran,
920353	923914	since I renewed my account, and then twice by myself.
924194	925595	I have hit a milestone.
926295	929096	I now have a character that is past level 10.
929516	930997	Congratulations!
931137	931917	I have level 15.
933998	935579	Draw 9 age.
935659	937239	Welcome to the world of talent points.
938440	939300	We hope you like it here.
939520	940320	See, that's how it starts.
940400	942941	First you do it with a friend, and then you start doing it by yourself.
943101	944142	Next thing you know, you just can't stop.
944182	945062	Next thing you know, you're playing EverQuest.
945122	946342	Are you talking about Warcraft?
946382	947983	Are you talking about... Never mind.
949335	950516	Thanks for watching!
969252	969832	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
991568	1006387	and Dan's in the other room and I'm going I've got a wildebeest and he comes in and going so you do and then I was like taking screen captures of my uh of my griffin because I was doing oh we're going back and forth on a griffin and I'm paying for it
1007328	1010351	It was just... I was just being a goof.
1010931	1013013	An utter goof playing, but it was pretty fun.
1013293	1014674	I like playing by myself.
1015976	1017016	Why do we play games?
1017217	1018017	To have fun.
1018378	1030788	And whatever that is for you, and especially in a very broad game like World of Warcraft or any MMO, if that's taking screenshots, if that's slash dancing, if that's roleplaying, whatever it is, it might not be just grinding to 80 as fast as you can.
1030828	1032810	It might be a variety of other things that make it fun.
1032890	1034271	So, more power to you.
1035782	1039823	Alright, I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you about that, but maybe I'll think of it later.
1040583	1043224	So, if DarkSakura's done with her gaming week, then I'll move on to Loki.
1043244	1043844	How was your gaming week?
1045065	1046165	My gaming week was okay.
1046385	1047545	I didn't play a whole lot, though.
1048506	1049946	Actually, for the last two weeks, I haven't played a lot.
1050306	1052687	I've been just working on the main cabin and getting that working.
1053967	1064530	Mainly choosing a front end, because I was originally going to start with Hyper Spin, which is really flashy and looks awesome, but the problem is you have to make a theme for every single game.
1065865	1069769	And I downloaded every single game that's out there for MAME right now.
1069909	1076236	So that would take forever to get skins for everything or make skins from scratch.
1076296	1078438	It's just way too much damn work.
1078538	1084544	I may end up going back to that though because I think you can actually put different settings for each game you launch in Hyper Spin.
1084564	1087988	Plus it's a lot more flexible in what you can run in it.
1088709	1103629	but right now I currently have Maximus Arcade on my system and I've been kind of working with that a little bit their configuration that they had for launching games and using the menu right now is really jacked up compared to what the
1104554	1105895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1128795	1129475	Thank you for watching!
1148624	1155353	Well, it's just, it's a lot, because I didn't know what games I wanted, so I said, okay, what the hell, I'm just going to download everything.
1155453	1162543	So I did, I downloaded everything, including clones of games, multiple ROM dumps for each game.
1162563	1163283	Miss World New 96?
1164245	1165426	Oh yeah, that's on there, of course.
1166644	1167264	All the porno games.
1167304	1167885	I'm coming over!
1168045	1174427	I'm telling you, every game that's out there is on there, including ones that are like 50,000 Mahjong games I need to get rid of.
1175388	1179789	So I just have to go and sort through everything, which is what really takes the time.
1180950	1181450	And then...
1183380	1199132	The other thing too is, because my cabinet has a dual sync monitor, so I can run games at the low resolution 15kHz, which is what most arcade games are, like all their old school ones, or medium resolution for some of the newer games.
1200453	1209260	The problem is, if you run it at the medium resolution, your newer games look nice, but your older games aren't quite as sharp because it's not running at the native resolution anymore.
1209870	1215278	So it's a debate whether I want to make it look nice for most of my games or just some of my games.
1216439	1221446	I'm pretty much just going to leave it alone right now because I get to the Switch to actually flip it to that medium resolution.
1221466	1223549	I have to take stuff apart and I don't want to do that.
1224050	1226113	So anyways, enough of the cabinet stuff.
1227622	1238809	Can I just say real quick on a related note, because I'm looking at our chat room, BlackWolf, of course our old buddy Bobby, who does the show before us on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, live on Sunday nights, says, You describe me.
1239129	1240891	I have a ton of consoles hooked up to my TV.
1241151	1241991	Do I often play them?
1242231	1244893	No, but I could if I wanted to.
1244973	1246814	That sounds very Jamie as well.
1246834	1248155	But mine aren't all hooked up.
1249336	1250036	But you could.
1250517	1253619	But we do have the pile of Sega hooked up in the vault.
1254459	1261161	and how often do you go in there and say, you know what, today I want to play, I don't know, I'm just feeling very Afterburner today.
1261301	1263061	I just, I want to play after, do you do that?
1263202	1263842	We do that shit.
1264182	1264642	Do you really?
1264762	1271364	We do, but sometimes we also break out the PC Engine and play some cue cards.
1272985	1277708	In the front room, we loaned our Wii to Dan's mom for some reason.
1279089	1283152	We have the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 hooked up out in the front.
1283352	1286695	The PlayStation 3, since it's a piece of shit, just collects dust.
1287875	1289617	We do nothing but play our Xbox 360.
1290137	1292439	Ironically, I'm in the complete opposite boat right now.
1292479	1294000	I still haven't replaced my Xbox 360.
1294060	1294600	Three months now.
1294660	1295181	Haven't needed to.
1296758	1297599	I've been doing everything on the PS3.
1297940	1299962	I'm like in the complete opposite boat you are, but okay.
1300784	1301665	That's what makes the show great.
1301865	1303227	Except, Rob, we have a choice.
1304609	1305229	Oh, snap.
1305269	1306030	You got me there.
1307012	1307713	What are we going to do?
1308013	1310717	Speaking of that... No, well, technically our PS3 is our Blu-ray player.
1310737	1311377	I have a choice, too.
1311417	1312579	I could play the Wii if I want to, like,
1313291	1314712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1335925	1339828	I basically swapped her the banned console because she doesn't play online, so she doesn't give a shit.
1339868	1342570	She just wants a console that's modded, and it works just fine.
1342630	1345392	It just can't go on live anymore, so hey, problem solved there.
1345452	1346693	So I have her broken console.
1347153	1352157	I have another console that's starting to go, and I have a friend's console that they brought in.
1352337	1356861	I don't know if he's giving it to me or what, but it's kind of broken, so I have three consoles that need to be fixed.
1357661	1359102	which I'm planning on doing soon.
1359882	1366685	I have a console coming from New Zealand actually that's a Japanese region console that's also modded so I can actually play some of the Japanese region games.
1368486	1372128	And then I have the four consoles that work right now that we're playing on.
1373989	1379651	But the ironic part was the console that got banned is the console that we don't really play modded games on.
1379912	1383333	We've played like one modded game on that and that's the one that gets banned.
1383873	1386715	Mine, which is seeing all sorts of like it is...
1387819	1388279	Dirty.
1390260	1391681	Dirty, naughty machine.
1391741	1394262	It's a filthy, filthy Xbox.
1394302	1405046	You know, and the one that my boss plays on, which was my old modded console that died once and came back, and it's completely just seen all sorts of burns and you name it, whatever.
1405747	1406627	Those consoles are fine.
1407247	1408108	Nothing wrong with those.
1408288	1410749	But sure, the one that played it one time, it's gone.
1411761	1412441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1437316	1439097	Fuck me, one got banned.
1439357	1440057	Well, here's the thing.
1440837	1445778	I understand now they're banning consoles because they don't want you to play games.
1446098	1448019	I thought they were going to ban your live account or whatever.
1449519	1453761	Can I throw this question to you from chat real quick?
1454121	1456501	Does Loki think Microsoft is right by banning consoles?
1456681	1457642	Well, they have the right to do it.
1458382	1461743	I think as far as banning you off live, I don't understand why they would do that.
1462643	1465744	I guess I understand the cheating part and stuff like that, but if you think about it,
1467142	1467984	Thanks for watching!
1475808	1484552	What's to really motivate you from trying to get your... I mean, because now, there's no fear of you getting banned off live because you're already banned off live.
1484592	1488394	So burn whatever the fuck you want now and play it on the console without consequence.
1488454	1489895	That's really kind of the thing right now.
1490335	1491836	So I don't understand why they would do that.
1492697	1496619	I wish... There should have been another way they could penalize somebody, but whatever.
1496679	1498800	I mean, I guess if you want to play on live... It's not that bad.
1498820	1501421	They're not banning your account, I guess.
1501581	1502221	It could be worse.
1502421	1505403	Really, the only thing that happens when your console gets banned...
1506328	1508148	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1533999	1537361	I don't know, it's just, it's an inconvenience, I guess.
1537841	1539181	But yeah, I understand why they're cracking it.
1539201	1541362	An inconvenient banning, the new movie by Al Gore.
1541382	1550346	Well, we're actually, to be honest, you know, we really modded the consoles, not necessarily to play pirated games, but we were really just playing, you know, modded copies of Grand Theft Auto.
1550846	1557429	Now, we're playing, you know, all have episodes of Liberty City Discs, all legit copies, and that's what we've been playing.
1557469	1563492	So that's why we're kind of surprised that, you know, the one console's banned, because we haven't played a burned game, well, actually, I take that back, we played
1565121	1571445	One new burned copy of Grand Theft Auto on that one because I found a new way to get around their mod patch or something like that.
1571485	1573366	So we tested it once and it didn't really work.
1573866	1576007	And so then we went back to just playing the normal disc.
1576848	1580350	And apparently that one time, though, they found out.
1580530	1582091	And so they decided to ban that console.
1582191	1588754	But it's just ironic because we've been playing normal copies of games on all these consoles for the longest time now.
1589074	1593717	I mean, if anything, they should be generous to me because I bought six copies of their damn game, you know.
1594532	1597034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1619480	1620381	and then they finally died.
1620741	1621462	Almost beat him too.
1622183	1622463	Sad.
1622623	1622904	Nice.
1622944	1626908	Cheater and usually they drop out and I talk so much trash doing that.
1628170	1628630	Good times.
1628770	1629191	It's awful.
1630812	1631133	Alright.
1631413	1632835	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1634597	1634717	Um...
1637194	1640819	That's really it.
1641300	1644784	I'm still sitting on my copy of Borderlands.
1644804	1645785	I haven't even touched yet.
1646166	1647768	I'm just like, I need to play this tonight.
1647828	1648729	I need to play this tonight.
1648749	1650812	And I go home and I end up working on the arcade cabinet.
1650832	1653816	At some point, I'm going to play the damn game.
1654994	1657355	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1682475	1683696	And that's what it all comes back to.
1684537	1688461	My gaming week, you know, surprisingly enough, because I was so sick, I didn't get to play a lot.
1688541	1693826	I did a lot of like TV and movie watching, which funny enough, I did get my PlayStation 3 Netflix streaming disc.
1694306	1695627	So I got to play around with that a little bit.
1695727	1703975	And, you know, it's pretty much the same stuff you're going to see on the Xbox version without the party chat, which my Xbox was borked before I got to play with that feature anyway.
1704035	1704916	So I'm none the wiser.
1705416	1707618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1730732	1731953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1753564	1759388	Also, as far as new games go, one of the new games I played, I was joking about the Wii earlier because DarkSakura was saying that she had choice.
1759868	1762290	And I'm like, well, I still have choice between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
1762890	1767213	And funny enough, I did turn on the Wii to check out the Excitebike World Tour.
1767293	1768894	Is that the name of it?
1768954	1769955	Excitebike World Rally.
1770862	1771723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1784011	1784992	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1802642	1807143	These games, these 8-bit games, we used to spend so much time with back in the day.
1807223	1809744	And some of them you can still spend a lot of time with today.
1810184	1819447	But now, thanks to the wide world of emulation, how many of you guys will just load up a cartridge on emulation, play it for like three minutes, and be all, I remember this game.
1819747	1820507	Alright, thrill's done.
1820707	1821187	Let's move on.
1821307	1821848	Play something else.
1821908	1822468	Pretty much, yeah.
1822608	1822908	That's...
1823348	1852396	What I felt playing this Excitebike World Rally Yes, I realized there was online mode Yes, the game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the day You know, I am totally aware of all these improvements they made to the game But yet, when the game itself hasn't really felt like it's changed that much I was just kind of like, eh, I'm over it And that's my honest feedback on Excitebike I can't really tell you if it's a good game or a bad game Because I was just kind of over it in ten minutes
1853681	1856243	and that was my experience with Excitebike.
1856823	1858144	You make my soul hurt, Rob.
1858284	1858564	Why?
1859585	1860165	Just because.
1860846	1861967	I mean, you know what's funny?
1862727	1867410	We used to play Excitebike for hours when I was like 10 or 11 years old.
1867450	1868191	We used to play this game.
1868251	1869972	I would spend hours making tracks.
1870032	1871373	Making the damn tracks.
1871829	1893264	and all this stuff and yet when I played this new one I was just kind of over it in 10 minutes and maybe to be fair maybe part of that was because the same day I played this was the same day I found out I had swine flu so I kind of had all of that on my mind at the same time so you know in the interest of full disclosure maybe I just didn't play this game in the right mood and you know I think a lot of people can admit
1894540	1895741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1917895	1943586	But, full disclosure, I had all this other crap going on too So naturally I played a lot of World of Warcraft as well One other game I did check out was a game called 30 Second Hero I downloaded this onto the PSP when I was sick Because, you know, when the doctor tells you not to go outside and give people your germs You're like, okay, but I'm bored, I need something to do I'll go onto PlayStation Store and see if there's an arcade game I want to download And then I realized, oh yeah, they have all these PSP games you can download now What do I want to play?
1943927	1946888	Oh, I played the demo for Half Minute Hero a while ago and I really liked it
1947108	1947948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1971835	1979461	The battles automatically play themselves, so you don't have to sit there and go, fight, fight, fight, item, potion, fight.
1979801	1980462	You don't do any of that.
1980702	1986626	You just have battles that happened, and you just kind of tear through them, and it's just a fast, fast game.
1987247	1997975	That's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is, is that you go and you run through the forest or do whatever you do to the cave where the bad guy is, but in each level, it's episodic.
1998155	2000537	The first level is very straightforward, but then later on,
2000757	2001237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2027649	2052505	because really the gist of the game is how do I get from point A to B to C to D as quick as possible making this whole thing work what's the solution without running out of time and that's kind of what Half-Minute Hero is and although I just overly simplified the game I think what's selling a lot of people on this is like kind of the nod to 8-bit cliches because seriously some of the dialogue in the game made me laugh out loud because the time goddess is like
2053125	2054885	I will reset time for money.
2055545	2055866	Why?
2056326	2056906	I don't know.
2057166	2058706	I just like money, hearts.
2059106	2063787	You know, like these very cliche, over-the-top things that just made me laugh.
2064187	2066887	So that's why I kind of liked Half Minute Hero.
2066907	2067748	Did it give you lulls?
2068428	2069508	It gave me a lot of lulls.
2069968	2077729	And that, you know, I think the people that at least localized the game, if not developed it, were kind of just in on the joke and knew what they were doing.
2077769	2078709	And I think it paid off.
2078749	2080410	And it's a cute game. $30...
2082659	2082839	P-R-P-G
2100922	2102823	It's a PRPG, yeah, a puzzle role-playing game.
2102843	2103223	I like that.
2104563	2106444	And then lots and lots and lots and lots of WoW.
2107385	2113687	I brought back from the dead my 80 Druid and brought it into another guild that a lot of my friends had transferred to.
2113787	2121170	And I also had my Paladin, my Helodin, I guess you could say, is level 72 now.
2121630	2124992	So, being sick, WoW, bad combination.
2125052	2125752	Although, honestly...
2127145	2127425	Project Runway
2146141	2146401	All right.
2146461	2148684	Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.
2148764	2154530	I think if that does it for everybody's gaming week, we can finally get into some gaming news here now that we've been on air for about 40 minutes.
2154851	2155311	No, Rob.
2155391	2155732	Food.
2156092	2156633	Food, Rob.
2156693	2157594	You want to talk more food?
2157754	2157894	No.
2158455	2159836	I do kind of want some yogurt or something.
2159856	2160917	I'm just fat.
2161318	2161538	All right.
2162014	2167138	Anyhow, I do want to say real quick in the housekeeping department, our podcast feed is disgustingly behind.
2167359	2169821	It's just sadly been a recurring theme this year.
2170802	2172543	Obviously, I blame the flu for that.
2172823	2174024	We will get all caught up this week.
2174044	2178869	We'll have a big dump of episodes just as we had, I think, back in October when we had some of the same thing going on.
2178929	2182652	So we will get that all caught up for you guys that rely on the podcast feed.
2182992	2189638	And we apologize for that, but do keep in mind the number one priority is pulling off this live show every Sunday night when we can.
2190237	2190877	We're done with sickness.
2190897	2191458	We're done with food.
2191478	2192318	We're done with all that stuff.
2192338	2192918	Let's talk games.
2192938	2193599	Loki, start us off.
2213703	2236452	Yes, well, as you may remember, earlier this week we had one of the biggest game launches this year, and, you know, probably for a while, but Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out, and of course, being that it is a major game, there are going to be those out there who decide to break street dates and release the game early to try to be competitive, usually against GameStop.
2236992	2250755	Well, apparently some local shops in New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some parts of Ohio, were responsible for this, and actually kind of from what I've seen all around the U.S.
2251215	2263218	But apparently in these areas in particular, what's interesting though is to combat this, GameStop on a corporate level has allowed their stores to break street date as well, and release the game early.
2264158	2264258	Um...
2264878	2268620	What gets even more interesting is this isn't the only title that's happened to.
2268700	2274443	Apparently, the same thing is happening now with the titles coming out next week, Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
2275203	2281226	Three game stops in the New Jersey area, Jersey City, have been putting out Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
2281606	2293552	Also saying that it was a call from their corporate office saying go ahead and put it out because there are mom and pop shops nearby that are also putting it out.
2295697	2301561	To simply summarize this, it's a big ol' clusterfuck right now.
2302581	2303922	It's a pain in the ass.
2304002	2305723	Pain in my ass is really what it is.
2306164	2307504	I'm really, really curious.
2307684	2315910	Okay, so the facts are, we know some GameStops are bending the street dates to compete with mom and pop stores, or at least that's the claim.
2316250	2317851	It's not happening at every GameStop.
2317911	2319672	It's happening, assumably, in areas where...
2321015	2323336	They're losing pre-orders to other stores who broke street date.
2324136	2329839	So first, let me ask you, because you work in retail and you said this is a giant pain in your ass.
2330199	2331479	What's your perspective on all this?
2331959	2334180	Okay, well here's what happened with Call of Duty.
2334840	2337701	First off, it was very clear what the street date was.
2338142	2344024	And Activision has graciously street dated all of their titles during the fourth quarter.
2344084	2345925	Which makes it very...
2347705	2359148	Nice for distribution because we can get it to our stores that we supply, get it to them early enough so that they have it day one to be on an even playing field with GameStop.
2359589	2361349	Because GameStop, they're so massive.
2361389	2364510	They get everything prior to street date because they're direct.
2365230	2370612	And we do get stuff a lot of times on street date, but then we have to ship it to our customers and whatnot.
2371192	2374753	So everybody was under... They understood when the street dates were.
2375333	2381957	The problem is, though, there's some of these small stores that are like, well, I don't know how I'm going to compete with GameStop.
2382197	2385979	They're just so massive, and I don't get all these perks and stuff that GameStop has.
2386299	2387300	They don't even try.
2387800	2392163	They're just plain, like, I don't know what to do to be competitive with them.
2392263	2397546	So they decide that they're going to go ahead and put product out early to get a competitive edge.
2397746	2399787	The problem is, though, they get caught.
2400268	2402189	And the other problem is...
2403362	2406765	GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
2424242	2428684	They would go buy a copy of the game or whatever, get a receipt, get some sort of evidence.
2428804	2434045	And then for Modern Warfare 2, they actually had a tip line and they would call in and report it.
2435026	2441548	And usually what happens then is they will collect all these stores that were in violation of street dates.
2441948	2445809	They then go to all the distributors out there and go, okay, are these your customers?
2446850	2471749	and if they are you need to um take care of this by and for you know Modern Warfare 2 here's the penalty one they would no longer be able to buy Modern Warfare 2 for the life of the title if they're out of it they're fucked it doesn't matter they're not gonna be able to buy any more copies of it um also any further Activision titles they will no longer be able to get before street day um
2472601	2493312	and also they're going to evaluate it whereas any sub-distributors out there, people that we basically sell to and then they turn and sell to other stores, they would also be blacklisted from selling a title if they were caught selling it early or whatnot or if these stores that they were servicing were selling early, they would also be blacklisted.
2493992	2498515	Interesting because I haven't heard this on any of the articles I'm reading so it's kind of fascinating to hear this.
2498939	2510945	Yeah, and this also goes, and especially with Modern Warfare 2, actually everybody's been kind of careful after Madden 10 this year because Madden 10, a whole bunch of stores broke street on it, and EA got...
2511547	2539633	pissed, they got really fucking pissed, like, first off we are looking, we're not gonna street date any more titles to distribution so fuck you guys, even though you know, we had no customers that were actually breaking street, but they just decided to blanket everybody and do that same thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum and Warner decided, you know what, we're just gonna do the same thing as EA, we're just gonna say fuck you guys and we're not gonna ship anything early anymore um, and then the other thing is then they decide, okay, well we're gonna
2540154	2567902	maybe allow you to do that but you're going to have to get written signed agreements from all your customers you know they're going to be street dated and we're going to have to ship it two separate shipments it's just a pain in the ass so Activision now you know they weren't too happy about this whole thing they obviously did not authorize GameStop to do this but you know GameStop being as big as they are they can pretty much do this and go what are you going to do about it and Activision is going to go well can't do anything because they're our largest customer we can't piss them off so
2569370	2569910	E.A.
2570170	2585943	and Ubisoft were watching the street dates closely for Left 4 Dead 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 because of this whole thing that happened with Modern Warfare 2 they wanted to make sure that no one was violating street dates on their titles
2586644	2588446	So anyways, to kind of go back around again.
2588926	2595713	So these stores think that they're going to get competitive advantage against everybody else, and not necessarily GameStop, but mom-pops, whomever.
2595853	2601919	I mean, and I hate to, like, blame just mom-pop shops for, you know, Violin Street, because they're not the only ones that do it.
2601939	2604581	I mean, you know, 7-Eleven does it.
2605682	2605923	There's...
2606696	2608037	All sorts of people that do it.
2608138	2609419	GameStop did it.
2609519	2610139	GameStop did it.
2610220	2616185	And the thing is, it's always just a few people that just don't give a shit, that ruin it for everybody.
2616346	2618688	And it's these same stores time and time again.
2618728	2620430	They're violating street date on everything.
2620850	2623613	Madden, for example, they know who... I mean, these people...
2625330	2635317	I could especially see that with 7-Eleven, because you know 7-Elevens are notorious for being independently owned by folks, and probably a lot of them don't even want to be selling games.
2635837	2639279	And so they probably are just kind of like, whatever, with this whole thing.
2639379	2640420	I could especially see it there.
2640460	2641661	Yeah, and there's like, you know...
2642561	2643222	Let me tell you this much.
2643322	2652731	If GameStop, corporate, has given these stores authorization to sell this game early, it's because they know who's selling it early around them, and they will get caught.
2653251	2662680	I was reading some TalkBack stuff on this Kotaku article, and there's one of the guys in there that was actually an owner of a mom-and-pop shop.
2663521	2664202	It's just like...
2665228	2666769	What a fucking douchebag the guy is.
2666809	2670412	He's like, you know, we knew what the street date was.
2670512	2673435	We decided we're going to go ahead and here he goes.
2673855	2674856	Here's my two cents.
2674896	2676917	I own a small mom-and-pop game store.
2677118	2682502	Modern Warfare 2 brought in ten times as much revenue as the store has ever done in a single game.
2682922	2683102	Why?
2683142	2684664	Because I sold the game one day early.
2684944	2686665	I could have had it last Thursday.
2687125	2692029	But did you think I sold anywhere near as many copies without having it early?
2692410	2692610	No.
2692630	2692670	No.
2694178	2695799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2716611	2718252	I'm sorry, that's a cop-out right there.
2718993	2725557	The only jump you have on GameStop is that you can't afford to pick up enough copies to supply your customers.
2725917	2729580	First off, I don't believe that you run out of copies for your customers in the first place.
2729600	2733522	And second off, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from GameStop.
2733863	2743789	And just using that as an excuse to put out a game early, well, first off, you probably can get blacklisted from all the distributors out there, especially if they find out that you're selling games early.
2744530	2745450	It's just a matter of time.
2747472	2752654	If your customers are that unloyal to you, where you don't have it out early, they're going to go elsewhere.
2753335	2759458	People, yeah, there are rabid fans of games that are going to go wherever they can get it early, but I'm sorry, that's not an excuse.
2760566	2762107	Is there an easy answer to this, though?
2762147	2768269	Because, you know, the bottom line is the consumer is just ultimately going to go wherever they can get it.
2768649	2771370	They'll go to the Ma and Pa store if it's out there.
2771430	2780133	They'll go to GameStop if Kotaku, Joystick, Destructoid, whoever runs a story that, hey, these GameStops in such and such New Jersey broke the street date.
2780513	2787736	You know there were people driving in from Pennsylvania and New York to these stores just to get the damn game because the series has that big level fans.
2787776	2788597	Well, here's the problem.
2788637	2790799	What they need to do is basically this.
2790980	2794263	They need to enforce the street date violators.
2794864	2799930	So if these people are breaking the street, they need to enforce it so that these people are reprimanded for doing that.
2800190	2801331	That includes GameStop.
2801411	2803374	These stores need to be all...
2805177	2823223	And if you give GameStop an exception because they decided to break the law because someone else was, well, I'm sorry, you know, if I decide to break the law because I see someone else breaking the law, like, for example, if I see someone speeding past me on the freeway and I decide, hey, you know what, I'm going to go 100 miles an hour, too, and I get pulled over for speeding, I can't blame them for speeding.
2823583	2824383	It was my own choice.
2825083	2830465	Well, devil's advocate, not that I don't agree with you, but devil's advocate, when you break street date, you're not breaking the law.
2831294	2832277	Thank you for watching!
2840939	2848022	Don't go into that agreement with your distributor or whomever, the publisher, if you're not going to abide by it.
2848523	2854766	How can the playing field be leveled between the Ma and Pa stores and the GameStops from your perspective?
2854806	2856667	Because I'm kind of surprised.
2856707	2862409	You're placing a lot more blame on the Ma and Pa stores than I kind of would have thought, considering those are the folks that you work with.
2862469	2864290	But a lot of what you say makes sense.
2864710	2867232	But the bottom line is that these places...
2867992	2870033	Claim they can't compete with GameStop
2898372	2910320	you know a lot of people also like the stupid little perks that you get from ordering with GameStop you know little trinkets and crap that if you actually look at it you know it's not that great in the first place you know some of the
2911651	2914694	Do you really need a keychain for a game?
2914934	2916215	Are you going to be fine without that?
2916455	2916936	Probably.
2917676	2921880	Are these mom-and-pop stores going to give you a better trade-in value on your game than GameStop?
2922601	2922921	Maybe.
2923261	2923722	It depends.
2924442	2926284	Is the customer service going to be better?
2926824	2927325	It all depends.
2927385	2930587	It's just like all this hatred for shopping at Walmart or something.
2930668	2935332	If you like shopping at Walmart and you find the prices to be fair, then why not shop there?
2935492	2937253	They just...
2939471	2944695	They just try to compete with them, and then they give up so easily because they're not as big.
2944995	2948218	And they're like, well, why can't they get all the advertising materials that GameStop has?
2948258	2953042	Well, they make a lot of it in-house, and they buy a lot of games, so they have the publisher backing for a lot of this stuff.
2953762	2956765	They have the pull to where they actually make the publishers pay them for shelf space.
2956825	2960328	I mean, you're never going to be as big as GameStop.
2961248	2961789	Get over it.
2961889	2963150	You've got to find a different way to compete.
2963190	2967894	And I have other stores out there that do just fine, and they abide by all the street dates.
2968826	2969927	So, it can be done.
2970768	2974131	Interesting little mini-debate in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
2974171	2975953	DangerSkew says, Easy solution.
2976073	2983300	Implement some type of server-side solution that does not allow the game to be played until street date, just like what PC games are starting to do.
2983660	2987804	But GameGuru and Frisbee pipe up and say, No, no online activation.
2988084	2989566	The games won't work offline.
2990997	2991518	and so forth.
2992278	2992879	You can't do that.
2992979	3000405	I mean, because there's people that aren't connected to online and if that's the case, if they're not connected online, there's no way to verify what date you have in your system.
3000445	3002506	I mean, you can switch a date around and it wouldn't matter.
3002986	3008050	So, I don't think that's a solution and really it's just going to come with enforcing street dates.
3008291	3008591	I mean...
3008951	3009371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3027356	3028276	That'll get their attention.
3028737	3034018	But at the same time, GameStop can't fucking just go break Street Date because they feel that they need to be competitive against these stores.
3034258	3037079	I'm sorry, you're not going to lose sales to these stores.
3037219	3038520	I mean, you're fucking GameStop.
3038640	3040680	It's not going to matter if you sell two less copies.
3041080	3041721	You're GameStop.
3041741	3043701	You make $7 billion a year.
3043901	3045042	It does not fucking matter.
3046042	3048745	Do you think any action should be taken against GameStop for this?
3048765	3049325	I think it should.
3049526	3055051	I think what they should have done is taken... They would have had a lot more pull if they took the high road and didn't put out any of these games.
3055411	3057533	If they just said, hey, look, we play by the rules.
3058574	3064380	Because they actually have the pull where they can go, listen, you're not fucking street dating anymore titles because this is what happens when you're street dating them.
3064700	3066782	And they're a big proponent of not street dating titles.
3066802	3067202	You know why?
3067543	3071026	Because the mom-pop stores get it two days later and then they have the advantage.
3072042	3072762	Thanks for watching!
3091061	3091581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3113196	3120361	A huge thing they're talking about today is that some Italian website started selling the MP3s for the new Lady Gaga album.
3120762	3124844	So of course, one person went in and downloaded it, and what do you think happened?
3125285	3131869	Now everybody who browses that community has a copy of the new Lady Gaga album about 10 days before it was actually supposed to come out.
3131889	3132730	Actually, it happens all the time.
3133090	3135392	It doesn't matter if it's the new Lady Gaga album or whatever.
3135932	3142517	Promo copies go out to... And I might be talking about some musician that you personally don't care about, but keep in mind...
3143418	3151285	I'm throwing music, movies, games all in the same boat here with broken... You know, one person ruined... In this case, not even in America.
3151746	3158953	One person in Italy on the internet ruins it, the street date, and it has colossal repercussions.
3159794	3160154	Exactly.
3160474	3162236	Games leak online early all the time.
3162697	3163137	All the time.
3163898	3163978	Um...
3165202	3165803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3182128	3200476	promo copies are sent out there to get people to supply the album in their store movies, screeners get put out there or they're just dumping region 5 DVDs from Russia that come out early and you have DVD copies of all sorts of movies that are out in theaters now and stuff like that
3200976	3201637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3227667	3229669	And to be fair, some of them do.
3229849	3232952	And at the end of the day, Lady Gaga's probably not going to hurt any from this happening.
3233753	3239618	But the point still stands is that there's a lot of people getting this stuff before they're supposed to be.
3240198	3242260	And it only delays the inevitable anyways.
3242801	3248145	If someone's waiting for a pirated copy, yeah, they may want to play it early.
3248286	3251829	But then again, that also has its repercussions, as with the console bannings.
3254053	3260500	So, I mean, everything has its downside to it, but I think, like, I know, for example, Grand Theft Auto 4.
3260680	3264464	Yes, I downloaded a copy early because I wanted to play it right away.
3265144	3271090	But when it came out, I bought six copies of it because I just wanted to play it really early because I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.
3271751	3274714	Needed to play it, like in the heroine or something.
3277413	3279475	but I still bought it.
3279755	3284621	I do have a problem with just downloading something early and not paying for it.
3285582	3287164	Not to say that I haven't done that before.
3287484	3292730	I probably have, but it's stuff that I wouldn't have bought anyways or stuff I try once for three minutes and throw it away.
3294052	3295073	Like a lot of the Wii games out there.
3297213	3299654	And again, chat, folks, look at the big picture.
3299714	3302154	I'm not specifically talking about Lady Gaga.
3302174	3303735	I'm using that as an example.
3303855	3306716	It's just one I happened to notice because I personally like her.
3307136	3308616	But I realize a lot of you don't.
3309096	3309997	Look at the bigger picture.
3310177	3316478	This has happened to every musician because that window between when the critics get it and all that is way too big.
3317018	3317399	And again, one –
3319279	3334647	especially with how quick and portable music files are one internet person leaks it and everybody on the internet has it insert your favorite band here, it's happened to them it's the swine flu of the internet I guess you could say that so, alright, anyhow
3335551	3340876	I guess we can move on to other stories, but it's just very interesting because in a way there's no easy answer.
3342157	3349683	It's stuff that's just going to be... This isn't going away, it's just been brought to the forefront for once, I guess.
3350003	3351104	Very interesting comment from Chad.
3351144	3354247	I want to state here, though, because I thought this also plays a part of it.
3354767	3358731	Jimmy Jack in chat says, GameStop has a limited business model anyway.
3359171	3362054	Once digital distribution is mainstream, they are screwed.
3362374	3362514	Right.
3363232	3363533	and DarkSakura.
3378032	3378792	That's a big thing.
3379472	3383174	And a lot of these stores, you know, they're selling copies that are sealed.
3383314	3386735	And if they don't have a copy that's not sealed, they're not selling it to their customer.
3387115	3388615	That's another thing that separates them.
3388895	3400099	Or, if you maybe just don't like going into GameStop because they have maybe a limited selection of PC titles, maybe they don't have the retro games you're looking for, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from all these other people out there.
3400499	3403600	If that were the case, then there wouldn't be any mom and pop shops because you just can't compete.
3403980	3411085	Also, you know, and in some places, again, I don't want to stereotype all, but a lot of times GameStop kind of has that...
3412486	3415407	or about it of like you get a lot of people that don't really care about their jobs.
3415427	3418348	You get a lot of college kids who just, you know, looking for something to do, right?
3418388	3419388	They don't want to work fast food.
3419709	3425331	You know, I, again, that's not all the employees, but I think it's certainly a stereotype they have to deal with.
3425711	3432913	On the other hand, you know, in a lot of Ma and Pa stores, Ma and Pa who are running that store obviously have a love of video games if they're running the place in the first place.
3433293	3436975	And a lot of times you're going to get people who really, really freaking care about what they're doing.
3437335	3437675	Again,
3438115	3439537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3456397	3459138	I don't really think that they liked video games all that much.
3459158	3459398	I knew them.
3459418	3462160	And no, they didn't really like video games all that much.
3462220	3462820	Interesting.
3463180	3465101	They just sold it because they knew that's where the money was at the time.
3481348	3484930	I think a lot of times passion leaves when the company gets that big.
3485090	3486390	It's all about money.
3486650	3489271	It's less about really if you like video games or not.
3489511	3491692	It's just that we're selling video games because it makes us a lot of money.
3492032	3493013	We're a capitalist society.
3493073	3494113	It's all based on the bottom line.
3494333	3494894	Money, money, money.
3495674	3495934	All right.
3496274	3497014	Let's move on, guys.
3497055	3498195	I want to move on to another story.
3498615	3499235	Oh, boy.
3499335	3501136	From one controversial topic to another.
3501196	3502777	Speaking of passionate people...
3504312	3504752	And Hypocritical
3526239	3527942	I'm not going to get into the political aspect of it.
3527982	3528482	I'm just not.
3528963	3534369	But regardless, PETA's there and sometimes they do these very big things for show.
3534389	3535511	PETA's are tasty with hummus.
3536300	3540722	You know, I once – and I think I've probably told this story before.
3541062	3549606	Once I was kind of talking to online on a dating website a guy who worked for PETA and it was very – I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff.
3549887	3553328	I also used to date a gay Republican, which to me was fascinating too.
3553969	3557790	I like diverse people even when sometimes that diversity doesn't agree with me.
3557850	3558391	So it's kind of –
3559051	3559772	I don't know, it's interesting.
3560192	3565756	But I know from talking to somebody who works directly with the organization, they're very passionate about what they do.
3565816	3570299	Whether you agree with them or not, they definitely have huge passion.
3570780	3572181	And they get very creative.
3572201	3576784	And one of the ways they get creative is that they do these little online games to get their message across.
3577105	3582849	There was a game that they put out a while ago, Super Chick Sisters, which was there to kind of protest KFC.
3582869	3584690	I remember we talked about it on the show a while back.
3584730	3585751	This was back in 2007.
3585791	3586251	Well, guess what?
3586552	3587873	There is a brand new...
3588613	3592856	New Super Chick Sisters So just in time for new Super Mario Bros.
3592916	3609045	Wii that came out today We also have new Super Chick Sisters But it has nothing to do with KFC this time No, it's all about McDonald's I don't know what the specifics is But obviously the McNuggets did not get there very easily So it probably has something to do with that whole thing
3610125	3618831	I have not played the game myself, but I imagine they are not happy about how the chicken turns into the McNugget, so they've built this whole game about awareness.
3620192	3626916	And I guess the whole idea behind it is how they tap into the market, is that they're not...
3628587	3629688	It's not a poster.
3629848	3631049	It's not a protest.
3631589	3636113	It's a flash video game which oftentimes tend to be very viral.
3636153	3636774	I mean look about it.
3636814	3638055	I'm talking about it here on the show.
3638735	3642278	But more the kind of creativity in their marketing.
3642618	3646802	But it's out there and to which I see Jamie and Loki rolling their eyes.
3648063	3653187	This next time you talk to someone from PETA, ask them how many animals they euthanize every year.
3655248	3661994	Ask them about how many of their higher-ups have type 2 diabetes and have to take insulin.
3662154	3665677	I don't know when the next time I'm going to be in Norfolk, Virginia is, which is where their office is.
3667159	3669220	And that's when I was talking to the dude.
3669280	3673484	But, you know, whatever.
3674685	3675506	Well, you know what?
3675626	3677988	I would have no problem with PETA if they weren't big hypocrites.
3678749	3679049	That's all.
3680205	3684489	Well, okay, stepping away from what PETA's all about and all this, because I don't know.
3684629	3687172	I just don't know enough about PETA because I've just never really cared.
3688193	3694579	What about this whole, this is how they market their message, is creating these viral flash video games.
3695299	3697802	Also, it's actually pretty defamatory, too.
3697922	3699163	Remember the Cooking Mama one?
3699563	3700104	I do remember that.
3700124	3700564	That was funny.
3701045	3705309	But in the end, though, I mean, it's like...
3706877	3718264	I don't think that they really care whose toes they step on because they think that they're invincible and honestly I would love to have a full scale investigation gone into the business practices of PETA
3720251	3727198	Very interesting, because I am looking at a screenshot here from the game, and it's not like they're trying to hide the fact that it's Mario.
3727238	3729380	I mean, there's a big red M on his cap.
3729900	3731802	He very much looks like Mario.
3732162	3739910	If I were Nintendo, I might think I could sue over protection of my character, although, I don't know, but then can't you get into parody and all this?
3740590	3740971	I don't know.
3741251	3745295	You still have to have enough remarkable difference that, you know...
3746603	3749685	I think that that actually is close enough to infringement right there.
3749705	3753747	Because, I mean, looking from where I am right here, it looks like Mario and Luigi.
3754928	3757189	And I've got my glasses on and everything.
3757309	3758370	It looks like Mario and Luigi.
3758490	3764574	But if you get super close up, you can see a little text on there that says, Princess Pamela Anderson kidnapped again.
3764614	3766555	And that's where I know this is not a Nintendo game.
3766575	3767095	You know what I mean?
3767455	3770417	That's where I go, okay, A... I'm sorry, that looks like Mario.
3770557	3771377	Pamela Anderson...
3772418	3799706	was maybe good looking like 20 years ago when she was on Baywatch but she's no princess now she's barbed wire she'd kick their ass again I was just talking about oh no they didn't earlier and funny enough I'm going to bring them up again once in a while they'll run these pictures of Pamela Anderson without makeup and oh my heavens she is not good looking anymore is she with Tommy Lee or Kid Rock at this point who fucking cares well I'll know
3800305	3802287	But obviously she's big on PETA.
3802347	3804569	She's one of their big supporters and stuff.
3804589	3805750	And that's why she gets named the princess.
3805770	3808532	That's because they're brainwashing people, especially people who have no brains.
3809193	3809473	Alright.
3810694	3811615	Let's just move on.
3813016	3814317	I just wanted to get it out there.
3814517	3817079	It's interesting marketing using video games.
3817540	3820382	It is showing you, I will say this, let me finish on this thought.
3820782	3823665	You, as a gamer, are being targeted.
3825475	3826235	for propaganda.
3827655	3828696	That's why I brought this up.
3828956	3829836	That's what I wanted to say.
3829856	3834157	Just serve me up a plate of fried sea kittens.
3834577	3844459	I'm sorry, it's going to be an argument between Guitar Hero 5 and Madden for KFC's side or Super Chick Sisters.
3845179	3850360	I'm sorry, I don't recognize Super Chick Sisters but Guitar Hero 5 and Madden tell me to go eat chicken.
3851140	3852300	I'm going to have to listen to them.
3853260	3881370	Because I don't want to piss off Chick-fil-A The cows say to eat more chicken They have signs Alright, this was the worst possible show to bring up this topic on Let's move on Well, especially since you're in, you know, PETA Hater Central Which would be me But I don't hate I don't hate You know what, I hate hypocrites I do, there are things I hate But I'm trying not to hate I do not hate people
3882677	3882997	Project Natal
3905441	3908784	There are details, including release dates, sort of.
3909966	3917553	We should be looking at it possibly around November 2010, and it should be costing around 50 bucks.
3918794	3923539	And they are speculating that 5 million units will be ready by that time.
3924941	3926724	So they're thinking big seller.
3927405	3933514	And they don't really just have a bunch of happy gamers all on them.
3933534	3935758	They have Time Magazine all on them.
3937443	3946270	Project Natal made it into the top 50 invention poll on the Time Magazine website.
3946991	3949073	How is that possible for a device that's not even out?
3949313	3950954	But it's been invented.
3951074	3953476	It's been invented on display.
3953697	3954497	And who's played it?
3954537	3955198	Jimmy Fallon.
3955418	3956559	Big deal.
3956779	3957960	But it's Jimmy Fallon.
3958080	3959902	He means a lot to everybody, right?
3960262	3960462	No?
3960883	3961964	Chirp chirp, cricket cricket.
3962124	3975796	They're quoted, they're saying that Project Natal, because it uses several cameras and the microphone and because it's so much more intuitive than anything that's been out to this date and is going to be put out on a mass consumer market, it's right up there with the bladeless fan.
3975816	3975917	Yeah.
3977028	3977608	Super Virtual Boy X2-5
4006479	4007039	Wait a minute.
4007540	4009581	Okay, you know what the iToy was good for?
4010641	4013363	The wash-in-windows game that played that song from the 1920s.
4013443	4014463	That was awesome.
4014563	4016364	Yes, when I'm wash-in-windows.
4016404	4019086	That was the greatest thing they ever did with the iToy, okay?
4019386	4021087	And that game actually worked pretty well.
4021387	4027250	But a lot of these other games they released for the iToy did not play like you think they would on the back of the box.
4027990	4042277	All I'm saying, again, I realize Natal is a much higher advanced technology than iToy, but when I see this little 12-year-old girl walking up and trying on her clothes by waving her hand, I'm kind of like, okay, well, that's what they want us to believe it really plays like.
4043117	4048920	Yeah, and we were making that joke is that when Natal was being previewed, like, wasn't this a scene in Clueless like 10 years ago?
4049580	4052583	But how is it really going to work that flawlessly?
4052603	4057627	Because part of me goes, you know, well, my DS is supposed to understand me saying blue, too.
4057667	4058928	But here I am going, brew!
4059508	4060649	Brew!
4060809	4061390	Brew!
4061850	4064733	Let me mention some of the other things that are on the list.
4065453	4065733	Okay.
4066494	4071478	For the list of stuff that's... And I actually can't really call this a list of inventions.
4072179	4073320	Because there are...
4074480	4077563	Not necessarily all real inventions.
4078084	4080566	Some are innovations in existing technology.
4080586	4081166	Some are books.
4081527	4083228	Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is on the list.
4083629	4085991	Is the Snuggie on the list?
4086131	4088914	The Dog Snuggie is on... I approve of the list.
4088954	4094419	The Snuggie is the greatest invention of modern times.
4094439	4095180	Have you seen The Sleepy?
4095220	4096781	The Dog Snuggie, Rob.
4096801	4097482	The Dog Snuggie.
4097930	4098791	Have you seen the Sleepy?
4099231	4100992	No, what's the Sleepy?
4101032	4106915	It's like a sleeping bag made out of bed sheets that has no zipper.
4107636	4109197	And it has a pillow inside of it.
4109297	4109737	Amazing.
4109757	4111318	Well, here's some of the stuff that's on here.
4111538	4113259	And some of these are actually pretty worthy.
4113639	4118502	The $10 million lightbulb, I love it, is actually a lightbulb that runs on LEDs.
4118582	4121004	It's just as bright as any lightbulb and will never burn out.
4122966	4124708	They've actually teleported atoms.
4126971	4136563	They have a guy who lost his vision and when I figured out with these other guys how to have a camera implanted into his eyeball so that he can record stuff.
4137952	4139253	Robot Penguins Robot Penguins, Rob
4167509	4168089	Thanks for watching!
4186465	4193732	This is... I don't see... A team of Dutch scientists is closing in on culturing stem cells from pigs and growing muscle in a petri dish.
4193833	4194073	Okay.
4194633	4195634	In vitro meat.
4196115	4197236	Okay, so I understand.
4197276	4201921	Maybe now this list makes a little more sense because a lot of these are things we haven't actually gotten to do ourselves.
4202321	4205084	You know, I have never grown meat myself.
4205124	4206666	I've never grown my own meat to eat.
4206706	4207947	This sounds like much more of a math thing to do.
4207967	4208808	Here's the robo-penguin.
4209088	4209268	What?
4209709	4209909	Okay.
4210670	4213052	So Natal, I see, fits into this list because a lot of these things.
4213312	4220119	But then again, I also say, does Project Natal really deserve to be up there with meat that you grow?
4221120	4221760	That sounds...
4223742	4224662	The unicycle thing.
4225383	4226824	I watched that thing.
4229005	4233348	Project Natal, I would say... Because you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a unicycle.
4233969	4236631	Just like you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a Segway.
4236811	4239052	What was that thing on South Park called?
4240674	4241294	I don't remember.
4241474	4244716	Whenever I see these new riding devices, I always think of that thing on South Park.
4244776	4246418	That one episode.
4246498	4248299	I know some of you listeners know what I'm talking about.
4248897	4249918	A 3D camera.
4250599	4252681	The smart bullet is my favorite invention on the list.
4253321	4257005	It's a bullet that you can trigger to explode after you've already shot it into somebody.
4257846	4260888	You can choose when the bullet explodes.
4261729	4263130	It's the best thing ever.
4265132	4266354	You don't want to piss me off.
4266454	4266914	Why not?
4267054	4269657	Because I just shot you and if I hit this button, you're fucked.
4269677	4271879	They've also figured out how to levitate a mouse with magnets.
4272694	4273435	Thanks for watching!
4286798	4289821	And Rob, it was the Wild Wacky Action Bike.
4290722	4292824	Wild Wacky Action Bike.
4293124	4294765	YouTube Funk, what the fuck.
4295126	4300010	Well, something else from Microsoft coming soon, of course, would be the Fall Update.
4301151	4304955	And we can expect that on Tuesday, November 17th.
4305335	4312782	With that will be coming the Facebook and Twitter integration, as well as Last.fm and all sorts of other fun stuff.
4313783	4324818	and um honestly still haven't really played around the Facebook and Twitter stuff other than the one time I posted on Twitter saying hey I'm posting from an Xbox 360 which apparently everybody else did so now I feel like a loser um
4326087	4328108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4356327	4362631	Integration with Facebook, a little shot of the cross-media bar there with a Facebook link there.
4363211	4368955	And also some thumbnails of photos in a grid layout.
4369095	4378141	So some other features coming possibly in a later expansion to the, I guess, the new cross-media bar.
4379241	4379562	Which is...
4380362	4384485	Good, I guess, because we need a lot more updates from consoles for different things.
4385146	4396234	I know with at least the Xbox 360 one, I know they're going to add some screenshots and stuff like that, which would be pretty awesome, because then when I kill people in Grand Theft Auto, I can share it with everybody.
4397395	4401038	Although that would be a lot of photos I'm sharing, because I kick a lot of ass in that game.
4402139	4402739	Okay, maybe not.
4403400	4403500	Um...
4404824	4405505	But yeah, it's interesting.
4405525	4406246	So what do you think, Jamie?
4407127	4408588	Something that you would probably use?
4408948	4411071	Although you don't play much on the PlayStation 3, do you?
4411211	4411952	No, I really don't.
4412132	4413213	I probably wouldn't use it.
4413373	4416256	But I actually...
4417945	4423691	I'll be honest, a lot of the little networking stuff through the consoles, I really have no interest in.
4424112	4428376	Because the only things that I use for my networking is my iPhone and my computer.
4429257	4437726	So it would actually more irritate me, I think, if I was being interrupted in a game for Facebook.
4438407	4445773	Well, I'm just hoping that they don't have automatic updates for trophies or achievements or something like that.
4446614	4449416	I know that they've kind of tried something a little bit with Twitter with Uncharted 2.
4449456	4452238	It was a big pain in the ass?
4452439	4457403	I haven't really seen anything from that because I don't think a lot of people use it because they realize how annoying that would be.
4457523	4460245	Well, the Raptor thing is what pisses me off.
4460785	4462106	Well, yeah, I've seen that too.
4462146	4462787	That's kind of annoying.
4463488	4464448	Especially with Twitter.
4464548	4466930	I mean, you can kind of block some of that stuff now.
4469125	4497354	and at least with Facebook in fact actually I've been going through on Facebook and kind of blocking all of the apps which actually makes it really nice because now I can actually see what my friends are updating without having to sort through all those apps on there I've been doing much the same still kind of going through everything and hopefully hopefully I can actually get down to where it's just my friends posting and stuff like that but there are a few though especially from Rob that I can't block because they're actually a screenshot that he has on there but um
4498362	4498783	Which one?
4498823	4499704	The sorority life?
4500085	4501186	Uh, no, it's not sorority life.
4501226	4503089	It's like a quiz or something that he's doing.
4503269	4505152	You can actually go in and block a lot of those quizzes, too.
4505713	4506755	I know, I've been doing that.
4506775	4513144	You can do hide app whenever you get a post up on your wall.
4513765	4513906	Hmm.
4514486	4520568	So I actually do that with a lot of stuff now, because honestly, I'm irritated by a lot of it.
4520688	4527210	And the only thing that I actually even play anymore on Facebook is the stupid little pet game that I like so much.
4528390	4529870	The Pet Society thing.
4531231	4531691	And that's it.
4533811	4534011	Yeah.
4534572	4537492	So you're going to be using a lot of the Facebook stuff and Twitter.
4537672	4539573	I know you're going to use some Last.fm stuff.
4540390	4541652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4560174	4565636	Hey guys, I'm updating my Twitter from Xbox, and then I never see another tweet from the Xbox.
4566036	4573298	And the only thing I worry about, again, is just the TwitSpam that we're already seeing, not just from Xbox, but like Uncharted 2 and some of these other games.
4573838	4576079	Like, you know, I just beat Level 3 in Uncharted 2.
4576619	4577159	I don't care!
4578199	4580200	Just all the Raptor people need to shut up.
4580300	4587662	And the problem is, is that unlike Facebook, Twitter has no button where I can say, filter all posts with hashtag Uncharted 2 in it.
4588814	4589354	You know what I mean?
4589714	4591815	And I'm not knocking Uncharted 2.
4591916	4594537	I haven't played it myself, but I hear the game is fabulous and it looks like fun.
4594577	4595477	I want to play it myself.
4595857	4598179	But I'm just saying this whole tweet spam thing has got to go.
4598599	4599379	Same thing with Facebook.
4599599	4601460	It was basically just to say, hey, we did it first.
4602421	4602841	I guess.
4604642	4604902	Anyhow.
4605821	4613266	Alright, well, moving on to other topics and maybe a game that might be publishing status updates to your Facebook very soon.
4614086	4618009	Drum Hero is a game that has been trademarked by Activision.
4618329	4621551	Keep in mind, though, this doesn't mean that necessarily the game is being made or anything.
4621571	4622452	I thought they already did this.
4622492	4622812	It is just...
4623112	4627453	Well, you know, a lot of people were kind of having this whole little like, wait a minute, haven't we heard this before?
4627774	4630814	But here's the thing, and this is what makes this newsworthy.
4631455	4637917	Previously, Activision trademarked the titles Guitar Villain and Drum Villain, and this was way back in 2007 when they did that.
4638817	4639918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4667003	4688027	In an interview with MCVUK.com, CEO Dan Rosenwig of the Guitar Hero brand and works for Activision says that the publisher is apparently already working on new versions of Guitar Hero and Band Hero and that there will also be more DJ Hero, which I'm sure all of this makes you go, duh, duh, and more duh.
4688067	4689488	We all know more of these games is coming.
4689788	4693108	But one thing they are saying, fewer SKUs in 2010.
4693969	4695629	But keep in mind, SKU is a term...
4696676	4699658	That's been, well, let's say skewed over the past couple years.
4699678	4706161	This has kind of made its way from a retail-only world to the mainstream game blogs.
4706201	4708202	Everybody throws this term skew around.
4708562	4709903	And what does skew really mean?
4709983	4712484	Skew is essentially like a barcode, I guess you could say.
4713125	4715006	Maybe you could explain this better than I could, Loki.
4715526	4719288	But basically, this doesn't mean like one game does not mean one skew.
4719768	4720469	A skew is...
4721229	4725833	Guitar Hero 5, Guitar plus Game on Wii is one SKU.
4726213	4729196	Guitar plus Drum plus Game on Wii is one SKU.
4729536	4731057	Game alone, another SKU, right?
4731658	4731858	Yeah.
4732578	4733839	It's basically kind of how it works.
4734320	4739724	Just because there's less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be less games, although that's kind of the conclusion a lot of people are jumping to.
4739945	4745529	And remember that this year alone, and this is including Guitar Hero Van Halen, there has been 41 SKUs.
4746350	4746730	Wow.
4746770	4749733	So less than that doesn't necessarily mean that much of a difference.
4750478	4757364	And that's because, you know, you have four different systems, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii, that all these games are coming out on.
4757904	4761988	And then you have the Jumbo Kit, the game alone, and the game and guitar.
4762168	4766332	The DS, and also possibly the PSP, which is actually supposed to be coming out next year as well.
4766492	4766732	Oh, wow.
4767608	4769049	And if you want to include the iPhone, I guess.
4769809	4770970	Right.
4772331	4781137	And also, by the way, Bobby in the chat room, which I think is interesting, he's bringing this up as well, says, another term co-opted by blogs that he's using correctly is price point.
4781537	4785280	That's a marketing term, not something, say, to talk about how much something costs you at retail.
4785600	4788442	And we're probably just as guilty as the next guy of using that term a lot.
4788502	4792645	It's kind of interesting how that has – that term, I would say, has almost evolved.
4792665	4792765	Right.
4793665	4796746	Maybe that's not what it's supposed to mean, but that's what everyone thinks it means now.
4797126	4797986	I always use MSRP.
4798006	4798747	Yeah, microtransaction.
4799327	4799967	Yeah, that too.
4800107	4812691	Anyway, getting off the subject a little bit here, but just because there's talking about less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean less games, although I personally think we're not going to see the Metallica and Van Halen-style releases next year in Aerosmith.
4813011	4821294	I don't think we're going to see any band-only releases next year, especially not after this whole stink about what's going on in Guitar Hero 5 with the band soon.
4821374	4822574	Actually, because of that stink,
4822958	4823258	Really?
4823718	4829501	Yeah, because then they'd have that one band that's already agreed to have their likeness in there, and then they're not really singing other people's songs.
4831562	4832022	I don't know, though.
4832042	4836725	Part of me just says it's kind of been done with all the big bands that are going to get their own game.
4837445	4839886	I mean, granted, I'm sure there's a million people.
4840006	4841867	Everybody's going to shout out their favorite band.
4842187	4844828	But are these games really selling that well?
4845068	4845609	I mean, come on.
4845649	4847229	The Van Halen one, they were given away.
4847990	4848210	Yeah.
4849372	4852817	Van Halen's still selling pretty well because a lot of people didn't buy it within that one month.
4853739	4854580	It's that one month.
4854780	4856903	After September, you aren't getting it for free.
4858667	4859507	I'm just surprised.
4859567	4862088	Again, I'm going to take a lot of hate with this comment, but I don't care.
4862649	4864089	Van Halen doesn't deserve their own game.
4864289	4868572	Especially not if they're going to ignore the latter half of the career.
4868892	4870072	I understand that.
4870593	4875335	And yeah, a lot of the older games like Aerosmith does not sell for shit right now.
4875915	4876996	But it's old.
4877316	4878577	It is old, but it doesn't matter though.
4878617	4879617	It's still another band.
4880858	4881478	Metallica?
4882919	4883419	Once in a while.
4884860	4885420	Smash Hits?
4885440	4885560	Never.
4885680	4885960	Never.
4887864	4888625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4911885	4914768	I see a couple people in chat are making a reference to Michael Jackson.
4914808	4916449	Specifically, I'll read this comment from Sterlok.
4916469	4917330	He has his own game coming.
4927034	4927675	and DarkSakura.com
4943291	4945352	I already have a theory of what Drum Hero is.
4945432	4949573	It's going to be something for either the DSi or an iPhone.
4949793	4955614	If you think about it, Guitar Hero can't do that on the DSi because there's no place to plug the guitar in.
4956014	4961136	But you better believe it, that drum skin that they put out for Band Hero, the DS version, can fit on the DSi.
4961696	4962536	So there's your drum.
4963547	4981792	drum hero that's actually one of the more creative thoughts I've heard is that maybe a lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that this is like a sequel to Guitar Hero but maybe it's an iPhone port makes a lot of freaking sense it'd be kind of neat to do something on Xbox Live Arcade or something like that too you know then that way you don't need a guitar you can just play it with your you know buttons hmm
4982512	4983673	That is a very interesting prospect.
5012796	5013557	Vib Ribbon
5030993	5034575	There are some songs in Lego Rock Band I want to play, but not the whole thing.
5034975	5039097	So I'll probably buy the game just to import the songs, but when it's in the clearance bin.
5039117	5044120	Because right now, $50 for the game plus another $10 for the import fees, I'm not feeling it.
5044540	5048783	But the game will end up in the bargain bin inevitably at some point, so I'll buy it then.
5049943	5054886	It's kind of interesting with all of these SKUs, if you want to say, or games coming out,
5056345	5056925	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5072094	5075395	I'm surprised that Boom Boom Rocket, was that what it was called?
5075835	5077015	Remember that game that came out on Xbox?
5077455	5078576	I was actually really good at that game.
5078596	5080076	I had a bunch of high scores for a while.
5080116	5081256	I probably don't anymore.
5081716	5087098	But Boom Boom Rocket, I'm kind of surprised they never did anything with that.
5087638	5089618	All the songs in that were classical songs.
5091199	5096800	Imagine if they had actually put some licensed songs or some fun techno things into that shell.
5097600	5098861	That game could have been a whole lot more.
5099061	5099681	Yeah, it would have been cool.
5101127	5113093	and then of course, the inevitable Bobby's Yelling Out, Beat and Groovy but that game was always just doomed for disaster we all knew Konami was not going to have the faith to try and get licensed songs there by the way, did you realize Poppin' Music Wii came out?
5113273	5127619	no, somebody in chat said it, and I actually kind of went and went, oh yeah, that came out, huh but I just don't have interest in it oh by the way, it's coming out sell some copies did you sell some copies?
5127639	5130901	nope just curious not a copy
5132101	5133803	I know better than the torch of my customers like that
5158164	5159385	It's got dates!
5159945	5160586	Realistic.
5160646	5160926	I don't know.
5160946	5163507	This thing's been the figment of my imagination for about four years.
5165748	5176715	There's supposed to have a simultaneous PS3 and Xbox 360 release for Final Fantasy XIII in the US and in Europe on the 9th of March, 2010.
5177995	5179837	So, hey, we've only got a few more months to go.
5180557	5182278	Of course, if you're in Japan, you get it next month.
5184266	5195355	And it's kind of interesting because the turnaround, you know, they promised that it was going to be a much quicker turnaround this time, but they really made it happen, you know, especially considering there's a 360 port in the works as well.
5195675	5201720	You know, a four-month turnaround by Square standards really doesn't seem all that bad when you were at least looking at nine months before.
5201760	5205663	Like, how long did it take for Final Fantasy X to come over here from the Japanese one?
5205703	5206084	Plenty.
5206284	5207345	Like, almost a year, right?
5208245	5208886	Something like that.
5209146	5209346	Yeah.
5209747	5209907	So...
5211546	5215549	I liked, though, that they did this whole announcement in this big trailer.
5215670	5218552	Like, it's just this big event of a game.
5218592	5220954	Because I guess Final Fantasy XIII does deserve that a little bit.
5220974	5224437	But Square's got a lot riding on this game, don't they?
5226158	5230001	Well, they tend to throw a lot of their stuff in on their Final Fantasy franchise.
5230041	5234064	I mean, that is really what I would say has kept them on the map.
5234645	5236847	I just don't remember all this fanfare over XII.
5237087	5237527	That's all.
5237887	5238808	Well, XII was kind of.
5238908	5239709	As there shouldn't have been.
5240743	5241824	I liked XII.
5242024	5243745	XII just came out at a very bad time.
5244005	5245806	XII should have been made for the PS3 and 360.
5246286	5248568	It just came out at a bad time.
5248728	5252930	They should have just delayed it a year and put it on the next, now gen or whatever you want to call them, consoles.
5252950	5254071	Yeah.
5254731	5257853	I was going to say that the guy in the trailer was a douche.
5258734	5259214	Yeah, a little bit.
5259234	5260775	He had kind of a douchey vibe, didn't he?
5261095	5265438	But it's like, you know, it's kind of typical of them to do something very fanfare like that because...
5266224	5266965	Lyonna Lewis The Theme Song
5289002	5293225	So here in the US and UK, but not in Japan.
5293265	5299750	So they're actually having different artists, which is kind of new because even when they localized the Kingdom Hearts song, it was still Utada, Hikaru.
5300190	5301591	But she's also bilingual.
5301691	5303052	I got concert tickets for her in January.
5303072	5303853	I'm so excited.
5305514	5309096	Anyhow, but what was I going to say before I got sidetracked with that?
5309196	5314640	Oh, this is the first time that they've had like a different artist singing it over here, right?
5314860	5315020	No.
5315281	5315961	No, did they do that with 12?
5316621	5317102	I don't remember.
5317202	5317882	They did that with 10 too.
5319195	5319896	Wasn't it the same?
5320576	5321877	It was the same song.
5321897	5323458	Oh, I forgot about 10-2.
5323498	5324299	That's right.
5324919	5328021	Yeah, they got What's Her Face from Jade.
5328462	5330503	Yeah, Sweet Box or whatever it was called.
5330523	5331104	That's right.
5331144	5331884	I forgot about that.
5332244	5332985	And I was really shocked.
5333005	5338469	And they changed one of the ending videos in the U.S.
5338509	5339770	version from the Japanese version.
5340310	5343532	They actually changed it because of her differences in singing it.
5344973	5345154	So...
5345871	5351353	Well, actually, the song that's going to be in Final Fantasy XIII is a song called My Hands.
5351413	5353573	It's actually on Leona Lewis' next album.
5353713	5358435	And if you're curious what the power ballad of Final Fantasy XIII is going to sound like, we have a little sneak peek for you right here.
5358455	5360936	We can only play a little clip of it because it's all copyright and stuff.
5360976	5361756	Here's a sneak peek.
5373613	5379193	So it sounds like your typical, like, sitting in the dentist's office, kind of, you know, Celine Dion station, you know, power ballad music, you know.
5380188	5383590	Which is kind of typical of the Final Fantasy ballads.
5384070	5388353	It actually does sound pretty J-pop ballad, actually.
5388473	5389053	A little bit.
5389233	5399359	What if they announce something horrible like Popo Sao or something like... Sexy Back is the theme song of Final Fantasy XIII.
5399439	5401080	Sexy Back, yeah.
5401100	5404042	No, that's Final Fantasy XIII versus Sexy Back.
5404986	5410391	So there you go, Leona Lewis, which actually, you know, I gotta say, though, that's a pretty good-sized name to land.
5410671	5411332	But you know what's funny?
5411352	5412452	You know who her record label is?
5413013	5413333	Sony.
5413954	5421981	So, kind of, who knows, maybe a little bit of networking there, but Leona Lewis, you know, that's a pretty, you know, it's not a triple-A artist, but she's hot shit right now.
5422241	5426304	Unfortunately, because of the Sony license, Xbox 360 version will be getting popos out.
5427385	5427746	Shut up.
5428635	5451080	I don't know about the UK but uh she's she's big over here in fact she's the only celebrity from a British reality show except maybe Susan Boyle that is well known over here whereas I'm assuming over there they probably have a lot of our American idols so they're probably not all of them I can't imagine people like Taylor Hicks are big in the UK but probably Kelly Clarkson and
5451793	5454558	Some of those people are big in the UK.
5455740	5458063	I still think that's a pretty decent-sized name to have.
5458424	5460086	Let's not forget, folks, that's...
5461741	5466344	That's for some people, it's not necessarily a draw, but it makes a lot of people do a double take.
5466845	5484697	It kind of, you know, I don't think anybody's going to buy this game because Leona Lewis is in it, but it's definitely going to make a lot of people go, hey, it's going to make some of these critics of video games are not a legitimate art form or video games are not on the same level as movies and TV shows kind of turn their heads and go, oh, oh, Leona Lewis is doing the theme song.
5484737	5485017	Really?
5485337	5486278	That's that's interesting.
5486778	5490041	That's only because they approached Bryan Adams first and he turned him down.
5490401	5490901	Shut up.
5491262	5493083	He's the king of power ballads.
5494064	5494344	All right.
5494404	5500089	Speaking of release dates, let's check out some closer release dates to, you know, like this week.
5500489	5504092	So, Loki, since you finished a bite of your wing there, I'll start with the U.S.
5504212	5504472	dates.
5505093	5506113	There's nothing coming out this week.
5506133	5506894	What are you talking about?
5508735	5509416	No really good stuff.
5509436	5509896	There's actually...
5511112	5511412	Lots of stuff.
5511432	5518115	Depends though what area of the world you're in or United States because that stuff might have already come out with people breaking street date because they suck.
5519556	5526899	No, but of course this week Left 4 Dead 2 making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not PlayStation 3, PC.
5526919	5530920	You wish on the 360 or PS3.
5531561	5539164	Anyways, Assassin's Creed 2 coming out on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
5541435	5557771	Also this week, some smaller titles including Planet 51 Of course, tying in with the new movie coming out That'll be out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP Today, actually, New Super Mario Bros.

5566285	5570569	Buck Fever, if you happen to like deer hunting games, also coming out on the Wii.

5574934	5578337	Formula One on PSP, coming from Codemasters.
5579598	5583582	NCAA Basketball 2010, out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
5584442	5588026	Also Formula One for the Wii as well.
5590528	5601562	This week, another big old bundle game, which I'm not sure is going to sell very well, but Tony Hawk's Ride with the skateboard will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii for a whopping $120.
5602503	5608290	The re-release of Stoked, the bigger edition, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.
5610157	5620845	Ubisoft pimping out their Pets games with Pets Hamster Superstars featuring what appears to be a rollerblading hamster, which is very disturbing.
5622587	5629372	LEGO Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC this week.
5629772	5632454	And also, I believe, the DS and PSP.

5656053	5658295	50s Tag Force 4 on PSP
5659665	5665848	Just Dance from Ubisoft out on the Wii, which the game looks absolutely ridiculous.
5665868	5671871	You remember that stupid minigame that they made me play instead of the sledding one I wanted to play in Rayman's Raven Rabbids TV Party?
5672031	5672551	I remember this.
5672591	5673812	This was at PAX, right?
5673832	5674672	Did that happen?
5674692	5675233	Yes, it was.
5675653	5678935	And unfortunately, this game is very similar to that, so...
5680822	5682684	I don't know, you'd probably look ridiculous playing it.
5683885	5684906	Jamie will get a kick out of this.
5684926	5690030	The Sims 3 World Adventures expansion was coming out this week as well on PC.
5691992	5692612	What does that mean?
5692632	5694214	You can go to France.
5694234	5698537	You can go on safari.
5698737	5699678	On France.
5701420	5702461	I can go to the Louvre.
5703261	5706064	I can take my fake character out for a baguette.
5707045	5708506	Be our guest, be our guest.
5710635	5711095	Sorry, Loki.
5711356	5713317	Can I read some quick chat comments, though, because there's some really funny shit.
5713337	5714278	Yeah, it's only in that voice, though.
5714879	5715439	Okay, then.
5715820	5717441	I will read some comments from Jet.
5718222	5726389	SSJ100 and Matt says that as far as the Final Fantasy theme song goes, Christopher Walken doing Poker Face should be in it.
5726709	5728051	And I'm thinking so much that.
5728571	5730813	Christopher Walken doing anything should be in a video game.
5730833	5731814	Or Cartman doing Poker Face.
5732757	5735278	or Cartman doing poker face or kind of like a mishmash of both.
5736058	5737818	Also, some strange chat.
5737838	5742540	I didn't read this whole thing, but they were talking about sales figures for DJ Hero.
5742560	5746881	Some chatters calling it a flop, but I didn't realize it was a flop.
5747241	5752442	In fact, I thought I saw some article this week that just in those first few days, like because the game came out, what, October 27th?
5752802	5755763	And just in those last few days, it sold like 100,000 copies or something?
5756083	5756243	Yeah.
5756383	5763085	I mean, granted, that's across four different platforms, and I think maybe like 3,000 were sold on the PS2, but, you know, you figure they're not gonna sell well there.
5763445	5765446	I mean, it's a little early to call that game a flop, right?
5766146	5773548	Yeah, I don't think it's sold as, you know, much as, say, like a Guitar Hero game, but then again, it's also way more expensive than a Guitar Hero game, so...
5774423	5775243	Guitar Hero 1
5796451	5797072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5813889	5842460	it is the best music game song list for an initial game in a series ever I wouldn't go so far to say as I enjoy it as much as say maybe the third mix or the sixth mix or sixth style or whatever of other games but I will say as far as an initial song list goes for a franchise launching music game it's the best song list there has ever been in a music game ever yeah
5843581	5845762	Alright, continuing on release dates.
5845963	5846663	This is a big one.
5846743	5848624	LittleBigPlanet coming to the PSP this week.
5848865	5849845	That should be pretty exciting.
5851446	5855569	Disney's The Princess and the Frog, not so exciting on DS and Wii this week.
5855589	5856550	Hey, I want to see that movie.
5856590	5857290	You shut up, hater.
5857690	5858991	Yeah, but the game's not going to be great.
5859011	5859992	Yeah, the game's going to be stupid.
5860012	5862854	The movie will be cool, but the game, not so much.
5864695	5867277	And talk about random licenses, D3.
5867657	5870279	Kamen Rider Dragon Knight on the Wii and DS.
5871420	5871520	Um...
5873567	5878188	Photo Frenzy on the Nintendo DS from Kokum International.
5878369	5880789	And if I remember correctly, I thought that was a DSi-only game.
5881409	5881809	Maybe not.
5882810	5884350	Pets, Dogs, Talent Show.
5884410	5890012	Yet another animal that's dressed up and on a skateboard coming to the DS from Ubisoft.
5890832	5892852	God forbid they do that to animals.
5893673	5893833	And...
5895086	5895906	This is kind of cool.
5896126	5898707	Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue coming to the Wii this week.
5899047	5905089	Oh, God, I remember talking about that like weeks and weeks ago that it was coming out for the Wii and now just out of nowhere here it is, right?
5905270	5905970	Boom, there it is.
5906090	5906430	Boom.
5906810	5907470	Jumbo Safari.
5907590	5909871	Imagine Artist on the Nintendo DS.
5911792	5912632	Let's see.
5913272	5914433	And some smaller games.
5914513	5915673	Rec Room on the Wii.
5919795	5920735	I think that's about it.
5921690	5923670	Next week though, Hello Kitty Party on DS.
5923950	5925191	Woo freaking hoo.
5925251	5928852	Alright, let's go to some Japanese releases and some of the things you have to look forward to over there.
5929292	5938734	Just like we have Left 4 Dead 2 coming out over here, you have that coming out in Japan as well in their own version coming out on the 19th because they get their releases on Fridays if I remember right.
5939314	5942694	Or no, I think they come out like Thursday or something.
5942814	5944255	And over there it's called Ha!
5945675	5946075	Zombies!
5964426	5965147	Tycho Notatujen
5990166	5991007	Callin' Kuroki Chakushin
6006431	6010732	or something and it looks to be like a kind of a scarier game that's coming out on the Wii.
6011052	6021574	I don't see any screenshots but definitely it's got one of those like Japanese grudge looking girls on the front and then like a little cell phone so I think it's has something to do with like cell phone horror or something.
6022314	6025295	I don't know exactly what cell phone horror would be but this game is it.
6025735	6029816	Hey on the PlayStation 2 your monthly bill from AT&T with an iPhone.
6033024	6037006	Oh, Loki, sometimes I feel like there should be a two-drink minimum to listen to this show with you on it.
6037507	6041609	PlayStation 2, Seke, Saikyou, Gensi, Ego, Kuza.
6041669	6046372	For those that are still buying PS2 games on the Nintendo DS, Monster Finder comes out.
6047392	6052635	And then also next week, just so you know, they're also getting like hella, hella, hella Hello Kitty peripherals.
6052995	6056717	Like a new little pouch and a DSi slim pouch and all this stuff.
6057238	6059339	I think it's like an anniversary, actually, of Hello Kitty.
6060017	6060577	I think so too.
6060937	6064819	Mario and Sonic, by the way, at the Vancouver Olympics also comes out in Japan this week.
6065500	6077625	And lastly, taking a look at the Sony PSP, Armored Core, Silent Line Portable coming out over there, as well as Jak and Daxter, a new release there, and a game called Mina no Navi comes out on the PSP.
6077665	6079106	Those are your Japanese release dates.
6080338	6082640	In the UK on the 17th, we have Left 4 Dead 2.
6083280	6085682	We have Gyromancer on the 18th.
6085962	6087523	And a bunch of stuff on the 20th.
6088063	6088724	Assassin's Creed 2.
6089625	6091166	Assassin's Creed Bloodlines.
6092586	6094087	Assassin's Creed 2 Discovery.
6094648	6096149	Okay, just different versions of it.
6096889	6098030	Dragon Age Origins.
6098330	6098731	F1 2009.
6099611	6100872	LittleBigPlanet on PSP.
6101432	6102393	New Super Mario Bros.
6102453	6102693	Wii.
6103154	6105755	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.
6106276	6107356	Pro Evolution Soccer 2010.
6107396	6107456	Saw.
6110398	6132230	Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper Sims 3 World Adventures Wii and Tony Hawk Ride I just want to mention that like next week or actually the week after next there's a game coming out on the Wii over here that's like all sorts of fail it's an exercise game called Your Shape it features Jenny McCarthy and guess what okay
6133206	6134986	They're super intelligent over Ubisoft.
6135006	6136187	They decided, hey, you know what?
6136267	6146029	Even though the Wii has this wonderful motion capture system with Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, we're going to use a webcam to capture your movement just like the eye toy.
6146369	6149289	I'm just worried about the shape it's going to tell me I am.
6149629	6151290	Congratulations, you are a pear.
6151810	6154190	Congratulations, you're shaped like Rosie O'Donnell.
6155051	6156211	No!
6159432	6160572	You are a leopard.
6161312	6161452	What?
6162972	6163893	Does he make A-sets?
6163933	6165314	Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
6167855	6168776	Let's keep moving on.
6168796	6172678	He realizes Part A is going on two hours tonight just for Part A. Good times.
6174319	6175420	Obviously, we've been gone a week.
6175500	6176801	And she's jumping and excited.
6177361	6179683	Fitness, that's fun and focused on you.
6179723	6183465	Jenny McCarthy's just excited to have a job this week.
6183505	6184786	Seriously, what has she done?
6186007	6189009	Besides, I think, a National Lampoon movie, maybe, here and there?
6190168	6192296	Alright, a few more stories and then do a break already.
6192517	6192999	Good lord.
6194484	6194745	Loki.
6196064	6196905	I have another story?
6196925	6197205	Yes.
6197966	6198406	Don't release dates.
6198426	6198746	It's your turn.
6198766	6202309	We're talking about Jenny McCarthy and how... The hell with her.
6203750	6208474	Anyways, Modern Warfare 2, of course, selling lots and lots and lots of copies.
6208934	6217581	Of course, in the UK, it sold 1.23 million units, the first day breaking first day sales records over there.
6217741	6219163	So that's pretty awesome.
6219183	6221264	I guess everybody loves Modern Warfare over there.
6223426	6224387	And of course, in the US...
6226571	6234179	4.7 million units in day one sales, making it probably the biggest game this year and the biggest game for quite a while.
6234459	6237462	So, um, yay!
6237482	6239023	I don't know.
6240782	6241002	Dan Storr
6256821	6259283	Hey look, it's gamers waiting for a game!
6259423	6261285	Oh my goodness, that pandemonium!
6261505	6266749	Well, because people need to be reminded for some reason that video games are a huge business.
6266889	6273574	And you know, this game probably made more money than most of the box office did this weekend.
6273594	6275616	Like, what was the big movie this weekend?
6275636	6276056	2012 or whatever?
6276737	6277918	And I don't think it...
6278698	6280999	I mean, even if it made $100 million, which I don't think it did.
6281219	6282899	That's half the movie's budget right there.
6283920	6287501	But that's probably still less than what Modern Warfare 2 made.
6288401	6291382	Granted, of course, the game is, what, $60 or it's a movie ticket.
6291722	6293562	Not to spoil anything about 2012.
6294142	6294663	Did you see it?
6294923	6296163	Yes, I went and saw it earlier today.
6296363	6297643	It looks ridiculous.
6297723	6298624	It is ridiculous.
6299604	6306826	After the fourth time, count it, fourth time that they took off on a runway and outrunning an earthquake.
6307250	6309731	That happened multiple times in this movie.
6310651	6311652	It was just like, really?
6312272	6312572	Really?
6312772	6314413	These movies are just getting ridiculous.
6314453	6314713	I'm sorry.
6314793	6318194	I realize there's an audience for these movies, and clearly it's Loki.
6318734	6323176	But, like, Independence Day, I watched.
6323216	6324516	I was all excited about it.
6324596	6325156	It was cool.
6325577	6328918	Day after tomorrow, I was kind of like, okay, really?
6328978	6331959	We're running away from, like, weather blasts and things like this?
6332039	6334340	Listen, you can outrun weather, okay?
6334500	6335020	It's a fact.
6335120	6335721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6352714	6353454	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6379029	6379830	is his job.
6379950	6381252	He's a failed author.
6381372	6381993	Like, really?
6395976	6397778	No, it's actually very funny.
6398258	6402423	Seriously, there's multiple times that they're flying the plane out of things.
6402703	6404525	They outran a volcano blast.
6404925	6407488	They outran building toppling.
6407788	6415296	How is the plane taking off from a landing strip and somehow sinking into the ground?
6415896	6419100	They were pulling up on the plane, yet going deep into the ground.
6420017	6420217	What?
6420777	6424959	It just... I'm sorry, there's a point where I'm like, this is just too much.
6425699	6427520	And this movie looks to be too much.
6427560	6429140	As I know, it was completely ridiculous.
6429300	6429881	And it was.
6431401	6433162	It lived up to its ridiculousness.
6433692	6439275	On the ridiculous scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not so ridiculous and 10 being completely fucking ridiculous, how ridiculous is 2012?
6439936	6446360	I would give this an 8.5 because a 10 I think would have to be Wild Zero because Wild Zero is so ridiculous.
6446400	6448961	They chopped a UFO in half with a samurai sword.
6449441	6450342	And it's a punk band.
6451102	6453764	Which, by the way, the samurai sword I think came out of his guitar.
6453884	6456706	That movie sounds awesome.
6456866	6457766	And there was zombie love.
6458066	6458947	And I've got your copy.
6460608	6462129	I forgot I even have that movie.
6463547	6463987	Amazing.
6464388	6467669	And any movie that has Guitar Wolf in it instantly rolls.
6467910	6475074	Okay, and Tiger Claw wants to clarify, 2012 has made $225 million worldwide and $65 million domestically.
6475114	6480697	And he sources ComingSoon.net as the source for the monetary figures.
6481678	6486060	But probably Modern Warfare 2 still makes more money in the week that it's out than this movie did.
6486100	6487181	I mean, it's just huge.
6487421	6488822	And honestly, though, it seriously...
6490245	6491246	It's a good movie to watch.
6491266	6492346	It's absolutely ridiculous.
6492386	6493307	But that's why you watch it.
6493587	6495288	It would make an awesome Riff Trax movie.
6495449	6497430	Oh my God, it's going to make an awesome Riff Trax movie.
6497450	6501933	Okay, back to Modern Warfare for a minute because I really, really don't care about 2012 anymore.
6502313	6506776	I do care, though, about that Facebook group about shut the fuck up, the world's not going to end in 2012.
6506816	6507737	That cracked me up.
6507837	6508477	I signed up for that.
6508817	6509118	I know.
6509998	6518584	I signed up last week for an undisclosed amount of people arbitrarily signing up for a cause or something like that.
6518604	6519164	I signed up for that.
6519184	6519745	That was funny.
6520625	6521345	There's an app for that.
6521946	6524126	Anyway, back to Modern Warfare 2.
6525166	6526667	Here's the thing I don't understand.
6526727	6538190	Loki, I need somebody to translate for me and for some reason I feel like you would understand this game better than I do because I'm not knocking the game, but keep in mind these type of war sims are not really my thing.
6538590	6543332	So what is it about this game that is making it sell zillions?
6544072	6546312	And yes, it is in fact selling zillions.
6547693	6547913	Well...
6548769	6549930	Thanks for watching!
6562981	6564362	Chatters, feel free to help me out, too.
6564422	6568125	Why is Modern Warfare 2 such a landmark game?
6568145	6569106	It's very gritty.
6569166	6573450	You're playing undercover.
6573650	6584298	In the beginning, I think you're undercover as part of a terrorist cell because you're infiltrating them from the inside, but you have to murder people and stuff like that, innocent people in an airport and whatnot, seeing they've got controversy or whatever.
6584318	6589323	So is it kind of trying to ride on that whole America, fuck yeah wave?
6589343	6589883	Mm-hmm.
6590323	6598025	Well, it's America and a bunch of other countries are getting all fucked over because there's one part where you're like, you know, storming the White House because terrorists have taken it over.
6598585	6603866	So, I mean, it's kind of, yeah, you know, fighting terrorism is cool.
6603926	6605106	And the online's really sweet.
6605226	6611928	I think of like a, guys, I don't know, like a Halo 3 or something like that because Halo 3 had a really short campaign and the online was awesome.
6612148	6613468	It's kind of the same with Modern Warfare 2.
6613508	6616109	The campaign's pretty cool, short, but it's awesome.
6616730	6621712	Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says even PC boycotters are playing Modern Warfare 2.
6621772	6625633	I did see that screenshot of like all the people in the boycott group on Steam were playing the game.
6626574	6632636	My god, if I could sum up like arguing on the internet in a picture, like you know how they say a picture is worth a thousand words?
6632656	6636578	Like if I had to explain debate on the internet, like that picture does it right there.
6636698	6639979	That is trying to debate someone on the internet summed up into a picture.
6643777	6646118	Do the same thing when Left 4 Dead 2 comes out this week.
6646658	6648879	Go snap a picture of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.
6648919	6650520	I bet there's shitloads of people playing it.
6651061	6651981	Yeah, because you know what?
6652561	6653402	Because they're sheep.
6653542	6656143	Because they're like, ah, but I want to play it.
6656223	6656743	Okay, I will.
6658604	6663027	And they'll justify it saying, oh, well, they took care of what I needed them to take care of.
6663607	6664007	Or whatever.
6665428	6665828	Let's see.
6666348	6669370	Quiltipo in chat says it's a manly macho game that makes people feel tough.
6671840	6676125	It's a modern version of when we used to go outside and play like Army Man or whatever.
6677006	6677507	Make-believe.
6678127	6680310	Now it's just all... Pleased to bury the G.I.
6680330	6681291	Joes in a mass graveyard.
6682685	6683065	Interesting.
6684706	6685987	Again, I'm not knocking the game.
6686548	6692131	I guess for what it is, it's a landmark game and certainly the graphics I've seen look very realistic and everything.
6692171	6697415	I realize just not every game I'm going to get and that's just the way it is.
6697455	6700337	Just like there's a lot of people that probably sit here and go, really?
6700637	6702118	Why do they play so many music games?
6702158	6704179	They talk all the time about music games and I think they're stupid.
6704820	6706321	Everybody's just into whatever they're into.
6706381	6712445	I just was kind of curious why this game above the countless other war games that are released.
6713885	6720367	Anyhow, got one more news story for you guys, and we're going to get into the classic video game of the week, and this actually has to do with the Zune.
6720667	6725088	You know, we talk a lot about iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, you know, and all the gaming that's going on there.
6725128	6729749	Well, certainly Microsoft wants a piece of that, too, with their own handheld device, the Zune.
6730129	6736491	And while the Zune doesn't make phone calls, the Zune does play movies, listen to music, and now it will do games, too.
6737091	6737211	Um...
6738243	6739924	There's a new firmware update that happened.
6739944	6743886	It was 4.3, and apparently there are now six free games on the Zoom Marketplace.
6743906	6744627	That's right, free.
6745047	6753772	Project Gotham Racing Ferrari Edition, Lucky Lane Bowling, Vans Skate Pool Service, Piano, Checkers, you know, classic game in there too.
6754712	6763476	and a game called Audio Surf Tilt which is a port of sorts of the popular game Audio Surf that was available on the PC where you can use your own MP3s.
6763516	6764256	I've actually played that game.
6764276	6764937	It's quite a bit of fun.
6765237	6768738	If you like music games, speaking of which, Audio Surf is a nice little investment.
6768758	6769619	That's kind of a fun game.
6770339	6771920	So now you can play that on the Zune as well.
6774423	6778384	So, you know, Zune's kind of trying to step it up there a little bit as a portable device.
6778705	6786307	And, of course, I'm sorry, not just a portable device, but, you know, kind of up there with the iPhone with its all-in-one kind of device there.
6786707	6793550	And for those that were asking, you know, when is Microsoft going to get into handheld gaming, I guess this is what we've got, at least so far.
6794230	6796251	So, I don't know, any interest in these games?
6797758	6804241	I'm curious what Project Gotham looks like and the audio surf I'm certainly interested in, especially if it plays off your MP3s from the Zune.
6804281	6805201	I think that's pretty cool.
6806501	6809983	But at the same time, I wouldn't drop several hundred dollars on the Zune just to check it out.
6810043	6815005	I'm just wondering when the hell they're going to actually release the X and A stuff on the Zune.
6815045	6815745	When's that happening?
6815785	6817526	Yeah, I heard something like that was supposed to happen, huh?
6819326	6820367	They talked about it a while ago.
6822157	6825138	DarkSakura, what video game did you pick for the kiddies tonight?
6825158	6825539	River City Ransom!
6825559	6825739	Woohoo!
6851262	6852368	By the way, the vault's cold.
6854468	6856870	Were you very cold going into the vault to pick out the game?
6858511	6864835	Actually, even though I love the NES version, I'm picking a specific one, and that's the example that have given us for our YouTube.
6866176	6873120	It's Downtown Neketsu Monogatari, which is Downtown Hot-Blooded Story.
6874381	6876223	In the PAL region, it came out as Street Games.
6878304	6879725	And it's one of the Kunio games.
6879805	6881986	And you can hear the music is a little different here.
6882307	6883467	In fact, let me play a little clip here.
6884949	6894681	I'll have to find this on my main cabinet You can play PC Engine games on your main?
6895148	6895988	Yeah, I can play anything I want.
6896008	6897129	Oh, you've got the emulator set up.
6897509	6905813	But yeah, this is... There are also versions for the X68000, the Game Boy Advance.
6907154	6908495	It came out on Virtual Console.
6908655	6923623	But basically, since it's one of the Kunio games, you know, and with Neketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, which was Renegade, and Neketsu Koko Dodgeball-bu, which was Super Dodgeball, which I have covered...
6924503	6927766	Yeah, I think that was a previous game you did because I love Super Dodgeball.
6928366	6931829	But basically you were playing high school kids in the Japanese version.
6931849	6939055	They're Kunio, Enriki, and over here it's Alex and Ryan as they go to try to rescue the girl.
6940396	6946741	And by going against different, I guess, you know, delinquent gangs or whatever.
6946981	6953947	And so it's just a little street brawler, you know, walk down the street, punch some people, and then you stop in for, you know, a burger.
6954414	6955015	and a free smile.
6955435	6956095	And a free smile.
6956536	6963381	So, you also of course have passwords so you can start off in different parts of the game.
6964342	6967425	But I did pick this one in particular.
6967605	6971568	Oh yeah, actually I needed to mention some differences between the Japanese version.
6973550	6977773	They actually changed the school uniforms into t-shirts and jeans.
6977953	6979094	You know, that type of stuff.
6981276	6982397	Also, now you just noticed...
6983427	6983587	Hello!
6983607	6985508	Would you like to make a request?
6985648	6987528	I can do whatever I want.
7013067	7014348	This game was also famous for having a butt.
7036690	7037271	I remember that.
7037411	7037971	You remember that?
7038371	7039312	In the sauna sequence?
7039772	7040533	You saw a butt.
7041614	7044896	Well, it was probably just a public bath or, you know, whatever.
7045997	7047659	But yeah.
7047979	7049520	This was the other bit.
7049540	7050041	More voice acting.
7050701	7053743	So for a little, you know, TurboGrafx-16 style cartridge.
7053783	7053884	No.
7053904	7053964	No?
7062410	7065832	This was PCCD, PC Engine CD.
7065872	7071675	But still, that wasn't the most technologically advanced, I mean at the time it was, but it's pretty impressive.
7072156	7076718	You had Redbook Audio with this, you had voice acting because it had a higher storage capacity.
7077319	7086624	Well, I mean, you heard the vocal intro for Dracula X on PC Engine, so it could definitely do it.
7086644	7088605	Just pre-record it and have it go up.
7089045	7094810	It's just interesting because I never really knew this version was here, even though I loved River City Ransom as a kid, and I see everybody in chat, BARF!
7095050	7103958	Everybody remembers some of the great dialogue that we got over here, which I'm sure was just great localization, but it came out very funny.
7104258	7106039	Kind of like the original English, if you will.
7107501	7110223	Because I highly doubt that's what they were saying in the Japanese thing, was BARF.
7111812	7123257	Well, also, the company that localized it was American Technos, which was a subsidiary of Technos Japan.
7124818	7127519	They actually brought out another Kunio game that came out over here.
7127719	7135282	It's Crashin' the Boys Street Challenge, although it's more of the same type, but not really super, super linked.
7136082	7137863	And, yeah, in Japan, that one was...
7140104	7149010	and Bikkuri Neketsu Shin Kiroku Harukanaru Kin Medal, which was Astonishing Hot-Blooded New Records Distant Gold Medals.
7149730	7151711	So, but yeah.
7153272	7155774	I love how they like to butcher names and everything when they come out.
7156274	7160137	But yeah, it did come back out on Virtual Console, so those with Wii, go get it!
7160817	7163919	However, I will just say this to this date.
7164699	7168742	The Super CD version is my favorite.
7170563	7178333	Alright, so your classic video game of the week, River City Ransom, or in this case, Downtown at Neketsu, Monogatari.
7178973	7179334	There it is.
7179975	7181497	Your classic game of the week from the archives.
7182122	7211663	and you know what a recently released game reminds me I would actually even consider it a spiritual successor because Dan and I were talking about it which is how I was thinking of doing this one is the oh crap now I just forgot the name where you play as a delinquent boy beating up other people badass bully badass rumble or something can't go bonch badass rumble that's it
7213115	7213776	Kenko Bancho.
7213796	7214696	Kenko Bancho.
7214736	7215097	That's it.
7215457	7215657	Hmm.
7216878	7217238	All right.
7217979	7219760	Well... Because that's how Dan we had to get that game.
7219780	7221962	And Dan's like, I want it just because it has badass in the name.
7222602	7223262	Just because of the name.
7223903	7224143	All right.
7224163	7225884	Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our show.
7225904	7226605	But we're not done yet.
7226625	7231348	We're going to come back for plenty more, which is pretty amazing because part A tonight was two hours.
7231729	7233490	That's one of our longest part A's in a while.
7233510	7234070	But that's okay.
7234371	7239074	We've obviously had a lot to talk about between the swine flu and gaming and all that food and all that other fun stuff.
7239094	7239935	But we are going to take a quick break.
7239955	7240555	We're going to talk about
7240635	7242176	We will be right back with more of
7267955	7282898	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 15th of 2009, where we are taping the 344th episode of our podcast, as we do every Sunday night live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
7283715	7284335	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG
7310890	7313351	and just kind of your typical little power ballad from Final Fantasy.
7313371	7314112	I kind of tuned it out.
7314192	7315252	Yeah, I kind of tuned it out a little bit.
7315532	7321416	You know, you just kind of have to imagine, you know, that's going to be the big romance scene with lightning and snow and what do they get?
7321456	7323778	Partially cloudy and whatever these guys' names are in the game.
7324058	7328381	No, it's going to be snow and that red-headed chick and one of them like flying through the... What's her name?
7328441	7328921	Thundersnow?
7329818	7331740	No, it's on Thunderstone.
7331760	7333161	30% chance of precipitation, is that her name?
7334042	7334682	No.
7334962	7342208	It's funnier, though, if you imagine it being that tough-looking army dude that raises all the chocobos, and he's singing it to a chocobo.
7342308	7343349	That is funny.
7343790	7344770	That is pretty damn funny.
7344790	7345211	There you go.
7345231	7346552	See, doesn't that make that song a lot funnier?
7346572	7350335	It'll be Snow getting it on with his motorcycle, which turns into the Twin Shivas, and yeah.
7351434	7351674	All right.
7352055	7352815	Anyhow, there you go.
7352895	7353416	Love it or hate it.
7353456	7356218	It's the ballad from Final Fantasy XIII.
7356678	7358980	And those of you that weren't listening live tonight, that's okay.
7359901	7364144	I'm sure that – I think her album comes out on Tuesday, so if you really want to hear it, you can check it out on iTunes.
7364685	7367607	Anyhow, we're going to get back into the show tonight.
7367927	7372511	Let's go ahead and go into rapid-fire news first because I failed to load the Twitter topics during the break.
7372551	7372791	Fail.
7373111	7373412	I know.
7373452	7374773	Well, we only had a short break tonight.
7374993	7378416	So while I get that up, we'll go ahead and do rapid-fire news, and then we will do Twitter topics.
7378976	7379256	Force Armor
7401158	7404162	Could very well be horse armor or a campaign to get horse armor.
7404202	7405063	Or it could be horse shit.
7405223	7405864	Or how about this?
7405924	7407966	There are no horses in Final Fantasy.
7408627	7409128	Oh my god.
7409148	7410009	Sorry.
7410229	7411290	Chocobo armor.
7411310	7413173	That'd be cool.
7413834	7414694	I don't like tactics games.
7414734	7415055	What? !
7438001	7439925	Oh my god, do I really do this show with you guys?
7440065	7441248	I really don't like tactics games.
7441268	7444975	I recognize it as an amazing game.
7445657	7448563	I personally do not dig the tactics games.
7451155	7456456	Command & Conquer 4 has been announced to be coming out next year on March 16th.
7456616	7462858	They call it Tiberian Twilight, and I hate that subtitle because it reminds me of that crappy vampire movie series and book series.
7463678	7464698	Crappy series in general.
7465419	7470560	Did you know that Burger King near us is staying open 24 hours for two days because of the stupid Twilight movies?
7470940	7471840	That's sad.
7472300	7475441	Why would Burger King... I mean, I realize they have the whole Twilight promotion.
7475521	7477101	Yeah, they have a big old Twilight promotion going.
7477361	7478402	It's on the crowns.
7478462	7479362	That's blasphemy.
7479382	7479462	Woo!
7482984	7485405	I was so bored this week, Loki, when I was sick.
7486166	7489468	I was watching the Rachel Ray show.
7489548	7491028	That right there should tell you something.
7491569	7496632	She was giving makeovers to Twilight fans to make them look like Twilight characters.
7497712	7500234	And I'm just sitting there going, Isn't she supposed to cook?
7500754	7502055	I would rather be at work.
7503015	7504436	So she took them the hot topic.
7506104	7507205	I thought she was supposed to cook
7527813	7538444	in the form of a pack from AFI including songs Beautiful Thieves, End Transmission, Love Like Winter, Medicaid, and the Leaving Song Part 2.
7540026	7541207	I like Love Like Winter.
7541227	7541888	That's a good song.
7542575	7554199	and that'll be available as a pack for 680 Microsoft Points or $8.50 in real money and of course available individually for $2 each or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii Points.
7554479	7555499	You can kind of figure that out.
7556039	7560521	And finally, the individual song for this week though is The Bangles, Walk Like an Egyptian.
7561101	7561801	Awesome!
7561841	7561961	For $2.
7563702	7567963	And for the PSP, Dead Kennedy's California Uber Allies.
7568364	7568764	Nice.
7569044	7569104	Or...
7569924	7570504	Uber Alls.
7570924	7571944	They spelled allies wrong.
7572064	7572485	Stupid.
7573805	7576885	Sleater Kinney with You're No Rock and Roll Fun.
7577566	7578126	And that's also $2.
7578346	7583327	Dude, Walk Like an Egyptian I think would actually be kind of a hard song to play.
7583827	7585827	I seem to remember it had a very fast guitar and drum part.
7585847	7587048	It's a song that people recognize.
7587488	7589288	People like songs that people can recognize.
7589548	7590028	Exactly.
7590328	7593169	But now I'm trying to think about what the game Walk Band would look like.
7595420	7603551	All I can picture are just these horrible, horrific stereotypes that really shouldn't be repeated, but that's just what pops into my mind.
7603611	7607616	I can't help it, but I'm sure it would be a hideously racist game.
7607636	7610500	50 different renditions of I'm Turning Japanese.
7610720	7611361	Alright, anyhow.
7611962	7614084	Moving on to another rapid fire news tonight.
7614425	7618670	The wireless N network adapter has made its way out to America.
7619050	7622735	If you want to pay $100 for it, the wireless N networking adapter is out.
7622795	7626620	It's dual band, 5 gigahertz, 2 point, you know what, it's
7627020	7629643	I'm not going to read all the technical specs because I'm just not that nerdy.
7630104	7630644	Just trust me.
7630904	7631285	It's out.
7631485	7635289	And if you like your wireless fast, very fast, then this will get it fast.
7635309	7638733	But do remember you need an end router or this will do no good.
7638753	7640355	It'll just be no faster.
7640775	7642017	Yeah, well, it'll be no faster.
7642057	7645320	It'll just revert to B or G or whatever it is you have in your house.
7646121	7653606	Anyhow, also, Madden NFL Arcade coming out November 24th and 25th, depending on what platform you're on.
7654326	7661211	It will come out for $15 on the PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on their respective service.
7662312	7664213	This is Madden NFL Arcade.
7664553	7673999	I'm assuming, I don't know a whole lot more about this game, but I'm assuming this just plays a little more like, not so probably intense with your play picks and so forth.
7674059	7675140	It's probably just more of a...
7675831	7678352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7699284	7699644	I don't know.
7700665	7710929	It's just another excuse to get you to spend money on this because, hey, they tried it with NBA and with, you know, NHL, so why not try it with Madden, their number one selling sports franchise?
7711129	7711529	Why not?
7712189	7717251	I mean, $15 is not exactly, you know, it's on the higher end of the arcade games.
7718072	7721133	I have to read this comment from chat before I get to the last story I have here.
7721253	7728556	SJ100Matt says, Walk Band sounds like a parody from South Park, like playing Rampart to keep the Mongolians from ripping down my shitty wall.
7732064	7759993	lastly for me for rapid fire news tonight Criterion's developed Need for Speed game is making its way out next year that is official I guess from Criterion Games website I don't know if that is the Need for Speed online game but it's another game coming out there from Criterion is next year so if you like your you know explosive car wrecks there you go
7761550	7767373	Well, Star Trek Online, how's this for Gearswitch, will be out on February 2nd, 2010.
7768654	7772756	Or, if you want to go by the star date, 63554.5.
7774517	7778979	But yeah, I am totally, totally, totally very happy with that because I will be playing the hell out of it.
7779659	7791305	And also, they were saying that the events that happened in the movie affect the game.
7792426	7794106	Even though the movie's a parallel universe thing.
7794126	7794306	Yes.
7794807	7795347	Strange.
7795707	7797247	Maybe this is a reboot universe game.
7797907	7798307	Interesting.
7798507	7799788	That would be very, very interesting.
7801548	7803929	Honestly, my gut reaction to hearing this was, already?
7804529	7809430	I seriously thought it was not going to be until next Christmas, and now I'm sitting here going, holy crap, it's going to be out in February?
7809710	7810310	February 2nd?
7810910	7811370	Oh my god.
7813011	7813491	Bye, WoW.
7814051	7814271	Yeah.
7815703	7822925	Well, also, new Beatles Right Band download content on November 17th with Sgt.
7822945	7824285	Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
7825926	7828006	So, that'll be pretty cool.
7828286	7830007	November 17th, not too far to go.
7833588	7838049	Also, that's actually going to be for Xbox 360 and Wii.
7840450	7846796	And then for the iPhone, there is a Commodore 64 emulator back on the iPhone store.
7849619	7859408	So... Because I guess they patched out... I remember it was there before, and you could somehow trick it into running BASIC, but then that means you could write your own code on the iPhone.
7859448	7860249	That's a big no-no.
7860868	7864849	Well, right, because it was rejected because of the basic interpreter.
7866129	7871050	But now they have removed it, and then other people figured out how to get back into it.
7871730	7876831	And so apparently now it's just on with even further revised code.
7877291	7885393	And also has a boost in performance and three new games, international basketball, international baseball, and international tennis.
7886213	7892237	Also included are Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Arctic Shipwreck, Jack Attack, and Jupiter Lander.
7893377	7895238	I actually played Le Mans when I was a kid.
7895298	7896079	I remember that game.
7896599	7898580	So those aren't totally obscure games.
7898620	7902182	Some of those are pretty well-known Commodore 64 games.
7902583	7905524	Alright, before we get back into more news, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.
7906805	7911408	We always ask before the show for you to send us your topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
7911428	7913169	And if you're not following us on Twitter, why not?
7914195	7914675	Follow us.
7915636	7916696	Enjoy our twit spam.
7916916	7922098	Twitter.com slash OLR is our username of the Orange Lounge Radio.
7922538	7929000	Sterlok tweeted us tonight wanting to know, I'm curious what your guys' opinion is on the visually impaired gamer suing Sony.
7929440	7932642	As a blind gamer myself, I find it to be a bad move.
7933022	7937063	And I had no idea what Sterlok was talking about, but I found it interesting, so I tweeted back.
7937123	7937884	I said, give me a link.
7938504	7939984	And Sterlok gave me a link.
7940004	7941905	Yeah, I heard about that.
7942510	7945665	I hadn't heard about this, but keep in mind I was a little bit out of it for a week.
7946098	7952421	So here's the story has to do with a visually impaired gamer who has basically sued Sony.
7953001	7971609	And a lot of this has to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that, quote, no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any persons who owns leases or leases to or operates a place of public accommodation.
7971669	7973830	So in other words, you know, you can't
7974290	7974770	and many more.
8001420	8013851	I don't know why though, but I guess this thing actually gets into massively multiplayer online titles requesting the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations for gamers with disability impaired visual processing.
8015352	8018995	So it's kind of interesting to hear this lawsuit comes to light.
8019355	8025440	I would have liked to hear more about, and I think Sturlock's in chat, I'd kind of like to hear more about his feelings against the story.
8025460	8027762	Because I think that's kind of interesting.
8029264	8029324	Um...
8030598	8032038	You know, it's tough.
8032998	8039220	I can imagine it's very tough to have a disability such as blindness or deafness.
8039240	8043780	And this isn't the first time we've had a listener who has a major disability who's kind of talking about games.
8044141	8057023	And I think a lot of these things that we take for granted sometimes, like for instance, have we ever sat here and said, oh man, the graphics in the game were awesome and just everything looks so real and the water effects were so cool.
8057443	8083739	and we have to sometimes realize like not everybody like sees that you know I know what they do in the movie world is that they actually will release movies in the theaters particular showings throughout the day or a special you know theater time or whatever where they actually have or a device that actually describes the scenes to folks while they're watching the movie you know because if you can't see what's going on it might actually say you know
8084179	8088120	Tom Cruise's character is walking into a bar or something, you know, like that type of thing.
8088160	8090901	It'll actually kind of describe the scenes for you, which, you know, makes sense.
8091461	8099584	Just like we have closed captioning for deaf folks, you know, who can't, you know, will see that and it'll be little musical notes of someone singing or what have you.
8099924	8101464	You know, there's other little ways they accommodate.
8101804	8104245	Video games don't really have a lot of that.
8105689	8108190	Does the ADA really apply here though?
8109090	8110030	I'm not so sure.
8110130	8112371	I think it might be a little bit of extreme to say that.
8112971	8126774	I think certainly though there is a statement being said here though that a game company that could cater to this could certainly bring in an audience that a lot of folks seem to be neglecting.
8128315	8128995	Does that make sense?
8129663	8138170	Well, yeah, it's just, there's certain things that I think people need to have a reasonable expectation about.
8139491	8141673	That, this is for an MMO, right?
8142814	8144956	Well, I think in part, but this is about games in general.
8144976	8146277	I mean, imagine if you were blind.
8146397	8152482	There are some, yeah, that it has to do with the type of game, with...
8154404	8172038	For example, if it's something that as a game requires a number of visual clues, if I personally, this is just me, for example, when my hand was hurting, I could not physically play any game except for singing in Rock Band.
8172901	8175782	And I don't like to sing, but I sing in rock bands so I can play.
8176462	8180323	I know that's a weak excuse, but I'm just using it as a personal example.
8180963	8193765	I think that if it's a game that, yes, modifications can be made to it so that someone can participate, there needs to be a release or a server or some way that you can enable somebody to do that.
8193785	8200727	But if it is something that requires visual clues so strongly that there is no possible way...
8201807	8207468	to simulate the same feel of the game through any other course of action.
8207548	8209668	If you could do it with sound, that would be great.
8210168	8214989	Especially if you could have a big speaker set up over your monitor that you could use directional sound like that.
8215349	8215949	That's one thing.
8216870	8222070	But you're talking about this has to do with the bottom line.
8222771	8230492	The company's main concern is going to be is your business going to be worth the money that we're going to spend to keep your business?
8231805	8237838	And I don't really think that the ADA is going to apply to that.
8238238	8240804	Because, I mean, for example, say that...
8243775	8248077	I say that I damaged my larynx and I really wanted to sing in rock band.
8248117	8250819	There's no possible way they can make me able to sing.
8251359	8251799	I'm sorry.
8252100	8253600	They can't do it.
8253640	8256422	Maybe I can play a keyboard or something with it.
8256502	8257242	That's reasonable.
8257322	8258583	But do you see what my point is?
8259344	8263446	There are just some things that you cannot compensate for.
8263993	8271318	I think the bottom line, though, and I think the point that Sherlock was trying to make with the story is that a lawsuit's not really the way to go about making your point.
8271398	8272919	And I think that's what he disagrees with.
8273620	8277102	And I, to some extent, say, yeah, a lawsuit's a little silly.
8277122	8279003	We have enough frivolous lawsuits in this country.
8279363	8284447	I think the key is reward the companies that address your needs.
8284767	8313680	exactly you know if there's MMOs out there that give those better audio clues to the things that you know sometimes we take for granted as visual you know descriptions or you know giving you more directional type of you know sound or clues or whatever it may be reward those companies for their efforts or even a special video mode because I know that in some cases certain colors will register in different types of blindness that others won't have like you know a special color filter because you can easily do that
8313800	8314641	Changing Flashes in DDR for Epilepsy
8339133	8339573	Interesting.
8339813	8345695	So there's lots of very interesting little subtle changes that they try to do in games to make them more accessible.
8345755	8348195	And I think we reward companies that do that.
8348275	8358858	Well, also, and I hate to say that this stinks of that situation where there's one lawyer, wheelchair-bound, who was going around to... Actually, not even going to some of these places.
8359338	8361859	Picking places like Julian, California.
8362139	8362639	They did it there.
8363679	8367140	Forcing businesses to either go out of business or spend all this money...
8367760	8371941	to make places accessible when the places were accessible anyway.
8372962	8375403	Going back and suing places that he had never been to.
8376023	8382225	Some people actually seek... This is a problem that I have with the American Disabilities Act is that...
8383507	8385708	and there's a lot of good that came from it.
8385748	8386308	Don't get me wrong.
8386368	8394671	I think there is a lot of good that came from it and I think that if a company wants the business, they do need to cater to everybody.
8394711	8397092	They need to be courteous.
8397872	8401153	I don't think there should be a law to force people to be courteous, but they should be courteous.
8401213	8403574	They should be mindful of their clientele.
8404335	8407816	At the same time, I think that it opened up a lot of doors for abuse.
8409068	8410649	A lot of doors for abuse.
8411550	8418374	And again, I'm actually out of work right now under the American Disabilities Act because I physically could not use my hand.
8418795	8419615	I was grateful for it.
8419655	8421076	It gave me the recovery time I needed.
8421697	8426460	But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to go to work and say, you're forcing me to do my job, I'm suing.
8428582	8428902	You know?
8430283	8431083	It's the same thing.
8431504	8434606	I think that it's actually trying to...
8436926	8437767	www.DarkSakura.com
8458516	8460397	So something developers have to be mindful for.
8460618	8461278	Go play another game.
8462419	8463660	Seriously, just play another game.
8463680	8464280	The one suing?
8464420	8464600	Yeah.
8465281	8465841	Play another game.
8466962	8470364	If they're going to be bitches, why do you want them to have your money?
8470404	8471325	Do something else.
8471625	8472746	Let's move on with some more tweets.
8473086	8476589	Fernando on the Twitter says, Philharmonic band, yes or no?
8478110	8479671	That's kind of a broad question.
8479691	8481072	Didn't we get Wii Music?
8481192	8484554	If you're going to join a Philharmonic band, I was a band geek.
8484594	8485755	Dark Sakura was a band geek.
8485795	8486696	Loki, were you a band geek?
8486856	8486996	Nope.
8487691	8489614	Well, two out of three say join the band.
8489775	8490496	It's a good experience.
8491137	8491538	But I don't know.
8491998	8494122	It could be talking about a CD coming out or something.
8494142	8494423	I don't know.
8494443	8495184	It's kind of broad.
8496789	8503191	Ray Iannami says, OLR, Modern Warfare 2 gets a 9.5 from IGN and a 1.5 reader average.
8503531	8507332	And I actually tweeted back because I was kind of like, okay, well, the sales figures don't say 1.5.
8507472	8511574	So I said, oh, is this people spamming it with negative reviews?
8511594	8513534	Because they're doing the Amazon thing.
8513834	8516655	They're spamming it with negative reviews because they're pissed about the server lockout.
8517075	8522437	And Ray Iannami says, yes, people who bought the PC version claim it's like playing a console FPS on a PC.
8523297	8536822	Well, don't buy it, and don't let us catch you on Steam playing the game and get screenshots of it, because that says way more than a silly 1.5 average on some site I don't even read anyway ever will.
8538567	8539668	I don't know what else to say about that.
8540028	8544992	Red Entertainment says, of these three major releases recently, which is the best?
8545552	8548894	Uncharted 2, The Ballad of Gay Tony, or Modern Warfare 2?
8549595	8552457	See, I haven't played any of those games.
8552517	8554358	Yeah, it just depends on the person you ask.
8555019	8558401	Certainly those are all games that are going to be up there when we talk about Game of the Year.
8558501	8561963	Maybe not so much Gay Tony because it's an expansion of last year's game, but...
8563044	8571237	If you're talking about which one do I have the most hype for, I really want to check out Uncharted 2 because that just seems like the game I would enjoy most out of the three.
8571798	8573161	But that's just me.
8573181	8574903	I think they're just different games.
8575324	8576906	It really depends on the type of gamer it is.
8579875	8584877	BlueSwim tweets, what do you think of Crush 40 of Sonic Adventure fame coming to the Rock Band Network?
8585037	8591339	I hadn't heard, but I guess it was inevitable that some of these video game related bands are going to come out through the Rock Band Network.
8591359	8591959	That's pretty cool.
8592459	8595140	Also, any thoughts on Steven Tyler leaving Aerosmith?
8596180	8597401	He's not going to leave Aerosmith.
8598182	8599342	It's all for show.
8599663	8602184	They're fighting like any family does after a while.
8602204	8603845	He had a diva tantrum.
8604005	8605086	Exactly.
8605126	8606147	He had a diva tantrum.
8606167	8606927	They'll work it out.
8607428	8609349	They'll probably be on break for a little while, but they'll bring it out.
8611190	8612031	They were on a break.
8612876	8613737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8629657	8633019	So yeah, this is the season for Child's Play, obviously the holiday season.
8633079	8635561	So definitely check out some of the stuff they're doing.
8635881	8641365	I'm just looking at this Desert Bus tweet, which is Desert Bus, D-E-S-E-R-T Bus on Twitter.
8641685	8643647	It is the Desert Bus for Hope Charity.
8643927	8650532	I wonder if this is the same thing that they did from last year where they actually sat and played that Desert Bus game.
8651372	8652053	on the feed.
8652793	8653354	I guess they are.
8653434	8654195	DesertBus.org.
8654215	8659099	You can actually go and look at the feed and watch them play this incredibly boring freaking game.
8659119	8660120	But it's all for a good cause.
8661141	8663103	Why don't you play a better game for a good cause?
8663923	8664764	That's my thing.
8664804	8667907	I mean, it's like, seriously, if you're going to do it anyway, just play a better game.
8667947	8672311	Well, I think it goes back to that whole thing, like, people like to pay to watch other people be tortured.
8672331	8675554	Well, then they should play, what was it, that, uh... The, uh...
8677079	8678860	Thank you for watching!
8694758	8716075	TigerClaw sends us one that says Modern Warfare 2 is banned in Russia and actually sent us a link here to a website that talks about console versions of Modern Warfare 2 have been banned in Russia and it's due to the content of the No Russian mission and that's the controversial airport massacre level and I guess the Russian government didn't like that.
8717356	8721159	Raised the ire of the Russian gaming public as well as some politicians.
8722142	8723183	In Soviet Russia, gameplay you.
8751554	8753876	All right, let's move on with some more stories here.
8754837	8757099	Loki, start us off with a story about Gran Turismo.
8757339	8767908	Yes, Gran Turismo, the game that will just never come out, and now it's just taking even longer because they're saying that it's being held up for marketing reasons, which is retarded.
8768349	8769770	Just say development, okay?
8770190	8775335	Not marketing, because then that just says, oh, yeah, we could release it, but we're going to be assholes.
8775875	8776676	So Gran Turismo 5...
8777717	8781000	We will release Gran Turismo 5 March in Japan, but for other regions it has not been decided yet.
8804947	8810455	and this is asked by Motoring Magazine what the holdup was in the western release of the game.
8811016	8816684	That's more depending on Sony Computer Entertainment America's marketing decisions.
8819908	8820208	What is...
8820888	8824609	The problem with just releasing a game and then marketing it.
8824970	8827150	Why does it have to be marketed right out the gate?
8827211	8830012	Are day one numbers that critical to a game's success?
8830072	8834914	Yeah, but also you have to figure that I'm not positive if it falls with them.
8835314	8840856	But at the same time, they're going to be having God of War 3 coming out, at least in the U.S.
8841636	8843097	That's supposed to be sometime in March.
8843557	8845498	So perhaps they're going to try to...
8846939	8853564	Sandbag the next year numbers by releasing it in the first quarter of their financial 2010 year.
8854164	8857527	Or 2011, I don't know how they really count it.
8857767	8862590	Usually a lot of the game companies, their financial year starts either in April or at the end of March.
8862871	8868935	That's why you'll see the first big push for games sandbagged into March.
8871397	8871597	All right.
8887367	8891090	Well, moving on to the games that are a lot closer to its release.
8891771	8896895	1 vs. 100, of course, had its early first season happen and then the games kind of disappeared for a little while.
8896936	8897496	But guess what?
8897916	8901880	Season 2 is starting November 19th at 5 o'clock Pacific.
8902621	8906444	1 vs. 100 extended play begins then to get you all warmed up for Season 2.
8907705	8914051	More than a half a million people competed in the 15-week beta season and they're trying to get even more people to show up for Round 2.
8914831	8921394	Extended Play, I guess, is now going to have themed trivia every weeknight, although I assume they'll still have kind of some general trivia, too.
8922074	8931719	And then, of course, the more Extended Play you play, apparently you have a better chance of being picked as one of the mob or even the one themselves, and you get to compete for actual prizes!
8931859	8932519	Woo!
8932959	8936501	Two million Microsoft points, apparently, were given away during the first season.
8936941	8938622	No, you get Microsoft Space Bucks.
8938982	8941663	It's not really cash, but in Microsoft's world, it's cash.
8941883	8943464	Oh, it's not like Smash TV.
8944244	8945785	So, there you go.
8945865	8947406	More money, more prizes.
8947546	8947967	I love it.
8947987	8948527	You know what?
8948987	8958554	As much as we're kind of making fun of it now, this actually is, of sorts, kind of like a groundbreaking game and I think is one of the huge things that Xbox 360 has going for it right now that no other system has.
8959234	8961676	My only wish is that they would do more games.
8962156	8964217	Like, why another season of 1 vs. 100?
8964518	8969021	How about some, like, Price is Right or Press Your Luck or, I don't know, you know, I understand 1 vs. 1.
8969061	8970402	Price is Right would be so awesome.
8970422	8971622	It would be amazing.
8972023	8973424	Amazeballs, as they say.
8975913	8977534	But I'll take 1 vs. 100 Season 2.
8977634	8979014	Everybody loves a good trivia game.
8979114	8979854	It'll be a lot of fun.
8981235	8983916	DarkSakura, any plans to join in on 1 vs. 100 Season 2?
8984396	8984596	Nope.
8985196	8985956	Well, fine.
8986636	8987517	I'll play by myself.
8987857	8988737	I have other stuff to play.
8989817	8990197	Like what?
8990498	8993839	Like a game that's coming out on the 8th of December over here in the U.S.
8995639	8995899	Yes.
8996939	8998320	Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
8998814	8999915	WeMake Flashlight
9017638	9044686	and um well there's no combat in it but the um the cool thing though that Climax is keeping is um all the stuff that Akira Yamaoka did for the music so that's going to be really happy um I'm just really really looking forward to it I think it's going to be fantastic and it better scare the crap out of me just saying it was one of the more fun demos I played at uh um E3 so I'm excited about it
9045154	9045674	DarkSakura.com
9075373	9080156	But see, seriously though, boy in his blob, no advertising, 9,200 units.
9080216	9082117	I mean, we could easily do that with President Cat.
9082197	9089261	This is why, again, I heard those stories about President Cat only selling 100 copies, and I know I went off on the last show we had.
9090702	9091582	I just don't believe it.
9091702	9092202	I'm sorry.
9092322	9098886	Like, if a game like Boy in His Blob sells 9,200 in this country, I can't believe President Cat only sold 100 units.
9098946	9101608	And by the way, there was an awesome article on Kotaku.
9102028	9104129	I don't want to talk about President Cat every week on the show, but
9104824	9133893	Kotaku did an awesome piece that kind of called out those sites that were showing like the pictures with nobody in them where you could clearly see there were barricades so the booth just wasn't open yet fucking called those sites out by showing another picture later in the day that had a lot of people there and like basically kind of saying like well all these sites are just misrepresenting what's going on although granted President Cat probably wasn't in the top 50 sales figures well I mean I don't think any of us really thought it was going to be
9134393	9137275	But neither was Boy and his blob, that's for sure.
9137395	9148340	And over there, I'm sure, the fact that they actually had a booth and were doing signings or whatever, that's more than you can say that big buck hunting or buck fever is going to do.
9148940	9152902	Buck fever is going to sell a lot because people are like, oh, hunting game, me buy.
9152922	9157324	That's exactly what they say, too, at Walmart.
9157444	9161526	Well, with President Cat, people are going to be like, oh my god, cute cat game, and they're going to buy that.
9161706	9162847	And that's what's going to happen.
9163615	9167122	Boy and his blob, they're like, uh, uh, blob?
9167423	9168224	No, boy?
9168545	9169346	I like boys.
9169407	9170348	No, I don't like boys.
9170389	9171431	That's wrong, you know?
9172172	9172373	So...
9174411	9176193	Where in the hell were you going with that, Loki?
9176273	9177174	I don't even know.
9177774	9178275	That's funny.
9178895	9183700	No, but again, I love that they called out those sites.
9184020	9187523	What are you guys trying to start?
9188084	9188384	Really?
9188544	9190146	Know your facts before you report on them.
9190406	9198814	And there were some pretty big sites that were running this story that this big failure of a launch event or whatever happened.
9198894	9199535	Thanks for watching!
9215352	9216853	Everybody fucking loves cats!
9238795	9239696	It's just the effort.
9239896	9243959	And a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, don't put any effort out there.
9243999	9246481	They expect everybody else to kind of just sell it for them.
9247061	9251424	Anyway, I just want to give major props to Kotaku for calling those people out that ran that story.
9251864	9253966	Think twice before you dish out your haterade, folks.
9254526	9254967	Think twice.
9256584	9258926	Anyhow, Loki, next story.
9259326	9273436	Yes, so the iPhone gets all sorts of crazy games, and there's a new one now that has you in the role of a firefighter called Firefighter 360, and it's actually kind of an augmented reality game.
9273636	9275237	It will create fires.
9276798	9277698	DarkSakura.com
9305049	9305509	Thanks for watching!
9326189	9327170	Thanks for watching!
9346192	9351734	So although this game sounds a little cheesy, I think the whole idea that it exists in the first place is kind of cool.
9352054	9355015	And someone asked, what happens when you point it at real fire?
9355055	9356255	Does the fire catch fire?
9357595	9357855	Nice.
9358156	9358856	That's crazy.
9359176	9359416	Deep.
9361757	9364638	That's kind of like that question about what happens when a tree falls in the woods or something.
9367938	9368699	It goes, ah!
9371059	9372900	Is that it that's going on in the iPhone world, Loki?
9373598	9375300	Well, there's other things.
9375560	9377902	And this is actually something more of Jamie's Alley, though.
9378703	9381125	R-Type is coming to the iPhone.
9381225	9382206	Woo-hoo!
9382226	9383067	Or iPod Touch, I guess.
9384007	9389092	It's basically... I don't know.
9389432	9390733	It looks kind of neat.
9391514	9397800	And they're basically collaborating with Irem Software Engineering, I guess, the company that put it out.
9398460	9398580	And...
9400748	9401329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9424497	9431361	Apple, if they want more games, they should just release something that plugs into the bottom that gives you a little controller.
9431521	9432382	How hard would that be?
9432862	9433923	How hard would that be?
9434323	9434783	Not very.
9435424	9435924	Exactly.
9437935	9443738	But then I guess the whole thought would be, well, not everybody would have one, so then these games wouldn't be open to everybody.
9444939	9448741	Well, you know, have, like, control scheme choices or something.
9448881	9449281	I don't know.
9449301	9451363	Have it detect if it's there and use that.
9451443	9453164	If not, it uses the on-screen thing.
9453444	9460728	I just think gaming on the iPhone could be so much better if there were, like, more to control with than just the touchscreen, because, you know, there's only so much you can do with your fat thumb.
9461608	9462809	Trust me, I know from experience.
9464127	9464507	DarkSakura.com
9479544	9480085	Out of the Box
9496045	9498567	Well, anyhow, of course, Moonwalker was a pretty epic game.
9498607	9500789	It was in the arcade and then, of course, on the Sega Genesis.
9500909	9508636	I'm imagining that this is the Sega Genesis version that's going to come over, but, of course, they do have arcade games emulatable on the Wii.
9508756	9509797	It's going to be the Genesis version.
9509817	9512859	Yeah, because I don't think they have any Sega games.
9513239	9514120	No, they do, actually.
9514140	9516923	Didn't Golden Axe come out on the emulator thing?
9518001	9519001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9535760	9538462	This is going to go the way of my Excitebike review.
9538702	9544746	You'll download it, play it for 10 minutes, and go, God, Moonwalker was pretty fucking awesome, but I'm already bored of it.
9544886	9547208	And then you'll never play it again, like a lot of virtual console games.
9547248	9549389	But it won't matter, because Nintendo and Sega have your money.
9552991	9555393	Moonwalker was kind of neat.
9555493	9558415	It was different, but I don't know if it's aged well.
9558595	9564499	I think it's probably more of just cashing in on Michael Jackson's death, which is kind of sad, but a lot of people are doing it.
9565267	9565867	Thank you for watching!
9579687	9584488	DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us.
9604505	9606966	Yep, um, actually just one from Spazinator.
9607386	9607706	Alrighty then.
9607766	9608106	It's long.
9608986	9609927	Well, it's just one.
9610207	9617489	Hi folks, I was initially going to call in about this subject tonight, but after seeing your tweet asking for mail, I decided to email you instead.
9617869	9622230	This email will be a first for me on your show for one single reason.
9622570	9628732	You see, despite the fact that I've been a fan of Sony systems since 97, I've decided that it's time to virtually rip Sony a new one.
9628832	9631553	Suffice to say, based on that last statement,
9632253	9635499	It is safe for everyone to assume I'm not happy with Sony right now.
9635860	9636361	Not at all.
9636822	9638064	And it's all due to one reason.
9638204	9642332	Their worthless piece of motherfucking POS DRM on their movies slash video downloads.
9644767	9651371	See, the thing is, I have been sinking good hard money into that service every week for movies, TV shows, etc.
9651411	9656595	that I had built up a decent collection, backing it all onto an external HDD as I buy it all.
9657475	9660517	In all, I had sunk several hundred dollars into the video service.
9660637	9662879	Well, as of this past Friday, all that money went down the drain.
9663579	9664339	See, here's the thing.
9664680	9671023	I was about to launch a game and it had to update before I could play it, but the system froze while it was updating, requiring a hard reset.
9671583	9676286	That, of course, corrupted the game, leaving a large, unusable file on my HDD.
9676786	9684290	So the kicker was, I couldn't delete it by highlighting it, pushing triangle, and selecting delete, thus requiring me to reformat my HDD to get rid of it, which I did.
9684930	9690936	I started redownloading my games as per usual and tried putting my video content back onto my internal HDD and watch it.
9691417	9692538	Here's the so-called good part.
9692718	9696662	I could transfer the videos back, but the DRM was all fouled up and the videos were unplayable.
9697163	9700026	As common sense would suggest, I called Sony and explained to the rep what happened.
9700406	9703269	Unfortunately, the response I got back was less than optimal, to put it lightly.
9703669	9706873	To paraphrase, they said I was shit out of luck and had to buy everything all over again.
9708464	9713708	I have to say it, but this is 100% pure, unadulterated, grade A fucking horseshit.
9714508	9715189	I love that term.
9715889	9723614	On one hand, I can sympathize with the fact that they want to curtail any kind of piracy, which is fine, but this could have been handled very differently and in a better manner.
9723975	9729058	I'm reasonably sure that they kept records of what each customer purchases, at least for their own bookkeeping purposes.
9729638	9737484	Also, obviously, for videos, one can only have one system activated at one time, so it's not like I could share these videos if I wanted to, not that I would, mind you.
9738084	9742025	Frankly, it kills me that I've been supporting them for so long and sunk so much money into that.
9742425	9746926	In the end all, I practically get a fucky from them and get spat in the face and kicked in the junk.
9747906	9752267	This really is making me seriously consider becoming a Rabid360 fanboy.
9752327	9757868	So in closing, and in the event that Sony is listening to the live broadcast or the podcast, I have to say this.
9758228	9761589	Fuck you and fuck the drama initiative sharks that you...
9762709	9764970	rode in on and subsequently jumped.
9765810	9771493	If Sony wants to keep me as a customer and avoid some serious negative PR, I seriously suggest they fix this issue ASAP.
9772073	9776155	This email was brought to you by Sony's Borked DRM, thus rendering this email unreadable.
9776915	9777755	I will say one thing.
9777935	9780196	It's not with Sony, but with Apple.
9780876	9787719	When I had to completely reboot my iPhone and lost everything I downloaded since... Well, let's see.
9787819	9788520	I did it in...
9789740	9818615	February and lost everything since November the year before and when I called in because they keep a record of all of my purchases I explained to them what happened I said yeah I was updating my iPhone for the first time in four months and it's like okay well we'll just reauthorize everything up to the last date of your last update and they did that and so it was just those things that they set up for me to queue to redownload why can't Sony do something like that it's fucking Sony that
9819275	9820056	is interesting.
9820396	9822177	I've not heard a lot like that.
9822398	9827081	I'm kind of sitting here a little bit in awe because I was listening to the first half of the email.
9827101	9832125	I was kind of sitting here going, well, you just need to call Sony and then they reset things because I think that's what Microsoft does.
9832205	9835288	Granted, I don't know so much about the video end of things.
9835848	9841432	I just know that they do that with the games is that they can reset the licenses.
9841472	9842513	Hell, you can do it yourself.
9842573	9844635	I think once a year you can reset your licenses.
9845095	9862988	same thing with Apple does something very similar like you know if you have to reinstall Windows or whatever and you get five plays per account or whatever you know this is they don't even sell music with DRM anymore anyway they got rid of it but for the DRM music that you still have you get like up to five computers I don't know
9864326	9867488	Regardless, I'm kind of sitting here in shock hearing this story.
9867588	9871871	This is a little bit surprising to me that I haven't heard this before.
9872451	9876613	But granted, I don't know a lot of people that use the video marketplace so heavily.
9877514	9881616	I don't think there's a lot of people that are really into the digital distribution.
9881636	9881857	I know...
9882917	9901447	you've called into the show several times talking about various animes and stuff so you know I know you're a heavy user of this so this is kind of surprising to me so I think you've done a good first step by starting to get the word out there that this is going on the way I see it you have a couple of options from here you can call Sony back
9902142	9903624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9925186	9951723	maybe try to get a clearer answer about what their policy is on it because you know I'm hearing that the rep told you that you were shit out of luck but I just as a consumer activist if you will that has a podcast I want to know a little more about the why why did they tell you that you were shit out of luck your other options once you've figured that out and once you have a really good solid reason you understand their policy you can do one of two things or you can do both
9953561	9954082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9962478	9970560	that Sony does say you're shit out of luck for something you legally purchased yourself when you had to fix something that they broke, right?
9970580	9972381	He said his drive corrupted, right?
9973121	9973521	Yeah.
9973841	9978302	So that's... And he had to do a hard reset and it corrupted his game data.
9978382	9985824	So he had the only way to get rid of it because it wouldn't delete was to reformat it.
9988025	9988125	Um...
9989751	9994919	or you could, and if you want, you could try to get your story out there a little more.
9995359	10004092	Once you kind of know, understand the policies a little more, email some of your favorite game blogs, see who might run the story, especially if you do end up sending a complaint to Better Business Bureau, you could see what happens.
10004753	10009036	Now, granted, there's also other things to check out here, and this is where our chat room's piping up.
10009076	10010677	Something very big to consider here.
10011097	10015480	Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, but why should Sony let them play it again?
10015940	10019102	A store does not replace your disc if you lose or scratch it.
10019783	10027968	And certainly that's a valid devil's advocate argument, is that, you know, if you just damage the data, you're shit out of luck if it were a Blu-ray disc that you dropped on the floor.
10028489	10031771	It was an accident, but you dropped it, you broke it, you're screwed, right?
10032091	10033352	This is due to their...
10035188	10040390	I know, there's just something where I totally respect where Brad's coming from with that statement.
10040750	10045552	There's just something about what Spazinator's saying that just doesn't sound fair to me.
10045693	10048694	Isn't this part of the reason we do digital distribution?
10049114	10050435	Yeah.
10050955	10057938	The advantage is supposed to be that I have a digital version of it that doesn't get damaged the way a physical copy does.
10058878	10068323	We always talk about the pros and cons about why should people have physical versions instead of digital versions, but we don't often talk about why should people have digital versions instead of physical ones.
10068703	10082711	And again, if Apple and Microsoft have these competitive DRM management schemes, then Sony should be taking a task for having one that is less than ideal, I suppose.
10083831	10086773	So, very interesting.
10088305	10115140	I don't know what else to think of this I would say call back, talk to a supervisor if you can't hear from the supervisor get their complaint address and write them a letter make sure also when you talk to their people that you document names, what time you called you want to know who you spoke to who their supervisor is you want to record all of that because the next step after writing them a letter is if you get nothing from that go to the Better Business Bureau
10115840	10144656	and for the I just would like to know what is their policy and you know I could go on to Sony's website and actually read the little blah blah blahs and probably figure it out for myself I don't have time to do that while trying to do a live radio show but I would kind of like our listeners to try and figure that out for the next week and maybe we'll see some emails on that what exactly is their policy when it comes to this stuff like just the whole you're shit out of luck response I mean just I'm a customer service trainer that's not the type of thing you tell a customer ever is that you're shit out of luck there's always something
10145827	10150009	Even if that something is, here is our complaint address if you don't like the policy.
10150349	10153430	This is our policy, and if you don't agree with it, here's an address to complain about it.
10153791	10155771	That is better than, well, fuck you.
10156112	10158152	You know what I mean?
10158333	10162934	Just what I'm hearing, just as the customer service trainer in me is crying a little bit.
10163555	10163755	So...
10164892	10168593	Keep in mind, I used to take escalated calls at my work.
10169213	10170593	I used to talk to all the pissed off people.
10172654	10174614	I know that there's something that can be done.
10174814	10183315	If you want to keep someone's business, because keep in mind, I'm going into a little bit of the world of business, and maybe this is something you can use, Rob.
10185796	10191597	Actually, I remember going through a couple of training seminars that were called A Complaint is a Gift.
10193104	10204570	and was talking about for every eight people that have a bad experience, at least two of them will talk about it.
10204910	10206611	Two of them will talk to eight more people.
10206771	10207292	You know what I mean?
10207752	10209693	And they'll keep passing it around by word.
10210093	10211514	For every, I think...
10212867	10214649	I've heard the same thing, just not with numbers.
10214809	10216231	I think the numbers always seem to change.
10216311	10217612	That principle.
10217632	10220815	But you're also going to run into the person who is an activist.
10221476	10224559	The person who's going to take the initiative and get up and write the letter.
10224599	10226761	The Jamie.
10226782	10229885	I actually adopted that whole attitude after taking that seminar.
10231609	10243216	I'll tell you this, if any place has given me bad service for any reason, if I know specifically that they haven't done things that they should do, I will say something about it.
10243296	10248980	Because if no one says anything about it to the company, how are they going to know to fix it?
10249700	10256545	How are they going to know that maybe so-and-so rep screwed up until you call them on it?
10257765	10260327	I think there's not enough people who call other people on their bullshits.
10261407	10269932	and to be fair if I know we have had people that work for we have been mentioned on the official Sony Playstation 3 Twitter before this show on the official Twitter yes
10270799	10272460	because we've had friends that work at Sony.
10272601	10277224	So please, by all means, Sony, the floor is yours.
10277384	10285211	If we are misrepresenting these facts, if this emailer had a bad experience and needs to be corrected, please contact us.
10285751	10286312	You know how.
10286372	10287533	There's many different ways to do it.
10288073	10289234	State your side of the case.
10289314	10292277	If we are misrepresenting you, we want to make it right.
10293217	10295720	But on the other hand, if your policy sucks, we also want to call you out on it.
10295740	10296540	Sorry, but that's what we do.
10297061	10299663	So by all means, let's hear both sides of the story.
10300549	10312101	Okay, well, that's pretty much what I was getting to next, is that, you know, there's always two sides of a story, but again, they don't know a situation exists until it's brought to their attention.
10313242	10317206	Right, and this could, unfortunately, be just a bad experience with the customer service rep.
10317607	10320029	And if that is their policy, this could be a step to changing it.
10320329	10320610	Who knows?
10321170	10321410	We'll see.
10324469	10327432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10347620	10351062	So, um, is that it for Mailbag then, for now?
10351282	10352342	That's the one and only.
10352422	10354924	Alright, well, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com That was a good email.
10355064	10355804	It was a good discussion.
10355864	10362647	So, MailbagOrangeOnStradio.com if you want to, um, and he always gets through on the phone, so I'm sure he's going to call in later to talk about it.
10363108	10367510	So, it'll come up again later, I'm sure, but it was an interesting discussion.
10367550	10369371	And I would be very curious
10371821	10378604	If you run a game blog out there, I'm too lazy to do this, so here you can take this story and just say it was inspired by this show.
10378644	10379244	Throw us a bone.
10380044	10384306	I would like to see the DRM policies of the various companies side by side.
10384606	10394129	I would like someone to make that nice little chart that says, here's what it is with Microsoft, here's what it is with Nintendo for their limited video service in Japan, which I think they have.
10394705	10395706	Here's what it is to the US.
10395766	10400389	I would like to see that kind of side by side so the consumer can be better informed going into this.
10400509	10401429	I would like to kind of see that.
10403711	10403931	Anyhow.
10404071	10404391	I agree.
10405071	10405332	All right.
10405892	10407873	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
10408013	10412776	And I was supposed to have a story and I neglected to link it.
10413416	10414557	So I've got to bring it up real quick.
10414577	10417639	So FU starts to me for not being prepared tonight.
10417950	10418190	DarkSakura
10444411	10445052	My F.U.
10445092	10447993	goes to pissy attitudes.
10449153	10449554	That's it.
10452395	10453976	Loki, F.U.
10454036	10459298	to the stores that think that it's necessary to break street to compete with GameStop and other stores.
10459738	10462700	You just suck and make my job harder.
10465441	10466161	My F.U.
10466242	10468663	just goes to the swine flu.
10470203	10470744	I mean, really.
10471943	10472663	Need I say more?
10472843	10474564	You heard the first 20 minutes of tonight's show.
10475364	10478426	Finally, we found that story that's supposed to inspire tonight's FUs.
10479166	10481367	You remember this came from a couple weeks ago.
10481627	10488370	Do you remember hearing about the raid where the police guys busted into the house and started playing the Nintendo Wii during the raid?
10488590	10488770	No.
10488950	10493492	Maybe this was the show you weren't here because you did miss a show or two because you had other things going on.
10494393	10498279	There was actually police that broke into a house and started playing the Wii that was there.
10499961	10500702	Seriously, really?
10500882	10503687	You're professionals and you're sitting there playing the Wii or whatever on the job?
10504267	10507272	Well, apparently what happens is that as
10508241	10510862	As punishment, did these officers get fired?
10511302	10513043	Did they get suspended without pay?
10513643	10516064	No, they're going to have to go through some retraining.
10516804	10520665	The officers even, those names are being withheld because they are undercover police.
10521325	10524166	And the company is saying they are learning from their mistakes.
10524206	10530949	So in other words, these officers that were screwing around playing the Wii on the job got a slap on the wrist and are getting sent back to training.
10531309	10532089	And as a trainer...
10533493	10537275	You know what, no, for the sake of separating my job from this, I'm not going to get into it.
10537415	10538416	I will tell you this.
10538456	10543259	There's certain things about that excuse that really strike a nerve with me, and that's all I can say.
10544439	10546080	I have to keep my work and personal separate, though.
10546541	10548121	Well, then I will talk about my experience.
10548302	10548662	Go for it.
10548722	10556967	As a person who is required to take a certain number of training classes a year, I think that they're just going to be more inconvenienced than anything else to go to a class to learn stuff that they already know.
10558127	10561351	There's a difference between knowing something and caring enough to put it into practice.
10562212	10563193	That's my point.
10563473	10567518	It's just going to be, oh, we have to sit in the class for a day.
10567538	10569400	You know.
10572165	10574146	There is so much I want to say, but can't.
10574386	10574906	I just can't.
10575207	10575547	I'm sorry.
10575767	10577148	Say after the show so you can get it out.
10577268	10584712	After the show, I would love to share it with you personally, but I can't talk about it on a platform where people... I don't know who has access to it and who could share it with who.
10584952	10586412	But there's just so much I could say about this.
10586432	10592456	I will say this, though, and I will tell you this because I do know our trainers and I know the hard work that they put into it.
10593056	10598699	That's why I usually at least pay attention, but all of them know...
10599811	10601752	But do you think these guys are going to sit there and pay attention?
10601913	10602313	Probably not.
10602353	10602773	They're dicks.
10603013	10605555	So this is probably a waste of everyone's time, right?
10606295	10606535	Yeah.
10608316	10611038	Anyhow, let's move on with some other stories.
10611078	10614680	I don't think playing a Wii is cause for suspension, but still.
10615101	10619083	At the same time, though, like, really, you're there to do a job.
10620584	10624887	I think the bad press for the police itself is punishment enough, I suppose.
10624907	10625867	Might be bad enough, yeah.
10626147	10626528	I suppose.
10627829	10628449	All right, Loki.
10631058	10631438	All right.
10632159	10637143	Anyways, so this is kind of cool because, of course, you know, huge Grand Theft Auto fan.
10637903	10645989	Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC just recently got an update to, I believe, live.
10646870	10650092	The Games for Windows Live also kind of got an update as well.
10650673	10659319	And with that, the download content for The Lost and Damned, the achievements are showing up now on Game for Windows Live for...
10660260	10667425	So that can only mean one thing, that the download content that once was exclusive to the Xbox 360 is coming to PC.
10667985	10683576	And that makes sense, because if you think about it, if Microsoft paid to have that download content made, or at least paid for the exclusivity, Games for Windows is still Microsoft, so perhaps we will see both episodes eventually released for the PC, and probably sooner than later.
10686177	10686778	That's pretty sweet.
10687278	10689980	Sorry, PS3 owners, no word on that.
10691966	10692266	Interesting.
10692326	10695127	Although, it could open the door to that, possibly?
10695567	10696267	Not necessarily.
10696687	10699707	I mean, they could literally port this in a heartbeat.
10699787	10705388	I mean, everything that's on there can be, you know, it's a multi-platform anyways.
10705908	10708269	It could be ported, like, seriously super quick.
10708849	10710569	Because they already have the hardware done.
10710589	10712129	I mean, the engine's already done.
10712170	10713590	They don't really have to change too much.
10714650	10716550	But they're just not gonna because they're under contract.
10717190	10718791	And especially if, you know, $50 million says, you know,
10721479	10724084	That kind of buys some time, I should say.
10725186	10726709	It probably will never make it over to the PS3.
10728470	10730851	Well, dudes, I got one more story for you.
10731091	10732691	Dudes, do you like Barbie?
10733131	10738632	Of course you do, because how else is the Xbox Live Marketplace selling Avatar clothing?
10738652	10740552	Because that's basically what it is.
10740813	10742933	It's Barbie for dudes.
10743273	10744453	And dudettes, of course, too.
10745233	10752615	But hey, some people like to buy these clothes and dress their own little character and buy the Malibu Beach backgrounds and whatever else you can get on Xbox Live Marketplace.
10752955	10753916	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10781618	10782218	Just so you know.
10782719	10785000	Also of interest, a Da Vinci's Flying Machine.
10785540	10786840	If you want to get that.
10786860	10788441	240 Microsoft points for that.
10788581	10789662	Well, that's also from Assassin's Creed 2.
10789702	10790822	I actually kind of want that.
10792923	10793263	I don't know.
10793323	10794964	I kind of... You know what?
10795024	10795324	I can see...
10797654	10800276	I can sit here and make fun of this stuff a little bit.
10801276	10802357	Granted, I'm no better.
10802497	10806120	I spent $10 on a Warcraft bet this week, so I'm really no better.
10806720	10809062	But I do find this stuff to be a little silly.
10809102	10811844	And even I can admit, what I did was silly too.
10811944	10827394	But I just think this whole buying for your virtual costume, when a lot of games don't even really use them, I mean, I guess a few do, like Guitar Hero does and stuff, maybe more will next year or what have you, but pretty soon it's all going to be Natal, so you will be in the game anyway, not your avatar.
10827894	10829235	So, I don't know.
10830356	10830956	Whatever, though.
10831817	10832237	There you go.
10835980	10843765	Anyhow, some folks in chat are complaining that the stream has died, but I am seeing... Oh, we did drop for a minute.
10844785	10846326	But we're reconnected now, and we're good.
10846386	10848107	So I guess the stream did drop for a minute.
10848167	10848988	I don't know what happened there.
10849849	10850749	Technical glitch!
10851390	10851830	It happens.
10851990	10852470	Don't know what to do.
10852490	10853511	I was downloading all that porn.
10853531	10854031	Sorry, Rob.
10855092	10855532	There you go.
10856293	10856533	Knew it!
10857560	10861843	And again, live folks, keep in mind there's not a lot we can do when the stream goes down.
10861903	10863644	It does usually tend to come back right away.
10864004	10868207	So our biggest advice to our live listeners would be just wait patiently 30 seconds and reload.
10868548	10869708	You usually won't miss too much.
10869748	10873451	You just miss me making jokes about how the Xbox Live Marketplace is like Barbie for dudes.
10873731	10874071	That's all.
10874872	10875152	All right.
10875532	10876173	You didn't miss much.
10876826	10880167	Alright, let's get into the Skype line.
10880187	10882328	1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give us a call.
10882428	10884488	Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
10884808	10885668	Go ahead and give us a call.
10885768	10890150	Speaking of technical difficulties, I hate the new Skype.
10890210	10894791	If you've been listening in the past few weeks, Skype got a makeover the last couple months and I hate it.
10895311	10898052	I miss the old one so, so, so much.
10898532	10901113	I miss the first version of Skype we used several years ago.
10901533	10910977	I would see everybody that was calling in so everybody would have a fair shot of being on the show because I could actually pick callers that I didn't recognize were calling in and you rotate it a little bit.
10911557	10913037	I don't even get that now in Skype.
10913518	10916278	Now Skype likes to randomly drop calls and do all this stuff.
10916319	10917259	I just, I hate it.
10918226	10920248	We all hate it.
10920288	10922249	Hey, what up?
10922269	10924091	This is X-Link calling from Melbourne, Florida.
10924111	10932397	Was that in your neck of the woods?
10932437	10932997	Did that happen?
10934218	10935159	No, it didn't happen around me.
10935219	10936260	It happened in a different part of town.
10936300	10942344	But it's great to know that these wonderful cops who get sworn to duty have nothing better to do than raid a house and play a Wii.
10942544	10945046	And the fix is more training, is the fix.
10945066	10945306	Yes.
10945527	10945747	Yes.
10946147	10949229	Not suspension, not getting fired, but more training.
10949329	10952892	Because clearly, they were not trained properly the first time.
10953632	10953892	Yes.
10954252	10955974	This is how you bowl a 300 game in Wii.
10956154	10960777	So the responsibility falls upon the trainers of the company to do the... Never mind.
10961157	10961457	Go ahead.
10961497	10962018	What's on your mind?
10962738	10970243	Anyways, I called because I want to call about a PSP game that recently came out, but before I do that, Spazinator, quick tip.
10970303	10974726	I don't know why he couldn't have a copy, like, hooked up his PS3 to the...
10976167	10994183	PC or through his PSP and then copy it onto his PC because every time when I get something new downloaded from the PlayStation Store, I always try to make a copy available on my hard drive just in case if something would happen or crash, I would have that backup as a storage
10995064	10997806	I think that's what he said he did.
11019690	11020111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11036650	11037450	That's kind of a weird situation.
11037470	11038211	Yeah, it's very weird.
11039391	11044513	That's why I'm kind of sitting here going, you know, whereas I think Spazinator has some very valid concerns.
11044613	11046274	I feel like there's a piece of the puzzle.
11046414	11054077	I need to hear Sony's policy on this because I feel like that piece is missing and we might be misrepresenting their policy a little bit and I don't want to do that either.
11054277	11057158	I don't see why you could do it as long as you have the idea and everything.
11057198	11058699	I don't see why there would be a problem with it.
11059359	11061320	I'm very curious to see how this further develops.
11061380	11062060	I think he'll do it.
11062100	11064040	I think he'll follow up on it and let us know.
11064300	11066781	Well, I had an interesting situation earlier on.
11066801	11067761	I'm trying to make this quick, too.
11068181	11078304	I bought Mass Effect a while back for the PC and unfortunately didn't have the CD code, though I could have easily gone on Torrent and got a no CD fix and stuff like that.
11078364	11080004	I really wanted to have it legalized.
11081801	11090013	I actually went through the EA website, talked to somebody through the chat, which was absolutely horrid.
11090434	11095502	The guy told me just to call the manufacturer and get a key from them, which I don't think he understood that it wasn't a download.
11096503	11105509	Um, so I ended up calling the, um, the, uh, long distance phone number for the tech support, uh, was put on hold for 20 minutes, got through to a guy.
11105549	11107890	The guy was very nice, very civilized.
11107970	11116936	I explained to him very nicely my problem and explained to him about it and, um, gave him the, you know, and we went through all the steps and he told me, he gave me, uh, he sent me an email.
11116976	11119037	He said on the email, he goes, go to this page.
11119117	11120258	He goes, what's your response?
11120358	11125301	And he goes, set up some, uh, photos of the booklet and show that the fact that you didn't get a CD key.
11125321	11125361	Um,
11126481	11133645	Um, did it, and the very next day they sent me a CD, uh, another person from the tech support sent me a CD key so I can actually have a legit version of my game.
11133785	11137067	Which was very cool, instead of paying like 10 or 20 bucks for a CD key for it.
11138331	11139132	Thanks for watching!
11163451	11163952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11189041	11197204	I'm not at liberty to say specifically people I know that were affected by it, but some names you might remember from the shows yesteryear.
11197344	11201546	So it's very unfortunate, and we hope for the best for our fans.
11201566	11201806	Definitely.
11201826	11207708	I know one or two from the Ted Braun, but like you said, too, I'm not going to mention any names either.
11207968	11212010	Obviously, we want to respect their privacy and wish them the best of luck because layoffs are never any fun.
11212790	11213270	Most definitely.
11214866	11216728	I've been playing a game for the pinball.
11216828	11218530	It's the Pinball Heroes.
11218610	11221512	It's the $3.99 one that recently came out on the PlayStation Network.
11222293	11223074	It's a very good game.
11223815	11224395	$3.99 pinball.
11224736	11226317	I like it very much.
11226397	11229080	The only problem I had with it was the fact that...
11231161	11244866	for each of the tables it's $3.99 but it has great scoring system it keeps a little achievement I think there's trophies you can get for it too if you hook it up to the PS3 through their trophy system
11245906	11257495	Um, but, um, it keeps on only scoring for not only for local when you play, you know, the, uh, the PlayStation, but also you can go against other people from around the globe that has the game on the network.
11257556	11261238	It will upload your score and go against other people's score, which is really awesome.
11262199	11268885	Um, it's, it, the only problem I had with it was the multi-ball was the screen would kind of like zoom outward, um,
11269645	11288315	and it would get kind of the table would get much smaller but when it's done it will zoom back in but if you're in multi-ball and you really have a hard time seeing I can see that being like a partly of a problem seeing like the little balls and like guys that goes around and hit stuff but other than that I've been having a lot of fun with it and for a four-hour game that's not that bad.
11289364	11289744	All right.
11290465	11292907	Well, we appreciate the perspective and all that.
11293067	11296049	So I'm going to go ahead and let you go, though, so we can get some more calls.
11296370	11300653	But thank you for your – you had a hometown buffet of stories tonight, but I like it.
11300933	11302554	I like hearing all the different stuff.
11302594	11306818	So some reviews and customer service goods and bads all rolled into one.
11307378	11308219	I just thought it was ironic.
11308239	11311321	It was this whole customer service thing, and then I had the customer service this week.
11312162	11312602	There you go.
11313042	11313283	All right.
11313303	11313703	Thank you, Gil.
11314003	11316285	Take care, and, hey, have fun on World of Warcraft.
11316465	11316826	Thank you.
11316886	11317607	I appreciate it.
11317647	11318408	Thank you for that crack.
11318508	11319169	Hey, you're welcome.
11319530	11321352	I'm going to win myself out of it.
11321853	11322213	Good luck.
11323475	11326179	Alright, that was X-Link here on Orange Lounge Radio.
11326500	11327701	We'll take a couple more calls.
11329008	11330029	Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku
11350662	11353304	Saku, you're the type of guy that's into Modern Warfare, right?
11354125	11362871	Well, yeah, and I mean, I would play it if they had dedicated servers on the PC, then I would have justification to spend money on it.
11363411	11366694	Oh, so you're one of the protesters that is actually protesting.
11367234	11373298	Yes, I mean, I have the money right now, and even if I didn't have the money, I wanted to see how this would play out first.
11374119	11378641	Just so I could see how this new matchmaking would work on the PC.
11378901	11383423	And lo and behold, it works just like the 360, works like the console versions.
11384123	11388786	Well, props to you sticking to your guns and actually meaning it and actually sticking to the cause.
11390046	11391147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11407444	11409385	It's almost like the Halo effect.
11409425	11418370	Have you ever seen how the subsequent Halo releases, like Halo 2 and 3, and you see people lining up for midnight launches?
11418870	11419651	It's kind of that.
11420111	11436200	When you have a game that managed to develop a big following on the first type of game, the first non-World War 2 game in the Call of Duty franchise, and yet that game managed to get Halo numbers for its sequel.
11437537	11445863	which it took a Bungie 3 just to get that amount whereas Infinity War just got it on the second try.
11447124	11449365	It was a surprise hit.
11449465	11454329	No one would have thought Modern Warfare would outdo the whole Call of Duty series.
11455450	11457211	That was completely unexpected.
11458769	11460670	I bought Halo 3 just for shits and giggles I had my 360 back then
11478303	11481064	But to be honest, I never got into the campaign mode at all.
11481104	11486906	I was just trying to do multiplayer because I don't play shooters on consoles.
11487086	11489107	I just play it on keyboard and mouse.
11489787	11491068	A bit old-fashioned.
11491328	11500891	Alright, but to summarize though, you still say that folks shouldn't get Modern Warfare 2, at least not on the PC, until they address what the fans want.
11501112	11501992	In other words, if they...
11502632	11509378	Basically, if they want a good single-player experience with the keyboard and mouse, then by all means, they should buy it.
11509878	11528233	But, you know, you have to really stick to your guns if you really want to wait out until Infinity Ward decides to come to their senses and release something for the community that it apparently backstabbed when killing off the dedicated servers.
11528513	11535807	You know buddy, I'm sure I don't even have to ask, but what about this rumor that they might allow the dedicated servers later on for more money?
11536772	11540573	Well, that depends on whether or not that actually comes to fruition.
11540753	11545375	Whether or not it's just a rumor, so you'd rather take it with a grain of salt.
11545735	11549137	What I heard recently was that the hackers managed to outdo them already.
11549277	11553778	They already had dedicated server support and a console.
11554439	11560141	The little console that you hit whenever you press the tilde key on the keyboard, just like any other first-person shooter.
11560241	11560601	Now you have...
11561641	11567326	Someone managed to hack the game and add console support, dedicated server as a proof of concept.
11568087	11568787	No surprise.
11569068	11569288	None.
11569648	11569888	None.
11569988	11573471	I mean, the hacker community, when they set out to do something, they fucking do it.
11573551	11575553	So I have to say I'm not surprised at all.
11575573	11586061	Basically, it won't be that long before Infinity Ward gets steamed to add that in the blacklist for back.
11586582	11589004	And then all the folks that run the hacked version get banned.
11589424	11591707	Um, Zaku, I know you may not have called in.
11591867	11593389	I made you kind of talk about Modern Warfare 2.
11593630	11599598	I don't know if that's originally why you called in tonight, but before we let you go, I wanted to let you get out whatever you wanted to actually call in and talk about tonight.
11600468	11607552	Oh man, I'm trying to basically play DJ Hero for the first time last night under the influence of alcohol.
11608112	11613154	It was a little bit of a transition since I'm more of a 2DX kind of guy.
11613955	11615816	But, you know, it's going to take a while.
11616276	11619958	I mean, I don't see it as a game I would normally play on my own.
11620558	11625000	It's because most of the songs are of a genre that I don't listen to.
11625320	11626601	I mean, there are some good ones.
11627642	11639971	you know the stuff that with Tiesto and Paul Van Dyke for example and even the one where Tears for Fears and Pajano is like you know mixed up but it's really not like 2DX at all is it?
11640091	11656504	of course I kind of see it that way because it's basically in this game you actually scratch and you actually move a crossfader so I guess in a sense Activision made it more realistic yeah it's different alright Zaku we gotta let you go buddy but thanks so much for the call as always and take care okay
11657162	11657622	Have a good one.
11657742	11659043	Later, you too.
11659063	11662403	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to get in.
11662543	11663844	Maybe we'll take one more call.
11665384	11666865	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
11669525	11671086	Not really, but here's what I got.
11671786	11683689	They're going to be doing possibly, well, there's a possible spin-off they're talking about doing for Modern Warfare starring, and I had to laugh because the character's name is Ghost, so it'd be like a Modern Warfare Ghost character.
11684663	11686123	StarCraftGoes, but not.
11686884	11687284	But not.
11687444	11687904	Anyways.
11688164	11688924	Hey, we got a phone call.
11688964	11689844	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11689864	11690225	Who's this?
11691165	11693746	Good evening, OU across the ocean.
11693946	11698347	OU in the land of the free or so we're to say.
11698467	11700507	The state that falls into the ocean in 2012.
11700547	11702248	That's where we are.
11702268	11703108	Oh, what the hell?
11703308	11703788	We're all dead.
11703808	11704909	Oh, hello there, OLR.
11704949	11707049	This is that one, Aki Ripper.
11707129	11709370	But John Cusack survives, so the hell with the rest of us.
11710090	11712551	Aki Ripper, it's been forever since we've heard from you.
11712571	11713431	What is on your mind, buddy?
11714920	11717302	Oh wow, what's on my mind?
11717543	11724548	Once again, I've given a reason actually to buy a Wii since, well, I saw footage of that new Super Mario Bros.
11725769	11740222	And, well, since I still actually haven't bought a Wii, even though I actually have like four games, actually already have four games, so... Wait, so you already have the games, but you just didn't have the Wii?
11740242	11740322	Yeah.
11740973	11741953	Yeah, exactly.
11743194	11746274	That's kind of the backwards way of doing it, but okay.
11746795	11762399	It really was like, I was at that point of like, there was like this plenty of games that I'm really interested in, but I either choose to buy the console and have no games, or buy the games or have no console.
11764782	11766283	That's why you're the crazy Swedish guy.
11766363	11767605	That's no problem.
11771990	11776516	Once again, it's quite fun in a way since I'm the kind of collector in a way.
11777677	11778298	That's cool, though.
11778318	11778698	That's cool.
11779098	11779839	Let me ask you, though.
11779999	11782702	And having things on my shelf is like a bonus.
11782962	11786725	Let me ask you, though, about New Super Mario Bros., because obviously the game just came out over here today.
11787206	11788747	I was actually kind of surprised.
11788827	11795153	I haven't touched the game myself yet outside of my short experience with it at E3, and you don't judge a game based off an E3 build.
11795666	11809690	But I'm kind of surprised because, of course, the gaming community did a little bit of backlash with the game with the whole easy button stuff that's going around, although we've talked a little more about how that's actually integrated into the game, and it kind of sounds like it might be interesting.
11810411	11813212	But the other thing, I was looking at some of the Metacritic scores for this.
11813872	11815092	The game's getting glowing reviews.
11815692	11819514	The game is probably going to end up on people's top ten list when all is said and done at the end of the year.
11820014	11820534	Many critics...
11821835	11842914	The reason I'm basing, in a way though, the video I saw was on Giant Bomb, and they were playing 4 player co-op, and that looked hilarious fun, really, so, that had me like stoked for it, so.
11843607	11846910	When I actually have three of my friends come over to play video games, it'll be great.
11847310	11851253	But my only concern is, is single-player mode fun, too?
11851653	11854475	Because sometimes, I have to play video games by myself.
11854536	11855636	In fact, that's most of the time.
11856797	11869427	Here's another thing, in a way, though, is that, well, the following week, in a way, though, if I get my Wii, I will still be busy, in a kind of way, with the new Sims 3 expansion.
11869507	11869627	So...
11871209	11872409	I'm right there with you on that.
11872870	11874790	You are not alone in this studio with that.
11875270	11877131	Now, one question, though.
11877151	11878992	Do you have President Cat sitting on your shelf?
11879932	11881112	No, I don't.
11881473	11882773	Unfortunately, not yet.
11884133	11893037	Speaking of which, since we have a mod-friendly one around your block, so to say, and...
11895012	11915708	I was wondering, is it, since I heard about the 360 bannings and such, well, I own a 360, but I have no plans whatsoever on shipping that one, but I was thinking about getting a shipped, getting a flashed or shipped Wii.
11917230	11921273	Is that like any, how does that work out, so to say?
11922073	11927779	Loki, do you recommend people do this to their Wii's or is this a risk you don't want to take or what?
11928460	11936328	There's mods now that seriously, you open the Wii up and you have to have a tri-wing screwdriver to do that but that's easy to get.
11937100	11937600	and DarkSakura.com.
11957691	11960953	It's very unlikely that you will break it up, especially when you're not soldering it.
11961153	11970419	I either solder my chip in, and from a person who can't solder for shit, soldering hair-thin wires on there, I'm surprised it works still.
11970839	11973721	But it does, and if I can do it, then anybody can do it.
11974162	11978925	So, yeah, it's seriously a new board, so they have some that literally will just plug in.
11979005	11980005	Was it worth it?
11980105	11984048	You have to step away from the I-did-it-because-I-can mentality for a little bit.
11985989	11986910	Absolutely.
11987490	11988130	Absolutely.
11988331	11988811	Interesting.
11989291	11998477	Yeah, well, once again, for the clarification whatsoever, I'm not really interested in pirating games.
11998797	12003401	Well, still, you can do it for playing region free stuff.
12003581	12008684	When you do such a thing, from my point of view, is to buy imports, right?
12011141	12013422	Yeah, like I said, I played President Cat on it.
12013562	12016623	I also, back in the day, I imported, you know, Smash Brothers.
12016643	12018144	That's right, you had the Japanese Smash Brothers.
12018164	12023206	Yeah, I remember that when you premiered that on, what was it, Uprade?
12023727	12024627	No, it wasn't Uprade.
12024647	12025968	It was Justin.TV or something.
12026008	12029129	It was either our Ustream at the time, or no, I'm sorry, we've never been on Ustream.
12029149	12030830	We actually have a Ustream channel, we just never used it.
12031990	12034171	It's Justin.TV, or what was before that?
12034931	12035932	Uprader 11.
12036112	12037072	Uprader 11, that's the one.
12037132	12038093	All games was all...
12038853	12039454	Up On That Channel
12064918	12067680	I don't know what plans that is for the network.
12067740	12071283	We usually find out about that stuff after it's already set in motion.
12071923	12075766	But certainly when I read that tweet, I was like, oh, that's pretty exciting for them.
12075786	12079248	Because I kind of miss having that spot to...
12081806	12086467	The best E3 I still think was the year that we had the arena and that whole thing going on.
12087148	12089348	I don't know about you guys, that was my favorite E3.
12089708	12103912	It was also the one where we probably worked the hardest and were the most tired afterwards, but just getting to all convene afterwards with the other podcasters, very much like us, in that really fun, almost frat house kind of place that I'm sure just lost somebody a shitload of money.
12104092	12104552	Poor Ron.
12104592	12104752	Yeah.
12106124	12108806	But goddamn, it was fun while it lasted.
12109326	12110987	So anyway, sorry.
12111047	12113949	Got a little off the tangent there, but it was worth mentioning.
12114370	12115470	Best of luck to our pals.
12115490	12116071	Well, what more?
12116371	12117011	Well, what more?
12117812	12129140	Well, it's been released like more than a few games around, and I still haven't... I have barely, in a way, though, installed Dragon Age and played it for like...
12130017	12131198	Two minutes in a kind of way.
12131859	12138144	I don't know how it didn't make the show roll tonight, but I heard about the gay sex in Dragon Age and the lesbian sex and all this stuff.
12138164	12141927	Can't you have sex with an animal or something in that game?
12141967	12142227	What?
12142708	12142988	What?
12143288	12143768	No, seriously.
12143808	12145130	No, no, no, no, no.
12145470	12154037	Do not follow up my big story about gay sex in a video game that's not completely tacky with, oh, by the way, you can also have sex with an animal.
12154277	12156319	You sound like a Prop 8 supporter right now.
12156991	12157852	That's what you sound like.
12157872	12158212	Sorry.
12158432	12158953	Go ahead.
12158973	12159494	No, I'm kidding.
12159534	12161115	I don't have anything else.
12162757	12165960	Let me finish up with Aki Ripper, then we'll talk about Dragon Age.
12166921	12169604	Before I brought sex into it, what were your thoughts on Dragon Age?
12170805	12179594	It looks really nice, and, well, you don't need a supercomputer to actually run it, since, well, I run it on mine, and that one isn't...
12180685	12200864	That one is actually a bit old, but in a way also, my other computer actually, or my primary gaming rig blew up the other month, and well, I had to replace it, and well, I'm up and running once again, so I will...
12201184	12203369	I have heard glowing reviews on Dragon Age though.
12203389	12204651	A lot of people are really into this game.
12206775	12210663	Once I get the time to play it, it will probably be good.
12210763	12211364	But for...
12214956	12220599	I was being stupid, actually, the other week also, since I actually bought Borderlands 2.
12221419	12227462	So I now have plenty of games, and in a way, though, I'm not playing anything, kind of.
12228122	12228922	You sound like Loki.
12229422	12229983	That's me.
12230903	12233044	Okay, Ripper, we've got to let you go, so we wrap up the show.
12233284	12240347	But thank you so much for calling in, as always, and best of luck with obtaining the Wii and getting your gaming rig up and going again, okay?
12241067	12241668	Yeah, thank you.
12241788	12242448	All right, later, dude.
12243493	12245174	Alright, we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.
12245194	12249135	Sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but of course you can always send us an email if you didn't get through.
12249195	12254477	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or of course we're on Twitter as well, Twitter.com slash OLR.
12255217	12268282	Real quickly with last minute stories, I don't know if you had anything else, Loki, but I just want to say about Dragon Age, I did see the scene on YouTube, and you know, I like what they, not just the man on man, but the woman on woman, I saw them both or whatever, and I just like that
12268762	12269843	It's just kind of there.
12270303	12271844	And it's a little bit cheesy.
12272544	12273965	But then again, sex in video games is cheesy.
12273985	12275385	Well, I'm not positive about the animals.
12275505	12277546	I read that a long time ago when they were covering it.
12277747	12278547	I'm like, what?
12278827	12280348	I haven't seen a YouTube on that.
12280628	12281528	That sounds like fable.
12281829	12283409	That sounds like something fable would do.
12283730	12283950	Yeah.
12284710	12286971	Anyhow, no, I just... It was funny.
12287051	12292394	Anyway, but in the end, I'm not going to buy a game just because it has gay sex in it.
12292554	12294195	I want to buy a good game, so...
12295879	12298842	It looks like it might actually be... I'm hearing really good things on it.
12299143	12301145	It's a good game that has gay sex in it.
12302927	12303467	It's win-win.
12304528	12306430	Alright, Loki, any other last-minute stories for us?
12306630	12307612	No, not really.
12307652	12308573	Not anything I ever want to cover.
12310205	12314548	I got a text message from a buddy of mine that I guess would qualify as a last minute story who went and saw 2012.
12314848	12317730	Yet again, all these people going to see 2012.
12318030	12319251	I know, I don't get it either, Jamie.
12319371	12319931	I don't get it either.
12320371	12326795	But Prince of Persia movie trailer from Disney looks fantastic, even better than 2012 itself.
12326996	12328617	Full theater cheered for it.
12329710	12330751	That's stupid.
12331051	12333613	No one cheers for Prince of Persia.
12334494	12341139	I would cheer if they actually are making a decent video game-related movie, of which I hear Prince of Persia just might be.
12341159	12341879	It might be.
12343200	12346923	That just struck me as interesting, though, that the theater would cheer for a trailer.
12346943	12351667	You're right, you don't hear about that a lot when it's not Harry Potter or one of those.
12351687	12351727	So...
12353268	12354048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12374551	12375752	DarkSakura DarkSakura
12400603	12402305	Shopping around, shopping around.
12402805	12403746	What are you shopping for?
12404046	12405588	Just looking at stuff.
12406048	12406709	Porns!
12406889	12407729	Not porn.
12409111	12413134	Blue Elf 2, 309.1, jam a card.
12413355	12414996	He's trying to find you a BurgerTime, Rob.
12415256	12416037	No, it's not BurgerTime.
12416858	12421001	And my final thought for the night is, I do want a main cabinet, I think.
12421322	12422222	I think I want one.
12422543	12425966	I want to play Miss World New 96 at my own convenience, whatever.
12425986	12426066	Dude.
12427423	12429104	That would be the game I would play, too.
12429164	12429604	You know it.
12429644	12431924	That's going to be the first game I fire up on that thing.
12431944	12435706	The 309-in-1 card has Miss World New 96 on there.
12435806	12436526	Amazing.
12436786	12438587	I'm surprised it's even included on there.
12438627	12439047	What is that?
12439067	12442068	Is that a... It's a card... Is that a super gun?
12442488	12442968	No, no, no.
12442988	12443708	It's not a super gun.
12443768	12447169	I was thinking about building a super gun out of it or building a bar top out of it.
12447890	12453552	It's basically a JAMA card that has four gigs worth of games on there.
12455072	12465242	including all the fighting games and all the beat-em-ups and stuff like that, but for some reason they also have Miss Nude World 96 on there, and I'm not sure why, but... Everybody, move your body!
12465562	12468165	I'm just like, oh, Rob would like that, but, you know.
12469082	12469362	All right.
12469442	12470122	Anyhow, that's it.
12470142	12471983	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
12472023	12480027	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show even when we are not always punctual with either the podcast or just being here because we get sick or what have you.
12480327	12482027	But we do appreciate the support of our fans.
12482448	12484809	I was actually checking out the listener accounts tonight.
12484829	12489270	We actually had a lot of people listening earlier on in the first hour before people start to go to bed and so forth.
12489311	12492672	So thank you guys so much for that and for your continued support of our show.
12493012	12493813	We really appreciate it.
12493833	12495634	We'll continue to be here for you guys and be free.
12495954	12499837	All we always ask is just tell somebody you know about the show.
12500137	12501017	Help spread the word.
12501097	12501718	It's word of mouth.
12501858	12503679	That's what helps an independent podcast survive.
12503979	12509923	We don't have marketing dollars or advertisements in magazines or billboards or any of that fun stuff or E3 booths.
12510304	12517388	So please, please continue to tell friends and spread the word about not only what we're doing here on Orange Lounge Radio but what the All Games Network is doing.
12517608	12522832	Because if you hate our show, you might like one of the other ones on the network might be talking about the games that you're interested in hearing.
12523413	12540992	it's a win-win situation though continuing to grow independent podcasting because we tell it like it is so we'll be back to do it all again next week barring any outbreaks of malaria or something here in studio so we'll see you guys next week until then I'm Rob she's Jamie he's Loki and we're out
