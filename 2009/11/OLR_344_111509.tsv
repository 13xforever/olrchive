7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.
14000	19000	Tonight, November 15th, 2009. Has GameStop decided to start ignoring street dates?
19000	22000	Is Facebook integration coming for the PS3?
22000	27000	And Final Fantasy 13 finally gets a release date in the U.S. and U.K.
27000	31000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange, Lounge, Radio.
36000	39000	Now with 75% less sickness.
39000	45000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you for the next three hours with my awesome co-hosts always here with me.
50000	53000	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53000	55000	Hi!
55000	56000	Hack, hack, cough, wheeze.
56000	57000	Not really.
57000	61000	Actually, you're feeling much better this week than those that heard the show a couple weeks ago.
61000	64000	Which we'll get into because the story is actually kind of funny.
64000	67000	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
67000	73000	But first, I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
73000	74000	Hello.
74000	78000	How are you doing? Techmaster Loki, who has to learn how to turn his mic off before we start the show.
78000	81000	I had the mic off earlier because I don't know why. I just turned it off.
81000	86000	No, I know. It's usually good practice if you're going to sit there and type on the keyboard or whatever to turn the mic off.
86000	95000	We're not that fancy. I know a lot of people probably envision us in some studio where we have those big microphones on stands and all that stuff.
95000	101000	I don't know if you've ever listened to Understation Live on Saturdays on All Games Radio where we tape our show, but they're on Saturday nights.
101000	103000	Travis had that whole setup in his house.
103000	108000	I don't know what Bobby has in his house, and he does, of course, the show before us, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf on All Games.
108000	110000	I don't know if he has the whole thing.
110000	124000	We have wired mics that just plug into this mixing board very crudely that Sherby the cat has to walk through like she's Catherine Zeta-Jones in entrapment to get through the cords.
124000	127000	She seriously looks up at me and goes, meh.
127000	128000	Meow.
128000	129000	You've seen her do it.
129000	130000	I have. I have.
130000	132000	She's made the noise of, help me mommy. Help me.
132000	140000	So it's literally just cords everywhere in this spare bedroom of sorts in Dark Sakura's house, which is just kind of the work room, I guess you could call it.
140000	141000	One has been taken care of.
141000	142000	Yes.
142000	144000	I went out to the dollar store and bought Velcro ties.
144000	151000	Even when you use the zippy ties thing, it's not going to get that clean. I mean, it's going to get more orderly.
151000	154000	It'll keep us from tripping over half of them.
154000	158000	It won't feel like whenever we're starting the show we're unpacking Christmas lights, because you know how that goes.
158000	164000	Even when you pack the Christmas lights away nice and neat, you'll pull them out in one big blob that looks like a triple that lights up.
164000	166000	Just because gremlins live in those little boxes.
166000	167000	Apparently. Clearly.
167000	169000	And Bobby is in our chat room, of course. Hi, Bobby.
169000	174000	And he says, I have the same setup that you saw I had at PAX, same mics.
174000	178000	And so I think he had the kind that actually sit there on the table.
178000	184000	Like if you remember like watching the old Howard Cosell sports show where they have the big mics sitting on the table or what have you.
184000	185000	Those are great.
185000	186000	Yeah, those are fun.
186000	187000	We don't have those.
187000	188000	We actually hold on the mics.
188000	191000	It's a wild world of games.
191000	192000	Good times.
192000	195000	All right. Anyhow, and if you want to join us in our chat room, please join us.
195000	197000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
197000	199000	And yeah, I see some folks in chat.
199000	200000	Go to Best Buy.
200000	201000	Go to Newegg.
201000	202000	Buy some stuff.
202000	207000	Dude, we've been doing this ghetto style for seven years, and it's one of those things where if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
207000	208000	If it ain't fixed, don't break it.
208000	209000	Exactly.
209000	218000	Anyhow, so why we weren't here last week, which is funny because I had promised a couple weeks ago on the show that we weren't going to miss any more shows in 2009.
218000	224000	Which is also funny because you haven't heard like the last month worth of podcasts, and it all ties into the same reason.
224000	227000	Well, also, you know, it's because Rob had diphtheria and I had malaria.
227000	229000	No, but it's close.
229000	230000	It's close.
230000	231000	Here's the deal.
231000	239000	If you were here live a couple weeks ago, and you will hear this on the podcast eventually, we're going to have a big dump this week like we had last month where we'll get all the shows up.
239000	244000	But if you were here with us live a couple weeks ago, Dark Sakura was very ill during the show.
244000	250000	And we kind of all chalked that up to, well, she has the plague again, which she always seems to get once a year, or a sinus infection.
250000	252000	My annual sinus infection.
252000	254000	And I'd kicked up all that dust earlier.
254000	257000	Yeah, and so we figured, okay, Jamie is just, you know, the sick girl.
257000	260000	Everybody went to high school with one.
260000	264000	There was that girl who just seemed to get sick all the time, just no matter what.
264000	271000	My sinus infection is literally an annual thing, and it's always right in the start of November I start getting sick.
271000	272000	We love you, Jamie, but you're the sick girl.
272000	274000	You're the cootie girl.
274000	275000	All right.
275000	276000	Yeah, well, here's some cooties.
276000	277000	Shove, shove.
277000	284000	Well, funny enough, so we do the show Sunday, and come Monday, I'm starting to feel a little sick.
284000	287000	Tuesday that week, I start to get really sick.
287000	291000	My first thought wasn't that I caught something from Jamie, because, again, she's cootie girl.
291000	295000	I never get things from her, because, you know, I actually get cooties from cootie girl.
295000	300000	I instead thought I got something at Rocky Horror on Halloween, because, you know, all those people.
300000	304000	I was running around in Rocky Horror attire, which, if you've been before, isn't much.
304000	307000	And, you know, I figured I caught just the flu or something.
307000	311000	Actually, my first thought was strep throat, because my throat was very sore.
311000	317000	So, I go to the doctor on Tuesday, and she says, oh, what's wrong?
317000	318000	And I'm like, I don't know.
318000	320000	I'm just really sick.
320000	323000	I want to just make sure I don't have H1N1 or something crazy like that.
323000	325000	She's all, oh, my dear.
325000	328000	Because, you know, she's an old Filipino lady, so she always says my dear and honey and all this.
328000	330000	Oh, my dear, open your mouth.
330000	332000	Oh, you have a very red mouth.
332000	335000	Oh, I think you have laryngitis, but you do not have H1N1, my dear.
335000	337000	Do you want me to give you the test anyway, my dear?
337000	340000	And I said, yeah, just for peace of mind, give you the H1N1 test.
340000	345000	So, they shoved the Q-tip up my nose and all that fun stuff, and yeah, it still hurts.
345000	347000	But, no, it wasn't that bad.
347000	351000	So, I did all that, and I'm thinking, okay, whatever, I have laryngitis.
351000	355000	And she says, if I'm still sick on Thursday, call her, and she'll give me an antibiotic.
355000	357000	I'm still sick on Thursday.
357000	358000	I've missed two days of work at this point.
358000	362000	So, I get an antibiotic, and Thursday night was really the worst of it.
362000	364000	That was the night where I lied down, and I thought, oh, my God.
364000	368000	I, like, literally, I saw the light.
368000	373000	Like, when I closed my eyes and was lying there on the couch in my Snuggie
373000	376000	with my Star Trek Next Generation movies playing on Blu-ray,
376000	377000	because that's what I did when I was sick,
377000	381000	because I watched every single Star Trek Next Generation movie on Blu-ray in my Snuggie.
381000	384000	I literally shut my eyes, and I started to see the light.
384000	386000	And I'm just lying there going, this is awful.
386000	387000	This is horrible.
387000	388000	Whatever I have.
388000	392000	But, finally, it started to go away, and I'm thinking, oh, antibiotics got rid of what I had.
392000	394000	I must have had a strep throat.
394000	397000	That seems to be the most, you know, obvious thing that I have.
397000	401000	So, finally, Saturday goes, Sunday goes.
401000	404000	Monday, I go to work, because I'm thinking, I miss four days of work.
404000	405000	That's a lot of work.
405000	408000	For somebody who's a trainer, for somebody with, you know, I have a very high work ethic.
408000	409000	I don't like to miss work.
409000	411000	So, I go to work Monday morning.
411000	414000	My doctor calls me four times while I'm trying to teach class,
414000	419000	and I'm like, I have to, like, chase them down to get them to call me.
419000	421000	Why are they calling me four times?
421000	422000	I call.
422000	423000	Hello, my dear.
423000	426000	Oh, my dear, you have H1N1.
426000	428000	Your test came back positive.
428000	430000	And I'm thinking, what?
430000	434000	Here I am back at work sick, and I had H1N1 this whole time, and I didn't even know it.
434000	438000	So, it turns out that H1N1 test that she didn't even think I needed came back positive.
438000	443000	And I think part of, you know, and no disrespect to my doctor, I didn't have a fever when I went in there.
443000	446000	So, but apparently I had H1N1.
446000	448000	Prisby asks if your doctor is Miss Cleo.
448000	449000	Yes, actually, she does.
449000	451000	She apparently sounds a lot like Miss Cleo.
451000	455000	I don't know how old Filipino lady sounds like Miss Cleo, but just work with me on this.
455000	457000	Well, next up Rob calls me.
457000	461000	Yeah, one of the first people I call is Jamie, because I start to piece it together in my head.
461000	463000	I'm like, how the fuck did I get the swine flu?
463000	465000	Nobody else at Rocky is saying anything about it.
465000	470000	Nobody else seems to be saying, and I'm thinking, oh, my God, Jamie has these sinuses.
470000	471000	Jamie gave me the swine flu.
471000	472000	And, like, I knew it in my mind.
472000	474000	I'm like, Jamie's the one that gave me the swine flu.
474000	478000	And then I'm also thinking, oh, my God, Matt has a swine flu, too, and he doesn't know it.
478000	480000	So, like, the first people I contact.
480000	483000	Yeah, I'm so swine fluid out right now, I can't tell.
483000	485000	They drown my sorrows in chicken.
485000	488000	So, Matt, were you sick at all the past couple weeks?
488000	495000	My throat was kind of scratchy for about five days, but kind of scratchy as in, hey, that kind of feels scratchy,
495000	497000	and I get distracted by something else and don't notice it.
497000	500000	That's really, though, how it starts, is it starts in the throat.
500000	502000	Yeah, it was that same with me.
502000	507000	So, somehow, Matt, with his Cylon genes or something, was able to avoid the swine flu.
507000	511000	I'm still saying it's because he eats enough meat that it gives him an immunity.
511000	514000	But I eat enough swine, see?
514000	522000	Well, I actually ended up calling my doctor, and, well, I talked to the advice nurse at Kaiser.
522000	525000	She was like, oh, no, you're coming in, you're coming in.
525000	530000	So, I finally actually talked to my doctor, and we go over all of the symptoms,
530000	536000	because he had actually seen me a week before for my sprained ankle, which still, by the way, hurts like a bitch.
536000	546000	And he's like, well, you had all of these symptoms, you had that with your throat, you started off with a dry cough.
546000	550000	He's like, that's not how your sinus infections tend to go.
550000	556000	And a lot of times now, they know by the symptoms, because they're pretty standard.
556000	561000	And I ran a fever for me. I actually got up to 100, but that's high for me.
561000	563000	But I kept running a fever after the fact.
563000	575000	And the whole big thing for me, what my plague usually is, is if I don't treat a sinus infection or anything sinus-related right away, I will always get bronchitis.
575000	581000	And the last time that it got really bad, I got pneumonia, and I was sick for three months.
581000	588000	And it was a nightmare, but now he put me on like a week of antibiotics to make sure that I don't get pneumonia.
588000	592000	Well, the interesting thing is, my doctor's approach was very different than yours.
592000	595000	He put me on Tamiflu, which, a little late for that, right, but whatever.
595000	599000	And I got pulled out of work for a week. My doctor ordered me out.
599000	600000	I was already over it.
600000	601000	So was I.
601000	604000	Yeah, but I was already two weeks over it, is the whole thing.
604000	609000	And I don't know. And I think a big part of it, too, because you kind of talk about that as a soul.
609000	612000	And we will get to talking about video games, but I think this story is hilarious.
612000	614000	I was hoping I'd get pulled out of work a second ago.
614000	615000	Dan was sick.
615000	616000	Stay home.
616000	617000	Two weeks before me, Dan was sick.
617000	618000	He might have had a tooth, I don't know.
618000	623000	I was like, you don't catch a sinus infection from somebody. They're not contagious.
623000	626000	So maybe Dan started this whole thing. I don't know.
626000	627000	I find him.
627000	631000	But I got pulled out of work for a week, and I was pissed when it happened, because I'm thinking like,
631000	634000	I'm going to miss nine days of work when I'm trying to teach a class, right?
634000	636000	And I'm like, what's the point? I'm already over it.
636000	640000	But the point is, it's very dangerous to develop something secondary.
640000	643000	So pulling me out of work for a week wasn't so much for my coworker's benefit,
643000	645000	as it was my own benefit to not catch anything else.
645000	648000	Because you might remember, if you've been listening to the show a long time,
648000	652000	it's kind of weird that we're talking about swine flu so nonchalantly,
652000	656000	because it did take the life of a good friend of mine back in June.
656000	659000	And I miss her dearly. I wish she was still here.
659000	660000	But back then, we didn't know.
660000	663000	I mean, even just in June, it's funny, we say back then, it was just a few months ago,
663000	664000	we didn't know as much about the swine flu.
664000	667000	But I think what got her is that she had two things going on.
667000	670000	She had pneumonia and swine flu and ultimately passed away from it.
670000	672000	So that's where the swine flu is dangerous.
672000	675000	You talked to the doctor early enough, did she?
675000	678000	I don't think so, no. She didn't have insurance.
678000	683000	Yeah, I think you mentioned that she eventually was pulled to the doctor to go.
683000	687000	But yeah, I mean, that's why my grandmom started having the same symptoms.
687000	688000	I talked to her on Wednesday.
688000	692000	And I was like, you go to the doctor tomorrow. You go tomorrow.
692000	694000	And as far as I know, she's okay.
694000	696000	And let me read this from chat here.
696000	699000	DangerSkewInChat says, H1N1 is the most overrated disease ever.
699000	701000	And this is from chat.orangelsonserato.com.
701000	702000	Yes and no.
702000	706000	Like, you know, I didn't realize I had it until it was gone.
706000	707000	And I think that's saying a lot.
707000	708000	And neither did Jamie.
708000	710000	You know, I honestly thought I had strep throat.
710000	711000	I thought I had a sinus infection.
711000	714000	But where you'd still need to see a doctor if you have these symptoms.
714000	717000	Just because it's overrated doesn't mean you don't want to take it seriously.
717000	721000	Because again, these secondary infections are what's extremely dangerous.
721000	724000	It's not the H1N1 itself that's bad.
724000	726000	It's the fact that it breaks your body down.
726000	728000	And if you catch something else, that's really bad.
728000	729000	Like the feline aids.
729000	736000	Well, it's like, for lack of a better description, that actually is kind of, you know, the problem that you run into with any kind of immunodeficiency.
736000	738000	Mentioning aids, I was just saying that.
738000	741000	The number one killer of people with aids is pneumonia.
741000	743000	And I actually described it.
743000	744000	I was trying to describe it to somebody.
744000	746000	I said, it's kind of like having 24-hour aids.
746000	749000	You know, you don't want to catch something secondary in that window.
749000	752000	And I don't mean to speak so nonchalantly about something serious.
752000	756000	But if I could explain how H1N1 is dangerous, that's why.
756000	765000	Well, the same thing is like why I always have to be careful with my sinus infections is that all of the drainage is going to carry bacteria down.
765000	767000	And that gets in your lungs.
767000	771000	You need to make sure that, you know, you're not going to get an infection in your lungs.
771000	781000	It's just, that's really, it's, yeah, it's just like we were saying, it's like the flu opens the door for the pneumonia to come in.
781000	782000	Right.
782000	785000	So to kind of wrap this all up, because we've been talking about this for a while here.
785000	786000	And I know folks want us to get to the games.
786000	789000	Okay, pneumonia is H1N1's mother-in-law.
789000	791000	You just don't want her to come visit.
791000	792000	I don't know.
792000	796000	No, but to wrap it all up, you know, again, the moral of the story, you know, I'm fine.
796000	797000	Dark soccer is fine.
797000	800000	If you get H1N1, you'll probably be fine too.
800000	801000	You probably won't even know you had it.
801000	804000	But please see a doctor.
804000	806000	Go to urgent care.
806000	809000	Or not necessarily the ER, because ERs are really bombarded.
809000	810000	They're very expensive.
810000	813000	Keep in mind there's a lot of urgent care clinics that can do the same thing a lot cheaper.
813000	816000	A lot of free clinics as well if you don't have insurance at all.
816000	818000	Just see a doctor.
818000	819000	Get treatment.
819000	824000	Get on some type of medication that will build up your immunity so that way you don't catch something secondary.
824000	826000	So is it that bad?
826000	827000	No.
827000	828000	But should you take it seriously?
828000	829000	Absolutely.
829000	831000	So that's kind of the moral of the story.
831000	833000	Now that we've talked about our sickness and why we've been gone.
833000	836000	And by the way, you know, because again, this kept Jamie down for two weeks.
836000	838000	This kept me out for two weeks.
838000	840000	This is why things have fallen behind with the feed.
840000	841000	And I still have a cough.
841000	842000	Yeah, I still have a cough too.
842000	845000	Like now it's I think officially three and a half weeks later.
845000	857000	I'm still having the same type of, you know, that same cough that I had when I was developing that bronchitis back then.
857000	858000	So I still have to be careful.
858000	860000	I'm living on Ricola.
860000	861000	A steady diet of Ricola.
861000	863000	And apparently Chinese food.
863000	864000	Good times.
864000	865000	All right.
865000	867000	Anyhow, enough about flu chat.
867000	873000	Let's get into actually our gaming weeks as we usually like to start the show off with talking about the games we've been playing.
873000	878000	Funny enough, you think with nine days out of work, I'd played a lot more video games.
878000	879000	But that's kind of not the case.
879000	881000	I don't know if that's true for you too, DarkSakura.
881000	883000	But what kind of games have you been playing for the past couple of weeks?
883000	890000	Well, I did something bad, Rob.
890000	891000	What did you do?
891000	892000	I've been a bad girl.
892000	894000	Have you been very naughty?
894000	895000	I've been naughty.
895000	896000	Do you need to be punished?
896000	898000	I need to be spanked.
898000	900000	Oh, this sounds like a raffle.
900000	902000	Spanking! Spanking!
902000	904000	Spank DarkSakura for a dollar.
904000	906000	It could be like a charity fundraiser.
906000	908000	I signed back up for World of Warcraft.
908000	910000	Oh, you've been very naughty indeed.
910000	914000	Which I am, again, far from addicted.
914000	921000	I have played once with Marin since I renewed my account.
921000	923000	And then twice by myself.
923000	926000	I have hit a milestone.
926000	929000	I now have a character that is past level 10.
929000	931000	Congratulations!
931000	933000	I have level 15!
933000	935000	Draw nine age.
935000	938000	Welcome to the world of talent points.
938000	939000	We hope you like it here.
939000	940000	See, that's how it starts.
940000	943000	First you do it with a friend, and then you start doing it by yourself.
943000	944000	Next thing you know, you just can't stop.
944000	945000	Next thing you know, you're playing EverQuest.
945000	947000	Are you talking about Warcraft, or are you talking about...
947000	949000	Never mind.
949000	950000	Alcohol.
950000	951000	It's alcohol.
951000	953000	Ooh, alcohol.
953000	955000	Well.
955000	959000	And I'm actually making some Sims characters right now.
959000	960000	What finally brought you back to WoW?
960000	964000	What made you decide, okay, time for me to take the plunge and actually play a character this time,
964000	967000	as opposed to just slash dancing in Brill?
967000	968000	Sauce did.
968000	969000	Gotcha.
969000	973000	You know, just because I had such a good time playing with her during the trial that I decided to come back,
973000	978000	and I didn't like some of the stuff Activision did, but I liked some of the stuff, you know?
978000	982000	So I gave it a go, and I had a pretty fun time, and you should have heard me the other day
982000	986000	complaining about doing that one Draw Night quest where you ride on the back of the wildebeest or whatever it is.
986000	988000	And I'm like, I got a wildebeest!
988000	991000	I was like, hi, on Nyquil.
991000	995000	And Dan's in the other room, and I'm going, I've got a wildebeest!
995000	998000	And he comes in and goes, so you do.
998000	1003000	And then I was like, taking screen captures of my, uh, of my griffin.
1003000	1007000	Because I was doing, oh, we're going back and forth on a griffin, and I'm paying for it.
1007000	1013000	It was just, I was just being a goof, an utter goof playing, but it was pretty fun.
1013000	1015000	I like playing by myself.
1015000	1017000	It's, it's, you, why do we play games?
1017000	1023000	To have fun, and whatever that is for you, and especially in a very broad game like World of Warcraft or any MMO,
1023000	1027000	whatever, if that's taking screenshots, if that's slash dancing, if that's role playing,
1027000	1031000	whatever it is, you know, it might not be just grinding to 80 as fast as you can.
1031000	1035000	It might be, you know, a variety of other things that make it fun, so, you know, more power to you.
1035000	1040000	Alright, I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you about that, but maybe I'll think of it later.
1040000	1043000	So, if DarkSakura's done with her gaming week, then I'll move on to Loki.
1043000	1044000	How was your gaming week?
1044000	1046000	My gaming week was okay.
1046000	1048000	I didn't play a whole lot, though.
1048000	1050000	And actually, the last two weeks I haven't played a lot.
1050000	1053000	I've been just working on the main cabinet and getting that working.
1053000	1058000	Mainly choosing a front end, because I was originally going to start with Hyper Spin,
1058000	1064000	which is really flashy and looks awesome, but the problem is you have to make a theme for every single game.
1064000	1069000	And I downloaded every single game that's out there for MAME right now.
1069000	1076000	So, I would take forever to get skins for everything or make skins from scratch.
1076000	1078000	It's just way too much damn work.
1078000	1084000	I may end up going back to that, though, because I think you can actually put different settings for each game you launch in Hyper Spin.
1084000	1088000	Plus, it's a lot more flexible in what you can run in it.
1088000	1093000	But right now, I currently have Maximus Arcade on my system.
1093000	1096000	And I've been kind of working with that a little bit.
1096000	1102000	Their configuration that they had for launching games and using the menu right now is really jacked up,
1102000	1108000	compared to what the keyboard encoder that I have for my arcade controls is.
1108000	1109000	So, it didn't make any sense.
1109000	1114000	I'd have to drop a coin in my cabinet to launch a game, which is annoying.
1114000	1121000	So, I fixed all that stuff, and after all that's said and done, I still haven't gotten to play a game on it yet.
1121000	1124000	But hey, it works good, and I actually worked on a lot of stuff.
1124000	1128000	I wired it up for stereo audio, which is pretty sweet.
1128000	1135000	Loki, you strike me as one of those guys that doesn't necessarily do things to actually play them,
1135000	1137000	but you do things because you can.
1137000	1143000	It's one of those things where it's like, well, I built this whole arcade cabinet, and I have a thousand games on it.
1143000	1148000	I haven't really played any of them, but I could if I wanted to, and that's the point.
1148000	1155000	Well, it's a lot because I didn't know what games I wanted, so I said, okay, what the hell, I'm just going to download everything.
1155000	1162000	So, I did. I downloaded everything, including clones of games, multiple ROM dumps for each game.
1162000	1163000	Ms. World Nude 96?
1163000	1165000	Oh, yeah, that's on there, of course.
1165000	1167000	All the porno games.
1167000	1168000	I'm coming over!
1168000	1174000	I'm telling you, every game that's out there is on there, including like 50,000 Mahjong games I need to get rid of.
1174000	1179000	So, I just have to go and sort through everything, which is what really takes the time.
1179000	1192000	And then, the other thing, too, is because my cabinet has a dual sync monitor, so I can run games at the low resolution, 15 kilohertz,
1192000	1199000	which is what most arcade games are, like all their old school ones, or medium resolution for some of the newer games.
1199000	1204000	The problem is, if you run it at the medium resolution, your newer games look nice,
1204000	1209000	but your older games aren't quite as sharp because it's not running at the native resolution anymore.
1209000	1215000	So, it's a debate whether I want to make it look nice for most of my games or just some of my games.
1215000	1221000	I'm pretty much just going to leave it alone right now because I get to the Switch to actually flip it to that medium resolution.
1221000	1224000	I have to take stuff apart and I don't want to do that.
1224000	1226000	So, anyways, enough of the cabinet stuff.
1226000	1230000	Can I just say real quick on a related note, because I'm looking at our chat room,
1230000	1234000	Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby, who does the show before us on All Games Radio,
1234000	1238000	www.allgames.com, live on Sunday nights, says,
1238000	1244000	You describe me. I have a ton of consoles hooked up to my TV. Do I often play them? No, but I could if I wanted to.
1244000	1247000	That sounds very Jamie as well.
1247000	1248000	Because mine are not hooked up.
1248000	1250000	But you could.
1250000	1254000	Well, we do have the pile of Sega hooked up in the vault.
1254000	1258000	And how often do you go in there and say, You know what? Today I want to play.
1258000	1261000	I don't know. I'm just feeling very afterburner today.
1261000	1263000	I just, I want to play after. Do you do that?
1263000	1264000	We do that shit.
1264000	1265000	Do you really?
1265000	1272000	We do. But sometimes we also break out the PC Engine and play some cue cards.
1272000	1278000	But like in the front room, we just had, well, we loaned our Wii to Dan's mom for some reason.
1278000	1285000	But we have the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 hooked up out in the front, and really the Playstation 3, since it's a piece of shit,
1285000	1290000	just collects dust and we do nothing but play our Xbox 360.
1290000	1294000	Ironically, I'm in the complete opposite boat right now. I still haven't replaced my Xbox 360 three months now.
1294000	1296000	Haven't needed to.
1296000	1300000	Been doing everything on the PS3. I'm like in the complete opposite boat you are, but okay.
1300000	1304000	Well, yeah, except Rob, we have a choice.
1304000	1306000	Oh, snap. You got me there.
1306000	1308000	What am I going to do?
1308000	1309000	Speaking of that...
1309000	1311000	No, well, technically our PS3 is our Blu-ray player.
1311000	1315000	I have a choice too. I can play the Wii if I want to, like, you know, which I did play.
1315000	1317000	Well, I'll get to my game in a little bit. Sorry. I don't want to interrupt.
1317000	1319000	No, no, no. That's all right. Sorry.
1319000	1321000	Speaking of which, it's funny that you mentioned that.
1321000	1326000	I had finally, you know, after all these rounds of consoles being banned and stuff, I had one of my consoles banned.
1326000	1332000	Thankfully, and this is the best part because it works out perfectly, right now we have three consoles,
1332000	1338000	because I had my sister's console, which, you know, I basically swapped her the banned console,
1338000	1341000	because she doesn't play online, so she doesn't give a shit. She just wants a console that's modded.
1341000	1344000	And it works just fine. It just can't go on live anymore.
1344000	1347000	So, hey, problem solved there. So I have her broken console.
1347000	1349000	I have another console that's starting to go.
1349000	1352000	And I have a friend's console that they brought in.
1352000	1355000	I don't know if he's given it to me or what, but it's kind of broken.
1355000	1359000	So I have three consoles that need to be fixed, which I'm planning on doing soon.
1359000	1364000	I have a console coming from New Zealand, actually, that's a Japanese region console that's also modded,
1364000	1368000	so I can actually play some of the Japanese region games.
1368000	1374000	And then I have the four consoles that work right now that we're playing on.
1374000	1380000	But the ironic part was, the console that got banned is the console that we don't really play modded games on.
1380000	1384000	We've played, like, one modded game on that, and that's the one that gets banned.
1384000	1390000	It's fine, which is seeing all sorts of, like, it is dirty.
1390000	1394000	Dirty, naughty machine. Filthy Xbox.
1394000	1400000	You know, and the one that my boss plays on, which was my old modded console that died once and came back,
1400000	1406000	and it's completely just seeing all sorts of burns and you name it, whatever.
1406000	1408000	Those consoles are fine. Nothing wrong with those.
1408000	1412000	But sure, the one that played it one time, it's gone.
1412000	1416000	It's funny, though, because they don't ban your live account. They only ban your console.
1416000	1421000	So, since I have so many damn spare consoles, it's just like, oh, well, that's an inconvenience.
1421000	1424000	Switch. That's it.
1424000	1429000	I love that you talk so nonchalantly. Like, here I am talking about, I'm too lazy to get my Xbox replaced.
1429000	1431000	I haven't really done it for three months.
1431000	1437000	And you're sitting here talking about, oh, I just got six Xbox 360s just kind of sitting in a stack in the corner.
1437000	1440000	Ah, fuck me, one got banned. Let's put a new one.
1440000	1446000	And I understand now, I mean, they're banning consoles because they don't want you to play games.
1446000	1449000	I thought they were going to ban your live account or whatever.
1449000	1451000	Can I throw this question to you from chat real quick?
1451000	1454000	Lumi's in our chat room, chat.orangishonsider.com.
1454000	1456000	Does Loki think Microsoft is right by banning consoles?
1456000	1458000	Well, they have the right to do it, yeah.
1458000	1462000	I think as far as banning you off live, I don't understand why they would do that.
1462000	1467000	I mean, I guess I understand the cheating part and stuff like that, but if you think about it,
1467000	1471000	if they ban you off live, that's revenue that they're cutting off basically for themselves.
1471000	1475000	Also, because you can't really get achievements or anything,
1475000	1480000	what's to really motivate you from trying to get your, I mean,
1480000	1484000	because now there's no fear of you getting banned off live because you're already banned off live.
1484000	1488000	So burn whatever the fuck you want now and play it on the console without consequence.
1488000	1490000	That's really kind of the thing right now.
1490000	1492000	So I don't understand why they would do that.
1492000	1496000	I wish there should have been another way they could penalize somebody, but whatever.
1496000	1498000	I mean, I guess if you want to play on live, it's not that bad.
1498000	1501000	They're not banning your account, I guess.
1501000	1502000	It could be worse.
1502000	1505000	Really, the only thing that happens when your console gets banned,
1505000	1510000	you can't connect to live and you can't install games onto your hard drive.
1510000	1513000	I don't understand that second part, why you can't install games onto your hard drive,
1513000	1515000	throw on them faster, whatever.
1515000	1517000	Fine. That's fine.
1517000	1520000	For example, my sister, she doesn't give a shit.
1520000	1523000	She doesn't know how to do that.
1523000	1524000	She doesn't care.
1524000	1527000	She just likes playing my crazy Grand Theft Auto that's modded
1527000	1530000	because she likes punchy people 50 blocks away.
1530000	1531000	And who doesn't?
1531000	1533000	And who doesn't? Yeah, exactly.
1533000	1538000	So, I don't know. It's just an inconvenience, I guess.
1538000	1539000	But yeah, I understand why they're...
1539000	1542000	An inconvenient banning, the new movie by Al Gore.
1542000	1545000	Well, we're actually, to be honest, we really modded the consoles,
1545000	1547000	not necessarily to play pirated games,
1547000	1551000	but we were really just playing modded copies of Grand Theft Auto.
1551000	1555000	And now we're playing, you know, all have episodes of Liberty City Discs,
1555000	1558000	all legit copies, and that's what we've been playing.
1558000	1560000	So that's why we're kind of surprised that, you know,
1560000	1563000	the one console's banned because we haven't played a burned game on...
1563000	1564000	Well, actually, I take that back.
1564000	1568000	We played one new burned copy of Grand Theft Auto on that one
1568000	1572000	because I found a new way to get around their mod patch or something like that.
1572000	1574000	So we tested it once and it didn't really work.
1574000	1577000	And so then we went back to just playing the normal disc.
1577000	1580000	And apparently that one time, though, they found out.
1580000	1582000	And so they decided to ban that console.
1582000	1586000	But it's just ironic because we've been playing normal copies of games
1586000	1589000	on all these consoles for the longest time now.
1589000	1591000	I mean, if anything, they should be generous to me
1591000	1594000	because I bought six copies of their damn game, you know?
1594000	1596000	But whatever.
1596000	1598000	So yeah, lots of Grand Theft Auto.
1598000	1600000	Still hate the multiplayer in Ballad of Gay Tony,
1600000	1602000	but I'm kind of warming up to it a little bit.
1602000	1604000	Still don't like how it's not very open world,
1604000	1607000	but I'm kicking so much ass in it except for the fact...
1607000	1610000	We got one guy that was ranked 10 the other day that was cheating.
1610000	1612000	Totally cheater because he's...
1612000	1615000	Two shots and all my health and armor is gone.
1615000	1619000	Whereas my pistol, eight shots to the head.
1619000	1622000	Then they finally died. Almost beat him too.
1622000	1624000	Sad. Cheater.
1624000	1628000	Usually they drop out and I talk so much trash to them.
1628000	1630000	Good times.
1630000	1633000	All right. Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1633000	1637000	Um...
1637000	1639000	That's really it.
1639000	1641000	I haven't really...
1641000	1646000	I'm still sitting on my copy of Borderlands I haven't even touched yet.
1646000	1648000	I'm just like, I need to play this tonight.
1648000	1649000	I need to play this tonight.
1649000	1651000	And I go home and I end up working on the arcade cabinet.
1651000	1655000	So at some point I'm going to play the damn game.
1655000	1658000	That's like me. I downloaded a demo for a game called Torchlight
1658000	1660000	a couple days ago.
1660000	1662000	And I keep saying I need to make time to play this game.
1662000	1664000	I need to make time to play this game.
1664000	1666000	And I still haven't gotten around to playing the damn game.
1666000	1669000	Just like I signed up for the beta for Battlefield...
1669000	1671000	Or was it Battlefield Bad Company 2?
1671000	1673000	I'm like, I'm not going to play this.
1673000	1675000	I'll take your key anyways.
1675000	1677000	Boy oh boy.
1677000	1680000	But again, this all goes back to, I'm not going to play it.
1680000	1682000	But if I wanted to, I could.
1682000	1684000	And that's what it all comes back to.
1684000	1686000	My gaming week.
1686000	1689000	Surprisingly enough, because I was so sick I didn't get to play a lot.
1689000	1691000	I did a lot of TV and movie watching.
1691000	1694000	But funny enough, I did get my Playstation 3 Netflix streaming disc.
1694000	1696000	So I got to play around with that a little bit.
1696000	1699000	And you know, it's pretty much the same stuff you're going to see on the Xbox version
1699000	1701000	without the party chat.
1701000	1704000	Which my Xbox was borked before I got to play with that feature anyway.
1704000	1706000	So I'm none the wiser.
1706000	1709000	So I'm cool with the PS3 disc.
1709000	1711000	I don't notice a huge quality difference.
1711000	1713000	It looks the same to me.
1713000	1716000	I guess some folks are noticing a lot more artifacting on the PS3.
1716000	1719000	I don't look at the stuff with as fine tooth and comb.
1719000	1722000	I'm just like, you know, can I play the damn show?
1722000	1724000	Does it look decent?
1724000	1727000	And stuff still comes in HD if it's available on Netflix.
1727000	1730000	Again, the biggest problem with Netflix streaming is it needs more stuff.
1730000	1734000	But when you consider that you're not really paying a premium at this time
1734000	1738000	on top of what you pay for your Netflix fee, it's not that bad.
1738000	1740000	I didn't pay a dime for the PS3 disc.
1740000	1743000	I just signed up for the little thing and they sent it to me within a couple days.
1743000	1746000	I didn't get it the very first day, but I signed up kind of late too.
1746000	1749000	I got it like maybe four days later.
1749000	1751000	So I think that's pretty cool.
1751000	1753000	A little perk to having Netflix.
1753000	1756000	Also, as far as new games go, one of the new games I played,
1756000	1760000	I was joking about the Wii earlier because Dark Soccer was saying that she had choice.
1760000	1763000	And I'm like, well, I still have choice between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
1763000	1767000	And funny enough, I did turn on the Wii to check out the Excitebike World Tour.
1767000	1768000	Is that the name?
1768000	1769000	Or Rally.
1769000	1771000	Excitebike World Rally.
1771000	1773000	Because I was pretty excited about this game.
1773000	1775000	I saw the trailer for it.
1775000	1776000	We did talk about it two weeks ago, right?
1776000	1778000	I can't remember if it was the show we couldn't do.
1778000	1780000	So we did talk about this game a little bit two weeks ago.
1780000	1781000	And I was really excited for it.
1781000	1784000	I downloaded it, played it for about ten minutes,
1784000	1786000	and then the magic just kind of wore off.
1786000	1790000	And I don't want to say it's a bad game, because it's not.
1790000	1792000	It is what it is.
1792000	1795000	It's a reimagining of the 8-bit Excitebike.
1795000	1799000	But to be honest, I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.
1799000	1802000	How many of you guys have done this?
1802000	1807000	These games, these 8-bit games, we used to spend so much time with back in the day.
1807000	1810000	And some of them you can still spend a lot of time with today.
1810000	1813000	But now, thanks to the wide world of emulation,
1813000	1816000	how many of you guys will just load up a cartridge on emulation,
1816000	1818000	play it for like three minutes, and be all,
1818000	1820000	I remember this game.
1820000	1822000	Alright, Thrill's done. Let's move on. Play something else.
1822000	1823000	Pretty much, yeah.
1823000	1826000	That's what I felt playing this Excitebike World Rally.
1826000	1828000	Yes, I realized there was online mode.
1828000	1831000	Yes, the game looks a heck of a lot better than it did back in the day.
1831000	1835000	You know, I am totally aware of all these improvements they made to the game.
1835000	1839000	But yet, when the game itself hasn't really felt like it's changed that much,
1839000	1844000	I was just kind of like, eh, I'm over it.
1844000	1847000	And that's my honest feedback on Excitebike.
1847000	1850000	I can't really tell you if it's a good game or a bad game,
1850000	1853000	because I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.
1853000	1856000	And that was my experience with Excitebike.
1856000	1858000	You make my soul hurt, Rob.
1858000	1859000	Why?
1859000	1860000	Just because.
1860000	1862000	I mean, you know what's funny?
1862000	1867000	We used to play Excitebike for hours when I was like ten or eleven years old.
1867000	1868000	We used to play this game.
1868000	1870000	I would spend hours making tracks.
1870000	1873000	Making the damn tracks and all this stuff.
1873000	1876000	And yet, when I played this new one, I was just kind of over it in ten minutes.
1876000	1881000	And maybe, to be fair, maybe part of that was because the same day I played this
1881000	1884000	was the same day I found out I had swine flu.
1884000	1887000	So I kind of had all of that on my mind at the same time.
1887000	1891000	So in the interest of full disclosure, maybe I just didn't play this game in the right mood.
1891000	1894000	And, you know, I think a lot of people can admit
1894000	1898000	maybe you've listened to a CD when you were in the wrong mood
1898000	1900000	and you hated it even though you thought it was great later.
1900000	1902000	Or you watched a movie that you thought sucked
1902000	1905000	just because you were in a bad mood when you watched it.
1905000	1907000	And I think maybe I'm giving this game a little bit of that.
1907000	1914000	So take my review, half-assed review, with a ginormous canister of salt, okay?
1914000	1915000	It is what it is.
1915000	1917000	But I'm just telling you, that's what I played and that's what I thought.
1917000	1920000	But full disclosure, I had all this other crap going on too.
1920000	1923000	So naturally, I played a lot of World of Warcraft as well.
1923000	1926000	One other game I did check out was a game called 30 Second Hero.
1926000	1929000	I downloaded this onto the PSP when I was sick because, you know,
1929000	1932000	when the doctor tells you not to go outside and give people your germs,
1932000	1935000	you're like, okay, but I'm bored, I need something to do.
1935000	1939000	I'll go onto PlayStation Store and see if there's an arcade game I want to download.
1939000	1942000	And then I realized, oh yeah, they have all these PSP games you can download now.
1942000	1943000	What do I want to play?
1943000	1947000	Ooh, I played the demo for Half Minute Hero a while ago and I really liked it.
1947000	1948000	Let me check out the full game.
1948000	1952000	So let me kind of try to summarize Half Minute Hero in a nutshell for you guys.
1952000	1956000	Yes, it's a game that you play in 30 second spurts, but it's a little bit of a lie.
1956000	1959000	Like, I don't want you to think this game is like WarioWare because it's very not.
1959000	1962000	It's just, imagine that you're playing a game like Final Fantasy.
1962000	1965000	No, Dragon Warrior, I think is a better comparison.
1965000	1970000	Imagine you're playing Dragon Warrior just, like, freaking on crack.
1970000	1972000	Like, it's just fast.
1972000	1976000	Like, the battles automatically play themselves so you don't have to sit there and go,
1976000	1980000	fight, fight, fight, item, potion, fight.
1980000	1981000	Like, you don't do any of that.
1981000	1987000	You just have battles that happened and you just kind of tear through them and it's just a fast, fast game.
1987000	1992000	That's kind of what Half Minute Hero is, is that, you know, you go and you run through the forest
1992000	1998000	or do whatever you do to the cave where the bad guy is, but in each level, it's episodic.
1998000	2002000	Like, the first level is very straightforward, but then later on, these little twists will come into play.
2002000	2004000	Like, oh, the forest is on fire.
2004000	2011000	So you have to get here and you have to get this item, but, you know, you have to do it all before the time runs out.
2011000	2017000	Now, one thing they don't really tell you about the game, there's a time goddess that you can visit that will reset the clock,
2017000	2021000	but it costs money exponentially every time you use her.
2021000	2027000	So it's really, it's a giant puzzle game that plays like Dragon Warrior
2027000	2034000	because really the gist of the game is how do I get from point A to B to C to D as quick as possible,
2034000	2038000	making this whole thing work, what's the solution, without running out of time.
2038000	2040000	And that's kind of what Half Minute Hero is.
2040000	2048000	And although I just overly simplified the game, I think what's selling a lot of people on this is like kind of the nod to 8-bit cliches
2048000	2051000	because seriously, some of the dialogue in the game made me laugh out loud
2051000	2055000	because the time goddess is like, I will reset time for money.
2055000	2056000	Why?
2056000	2064000	I don't know, I just like money hearts, you know, like these very cliche, over-the-top things that just made me laugh.
2064000	2067000	So that's why I kind of liked Half Minute Hero.
2067000	2068000	Did it give you lulz?
2068000	2075000	It gave me a lot of lulz and that, you know, I think the people that at least localized the game, if not developed it,
2075000	2079000	were kind of just in on the joke and knew what they were doing and I think it paid off.
2079000	2087000	It's a cute game. 30 bucks, kind of steep, but I think for a lot of people are still going to find it very rewarding.
2087000	2093000	I will say it's worth the plunge if you are into puzzles and RPGs because I think this game is really a mix of both.
2093000	2096000	I think this game can be better defined as a puzzler than an RPG.
2096000	2099000	It just happens to have a lot of RPG elements, so there you go.
2099000	2100000	You call it a PRPG.
2100000	2103000	It's a PRPG, yeah, a puzzle role-playing game, I like that.
2103000	2113000	And then lots and lots and lots and lots of wow. I brought back from the dead my 80 druid and brought it into another guild that a lot of my friends had transferred to.
2113000	2121000	And I also had my paladin, my Heladin I guess you could say is level 72 now.
2121000	2125000	So being sick, wow, bad combination.
2125000	2129000	Although honestly, when you're really sick you don't want to focus on games.
2129000	2143000	Games take thought and energy somewhat, whereas Netflix and Blu-rays, much more like I can just kind of watch it and just kind of fade in and out as I'm watching it.
2143000	2145000	And Project Runway of course.
2145000	2148000	Alright, anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.
2148000	2154000	I think if that does it for everybody's gaming week we can finally get into some gaming news here now that we've been on air for about 40 minutes.
2154000	2156000	No Rob, food. Food Rob.
2156000	2157000	You want to talk more food?
2157000	2158000	No.
2158000	2161000	I do kind of want some yogurt or something. I'm just fat.
2161000	2167000	Alright, anyhow, I do want to say real quick in the housekeeping department our podcast feed is disgustingly behind.
2167000	2170000	It's just sadly been a recurring theme this year.
2170000	2172000	Obviously I blame the flu for that.
2172000	2174000	We will get all caught up this week.
2174000	2178000	We'll have a big dump of episodes just as we had I think back in October when we had some of the same thing going on.
2178000	2182000	So we will get that all caught up for you guys that rely on the podcast feed.
2182000	2189000	And we apologize for that, but do keep in mind the number one priority is pulling off this live show every Sunday night when we can.
2189000	2193000	But of course we want to get the podcast out there because we know not everybody can join us on Sunday.
2193000	2194000	It's just sometimes we're a little slow.
2194000	2196000	So please bear with us.
2196000	2204000	It's a lot more work than you'd think to turn the live show into what you actually hear on the podcast.
2204000	2207000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news finally.
2207000	2208000	We're done with sickness.
2208000	2209000	We're done with food.
2209000	2210000	We're done with all that stuff.
2210000	2212000	Let's talk games.
2212000	2213000	Loki, start us off.
2213000	2214000	Yes.
2214000	2223000	Well, as you may remember, earlier this week we had one of the biggest game launches this year, probably for a while.
2223000	2225000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out.
2225000	2236000	And of course, being that it is a major game, there are going to be those out there who decided to break street dates and release the game early to try to be competitive, usually against GameStop.
2236000	2251000	Well, apparently some local shops in New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some parts of Ohio, were responsible for this and actually kind of from what I've seen all around the US.
2251000	2263000	But apparently in these areas in particular, what's interesting though is to combat this, GameStop on a corporate level has allowed their stores to break street date as well and release the game early.
2263000	2268000	What gets even more interesting is this isn't the only title that's happened to.
2268000	2274000	Apparently the same thing is happening now with the titles coming out next week, Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
2274000	2281000	Three GameStops in the New Jersey area, Jersey City, have been putting out Assassin's Creed 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
2281000	2294000	Also saying that it was a call from their corporate office saying go ahead and put it out because there are mom and pop shops nearby that are also putting it out.
2294000	2306000	To simply summarize this, it's a big ol' clusterfuck right now. It's a pain in the ass. Pain in my ass is really what it is.
2306000	2316000	I'm really, really curious. Okay, so the facts are we know some GameStops are bending the street dates to compete with mom and pop stores, or at least that's the claim.
2316000	2324000	It's not happening at every GameStop. It's happening, assumably, in areas where they're losing pre-orders to other stores who broke street date.
2324000	2332000	So first, let me ask you, because you work in retail and you said this is a giant pain in your ass, what's your perspective on all this?
2332000	2344000	Okay, well here's what happened with Call of Duty. First off, it was very clear what the street date was, and Activision has graciously street dated all of their titles during the fourth quarter,
2344000	2359000	which makes it very nice for distribution because we can get it to our stores that we supply, get it to them early enough so that they have a day one to be on an even playing field with GameStop.
2359000	2370000	Because GameStop, they're so massive, they get everything prior to street date because they're direct, and we do get stuff a lot of times on street date, but then we have to ship it to our customers and whatnot.
2370000	2378000	So everybody was under, they understood when the street dates were. The problem is though, there's some of these small stores that are like,
2378000	2390000	well, I don't know how I'm going to compete with GameStop. They're just so massive and I don't get all these perks and stuff that GameStop has. They don't even try. They're just plain like,
2390000	2397000	I don't know what to do to be competitive with them. So they decide that they're going to go ahead and put product out early to get a competitive edge.
2397000	2406000	The problem is though, they get caught, and the other problem is then these publishers don't just blame them.
2406000	2410000	Can I stop you for a minute? Out of curiosity, just because I don't know, how do they get caught?
2410000	2417000	They get caught because other stores around them, other mom and pop shops, especially ones that are playing by the rules, or GameStop in this case,
2417000	2427000	they go and get basically, and this would work also with movies, anybody that's breaking the street on a movie, they would go buy a copy of the game or whatever, get a receipt,
2427000	2441000	get some sort of evidence. For Modern Warfare 2, they actually had a tip line and they would call in and report it. Usually what happens is they will collect all these stores that were in violation of street dates.
2441000	2451000	They then go to all the distributors out there and go, okay, are these your customers? If they are, you need to take care of this, buy.
2451000	2462000	For Modern Warfare 2, here's the penalty. One, they would no longer be able to buy Modern Warfare 2 for the life of the title. If they're out of it, they're fucked.
2462000	2471000	It doesn't matter. They're not going to be able to buy any more copies of it. Also, any further Activision titles, they will no longer be able to get before street date.
2471000	2481000	Also, they're going to evaluate it, whereas any sub distributors out there, people that we basically sell to and then they turn and sell to other stores,
2481000	2492000	they would also be blacklisted from selling a title if they were caught selling it early or whatnot, or if these stores that they were servicing were selling early.
2492000	2494000	They would also be blacklisted.
2494000	2499000	Interesting, because I haven't heard this on any of the articles I'm reading, so it's kind of fascinating to hear this.
2499000	2512000	Especially with Modern Warfare 2, everybody's been kind of careful after Madden 10 this year, because Madden 10, a whole bunch of stores broke street on it, and EA got pissed.
2512000	2521000	They got really fucking pissed. First off, we're not going to street date any more titles to distribution, so fuck you guys.
2521000	2527000	Even though we had no customers that were actually breaking street, but they just decided to blanket everybody and do that.
2527000	2536000	Same thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum, and Warner decided, you know what, we're just going to do the same thing as EA, and we're just going to say fuck you guys, and we're not going to ship anything early anymore.
2536000	2546000	And then the other thing is, then they decide, okay, well we're going to maybe allow you to do that, but you're going to have to get written signed agreements from all your customers.
2546000	2550000	They're going to be street dated, and we're going to have to ship it two separate shipments. It's just a pain in the ass.
2550000	2563000	Activision now, they weren't too happy about this whole thing. They obviously did not authorize GameStop to do this, but GameStop being as big as they are, they can pretty much do this and go, well what are you going to do about it?
2563000	2570000	And Activision's just going to go, well, we can't do anything because they're our largest customer, we can't piss them off. Really, they can do whatever they want.
2570000	2582000	And then of course, EA and Ubisoft were watching the street dates closely for Left 4 Dead 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 because of this whole thing that happened with Modern Warfare 2.
2582000	2586000	They wanted to make sure that no one was violating street dates on their titles.
2586000	2602000	So anyways, kind of go back around again. So these stores think that they're going to get competitive advantage against everybody else, and not necessarily GameStop, but MomPops, whomever. I hate to blame just MomPops shops for violating street because they're not the only ones that do it.
2602000	2616000	I mean, 7-Eleven does it. There's all sorts of people that do it. And GameStop did it. And the thing is, it's always just a few people that just don't give a shit that ruin it for everybody.
2616000	2624000	And it's these same stores, time and time again, they're violating street date on everything. Madden, for example, they know who... I mean, these people...
2624000	2635000	If I could especially see that with 7-Eleven, because you know 7-Elevens are notorious for being independently owned by folks, and probably a lot of them don't even want to be selling games.
2635000	2640000	And so they probably are just kind of like, whatever, with this whole thing. I could especially see it there.
2640000	2654000	Yeah, and let me tell you this much. If GameStop corporate has given these stores authorization to sell this game early, it's because they know who's selling it early around them, and they will get caught.
2654000	2667000	I was reading some TalkBack stuff on this Kotaku article, and there's one of the guys in there that was actually an owner of a MomPops shop, and it's just like, what a fucking douchebag the guy is.
2667000	2674000	And he's like, you know, we knew what the street date was, we decided we're going to go ahead and... here he goes.
2674000	2683000	Here's my two cents. I own a small MomPop game store. Modern Warfare 2 brought in ten times as much revenue as the store has ever done in a single game.
2683000	2692000	Why? Because I sold the game one day early. I could have had it last Thursday, but did you think I sold anywhere near as many copies without having it early?
2692000	2700000	No. But I had to sign an agreement with my distributor saying I couldn't pick it up until Monday, even though they had it five days early.
2700000	2706000	I can't afford to pick up hundreds, if not thousands, of copies of one game, although GameStop can.
2706000	2716000	The only jump I have on GameStop is that we all have the old gaming systems and literally everything else, and we have games early.
2716000	2726000	I'm sorry, that's a cop-out right there. The only jump you have on GameStop is that you can't afford to pick up enough copies to supply your customers.
2726000	2730000	First off, I don't believe that you run out of copies for your customers in the first place.
2730000	2738000	And second off, there's a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from GameStop, and just using that as an excuse to put out a game early...
2738000	2744000	Well, first off, you probably can get blacklisted from all the distributors out there, especially if they find out that you're selling games early.
2744000	2753000	It's just a matter of time. And two, if your customers aren't that unloyal to you, where you don't have it out early, they're going to go elsewhere.
2753000	2760000	People, yeah, there are rabid fans of games that are going to go wherever they can get it early, but I'm sorry, that's not an excuse.
2760000	2768000	Is there an easy answer to this, though? Because the bottom line is, the consumer is just ultimately going to go wherever they can get it.
2768000	2780000	They'll go to the Ma and Pa store if it's out there. They'll go to GameStop if Kotaku, Joystiq, Destructoid, whoever runs a story that, hey, these GameStops in such-and-such New Jersey broke the street date.
2780000	2787000	You know there were people driving in from Pennsylvania and New York to these stores just to get the damn game, because the series has that big a level of fans.
2787000	2794000	Well, here's the problem. What they need to do is basically this. They need to enforce the street date violators.
2794000	2800000	So if these people are breaking the street, they need to enforce it so that these people are reprimanded for doing that.
2800000	2805000	That includes GameStop. These stores need to be all reprimanded the same.
2805000	2810000	And if you give GameStop an exception because they decided to break the street because someone else was, well, I'm sorry.
2810000	2823000	If I decide to break the law because I see someone else breaking the law, like for example, if I see someone speeding past me on the freeway and I decide, hey, you know what, I'm going to go 100 miles an hour, too, and I get pulled over for speeding, I can't blame them for speeding.
2823000	2825000	It was my own choice.
2825000	2831000	Well, devil's advocate, not that I don't agree with you, but devil's advocate, when you break street date, you're not breaking the law.
2831000	2840000	No, but you're in violation of a contract that you have signed, so you're breaking a contract, and you have to take the penalties that are with that contract.
2840000	2848000	Don't go into that agreement with your distributor or whomever, the publisher, if you're not going to abide by it.
2848000	2855000	How can the playing field be leveled between the Ma and Pa stores and the GameStops from your perspective?
2855000	2864000	Because I'm kind of surprised. You're placing a lot more blame on the Ma and Pa stores than I kind of would have thought, considering those are the folks that you work with, but a lot of what you say makes sense.
2864000	2870000	But the bottom line is that these places claim they can't compete with GameStop.
2870000	2876000	You say bollocks because what can they do to ultimately compete with GameStop and everybody plays fair?
2876000	2887000	If there's customer service, there's a lot of people, you'll read any of these stories about GameStop revenue, GameStop this, GameStop that, and there's always going to talk back to people,
2887000	2893000	I hate shopping in GameStop, GameStop sucks because I hate talking to these people, they're always trying to give me a pre-order or something, blah, blah, blah.
2893000	2903000	There's people that hate GameStop and are looking for another alternative, but the problem is a lot of people also like the stupid little perks that you get from ordering with GameStop,
2903000	2909000	little trinkets and crap that, if you actually look at it, it's not that great in the first place.
2909000	2917000	Some of the, like a keychain or something. Do you really need a keychain for a game? Are you going to be fine without that? Probably.
2917000	2924000	Are these Ma and Pa stores going to give you a better trade-in value on your game than GameStop? Maybe. It depends.
2924000	2930000	And is the customer service going to be better? It all depends. It's just all this hatred for shopping at Walmart or something.
2930000	2935000	If you like shopping at Walmart and you find the prices to be fair, then why not shop there?
2935000	2944000	But they just try to compete with them and then they give up so easily because they're not as big.
2944000	2950000	And they're like, well, why can't they get all the advertising materials that GameStop has? Well, they make a lot of it in-house and they buy a lot of games,
2950000	2956000	so they have the publisher backing for a lot of the stuff. They have the pull to where they actually make the publishers pay them for shelf space.
2956000	2963000	I mean, you're never going to be as big as GameStop. Get over it. You've got to find a different way to compete.
2963000	2970000	And I have other stores out there that do just fine. And they abide by all the street dates. So, it can be done.
2970000	2974000	Interesting little mini-debate in our chatroom at chat.orangelandstrated.com.
2974000	2981000	DangerSkew says, easy solution. Implement some type of server-side solution that does not allow the game to be played until street date,
2981000	2988000	just like what PC games are starting to do. But GameGuru and Frisbee pipe up and say, no, no online activation.
2988000	2992000	The games won't work offline, you know, and so forth.
2992000	2996000	You can't do that. I mean, because there's people that aren't connected to, you know, online.
2996000	3000000	And if that's the case, if they're not connected online, there's no way to verify what date you have in your system.
3000000	3005000	I mean, you can switch a date around. I mean, it wouldn't matter. So, I don't think that's a solution.
3005000	3008000	And really, it's just going to come with enforcing street dates.
3008000	3012000	I mean, there's going to be violators out there, but you can start weeding them out with all these titles,
3012000	3015000	especially around the fourth quarter now that we've got a few titles, you know, under our belt.
3015000	3019000	We can see who's, you know, violating these street dates and stop doing business with them.
3019000	3024000	And, you know, you put out that list to all the distributors and listen, if you're caught doing business with them,
3024000	3028000	we stop doing business with you. And that'll get their attention.
3028000	3034000	But at the same time, GameStop can't fucking just go break street date because they feel that they need to be competitive against these stores.
3034000	3038000	I'm sorry. You're not going to lose sales to these stores. I mean, you're fucking GameStop.
3038000	3043000	It's not going to matter if you sell two less copies. You're GameStop. You make seven billion dollars a year.
3043000	3045000	It does not fucking matter.
3045000	3048000	Do you think anything, any action should be taken against GameStop for this?
3048000	3051000	I think it should. I think what they should have done is taken...
3051000	3055000	They would have had a lot more pull if they took the high road and didn't, you know, put out any of these games.
3055000	3060000	If they just say, hey, look, we played by the rules, you know, because they actually have the pull where they can go,
3060000	3064000	listen, you're not fucking street dating more tiles because this is what happens when you're street dating them.
3064000	3067000	And they're a big proponent of not street dating tiles. Do you know why!
3067000	3071000	Because the mom and pop stores get it two days later and then they have the advantage.
3071000	3075000	Yeah, you never hear the complaint. You know, oh, well we got it two days before this mom and pop store
3075000	3078000	because they have to get it shipped to them, you know.
3078000	3080000	They don't give a shit because they're always in advantage in that sense.
3080000	3083000	The only time they have an even playing field is street dated tiles.
3083000	3088000	And when people start violating that, then they get pissed off because now they're at a disadvantage.
3088000	3091160	advantage, and they don't want to be at a disadvantage for anything.
3091160	3094400	Not to continue to drag this out because we're already running long as it is, but I think
3094400	3099720	this is just a very interesting topic to me tonight. How do you think piracy plays a role
3099720	3103460	in this? Because when street dates are broken, this is ultimately what leads to piracy. Let
3103460	3108760	me give you a perfect example. One of the big things going on right now on a huge live
3108760	3113760	journal community, Oh No They Didn't, which is always a fun, hilarious read, a huge thing
3113760	3119320	they're talking about today is that some Italian website started selling the MP3s for the new
3119320	3124140	Lady Gaga album. So of course, one person went in and downloaded it, and what do you
3124140	3128460	think happened? Now everybody who browses that community has a copy of the new Lady
3128460	3131840	Gaga album about ten days before it was actually supposed to come out.
3131840	3135040	Actually it happens all the time. It doesn't matter if it's the new Lady Gaga album or
3135040	3137920	whatever. Promo copies go out to male.
3137920	3141880	And I might be talking about some musician that you personally don't care about, but
3141880	3147280	keep in mind, I'm throwing music, movies, games all in the same boat here with broken,
3147280	3152760	you know, one person ruin, in this case, not even in America, one person in Italy on the
3152760	3159320	internet ruins it, the street date, and it has colossal repercussions.
3159320	3166540	Exactly. Games leak online early all the time. All the time. But it's not necessarily from
3166540	3170000	people breaking street date. It could be. It could also be people, you know, working
3170000	3174320	at these companies. It could also be people working for GameStop to get the game early.
3174320	3179560	You never know who is supplying these games to these people that are ripping them. I mean,
3179560	3185820	same with the music stuff. Music promo copies are sent out there to get people to supply
3185820	3190800	the album in their store. Movies and screeners get put out there, or they're just dumping
3190800	3198480	Region 5 DVDs from Russia that come out early, and you have DVD copies of all sorts of movies
3198480	3200760	that are out in theaters now and stuff like that.
3200760	3205300	Well, I think especially with music, they have got to tighten the window between when
3205300	3210620	the thing is finished and when the thing hits the street, because obviously, that is a rough
3210620	3214060	market right now. I mean, but funny enough, this is where games could be headed before
3214060	3219760	too long. You know, I mean, music is, it's tough to be a musician right now with all
3219760	3222520	this stuff being pirated so crazy, you know?
3222520	3227080	Unless they're the smart people that actually take advantage of that kind of market.
3227080	3231640	And, to be fair, some of them do. And at the end of the day, Lady Gaga's probably not going
3231640	3236480	to hurt any from this happening, you know, but, you know, the point still stands is that,
3236480	3239800	you know, there's a lot of people getting this stuff before they're supposed to be quote
3239800	3240800	unquote.
3240800	3243560	And it only delays the inevitable anyways. I mean, if they're going to, you know, put
3243560	3247520	up, if someone's waiting for a pirated copy, yeah, they may play, you know, they may want
3247520	3254120	to play it early. Then again, that also has its repercussions as with the console bandings.
3254120	3259760	So, I mean, everything has its downside to it, but I think, like, I know, for example,
3259760	3265280	Grand Theft Auto IV. Yes, I downloaded a copy early because I wanted to play it right away.
3265280	3269160	But when it came out, I bought six copies of it because I just wanted to play it really
3269160	3273760	early because I couldn't wait to get my hands on it, needed to play it, like, like in the
3273760	3280040	heroine or something. But, you know, but I still bought it. And yeah, there's, I do have
3280040	3284200	a problem with, you know, just downloading something, you know, early and not paying
3284200	3289240	for it. Not to say that I haven't done that before. I probably have, but it's stuff that
3289240	3294120	I wouldn't have bought anyways or stuff I try once for three minutes and throw it away.
3294120	3296720	Like a lot of the Wii games out there.
3296720	3301440	So and again, chat folks, look at the big picture. I'm not specifically talking about
3301440	3306360	Lady Gaga. I'm using that as an example. It's just one I happen to notice because I personally
3306360	3310280	like her. But, you know, I realize a lot of you don't. Look at the bigger picture. This
3310280	3315400	has happened to every musician because that window between when the critics get it and
3315400	3321020	all that is way too big. And, you know, again, one, especially with how quick and portable
3321020	3327080	music files are, one internet person leaks it and everybody on the internet has it. Insert
3327080	3329300	your favorite band here. It's happened to them.
3329300	3330800	It's the swine flu of the internet.
3330800	3336880	I guess you could say that. So, all right. Anyhow, I guess we can move on to other stories,
3336880	3341080	but it's just very interesting because, you know, in a way there's no, I guess, easy answer.
3341080	3347360	But it's just, it's stuff that's just going to be, this isn't going away. It's just been
3347360	3350160	brought to the forefront for once, I guess.
3350160	3352680	Very interesting comment from chat. I want to state here though because I thought this
3352680	3357560	was also kind of plays a part of it. Jimmy Jack in chat says, GameStop has a limited
3357560	3364040	business model anyway. Once digital distribution is mainstream, they are screwed. And honestly,
3364040	3366840	in my opinion, you could replace GameStop with any of these stores we've been talking
3366840	3367840	about, right?
3367840	3371240	Like I said, there's lots of things they can do to compete. One of the things I'll give
3371240	3376560	you an example, Play and Trade. They allow their customers to try any game in their store
3376560	3381560	before they buy it. That's a big thing. And a lot of these stores, you know, they're selling
3381560	3385440	copies that are sealed. And if they don't have a copy that's not sealed, they're not
3385440	3388920	selling it to their customer. That's another thing that separates them.
3388920	3392360	Or if you maybe just don't like going into GameStop because they have maybe a limited
3392360	3396440	selection of PC titles, maybe they don't have the retro games you're looking for, there's
3396440	3400720	a lot of stuff to differentiate yourself from all these other people out there. If that
3400720	3403920	were the case, then there wouldn't be any mom and pop shops because you just can't compete.
3403920	3408840	Also, you know, and in some places, again, I don't want to stereotype all, but a lot
3408840	3414360	of times GameStop kind of has that aura about it of like you get a lot of people that don't
3414360	3417280	really care about their jobs. You get a lot of college kids who are just, you know, looking
3417280	3421200	for something to do, right, that don't want to work fast food. You know, again, that's
3421200	3425760	not all the employees, but I think it's certainly a stereotype they have to deal with.
3425760	3429320	On the other hand, you know, in a lot of mom and pop stores, ma and pa who are running
3429320	3432280	that store obviously have a love of video games if they're running the place in the
3432280	3435920	first place. And a lot of times you're going to get people who really, really freaking
3435920	3440360	care about what they're doing. Again, not all the time because certainly there's people
3440360	3445080	that work at those places too that don't give a shit. But, you know, I'm just saying that
3445080	3449680	I could see that as being one thing too, is that when you deal with mom and pa's, you're
3449680	3454780	more likely to be dealing with somebody who truly loves gaming. You know, I don't know.
3454780	3459040	Maybe that, is that a fair statement? You think in theory, in theory? I know it's kind
3459040	3463440	of one of those things that like out loud, it makes sense, but I don't know. In practice,
3463440	3466080	it could be very different. Certainly I've met a lot of GameStop employees who really
3466080	3470320	love what they do. Well, I have an example. Sure. The video game swappers here in Sacramento,
3470320	3474880	when they were open, I don't really think that they liked video games all that much.
3474880	3479040	I knew them. And no, they didn't really like video games all that much. Interesting. They
3479040	3482000	just sold it because they knew that's where the money was at the time. I think a lot of
3482000	3485840	times passion leaves when the company gets that big. You know, it's just like, it's all
3485840	3489760	about money. It's less about, you know, really if you like video games or not, it's just
3489760	3492560	that we're selling video games because it makes us a lot of money. We're a capitalist
3492560	3496520	society. It's all based on the bottom line. Money, money, money. All right, let's move
3496520	3501200	on guys. I want to move on to another story. Oh boy, from one controversial topic to another.
3501200	3507000	Speaking of passionate people, we have another story about PETA, who we haven't talked about
3507000	3510760	a long time on this show. Sorry, I had to throw up. I was thinking about them right
3510760	3515480	now. As you're eating KFC, which funny, it kind of ties into this. Okay, here's the whole
3515480	3519760	thing. PETA is obviously the people for ethical treatment of animals. And therefore evil.
3519760	3524060	They're very controversial in their practices. You can certainly hear my co-hosts attesting
3524060	3529040	to the background. I'm not going to get into the political aspect of it. I'm just not.
3529040	3536360	But regardless, PETA is there and sometimes they do these very big things for show. You
3536360	3542100	know, I once, and I think I've probably told this story before, you know, once I was kind
3542100	3546920	of talking to online on a dating website, a guy who worked for PETA and it was very,
3546920	3550880	you know, I, I'm, I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff. You know, I also used to date a
3550880	3556400	gay Republican, which to me was fascinating too. I like diverse people, even when sometimes
3556400	3560320	that diversity doesn't agree with me. So it's kind of, I don't know, it's interesting, but
3560320	3564360	I know from, you know, talking to somebody who works directly with the organization,
3564360	3568420	they're very passionate about what they do, whether you agree with them or not, they definitely
3568420	3573800	have huge passion and they get very creative. And one of the ways they get creative is that
3573800	3578040	they do these little online games to get their message across. There was a game that they
3578040	3582760	put out a while ago, Super Chick Sisters, which was there to kind of protest KFC. And
3582760	3586000	I remember we talked about it on the show a while back. This was back in 2007. Well,
3586000	3592240	guess what? There is a brand new, new Super Chick Sisters. So just in time for new Super
3592240	3597280	Mario Brothers Wii that came out today, we also have new Super Chick Sisters, but it
3597280	3602280	has nothing to do with KFC this time. No, it's all about McDonald's. I don't know what
3602280	3607760	the specifics is, but obviously the McNuggets did not get there very easily. So it probably
3607760	3612140	has something to do with that whole thing. And I have not played the game myself, but
3612140	3617000	I imagine they are not happy about how the chicken turns into the McNugget. So they've
3617000	3623800	built this whole game about awareness. And I guess the whole idea behind it is how they
3623800	3632560	tap into the market is that they're not, it's not a poster. It's not a protest. It's a flash
3632560	3637160	video game, which oftentimes tend to be very viral. I mean, look about it. I'm talking
3637160	3642800	about it here on the show, but you know, more the kind of creativity in, in their marketing,
3642800	3648600	but it's out there and to which I see Jamie and Loki rolling their eyes. This next time
3648600	3655440	you talk to someone from PETA, ask them how many animals they euthanize every year. Ask
3655440	3662400	them about how many of their higher ups have type two diabetes and take insulin. I don't
3662400	3665120	know when the next time I'm going to be in Norfolk, Virginia is, which is where their
3665120	3669440	office is. But you know, and that's what, you know, when I was talking to the dude,
3669440	3675920	but you know, I, it's, you know, whatever. I just, well, no, you know what? I would have
3675920	3681960	no problem with PETA if they weren't big hypocrites. That's all. Well, okay. Stepping away from
3681960	3685620	what PETA is all about and all this, cause I don't know. I just don't know enough about
3685620	3690880	PETA cause I've just never really cared. What about this whole, this is how they market
3690880	3696480	their message is creating these viral flash video games. That's also, it's, it's actually
3696480	3701240	pretty defamatory too. Remember the cooking mama one? I do remember that. That was funny.
3701240	3708080	That, but in the end though, I mean, it's like, I don't think that they really care
3708080	3713280	whose toes they step on because they think that they're invincible. And honestly, I would
3713280	3720480	love to have a full scale investigation gone into the business practices of PETA. Very
3720480	3724960	interesting because I am looking at a screenshot here from the game and it's not like they're
3724960	3730360	trying to hide the fact that it's Mario. I mean, there's a big red M on his cap. He very
3730360	3736560	much looks like Mario. If I were a Nintendo, I might think I could sue over protection
3736560	3740320	of my character, although I don't know, but then can't you get into parody and all this?
3740320	3746680	I don't know. You still have to have enough remarkable difference that, you know, I, I
3746680	3750760	think that that actually is close enough to infringement right there. Cause I mean, from
3750760	3756560	looking from where I am right here, it looks like Mario and Luigi and I've got my glasses
3756560	3760400	on and everything. It looks like Mario and Luigi, but if you get super close up, you
3760400	3764920	can see little text on there that says princess Pamela Anderson kidnapped again. And that's
3764920	3769040	where I know this is not a Nintendo game. You know what I mean? That's where I go. Okay.
3769040	3774760	I'm sorry. That looks like Mario. Pamela Anderson was maybe good looking like 20 years ago when
3774760	3780760	she was on Baywatch, but she's no princess now. She's barbed wire. She kicked her ass.
3780760	3784600	I mean, if you've seen, again, I was just talking about, Oh no, they did an earlier
3784600	3787800	and funny enough, I'm going to bring them up again. Once in a while they'll run these
3787800	3793400	pictures of Pamela Anderson without makeup and Oh my heavens, she is not good looking
3793400	3798120	anymore. Is she with Tommy Lee or Kid Rock at this point? Who fucking cares? Who fucking
3798120	3804080	cares? We all know. But obviously she's big on PETA. She's one of their big supporters
3804080	3810840	and stuff. And that's why she gets people, especially people who have no brains. Alright,
3810840	3816000	let's just move on. I just wanted to get it out there. It's, it's interesting. Marketing
3816000	3821440	using video games. It is showing you, I will say this, let me finish on this thought. You
3821440	3829140	as a gamer are being targeted for propaganda. Yeah. That's, that's why I brought this up.
3829140	3833240	That's what I wanted to say. You just set me up a plate of, uh, you know, fried, you
3833240	3840480	know, sea kittens. I'm sorry. It's going to be an argument between guitar hero five and
3840480	3847280	Madden for KFC side or super chick sisters. I'm sorry. I don't recognize super chick sisters,
3847280	3852000	but guitar hero five and matter and tell me to go eat chicken. I'm going to have to listen
3852000	3858040	to them because I don't want to piss off. The cows say to eat more chicken. They have
3858040	3863680	signs. All right. This, this was the worst possible show to bring up this topic on. Let's
3863680	3868640	move on. Well, especially since you're in, you know, Peter Peter hater central, which
3868640	3874520	would be me, but I don't, I don't hate, I don't hate, I know it. I hate hypocrites.
3874520	3879480	I do. Okay. I know. I do. I do. There are things I hate, but I, I, I'm trying not to
3879480	3889800	hate people, but I do hate ideas and I hate hypocrisy. So fair enough. All right, let's
3889800	3895260	move on. That Peter sucks. Um, um, there's some, how about something that's completely
3895260	3900400	non-controversial and very happy for those of us who have our Xbox three sixties and
3900400	3910120	love them. Um, project Natal, there are details including release date sort of, um, we should
3910120	3916160	be looking at it, um, uh, possibly around November, 2010 and it should be costing around
3916160	3925000	50 bucks. And they are speculating that 5 million units will be ready by that time.
3925000	3932100	So they're thinking big seller and they don't really just have, you know, a bunch of happy,
3932100	3938240	you know, gamers all on them. They have time magazine all on them. Project Natal made it
3938240	3947040	into the top of 100 or no top 50 invention poll on, uh, on the time magazine website.
3947040	3951320	How is it possible for a device that's not even out, but it's been invented. It's been
3951320	3956840	invented in this on display, but who's played at Jimmy Fallon. Big deal, you know, like,
3956840	3962200	but it's Jimmy Fallon. He means a lot to everybody, right? No chirp, chirp, cricket, cricket.
3962200	3966560	They're quoted this saying that a project Natal because it uses several cameras and
3966560	3971320	the microphone and because it's so much more intuitive than anything that's been out to
3971320	3975080	this date and is going to be put out on a mass consumer market. It's right up there
3975080	3980240	with the blade. Yeah, but they haven't played like the super virtual boy X two five, you
3980240	3985480	know, that's coming out 2015. Okay. And I just want to clarify, we're all still approaching
3985480	3989720	Natal with a healthy dose of skepticism, right? Because I thought when we last talked about
3989720	3995160	this, we're still sitting here going, okay, but yeah, but when we saw the eye toy in motion,
3995160	3999180	it looked like it worked flawlessly too. Listen, you're not talking bad about the eye toy or
3999180	4004220	PlayStation eye or say a, you know, the Xbox vision camera. I've never been burned by any
4004220	4011240	of those ever. Wait a minute. Okay. You know what the eye toy was good for the wash and
4011240	4016600	windows game that played that song from the 1920s. Yes. When I'm washing windows, that
4016600	4020240	was the greatest thing they ever did with the eye toy. Okay. And that game actually
4020240	4024260	worked pretty well, but a lot of these other games they released through the eye toy did
4024260	4029880	not play like you think they would on the back of the box. All I'm saying again, I realize
4029880	4034560	Natal is a much higher advanced technology than eye toy, but when I see this little like
4034560	4039260	little 12 year old girl walking up and trying on her clothes by waving her hand, I'm kind
4039260	4042880	of like, okay, well that's what they want us to believe. It really plays like, well,
4042880	4046480	yeah, yeah. Remember, but, and we were making that joke is that when Natal was, was being
4046480	4051380	previewed, like, wasn't this a scene in clueless like 10 years ago, but how is it, is it really
4051380	4055920	going to work that flawlessly? Cause part of me goes, you know, well, my DS is supposed
4055920	4062660	to understand me saying blue too, but here I am going brew, brew, brew. Let me mention
4062660	4068820	some of the other things that are on the list. Okay. For the list of stuff that's, um, and,
4068820	4075660	and I actually can't really call this a list of inventions because they're not necessarily
4075660	4081680	all real inventions. Some are innovations and existing technology. Some are books. Pride
4081680	4087440	and prejudice and zombies is on the list. If the Snuggie is on that list, the Snuggie
4087440	4094680	is on the list. The Snuggie is the greatest invention of the modern times. Have you seen
4094680	4099600	the Sleepy? The dog Snuggie, Rob, the dog Snuggie. Have you seen the Sleepy? No. What's
4099600	4106000	the Sleepy? It's like a bed. It's like a, think a, um, sleeping bag made out of bedsheets
4106000	4110760	that has no zipper and has a pillow inside of it. Amazing. Well, here's some of the stuff
4110760	4114720	that's on here and some of these are actually pretty worthy. The 10 million dollar light
4114720	4119140	bulb, I love it, is, is actually a light bulb that runs all on LEDs. It's just as bright
4119140	4127020	as any light bulb and will never burn out. Um, they've actually teleported atoms. Uh,
4127020	4132260	they have, uh, a guy who lost his vision in one eye figured out with these other guys
4132260	4138300	how to have a camera implanted into his eyeball so that he can record stuff. They've got a
4138300	4142760	chip that can actually make the blind see through the use of chip and special glasses,
4142760	4147040	which is what I was on Facebook earlier calling. So didn't they already do this in Star Trek
4147040	4154840	The Next Generation with Geordi Spicer? Um, there's vertical farming. That's cool. Okay,
4154840	4158760	so great. Project Natal is right out there with vertical farming, but yet I guess none
4158760	4162080	of us have enjoyed vertical farming. Rob, there's one more though that I think would
4162080	4169080	appeal to you. Okay. Robot penguins. Robot penguins, Rob. I got a text message from Victoria
4169080	4175560	today that said she got a leopard print Snuggie. You know what I replied? You can't because
4175560	4182800	I wanted one of those meat farms. You can grow meat by parts, Rob. How great is that?
4182800	4189920	I mean, you can grow meat. This is, I don't see a team of Dutch scientists is closing
4189920	4196360	in on culturing stem cells from pigs and growing muscle in a Petri dish in vitro meat. Okay,
4196360	4199600	so I understand. Maybe, maybe now this list makes a little more sense because a lot of
4199600	4203560	these are things we haven't actually gotten to do ourselves. You know, I have never growed
4203560	4208000	meat myself. I've never grown my own meat to eat. This sounds like more than that. Here's
4208000	4213380	the Robo penguin. What? Okay, so Natal I see fits into this list cause a lot of these things,
4213380	4219600	but then again I also say, does project Natal really deserve to be up there with meat that
4219600	4227160	you grow? That sounds like the unicycle thing. All right. That was, I watched that thing.
4227160	4231760	This stuff on there, Rob. No. Okay. Project Natal, I would say you wouldn't look ridiculous
4231760	4236880	riding around on unicycle just like you wouldn't look ridiculous riding around on a Segway.
4236880	4242320	What was that thing? What was that thing on a South Park called? Whenever I see these
4242320	4246400	new writing devices, I always think of that thing on South Park, the, that one episode.
4246400	4251040	I know some of you listeners know what I'm talking about. A 3d camera, a smart, the smart
4251040	4255440	bullet is my favorite invention on the list. It's a bullet that you can trigger to explode
4255440	4261880	after you've already shot it into somebody. You can choose when the bullet explodes. It's
4261880	4268040	the best thing ever. It will, it will. You don't want to piss me off. Why not? I shot
4268040	4271160	you and if I hit this button, you're fun. I've also figured out how to levitate a mouse
4271160	4275640	with magnets. There is something even better than the smart bullet. They didn't have to
4275640	4279520	have the smart bullet with a one liner at the end. So when you trigger it, it says a
4279520	4285080	one liner, then you explode. That'd be even better. I don't know. They actually have an
4285080	4290480	x-ray camera on the list. And Rob, it was the wild, or Wild Wacky Action Bike, which
4290480	4297600	is a fun times. YouTube funk, what the funk. Well, something else from Microsoft coming
4297600	4305400	soon of course would be the fall update and we can expect that on Tuesday, November 17th.
4305400	4310880	With that will be coming the Facebook and Twitter integration as well as Last.fm and
4310880	4316840	all sorts of other fun stuff. And honestly, still haven't really played around the Facebook
4316840	4320280	and Twitter stuff other than the one time I posted on Twitter saying, hey, I'm posting
4320280	4326520	from an Xbox 360, which apparently everybody else did so now I feel like a loser. But yeah,
4326520	4332640	it's cool I guess. But if you feel sad because you don't own a 360 and happen to have a PS3,
4332640	4337260	well fear not. There is a rumor that you're going to be getting integration to Facebook
4337260	4341520	as well very soon. This is actually coming from some screenshots that leaked out from
4341520	4348260	Sony's own website. Oopsie. Apparently Sony Computer Entertainment Europe had a few screenshots
4348260	4353080	on their website including brand new things like the ability to change your gamer card
4353080	4360960	colors as well as integration with Facebook. A little shot of the cross media bar there
4360960	4369960	with a Facebook link there and also some thumbnails of photos in a grid layout. So some other
4369960	4380520	features coming possibly in a later expansion to the new cross media bar. Which is good
4380520	4385280	I guess because we need a lot more updates from consoles for different things. I know
4385280	4392280	with at least the Xbox 360 one I know they're going to add some screenshots and stuff like
4392280	4395040	that which would be pretty awesome because then when I kill people in Grand Theft Auto
4395040	4399600	I can share it with everybody. Although that would be a lot of photos I'm sharing because
4399600	4405800	I kick a lot of ass in that game. Okay, maybe not. But yeah, it's interesting. So what do
4405800	4409760	you think, Jamie? Something that you would probably use? Although you don't play much
4409760	4415240	on the PlayStation 3, do you? No, I really don't. I probably wouldn't use it. But I
4415240	4422960	actually, I'll be honest, a lot of the little networking stuff through the consoles I really
4422960	4427720	have no interest in. Because the only things that I use for my networking is my iPhone
4427720	4436560	and my computer. So it would actually more irritate me I think if I was being interrupted
4436560	4443400	in a game for Facebook. Well I'm just hoping that they don't have automatic updates for
4443400	4447880	trophies or achievements or something like that. I know that they kind of tried something
4447880	4452800	a little bit with Twitter with Uncharted 2. It was a big pain in the ass. I haven't really
4452800	4455840	seen anything from that because I don't think a lot of people use it because they realize
4455840	4461400	how annoying that would be. Well the raptor thing is what pisses me off. Well yeah, I've
4461400	4465840	seen that too. That's kind of annoying. Especially with Twitter, I mean you can kind of block
4465840	4471400	some of that stuff now. At least with Facebook. In fact actually I've been going through on
4471400	4475640	Facebook and kind of blocking all of the apps. Which actually makes it really nice because
4475640	4478720	now I can actually see what my friends are updating without having to sort through all
4478720	4483080	those apps on there. I've been doing much the same. Still kind of going through everything
4483080	4489720	and hopefully I can actually get down to where it's just my friends posting and stuff like
4489720	4494720	that. There are a few though, especially from Rob, that I can't block because there's actually
4494720	4501320	a screenshot that he has on there. Which one? The Sorority Life? No it's not Sorority Life.
4501320	4504280	That's like a quiz or something that he's doing. You can actually go in and block a
4504280	4514560	lot of those quizzes too. You can do hide app whenever you get a post up on your wall.
4514560	4520320	So I actually do that with a lot of stuff now because honestly I'm irritated by a lot
4520320	4525760	of it. And the only thing that I actually even play anymore on Facebook is the stupid
4525760	4535040	little pet game that I like so much. The pet society thing. And that's it. Yeah. So you're
4535040	4538640	going to be using a lot of the Facebook stuff and Twitter. I know you're going to use some
4538640	4544280	Last.fm stuff. Not particularly on Xbox. Well obviously my Xbox is still down and I don't
4544280	4549400	really think I want to come back on board with Xbox for this. I mean I say this every
4549400	4552900	week. I'll get my Xbox replaced eventually but this isn't really enough to kind of like
4552900	4557480	sell me on it. Because again, I've watched the people update their Twitters from Xbox
4557480	4563400	and you know everything I've seen so far. Hey guys, I'm updating my Twitter from Xbox
4563400	4567600	and then I never see another tweet from the Xbox. And the only thing I worry about again
4567600	4572760	is just the Twit spam that we're already seeing. Not just from Xbox but Uncharted 2 and some
4572760	4578680	of these other games. I just beat level 3 in Uncharted 2. I don't care. Just all the
4578680	4584160	raptor people need to shut up. And the problem is that unlike Facebook, Twitter has no button
4584160	4589840	where I can say filter all posts with hashtag uncharted 2 in it. You know what I mean? And
4589840	4593880	I'm not knocking uncharted 2. I haven't played it myself but I hear the game is fabulous
4593880	4597400	and it looks like fun. I want to play it myself. But I'm just saying this whole tweet spam
4597400	4602380	thing has got to go. Same thing with Facebook. It's basically just to say hey we did it first.
4602380	4610020	I guess. Anyhow, alright well moving on to other topics and maybe a game that might be
4610020	4616240	publishing status updates to your Facebook very soon. Drum Hero is a game that has been
4616240	4620480	trademarked by Activision. Keep in mind though this doesn't mean that necessarily the game
4620480	4621480	is being made or anything.
4621480	4622480	I thought they already did this.
4622480	4625940	It is just, well you know a lot of people were kind of having this whole little like
4625940	4628980	wait a minute, haven't we heard this before? But here's the thing and this is what makes
4628980	4636580	this newsworthy. Previously Activision trademarked the titles Guitar Villain and Drum Villain
4636580	4640720	and this was way back in 2007 when they did that. But nothing ever became of these titles,
4640720	4643880	at least not yet. Who knows? You never know what might be in the making. But nothing ever
4643880	4648520	happened with those. But even though they trademarked Drum Villain, they never trademarked
4648520	4652940	just straight up Drum Hero. That trademark never happened to everyone's surprise. It
4652940	4656480	is just now being trademarked. Again though this doesn't necessarily mean they're going
4656480	4659940	to do anything with it, although it certainly seemed logical.
4659940	4665760	Now here's something else to keep in mind and kind of a related story that's going on.
4665760	4674800	Apparently in an interview with MCVUK.com, CEO Dan Rosenweg of the Guitar Hero brand
4674800	4679600	and works for Activision says that the publisher is apparently already working on new versions
4679600	4685020	of Guitar Hero and Band Hero and that there will also be more DJ Hero, which I'm sure
4685020	4689720	all of this makes you go, duh, duh, and more duh. We all know more of these games is coming.
4689720	4696840	But one thing they are saying, fewer SKUs in 2010. But keep in mind SKU is a term that's
4696840	4700600	been, well let's say skewed over the past couple of years. This has kind of made its
4700600	4707800	way from a retail only world to the mainstream game blogs everybody throws this term SKU
4707800	4712120	around. And what does SKU really mean? SKU is essentially like a bar code I guess you
4712120	4716640	could say. Maybe you could explain this better than I could Loki. But basically this doesn't
4716640	4724640	mean like one game does not mean one SKU. A SKU is Guitar Hero 5, Guitar plus game on
4724640	4731240	Wii is one SKU. Guitar plus drum plus game on Wii is one SKU. Game alone, another SKU,
4731240	4735940	right? Yeah. That's basically kind of how it works. Just because there's less SKUs doesn't
4735940	4738900	necessarily mean there's going to be less games, although that's kind of the conclusion
4738900	4740080	a lot of people are jumping to.
4740080	4744280	Just remember that this year alone, and this is including Guitar Hero Van Halen, there
4744280	4750600	has been 41 SKUs. So less than that doesn't necessarily mean that much of a difference.
4750600	4756440	And that's because you have four different systems, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, and Wii that
4756440	4761260	all these games are coming out on. And then you have the jumbo kit, the game alone, and
4761260	4762260	the game and guitar.
4762260	4766000	The DS and also possibly the PSP which is actually supposed to be coming out next year
4766000	4767000	as well.
4767000	4768000	Oh wow.
4768000	4770000	And if you want to include the iPhone I guess.
4770000	4776600	And also, by the way, Bobby in the chat room, which I think is interesting, he's bringing
4776600	4780760	this up as well, says another term co-opted by blogs that he's using correctly is price
4780760	4784640	point. That's a marketing term, not something, say, to talk about how much something costs
4784640	4788000	you in retail. And we're probably just as guilty as the next guy of using that term
4788000	4793520	a lot. It's kind of interesting how that has, that term I would say has almost evolved.
4793520	4796520	Like maybe that's not what it's supposed to mean, but that's what everyone thinks it means
4796520	4797520	now.
4797520	4798520	I always use MSRP.
4798520	4799520	Yeah, microtransaction.
4799520	4804040	Yeah, I know that too. Anyway, anyhow, getting off the subject a little bit here, but just
4804040	4807360	because there's talking about less SKUs doesn't necessarily mean less games. Although I personally
4807360	4812280	think we're not going to see the Metallica and Van Halen style releases next year in
4812280	4816240	Aerosmith. I don't think we're going to see any band only releases next year, especially
4816240	4821160	not after this whole stink about what's going on in Guitar Hero 5 with the band seeing it.
4821160	4822840	I think it would actually be because of that stink.
4822840	4823840	Really?
4823840	4826580	Yeah, because then they'd have that one band that's already agreed to have their likeness
4826580	4831500	in there and they're not really singing other people's songs.
4831500	4835360	I don't know though, part of me just says it's kind of been done with all the big bands
4835360	4839800	that are going to get their own game. I mean, granted, I'm sure, you know, there's a million
4839800	4843160	people, everybody's going to shout out their favorite band, but are these games really
4843160	4847680	selling that well? I mean, come on, the Van Halen one, they were given away.
4847680	4852240	Van Halen is still selling pretty well because a lot of people didn't buy it within that
4852240	4857760	one month. It's that one month after September, you aren't getting it for free unless you
4857760	4858760	find it used.
4858760	4861840	I'm just surprised. Again, I'm going to take a lot of hate with this comment, but I don't
4861840	4866720	care. Van Halen underserved their own game, especially not if they're going to ignore,
4866720	4868840	you know, the latter half of the career.
4868840	4874200	I understand that. And yeah, a lot of the older games, like Aerosmith does not sell
4874200	4876520	for shit right now. No one cares.
4876520	4877520	But it's old.
4877520	4885080	It's old, but it doesn't matter though. It's still another band. Metallica, once in a while.
4885080	4891180	Smash Hits, never. Five sells well. Van Halen will start selling well. But the problem is
4891180	4896120	when you release that many different games out there, you start getting, you know, obviously
4896120	4901800	oversaturation with that title, and then people start ignoring the other ones. But if they
4901800	4907360	plan it that way, that's fine, because they've gotten you to buy one release, you know, multiple
4907360	4911560	releases a year. I don't know.
4911560	4915280	And I see a couple people in chat are making reference to Michael Jackson. Specifically,
4915280	4918440	I'll read this comment from Sturlock, says, I wouldn't be surprised by a Michael Jackson
4918440	4923280	specific game. And I have to admit, of all these things that people randomly shout out,
4923280	4927960	I suppose that's the one that I could see really happening, although, yeah, I don't
4927960	4933540	think it would really be a rock band or guitar hero game. Michael Jackson could kind of have
4933540	4936840	a new thing, like a new music game.
4936840	4937840	You're supposed to be doing something.
4937840	4938840	Based on Michael Jackson.
4938840	4940960	Well, they're doing a Michael Jackson game already. It was already in the works before
4940960	4946920	he died. I already have a theory of what Drum Hero is. It's going to be something for either
4946920	4951800	the DSi or like an iPhone, something like that, because if you think about it, Guitar
4951800	4956440	Hero can't do that on the DSi because there's no place to plug the guitar in. But you better
4956440	4960360	believe that that drum skin that they put out for Band Hero, the DS version, can fit
4960360	4964360	on the DSi. So there's your drum. Drum Hero.
4964360	4968120	That's actually one of the more creative thoughts I've heard, is that maybe a lot of people
4968120	4972520	are jumping to the conclusion that this is like a sequel to Guitar Hero, but maybe it's
4972520	4974600	an iPhone port makes a lot of freaking sense.
4974600	4978120	It'd be kind of neat to do something on Xbox Live Arcade or something like that, too. Then
4978120	4982600	that way you don't need a guitar. You can just play it with your, you know, buttons.
4982600	4986100	That is a very interesting prospect. You know, and also, kind of speaking of this, I was
4986100	4989320	thinking about this earlier, and I think part of this was kind of inspired by Bobby's show
4989320	4992560	because he was talking about Lego Rock Band tonight and he was kind of talking about the
4992560	4996580	importing of the songs and all this. And I kind of got to thinking, like, how come nobody's
4996580	5004520	jumped on that idea of releasing a music game that's just a shell very cheaply that maybe
5004520	5009600	comes with a couple in-house produced songs? You know, maybe one or two big licensed songs
5009600	5012480	for like ten bucks, fifteen bucks.
5012480	5016720	Well, like the same concept that Vibribin had its own stuff in it, but you could bring
5016720	5019680	in your own music, except in this case you'd be downloading to buy?
5019680	5024320	Okay, yeah. The big difference would be that Vibribin, its whole thing was around importing
5024320	5028960	your own CDs, but this would be around microtransactions, basically, buying the songs you want. And
5028960	5033180	I think what made me think of this is that there are some songs in Lego Rock Band I want
5033180	5038020	to play, but not the whole thing. So I'll probably buy the game just to import the songs,
5038020	5041600	but when it's in the clearance bin. Because right now, you know, fifty bucks for the game
5041600	5045560	plus another ten for the import fees, I'm not feeling it. But the game will end up in
5045560	5048520	the bargain bin inevitably at some point, so I'll buy it then.
5048520	5054140	You know, it's kind of interesting with all of these skews, if you want to say, or games
5054140	5058900	coming out, I want to be able to pick and choose a little more. So it's kind of interesting
5058900	5063480	there is no game out right now that's, you know, and I would think that Xbox Live Arcade
5063480	5069120	or PSN would be the perfect place for a game like this to release just the shell of a game
5069120	5071920	and make most of their money off the songs.
5071920	5076480	I'm surprised that Boom Boom Rocket, was that what it was called? Remember that game that
5076480	5079600	came out on Xbox? I was actually really good at that game. I had like a bunch of high scores
5079600	5085400	for a while. I probably don't anymore. But Boom Boom Rocket, I'm kind of surprised they
5085400	5091480	never did anything with that. You know, like all the songs in that were classical songs.
5091480	5096180	Imagine if they had actually put like some licensed songs or some fun techno things into
5096180	5098920	that shell. Like that game could have been a whole lot more.
5098920	5101160	Yeah, it would have been cool.
5101160	5105500	And then of course, the inevitable Bobby's yelling out, beat and groovy. But that game
5105500	5108840	was always just doomed for disaster. We all knew Konami was not going to have the faith
5108840	5111000	to try and get licensed songs there.
5111000	5113240	By the way, did you realize Popping Music Week came out?
5113240	5117840	No, I, somebody in chat said it and I actually kind of went and went, oh yeah, that came
5117840	5121680	out, huh? But I just don't have interest in it.
5121680	5125440	It was really contacted us a week before it came out. Oh, by the way, it's coming out.
5125440	5126680	Sell some copies.
5126680	5127920	Did you sell some copies? Move it?
5127920	5128920	Nope.
5128920	5130320	Oh, just curious.
5130320	5131320	Not a copy.
5131320	5132320	All right.
5132320	5134120	I know better than to torture my customers like that.
5134120	5139320	All right. Anyhow, so we'll see what happens with Guitar Hero in the coming year and Rock
5139320	5142960	Band as well. I think it's inevitable. We all know it's coming in 2010, Rock Band 3.
5142960	5143960	It's got to be happening.
5143960	5144960	Oh yeah.
5144960	5147840	That'll be our next E3. We're going to hear all about Rock Band 3 and Guitar Hero 6.
5147840	5149840	Everyone's going to teach you how to play an instrument this time.
5149840	5151840	Oh yeah, that's right. We'll see.
5151840	5159280	Well, how about something a little bit more realistic? Final Fantasy 13. It's got dates.
5159280	5163160	Realistic. I don't know. This thing's been the figment of my imagination for about four
5163160	5165200	years.
5165200	5171680	There's supposed to have a simultaneous PS3 and Xbox 360 release for Final Fantasy 13
5171680	5179440	in the US and in Europe on the 9th of March, 2010. So hey, we've only got a few more months
5179440	5184320	to go. Of course, if you're in Japan, then you get it next month.
5184320	5188040	And it's kind of interesting because the turnaround, they promised that it was going to be a much
5188040	5192500	quicker turnaround this time, but they really made it happen, especially considering there's
5192500	5198440	a 360 port in the works as well. A four month turnaround by Square standards really doesn't
5198440	5202560	seem all that bad when you were at least looking at nine months before. How long did it take
5202560	5205960	for Final Fantasy 10 to come over here from the Japanese one?
5205960	5206960	Plenty.
5206960	5207960	Almost a year, right?
5207960	5209960	Something like that.
5209960	5215980	Yeah. I liked, though, that they did this whole announcement in this big trailer. It's
5215980	5220760	just this big event of a game because I guess Final Fantasy 13 does deserve that a little
5220760	5225360	bit, but Square's got a lot riding on this game, don't they?
5225360	5230360	Well, they tend to throw a lot of their stuff in on their Final Fantasy franchise. I mean,
5230360	5234560	that is really what I would say has kept them on the map.
5234560	5237680	I just don't remember all this fanfare over 12. That's all.
5237680	5238920	Well, 12 was kind of...
5238920	5244560	As there shouldn't have been. I liked 12. 12 just came out at a very bad time. 12 should
5244560	5249200	have been made for the PS3 and 360. It just came out at a bad time. They should have just
5249200	5254640	delayed it a year and put it on the next Gen or whatever you want to call them, consoles.
5254640	5257920	I was going to say that the guy in the trailer was a douche.
5257920	5261240	Yeah, a little bit. He had kind of a douchey vibe, didn't he?
5261240	5266700	But it's kind of typical of them to do something very fanfare like that because, after all,
5266700	5271200	they do have the theater of fun that they have all their trailers that play in during
5271200	5272200	E3.
5272200	5273200	Except this last year.
5273200	5274200	Except for last year, yeah.
5274200	5279560	Now, didn't they also make a big announcement about the theme song for Final Fantasy 13?
5279560	5285880	That they actually landed... Usually they just bring over the Japanese song, right?
5285880	5286880	You know, like...
5286880	5289040	Well, they got Leona Lewis to sing the theme song.
5289040	5295600	So here in the US and UK, but not in Japan. So they're actually having different artists,
5295600	5298320	which is kind of new because even when they localized the Kingdom Hearts song, it was
5298320	5299320	still Utada Hikaru.
5299320	5301640	But she's also bilingual.
5301640	5303640	I got concert tickets for her in January. I'm so excited.
5303640	5311160	Anyhow, but what was I gonna say before I got sidetracked with that? Oh, this is the
5311160	5314680	first time that they've had like a different artist singing it over here, right?
5314680	5315680	No.
5315680	5317240	No, did they do that with 12? I don't remember.
5317240	5318240	They did that with 10-2.
5318240	5320620	Wasn't it the same?
5320620	5321620	It was the same singer.
5321620	5324160	Oh, I forgot about 10-2. That's right.
5324160	5328560	Yeah, they got What's Your Face from Jade from...
5328560	5332560	Yeah, Sweet Box or whatever it was called. That's right. I forgot about that. And I was
5332560	5333560	really shocked.
5333560	5341120	One of the ending videos in the US version from the Japanese version, they actually changed
5341120	5346000	it because of her differences in singing it.
5346000	5351440	Well actually, the song that's gonna be in Final Fantasy 13 is a song called My Hands.
5351440	5355080	It's actually on Leona Lewis' next album. And if you're curious what the power ballad
5355080	5358480	of Final Fantasy 13 is gonna sound like, we have a little sneak peek for you right here.
5358480	5361520	We can only play a little clip of it because it's all copyrighted and stuff. Here's a sneak
5361520	5362520	peek.
5362520	5377760	So it sounds like your typical sitting in the dentist's office kind of Celine Dion station
5377760	5383840	power ballad music, which is kind of typical of the Final Fantasy ballads.
5383840	5388440	It actually does sound pretty J-pop ballad actually.
5388440	5389440	A little bit.
5389440	5397320	I think they announced something horrible like Popo Sow or something like, you know...
5397320	5399560	Sexy Back is the theme song of Final Fantasy 13.
5399560	5405080	Sexy Back. No, that's Final Fantasy 13 versus Sexy Back.
5405080	5409440	So there you go, Leona Lewis. Which actually, I gotta say though, that's a pretty good sized
5409440	5414440	name to land. But you know what's funny? You know who her record label is? Sony. So kind
5414440	5418920	of, who knows, maybe a little bit of networking there. But Leona Lewis, that's a pretty...
5418920	5421880	She's not a AAA artist, but she's hot shit right now.
5421880	5426000	Unfortunately, because of the Sony license, the Xbox 360 version will be getting Popo
5426000	5427000	Sow.
5427000	5435280	Shut up. I don't know about the UK, but she's big over here. In fact, she's the only celebrity
5435280	5441920	from a British reality show, except maybe Susan Boyle, that is well known over here.
5441920	5446040	Whereas I'm assuming over there, they probably have a lot of our American Idol. So they're
5446040	5449720	probably not all of them. I can't imagine people like Taylor Hicks are big in the UK,
5449720	5456160	but probably Kelly Clarkson and some of those people are big in the UK. So I still think
5456160	5458560	that's a pretty decent sized name to have.
5458560	5464900	Let's not forget, folks. For some people, it's not necessarily a draw, but it makes
5464900	5470080	a lot of people do a double take. I don't think anybody's gonna buy this game because
5470080	5473800	Leona Lewis is in it, but it's definitely gonna make a lot of people go, hey, it's gonna
5473800	5478520	make some of these critics of video games are not a legitimate art form, or video games
5478520	5483320	are not on the same level as movies and TV shows to turn their heads and go, oh, Leona
5483320	5486920	Lewis is doing the theme song. Really? That's interesting.
5486920	5490320	That's only because they approached Bryan Adams first and he turned them down.
5490320	5491320	Shut up.
5491320	5493160	He's the king of power ballads.
5493160	5499720	All right. Speaking of release dates, let's check out some closer release dates to this
5499720	5505200	week. So, Loki, you should finish a bite of your wing there. We'll start with the US states.
5505200	5509520	There's nothing coming out this week. What are you talking about? No really good stuff.
5509520	5514120	There's actually a lot of stuff. It depends on what area of the world you're in or United
5514120	5517520	States because that stuff might have already come out with people breaking street date
5517520	5522980	because they suck. No, but of course this week, Left 4 Dead 2, making its way out on
5522980	5534600	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not PlayStation 3, PC. Anyways, Assassin's Creed 2 coming
5534600	5545800	out on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Also this week, some smaller titles including Planet
5545800	5553080	51, of course tying in with the new movie coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and
5553080	5560240	DS and PSP. Today, actually, New Super Mario Brothers Wii came out. That's pretty awesome.
5560240	5567200	Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles also coming out on the Wii this week. Buck Fever, if you
5567200	5571760	happen to like deer hunting games, also coming out on the Wii. There seems to be a lot of
5571760	5580840	deer hunting games on the Wii lately. Formula 1 on PSP coming from Codemasters, NCAA Basketball
5580840	5591360	2010 out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Also Formula 1 for the Wii as well. This week,
5591360	5595000	another big old bundle game, which I'm not sure is going to sell very well, but Tony
5595000	5600500	Hawk's Ride with the skateboard will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii
5600500	5608680	for a whopping $120. The re-release of Stoked, the big air edition coming out on Xbox 360
5608680	5616400	this week. Ubisoft pimping out their Pets games with Pets Hamsters Superstars featuring
5616400	5623240	what appears to be a rollerblading hamster, which is very disturbing. LEGO Indiana Jones
5623240	5630040	2, the adventure continues out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC this week. And also
5630040	5637360	I believe the DS and PSP. Assassin's Creed Bloodlines on PSP this week, also Assassin's
5637360	5645280	Creed 2 Discovery on the DS. Seen It, Bright Lights big screen out on PlayStation 3, Xbox
5645280	5652420	360, and the Wii. God of War Collection coming out on the PlayStation 3 with a demo of God
5652420	5660040	of War 3 in there, so that would be pretty cool. Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Tag Force 4 on PSP. Just
5660040	5666040	Dance from Ubisoft out on the Wii, which the game looks absolutely ridiculous. Remember
5666040	5670100	that stupid minigame that they made me play instead of the sledding one I wanted to play
5670100	5671880	in Rayman's Raven Rabbids TV Party?
5671880	5674720	I remember this. This is a PAX, right? Did that happen?
5674720	5681160	Yes it was, and unfortunately this game is very similar to that, so I don't know, you'd
5681160	5685880	probably look ridiculous playing it. Jamie will get a kick out of this. The Sims 3 World
5685880	5690320	Adventures expansion was coming out this week as well on PC.
5690320	5692040	Yay!
5692040	5693040	What does that mean?
5693040	5698720	You can go to France. You can go on safaris.
5698720	5707040	On français! I can go to the Louvre. I can take my fake character out for a baguette.
5707040	5710760	Be our guest, be our guest.
5710760	5713400	Sorry, Loki. Can I read some quick chat comments though, because there's some really funny
5713400	5714400	shit.
5714400	5715400	Yeah, it's only in that voice though.
5715400	5722400	Okay then, I will read some comments from Jet. SSJ100 and Matt says that as far as the
5722400	5726800	Final Fantasy theme song goes, Christopher Walken doing Poker Face should be in it. And
5726800	5730800	I'm thinking so much that. Christopher Walken doing anything should be in a video game.
5730800	5732800	Or Cartman doing Poker Face.
5732800	5735480	Or Cartman doing Poker Face. They're kind of like a mishmash of both.
5735480	5736480	A duet.
5736480	5741520	Some strange chat. I didn't read this whole thing, but they were talking about sales figures
5741520	5747400	for DJ Hero. Some chatters calling it a flop, but I didn't realize it was a flop. In fact,
5747400	5750680	I thought I saw some article this week that just in those first few days, because the
5750680	5754800	game came out what, October 27th? And just in those last few days, it sold like 100,000
5754800	5755800	copies or something?
5755800	5756800	Yeah.
5756800	5759760	I mean, granted, that's across four different platforms, and I think maybe like 3,000 were
5759760	5763880	sold in the PS2, but you figure they're not going to sell well there. I mean, it's a little
5763880	5766200	early to call that game a flop, right?
5766200	5770840	Yeah. I don't think it's sold as much as, say, a Guitar Hero game, but then again, it's
5770840	5774560	also way more expensive than a Guitar Hero game.
5774560	5776560	Did Guitar Hero 1 catch on right away?
5776560	5777560	No. Not really.
5777560	5779500	And that kind of had to build, too.
5779500	5783800	It's all right. I mean, I think that they're going to be selling enough. I mean, they're
5783800	5787400	making another one already, so.
5787400	5791520	I think you have to look at the sales figures after Christmas, and then we can talk about
5791520	5792520	if it's a flop or not.
5792520	5798360	Yeah. Say, man, I've enjoyed the soundtrack to this game kind of like as much as I did
5798360	5803760	with the early DDR games. The soundtracks are really good, and I mean, I've been listening
5803760	5808640	to the whole soundtrack in my car, well, what I have dumped of it, and I love it. It's awesome.
5808640	5813920	I will put this out there, and the Bamani fans can have their way with me. I don't care.
5813920	5821520	It is the best music game song list for an initial game in a series ever. I wouldn't
5821520	5826800	go so far to say as I enjoy it as much as, say, maybe the third mix or the sixth mix
5826800	5831560	or sixth style or whatever of other games, but I will say as far as an initial song list
5831560	5839640	goes for a franchise-launching music game, it's the best song list there has ever been
5839640	5841160	in a music game ever.
5841160	5847320	Yeah. All right. Continuing on our release dates. This is a big one. LittleBigPlanet
5847320	5852400	coming to the PSP this week. That should be pretty exciting. Disney's The Princess and
5852400	5855480	the Frog, not so exciting on DS and Wii this week.
5855480	5857360	Hey, I want to see that movie. You shut up, hater.
5857360	5859000	Yeah, but the game's not going to be great.
5859000	5860000	Yeah, the game's going to be stupid. They always are.
5860000	5861640	The movie will be cool, but you know.
5861640	5862640	They always are.
5862640	5869560	Game, not so much. And talk about random licenses, D3. Common Rider Dragon Knight on the Wii
5869560	5878920	and DS. Let's see. Photo Frenzy on the Nintendo DS from Kokum International. And if I remember
5878920	5885520	correctly, I thought that was a DSi-only game. Maybe not. Petz Dog's Talent Show, yet another
5885520	5891280	animal that's dressed up and on a skateboard coming to the DS from Ubisoft. God forbid
5891280	5897880	they do that to animals. And this is kind of cool. Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue coming
5897880	5898880	to the Wii this week.
5898880	5902440	Oh, that. God, I remember talking about that like weeks and weeks ago that it was coming
5902440	5905120	out for the Wii and now just out of nowhere, here it is, right?
5905120	5906120	Boom, there it is.
5906120	5907520	Boom. Jumbo Safari.
5907520	5915080	Imagine Artist on the Nintendo DS. Let's see. And some smaller games. Wreck Room on the
5915080	5924040	Wii. I think that's about it. Next week, though, Hello Kitty Party on DS.
5924040	5927720	Woo-freaking-hoo. All right, let's go to some Japanese releases and some of the things
5927720	5931400	you have to look forward to over there. Just like we have Left 4 Dead 2 coming out over
5931400	5934920	here, you have that coming out in Japan as well in their own version coming out on the
5934920	5941560	19th because they get their releases on Fridays, if I remember right. Or no, I think they come
5941560	5942840	out like Thursday or something.
5942840	5945240	And over there it's called Ha! Zombies!
5945240	5950960	Shut up. PlayStation 3, Ratchet and Clank Future, A Crack in Time comes out. That's
5950960	5954220	the big release on the PS3 this week. Oddly enough, though, I don't see anything about
5954220	5960720	Left 4 Dead on the PS3 over there, but is that not coming out on PS3 at all? Over there?
5960720	5965080	Left 4 Dead 2? It's not coming out on PS3 over here.
5965080	5966080	Why did I think it was?
5966080	5967960	Because I goofed and said that earlier.
5967960	5972040	Oh, okay. I just assumed it was, but okay. No, I guess that makes sense.
5972040	5973400	Remember, Valve hates PS3.
5973400	5977640	Yeah, I remember that now. All right, the Wii has a lot more to choose from, though.
5977640	5983760	Taiko no Tatsujin has its own little version coming out. It's Wii Dodun Tuto Yomei. I
5983760	5987800	don't believe this is the first Taiko no Tatsujin game coming out, but I believe this
5987800	5992160	is the one that has the little inflatable drum that is disgustingly cute that you can
5992160	5996240	get in a little bundle set there. So if you're a fan of that series, you have that to look
5996240	5997720	forward to on the Wii this week.
5997720	6002600	Otherwise, a game you might be interested in, Calling! Kuroki! Chakushin is coming out,
6002600	6006440	and that looks to be kind of like a scary game. I think it's called The Calling or
6006440	6011200	something, and it looks to be kind of a scarier game that's coming out on the Wii. I don't
6011200	6015520	see any screenshots, but definitely it's got one of those Japanese grudge-looking girls
6015520	6019300	on the front and then a little cell phone, so I think it has something to do with cell
6019300	6024760	phone horror or something. I don't know exactly what cell phone horror would be, but
6024760	6025760	this game is it.
6025760	6034080	Hey, on the PlayStation 2, your monthly bill from AT&T with an iPhone! Oh, Loki, sometimes
6034080	6038160	I feel like there should be a two-drink minimum to listen to this show with you on it. PlayStation
6038160	6043760	2, Seke, Saikyo Yu, Gen-C, Igo, Kooza, for those that are still buying PS2 games, on
6043760	6049360	the Nintendo DS, Monster Finder comes out! And then also next week, just so you know,
6049360	6054200	they're also getting like hella hella Hello Kitty peripherals, like a new little pouch
6054200	6057160	and a DSi slim pouch and all this stuff.
6057160	6059940	I think it's like an anniversary, actually, of Hello Kitty.
6059940	6063540	I think so too. Mario and Sonic, by the way, at the Vancouver Olympics also comes out in
6063540	6069960	Japan this week. And lastly, taking a look at the Sony PSP, Armored Core, Silent Line
6069960	6074640	Portable coming out over there, as well as Jak & Daxter, a new release there, and a game
6074640	6080380	called Mina no Na'vi comes out on the PSP. Those are your Japanese release dates.
6080380	6086600	In the UK, on the 17th, we have Left 4 Dead 2, we have Gyromancer on the 18th, and a bunch
6086600	6093280	of stuff on the 20th. Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Bloodlines, Assassin's Creed
6093280	6099760	2 Discovery, okay, just different versions of it, Dragon Age Origins, F1 2009, Little
6099760	6105160	Big Planet on PSP, New Super Mario Brothers Wii, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of
6105160	6113280	Sky, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Saw, BLEH, Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper, Sims
6113280	6118380	3 World Adventures, Wii, and Tony Hawk Ride.
6118380	6123400	I just wanted to mention that next week, or actually the week after next, there's a game
6123400	6127880	coming out on the Wii over here that's like all sorts of fail. It's an exercise game called
6127880	6134360	Your Shape. It features Jenny McCarthy, and guess what? Okay, they're super intelligent
6134360	6137620	over Ubisoft. They decided, hey, you know what, even though the Wii has this wonderful
6137620	6143500	motion capture system with Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, we're gonna use a webcam
6143500	6146280	to capture your movement, just like the eye toy.
6146280	6150920	I'm just worried about the shape it's gonna tell me I am. Congratulations, you are a
6150920	6151920	pair.
6151920	6155120	Congratulations, you're shaped like Rosie O'Donnell.
6155120	6159480	Noooooo.
6159480	6161480	You are a leopard.
6161480	6168040	What? That doesn't make any sense. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
6168040	6171600	Let's keep moving on. You realize this part A is going on two hours tonight just for part
6171600	6175560	A. Good times. Obviously we've been gone a week.
6175560	6179880	And she's jumping and excited. Fitness that's fun and focused on you.
6179880	6184360	Jenny McCarthy's just excited to have a job this week. Because seriously, what has she
6184360	6185360	done?
6185360	6186360	Exactly.
6186360	6190680	Besides, I think like a National Lampoon movie, maybe, here and there? Alright, a few more
6190680	6192640	stories and then do a break already.
6192640	6193640	Good lord.
6193640	6194640	Loki.
6194640	6196920	Oh, I have another story?
6196920	6198840	Yes. We don't release dates. It's your turn.
6198840	6201680	We're talking about Jenny McCarthy and how, you know,
6201680	6202680	The hell with her.
6202680	6208920	Anyways, Modern Warfare 2, of course, you know, selling lots and lots and lots of copies.
6208920	6216080	Of course, in the UK, it sold 1.23 million units the first day, breaking first day sales
6216080	6221040	records over there. So that's pretty awesome. Guess everybody loves Modern Warfare over
6221040	6222040	there.
6222040	6231700	And of course, in the US, 4.7 million units in day one sales, making it probably the biggest
6231700	6241240	game this year and the biggest game for quite a while. So, yay! I don't know. Yeah, we kind
6241240	6242960	of figured it was going to sell a lot.
6242960	6245960	And it was on the news and everything. Like, I was watching, you know, one of the days
6245960	6250320	I was home sick, I was watching the morning news and they were actually did a story about
6250320	6252960	all the lines that were going on around midnight at the store.
6252960	6254440	I saw pictures from Dan's store.
6254440	6258240	Honestly, do we need more newscast stories where it's like, hey, look, it's gamers waiting
6258240	6262040	for a game. Oh, my goodness, that pandemonium.
6262040	6266680	Because people need to be reminded for some reason that video games are a huge business
6266680	6273040	and, you know, this game probably made more money than most of the box office did this
6273040	6277560	weekend. Like, what was the big movie this weekend, 2012 or whatever? And I don't think
6277560	6281360	it, I mean, even if it made a hundred million, which I don't think it did.
6281360	6284080	That's half the movie's budget right there.
6284080	6289080	But that's probably still less than what Modern Warfare 2 made. You know, granted, of course,
6289080	6291860	the game is, what, 60 bucks or it's a movie ticket.
6291860	6293760	Not to spoil anything about 2012.
6293760	6294760	Did you see it?
6294760	6296440	Yes, I went and saw it earlier today.
6296440	6297440	It looks ridiculous.
6297440	6298440	It is ridiculous.
6298440	6299440	I can't.
6299440	6306200	After the fourth time, count it, fourth time that they took off on a runway and outrunning
6306200	6312920	an earthquake. That happened multiple times in this movie. It was just like, really? Really?
6312920	6316200	These movies are just getting ridiculous. I'm sorry. I realize there's an audience for
6316200	6324040	these movies and clearly it's Loki, but like Independence Day, I watched, I was all excited
6324040	6325640	about it. It was cool.
6325640	6330400	Day after tomorrow, I was kind of like, okay, really? We're running away from like weather
6330400	6333280	blasts and things like this and run before the cold gets...
6333280	6335200	Listen, you can outrun weather, okay? It's a fact.
6335200	6338640	It was a little bit ridiculous, but okay, whatever. It was a good popcorn flick. But
6338640	6345360	I watched, like they had a clip of LA getting leveled or whatever on Yahoo movies or whatever
6345360	6349680	and I was watching a clip from 2012 and I'm just sitting there the whole time going, this
6349680	6354880	is so ridiculous because I think you're supposed to feel like excitement for John Cusack and
6354880	6358320	his whole family getting out of these horrific situations.
6358320	6361560	But all I can think about, because I don't know, this is just the kind of person I am,
6361560	6366960	is that what about those millions of cars that are piling up on the freeway and these
6366960	6371800	buildings that are toppling over? Why am I supposed to give a shit about this rich white
6371800	6374600	dude who got a limo to escape from the...
6374600	6376840	Listen, it's a middle class white dude.
6376840	6377840	I'm sorry.
6377840	6380020	The limo driving is his job.
6380020	6381020	Why should I care about...
6381020	6382020	He's a failed author.
6382020	6384640	Okay, my bad for not paying the money to see the movie.
6384640	6385640	No.
6385640	6390640	But why should I give a shit about him when the movie is depicting millions of people
6390640	6395600	dying in a catastrophe and it's supposed to be like a feel good movie? Like really?
6395600	6400960	No, it's actually very funny because seriously, there's multiple times that they're flying
6400960	6407840	the plane out of things. They outran a volcano blast. They outran buildings toppling. How
6407840	6415920	is the plane taking off from a landing strip and somehow sinking into the ground? I mean,
6415920	6422620	they were pulling up on the plane yet going deep into the ground. What? I'm sorry, there's
6422620	6427520	a point where I'm like, this is just too much and this movie looks to be too much.
6427520	6433700	I know it was completely ridiculous and it was. It lived up to its ridiculousness.
6433700	6437460	On the ridiculous scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not so ridiculous and 10 being completely
6437460	6439840	fucking ridiculous, how ridiculous is 2012?
6439840	6445520	I would give this an 8.5 because a 10 I think would have to be Wild Zero because Wild Zero
6445520	6450480	is so ridiculous. They chopped a UFO in half with a samurai sword and it's a punk band.
6450480	6455880	I mean, which by the way, the samurai sword I think came out of his guitar. So, that movie
6455880	6458120	sounds awesome. And there was Zombie Love.
6458120	6460480	And I've got your copy.
6460480	6464720	I forgot I even have that movie. Amazing.
6464720	6467880	Any movie that has Guitar Wolf in it instantly rules.
6467880	6474480	Okay, and Tigerclaw wants to clarify, 2012 has made $225 million worldwide and $65 million
6474480	6481760	domestically. Any sources coming soon.net as the source for the monetary figures.
6481760	6485420	But probably Modern Warfare 2 still makes more money in the week that it's out than
6485420	6487480	this movie did. I mean, it's just huge.
6487480	6492480	And honestly though, it's seriously, it's a good movie to watch. It's absolutely ridiculous.
6492480	6496060	But that's why you watch it. It would make an awesome RiffTrax movie. Oh my God, it's
6496060	6497520	going to make an awesome RiffTrax movie.
6497520	6501160	Okay, back to Modern Warfare for a minute because I really, really don't care about
6501160	6505880	2012 anymore. I do care though about that Facebook group about shut the fuck up, the
6505880	6507880	world's not going to end in 2012. That cracked me up.
6507880	6508880	I signed up for that.
6508880	6517120	I know. I signed up last week for an undisclosed amount of people arbitrarily signing up for
6517120	6518520	a cause or something like that.
6518520	6519520	I signed up for that.
6519520	6525720	That was funny. There's an app for that. Anyway, back to Modern Warfare 2. Here's the thing
6525720	6529280	I don't understand. Loki, I need somebody to translate for me and for some reason I
6529280	6534200	feel like you would understand this game better than I do because I'm not knocking the game,
6534200	6539920	but keep in mind these type of war sims are not really my thing. So what is it about this
6539920	6547840	game that is making it sell zillions? And yes, it is in fact selling zillions.
6547840	6556200	Well, the game is really fun, really intense. Online was awesome in the first one. I wouldn't
6556200	6560440	know because I didn't play it, but everyone says it's awesome, therefore I'm blindly believing
6560440	6561440	that.
6561440	6567960	Chatters, feel free to help me out too. Why is Modern Warfare 2 so, like such a landmark
6567960	6568960	game?
6568960	6573600	It's very gritty. Like, I mean, there's, you know, you're playing undercover at, I guess
6573600	6577120	in the beginning I think you're undercover as, you know, part of a terrorist cell because
6577120	6580000	you're infiltrating them from the inside, but you have to murder people and stuff like
6580000	6584160	that, innocent people in an airport and whatnot. You know, the scene that got controversy or
6584160	6585160	whatever.
6585160	6589720	Is it kind of trying to ride on that whole America fuck yeah wave?
6589720	6594080	Well, it's America and a bunch of other countries are getting all fucked over because there's
6594080	6597600	one part where you're like, you know, storming the White House because terrorists have taken
6597600	6604560	it over. So, I mean, it's kind of, yeah, you know, fighting terrorism is cool and the online
6604560	6609280	is really sweet. I think of like a guy's, I don't know, like a Halo 3 or something like
6609280	6612560	that, because Halo 3 had a really short campaign and the online was awesome. It's kind of the
6612560	6616800	same with Modern Warfare 2. Campaign's pretty cool, short, but it's awesome.
6616800	6621080	ActDeft in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com says, even PC boycotters are playing Modern
6621080	6624800	Warfare 2. I did see that screenshot of like all the people in the boycott group on Steam
6624800	6629880	were playing the game. My God, if I could sum up, like arguing on the internet in a
6629880	6633120	picture, like, you know, they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Like if I had to
6633120	6637400	explain debate on the internet, like that picture does it right there. That is, that
6637400	6642160	is trying to debate someone on the internet summed up into a picture.
6642160	6647000	I bet, dude, do the same thing when Left 4 Dead 2 comes out this week. Let's go snap
6647000	6650380	a picture of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group. I bet there's shit loads of people playing
6650380	6655540	it. Yeah, because you know what? Cause they're sheep because they're like, ah, but I want
6655540	6662000	to play it. Okay. Well, and they'll justify it saying, oh, well they, they, uh, took care
6662000	6667280	of what I needed them to take care of or whatever. Um, let's see. Uh, Quel Tipo in chat says
6667280	6672240	it's a manly macho game that makes people feel tough. Is that what it's a, it's a, it's
6672240	6678120	a modern version of when we used to go outside and play like army man or whatever, make believe.
6678120	6684240	Now it's just all please to bury the GI Joes in a mass graveyard. Interesting. I, I, you
6684240	6688760	know, I, again, I'm not knocking the game. I guess for what it is, it's a landmark game
6688760	6692440	and it's certainly the graphics I've seen look very realistic and everything. I'm not,
6692440	6697400	I realize, you know, just not every game I'm going to get and that's just the way it is.
6697400	6701160	Just like there's a lot of people that probably sit here and go, really? Why do they play
6701160	6704600	so many music games? They talk all the time about music games and I think they're stupid.
6704600	6709240	You know, everybody's just into whatever they're into. I just was kind of curious why this
6709240	6716200	game above the countless other war games that are released. Anyhow, um, got one more news
6716200	6718780	story for you guys and we're going to get into the classic video game of the week and
6718780	6722760	this actually has to do with the Zune. You know, we talk a lot about iPhone, iPhone,
6722760	6726120	iPhone, you know, and all the gaming that's going on there. Well, certainly Microsoft
6726120	6730840	wants a piece of that too with their own handheld device, the Zune. And while the Zune doesn't
6730840	6736280	make phone calls, the Zune does play movies, listen to music, and now it will do games
6736280	6741560	too. Um, there's a new firmware update that happened. It was 4.3 and apparently there
6741560	6746280	are now six free games on the Zune marketplace. That's right, free. Project Gotham Racing
6746280	6753280	Ferrari edition, Lucky Lane Bowling, Vans Skate Pool Service, Piano, Checkers, you know,
6753280	6757040	classic game in there too, excuse me, classic game in there too, and a game called Audiosurf
6757040	6762240	Tilt, which is a port of sorts of the popular game Audiosurf that was available on the PC
6762240	6765080	where you can use your own MP3s. I've actually played that game. It's quite a bit of fun.
6765080	6768860	If you like music games, speaking of which, Audiosurf is a nice little investment. That's
6768860	6775360	kind of a fun game. Um, so now you can play that on the Zune as well. Um, so, you know,
6775360	6778840	Zune's kind of trying to step it up there a little bit as a portable device, and of
6778840	6783160	course, I'm sorry, not just a portable device, but kind of up there with the iPhone with
6783160	6788640	its all in one kind of device there, and for those that were asking, you know, when is
6788640	6793080	Microsoft going to get into handheld gaming, I guess this is what we've got, at least so
6793080	6799200	far. So, I don't know, any interest in these games? Like, I'm curious what Project Gotham
6799200	6803000	looks like and the Audiosurf I'm certainly interested in, especially if it plays off
6803000	6807720	your MP3s from the Zune. I think that's pretty cool. Um, but at the same time, I wouldn't
6807720	6810040	drop several hundred dollars on the Zune just to check it out.
6810040	6812760	I'm just wondering when the hell they're going to actually release, you know, was it the
6812760	6815720	XNA stuff on the Zune? When's that happening?
6815720	6817640	Yeah, I heard something like that was supposed to happen, huh?
6817640	6821960	I talked about it like a while ago.
6821960	6825560	I don't know. I don't think that's come full circle yet as to when that's actually going
6825560	6830560	to happen when you see the indie games on the Zune. So, maybe soon. Anyhow, let's get
6830560	6834680	into that part of the show that we like to take a trip down memory lane and look at a
6834680	6838800	classic video game from The Vault. Every week, DarkSakura steps into The Vault and picks
6838800	6843520	a game that she thinks you guys should be playing. It's our classic video game of the
6843520	6847480	week. DarkSakura, what video game did you pick for the kiddies tonight?
6847480	6848480	River City Ransom.
6848480	6849480	Woohoo!
6849480	6854560	I'm glad the Vault's cold.
6854560	6856880	Were you very cold going into The Vault to pick out the game?
6856880	6857880	Quite.
6857880	6862520	Actually, even though I love the NES version, I'm picking a specific one and that's the
6862520	6871280	example that I've given us for our YouTube. It's Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, which is
6871280	6878880	Downtown Hot-Blooded Story. In the PAL region, it came out as Street Games. And it's one
6878880	6879880	of the Kunio games.
6879880	6884000	And you can hear the music is a little different here. In fact, let me play a little clip here.
6884000	6891000	I'll have to find this on my main cabinet.
6891000	6894800	You can play PC Engine games on your main?
6894800	6896040	Yeah, I can play anything I want.
6896040	6902280	Oh, you've got the emulator set up. But yeah, this is... there are also versions for the
6902280	6909800	X68000, the Game Boy Advance. It came out on Virtual Console. But basically, since it's
6909800	6920320	one of the Kunio games, you know, with Nekketsu Koha Kunio-kun, which was Renegade, and Nekketsu
6920320	6923600	Koko Dodgeball-bu, which is Super Dodgeball, which I have covered.
6923600	6928280	Yeah, I think that was a previous game you did, because I love Super Dodgeball.
6928280	6932360	But basically, you were playing high school kids in the Japanese version. They're Kunio,
6932360	6942200	Enriki, and over here it's Alex and Ryan as they go to try to rescue the girl. And by
6942200	6947600	going against different, I guess, you know, delinquent gangs or whatever. And so it's
6947600	6952120	just a little street brawler. You know, walk down the street, punch some people, and then
6952120	6954320	he's stopping for, you know, a burger.
6954320	6955320	And a free smile.
6955320	6961600	And a free smile. So the... you also, of course, have passwords so you can start off in different
6961600	6969560	parts of the game. But I did pick this one in particular. Oh yeah, actually I needed
6969560	6976160	to mention some differences between the Japanese version. They actually changed the school
6976160	6981360	uniforms into t-shirts and jeans, you know, that type of stuff.
6981360	6983360	Also, now you just noticed?
6983360	6984360	Voice acting.
6984360	6989440	Digitized voices. So there are other times, this is what I was going to mention, you can
6989440	6995000	go into, like, restaurants and buy stuff to refill your health or do whatever. These are
6995000	7000640	actually, have voice acting on them, so if you want to skip up to the next part.
7000640	7002640	Sure, which isn't too far ahead here.
7002640	7015960	And that's, this is like the little fast food restaurant sequence.
7015960	7016960	Yeah.
7016960	7023200	It's super light, you have the hashtag message, you know.
7023200	7027480	And I love the little, this is such great radio, I know, but I love the little look
7027480	7034280	on his face after he eats his burger. And the cutesy music.
7034280	7038520	This game was also famous for having a butt. I remember that. You remember that? In the
7038520	7041280	sauna sequence, you saw a butt.
7041280	7049080	Well, it was probably just a public bath or, you know, whatever. But yeah. This is the
7049080	7056880	other bit. More voice acting.
7056880	7060920	So for a little, you know, TurboGrafx-16 style cartridge.
7060920	7061920	No.
7061920	7062920	No?
7062920	7063920	This was PCCD. PCCD.
7063920	7064920	Oh, okay.
7064920	7065920	So...
7065920	7070040	But still, I mean, that wasn't the most technologically advanced, I mean, at the time it was, but,
7070040	7071040	you know, it's pretty impressive.
7071040	7075760	All the, you had Redbook audio with this, you had voice acting because it had a higher
7075760	7082280	storage capacity. Well, I mean, you saw, you heard the, you know, vocal intro for Dracula
7082280	7088160	X on PC Engine, so it could definitely do it. It's, you know, just pre-record it and
7088160	7089160	have it go up.
7089160	7091760	It's just interesting because I never really knew this version was here, even though I
7091760	7095760	loved Rude for City Ransom as a kid, and I see everybody in chat barf exclamation-blimey.
7095760	7099920	Everybody remembers some of the great dialogue that we got over here, which I'm sure was
7099920	7105640	just raped localization that came out very funny. Like, kind of like the original Engrish,
7105640	7106640	if you will.
7106640	7107640	Well...
7107640	7111920	Because I highly doubt that's what they were saying in the Japanese thing, was barf.
7111920	7122440	Well also, the company that localized it was American Technos, which was a subsidiary of
7122440	7128260	Technos Japan. They actually brought out another Kunio game that came out over here as Crash
7128260	7134600	and the Boys Street Challenge, although it's more of the same type, but not really super,
7134600	7144100	super linked. And yeah, in Japan, that one was Bikuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku Harukanaru
7144100	7153000	Kin Metal, which was Astonishing Hot-Blooded New Records Distant Gold Medals. So, but yeah.
7153000	7156800	I love how they like to butcher names and everything when they come out. But yeah, it
7156800	7161960	did come back out on virtual consoles, so those with Wii go get it. However, I will
7161960	7170520	just say this to this date, the Super CD version is my favorite.
7170520	7175920	Alright, so your classic video game of the week, River City Ransom, or in this case,
7175920	7182200	Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari. There it is. The classic game of the week from the archives.
7182200	7188840	And you know what? A recently released game reminds me, I would actually even consider
7188840	7191480	it a spiritual successor, because Dan and I were talking about it, which is how I was
7191480	7199100	thinking of doing this one, is the, oh crap, now I just forgot the name, where you play
7199100	7205440	as a delinquent boy beating up other people. Badass something.
7205440	7206440	Bully?
7206440	7209200	No, Badass Rumble or something.
7209200	7211440	Kankobancha Badass Rumble.
7211440	7212440	That's it.
7212440	7213440	Kankobancha.
7213440	7214440	That's it.
7214440	7215440	Alright, well.
7215440	7220800	Because I told Dan we had to get that game, and Dan's like, I want it just because it
7220800	7222800	has badass in the name.
7222800	7225840	Just because of the name. Alright, well that's going to do it for this part A of our show,
7225840	7229920	but we're not done yet. We're going to come back for plenty more, which is pretty amazing,
7229920	7233720	because part A tonight was two hours. That's one of our longest part A's in a while, but
7233720	7237400	that's okay. We've obviously had a lot to talk about between this wine flu and gaming
7237400	7240720	and all that food and all that other fun stuff. But we are going to take a quick break. We
7240720	7245240	will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around. Stay tuned. We'll
7245240	7248720	be right back, because in part B tonight, your Twitter topics, your phone calls, some
7248720	7253960	rapid fire news, and of course more chat, including Silent Hill news, One vs. 100 season
7253960	7259280	2, Gran Turismo 5, Moonwalker, plenty more coming up in part B tonight. We will be right
7259280	7268040	back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
7268040	7271440	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November
7271440	7278280	the 15th of 2009, where we are taping the 344th episode of our podcast, as we do every
7278280	7286040	Sunday night, live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. We tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard
7286040	7289880	Time, right after the conclusion of the Bobby Black Wolf show, every Sunday night on All
7289880	7294840	Games Radio, when we aren't sick with the flu. And we just came back from a music break.
7294840	7298040	We took a really short live break tonight. We only listened to one song, and that was
7298040	7302080	the new song from Final Fantasy 13. We actually listened to the full version of Leona Lewis
7302080	7305680	with My Hands. I'm kind of curious. I'm assuming this is the first time that Dark Soccer and
7305680	7311160	Loki had heard that song. Would you guys kind of think of that as the Final Fantasy ballad?
7311160	7313320	Just kind of your typical little power ballad from Final Fantasy.
7313320	7314320	Yeah, I kind of tuned it out.
7314320	7316800	Yeah, I kind of tuned it out a little bit. You know, you just kind of have to imagine,
7316800	7321120	you know, that's going to be the big romance scene with lightning and snow and what do
7321120	7323920	they get partially cloudy and whatever these guys' names are in the game.
7323920	7327600	No, it's going to be snow and that red-headed chick and one that's like flying through the
7327600	7328600	fire.
7328600	7329600	What's her name? Thunder Snow?
7329600	7331600	No, it's not Thunder Snow. I don't know.
7331600	7337080	30% chance of precipitation. Is that her name? It's funnier, though, if you imagine it being
7337080	7342560	that tough-looking army dude that raises all the chocobos, and he's singing it to a chocobo.
7342560	7343560	That is funny.
7343560	7344560	That is pretty damn funny.
7344560	7346560	There you go. See, doesn't that make that song a lot of fun?
7346560	7350920	It'll be snow getting it on with his motorcycle, which turns into the twin shivas and yeah.
7350920	7355560	All right. Anyhow, there you go. Love it or hate it. It's the ballad from Final Fantasy
7355560	7360400	13 and those of you that weren't listening live tonight, that's okay. I'm sure that...
7360400	7363480	I think her album comes out on Tuesday, so if you really want to hear it, you can check
7363480	7364480	it out on iTunes.
7364480	7369200	Anyhow, we're going to get back into the show tonight. Let's go ahead and go into rapid
7369200	7372480	fire news first because I failed to load the Twitter topics during the break.
7372480	7373480	Fail.
7373480	7376000	I know. Well, we only had a short break tonight. So while I get that up, we'll go ahead and
7376000	7378440	do rapid fire news and then we will do Twitter topics.
7378440	7384640	Well, Final Fantasy 13 is coming out a lot sooner than it is over here in Japan. Well,
7384640	7390320	they're going to be getting some extra content as well, including a new camp or a campaign
7390320	7397120	code, which will be used in Final Fantasy 14. What exactly does that mean? Who knows?
7397120	7399360	But it's something that's exclusive if you buy...
7399360	7401280	Horse armor.
7401280	7404040	Could very well be horse armor or a campaign to get horse armor.
7404040	7405300	Or it could be horseshit.
7405300	7408520	Or how about this? There are no horses in Final Fantasy.
7408520	7409520	Oh my God.
7409520	7410520	Sorry.
7410520	7411520	Chocobo armor.
7411520	7412520	That'd be cool.
7412520	7413520	Like tactics.
7413520	7415520	It's bird crap.
7415520	7419160	Actually, when a lot of folks saw the previews for one of those Final Fantasy games, I think
7419160	7422480	it was Eleven that first showed it, that a lot of people were like, cool, Chocobos and
7422480	7423480	armor. Cool.
7423480	7425400	I thought that was tactics to have that.
7425400	7428600	Oh, maybe it was. Maybe it does go that far back. I wouldn't be surprised.
7428600	7429600	Anyways.
7429600	7432840	Hold on. Can we just have a moment to reflect on what a great fucking game Final Fantasy
7432840	7433840	Tactics was?
7433840	7434840	I didn't like it.
7434840	7435840	What?
7435840	7436840	Get out.
7436840	7437840	I don't like tactics games.
7437840	7438840	What?
7438840	7439840	Oh my God.
7439840	7440840	Do I really do this show with you guys?
7440840	7441840	I really don't like tactics games.
7441840	7442840	Oh my God.
7442840	7443840	Final Fantasy Tactics is amazing.
7443840	7445520	I recognize it as an amazing game.
7445520	7449200	I personally do not dig the tactics games.
7449200	7450200	Fine.
7450200	7456640	Command & Conquer 4 has been announced to be coming out next year on March 16th.
7456640	7460560	They call it Tiberian Twilight, and I hate that subtitle because it reminds me of that
7460560	7463880	crappy vampire movie series and book series.
7463880	7465480	Happy series in general.
7465480	7469580	Did you know that Burger King Neuros is staying open 24 hours for two days because of the
7469580	7471160	stupid Twilight movies?
7471160	7472360	That's sad.
7472360	7475240	Why would Burger King- I mean, I realize they have the whole Twilight promotion.
7475240	7478600	Yeah, they have a big old Twilight promotion going, it's on the crowns.
7478600	7479600	That's blasphemy.
7479600	7480600	Blasphemy.
7480600	7481600	Sorry.
7481600	7482880	Anyways, the game will-
7482880	7486040	I was so bored this week, Loki, when I was sick.
7486040	7491620	I was watching the Rachael Ray show, and that right there should tell you something.
7491620	7497760	She was giving makeovers to Twilight fans to make them look like Twilight characters.
7497760	7498920	And I'm just sitting there going-
7498920	7500600	Isn't she supposed to cook?
7500600	7503040	I would rather be at work.
7503040	7504520	So she took them the hot topic.
7504520	7505520	Alright, just keep-
7505520	7507400	I thought she was supposed to cook.
7507400	7508400	Keep going.
7508400	7509400	I'm sorry.
7509400	7513460	Anyways, the game will conclude the Tiberian storyline, and yeah, it'll be coming out also
7513460	7515160	March 19th in Europe.
7515160	7516160	So that's kinda cool.
7516160	7519560	And then finally, Wok- or, Wokban.
7519560	7522560	I'm sorry, no Wokban this- but Rockban, though.
7522560	7531320	We will be getting some wonderful download content in the form of a pack from AFI, including
7531320	7537000	songs Beautiful Thieves, End Transmission, Love Like Winter, Medicate, and the Leaving
7537000	7539840	Song Part 2.
7539840	7542640	I like Love Like Winter, that's a good song.
7542640	7549400	And that'll be available as a pack for 680 Microsoft points, or $8.50 in real money.
7549400	7554120	And of course, available individually for $2 each, or 160 Microsoft points, or 200 Wii
7554120	7556120	points, you know, you can kinda figure that out.
7556120	7559960	And finally, the individual song for this week, though, is The Bangles, Walk Like an
7559960	7563880	Egyptian, which also goes over for $2.
7563880	7571000	And for the PSP, Dead Kennedys, California, Uber Allies, or Uber Alls?
7571000	7573920	They spelled allies wrong, stupid.
7573920	7577640	Sleater Kinney with You're No Rock and Roll Fun.
7577640	7579880	And that's also $2.
7579880	7583400	Dude, Walk Like an Egyptian I think would actually be kind of a hard song to play.
7583400	7585680	I seem to remember it had a very fast guitar and drum part.
7585680	7587680	It's a song that people recognize.
7587680	7589480	People like songs that people can recognize.
7589480	7590480	Exactly.
7590480	7595160	But now I'm trying to think about what the game Walkban would look like.
7595160	7601760	I can picture just these horrible, horrific stereotypes that really shouldn't be repeated,
7601760	7605600	but that's just what pops into my mind, I can't help it, but I'm sure it would be a
7605600	7607720	hideous, hideously racist game.
7607720	7610480	50 different renditions of I'm turning Japanese.
7610480	7614480	All right, anyhow, moving on to another rapid fire news tonight.
7614480	7619080	The Wireless N network adapter has made its way out to America.
7619080	7622880	If you want to pay $100 for it, the Wireless N networking adapter is out.
7622880	7625840	It's dual band, 5 gigahertz, 2 point...
7625840	7626960	You know what?
7626960	7630240	I'm not gonna read all the technical specs, because I'm just not that nerdy.
7630240	7634920	Just trust me, it's out, and if you like your wireless fast, very fast, then this will get
7634920	7635920	it fast.
7635920	7639240	But do remember, you need an N router, or this will do no good.
7639240	7640240	That is one thing you need.
7640240	7641240	It'll just be no faster.
7641240	7642240	Yeah, oh well, it'll be no faster.
7642240	7646240	It'll just revert to B or G or whatever it is you have in your house.
7646240	7652660	Anyhow, also, Madden NFL Arcade coming out November 24th and 25th, depending on what
7652660	7654320	platform you're on.
7654320	7660560	It will come out for $15 on the PlayStation Network, 1200 Microsoft points on their respective
7660560	7662400	service.
7662400	7664480	This is Madden NFL Arcade.
7664480	7665480	I'm assuming...
7665480	7669160	I don't know a whole lot more about this game, but I'm assuming this just plays a little
7669160	7674080	more like, not so probably intense with your play picks and so forth.
7674080	7675080	It's probably just more of a...
7675080	7676800	It's like 30 yards.
7676800	7677800	It's almost like...
7677800	7681280	Probably like, I would imagine like Tecmo Bowl back in the day or something.
7681280	7682280	Was it so...
7682280	7683280	Yeah, maybe.
7683280	7686280	This is actually, to be honest, this looks like the type of football game I could get
7686280	7690360	into where it's just not overly complicated with all this technical stuff.
7690360	7695240	It almost reminds me of arena football because, I mean, they are playing on 30 yard fields
7695240	7699160	and it's really fast and...
7699160	7700720	I don't know.
7700720	7703920	It's just another excuse to get you to spend money on this because, hey, they tried it
7703920	7711120	with NBA and with NHL, so why not try it with Madden, their number one selling sports franchise?
7711120	7712120	Why not?
7712120	7713120	They can make...
7713120	7715160	I mean, $15 is not exactly...
7715160	7717600	It's on the higher end of the arcade games.
7717600	7721240	I have to read this comment from chat before I get to the last story I have here.
7721240	7725120	Sj100matt says, Walk band sounds like a parody from South Park.
7725120	7730440	Like playing Rampart to keep the Mongolians from ripping down my shitty wall.
7730440	7737120	Lastly, for me for rapid fire news tonight, Criterions developed a need for speed game
7737120	7740600	is making its way out next year.
7740600	7745160	That is official, I guess, from Criterion Games website.
7745160	7753920	I don't know if that is the need for speed online game, but it's another game coming
7753920	7756400	out there from Criterion is next year.
7756400	7761560	So if you like your, you know, explosive car wrecks, there you go.
7761560	7765720	Well, Star Trek Online, how's this for Gear Switch?
7765720	7772600	Will be out on February 2nd, 2010, or if you want to go by the star date, uh, 63554.5.
7772600	7778120	Um, but yeah, I am totally, totally, totally very happy with that because I will be playing
7778120	7779720	the hell out of it.
7779720	7789760	And also, um, they were, um, saying that, um, the events that happened in the movie
7789760	7792560	affect the game.
7792560	7794480	Even though the movie's a parallel universe thing.
7794480	7795480	Yes.
7795480	7796480	Strange.
7796480	7797480	Maybe this is a reboot universe game.
7797480	7798480	Interesting.
7798480	7799800	That would be very, very interesting.
7799800	7805240	I am, I honestly, my gut reaction to hearing this was already like, I seriously thought
7805240	7806800	it was not going to be till next Christmas.
7806800	7810280	And now I'm sitting here going, Holy crap, it's going to be out in February, February
7810280	7811280	2nd.
7811280	7812280	Oh my God.
7812280	7813280	Bye.
7813280	7814280	Wow.
7814280	7815280	Yeah.
7815280	7822120	Well, um, also, um, new, uh, Beatles right band, uh, download content on November 17th
7822120	7826000	with a Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.
7826000	7831840	So that'll be pretty cool November 17th, not too far to go.
7831840	7840560	Um, also, um, yeah, that's actually going to be for Xbox 360 and Wii.
7840560	7849720	And then, um, for the iPhone, there is a Commodore 64 emulator back on the iPhone store.
7849720	7855120	So I guess they patched out, I remember it was there before and like you could somehow
7855120	7858800	trick it into running basic, but then that means you could write your own code on the
7858800	7859800	iPhone.
7859800	7860800	That's a big no-no.
7860800	7865160	Well, right, because it was rejected because of the basic interpreter.
7865160	7870480	Um, but now they have, um, removed it and then other people figured out how to get back
7870480	7871880	into it.
7871880	7879520	And so, um, apparently now it's just on with even further revised code and also has, um,
7879520	7883760	a boost in performance and three new games, international basketball, international baseball
7883760	7886440	and international tennis.
7886440	7892600	Also included are Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Arctic Shipwreck, Jack Attack and Jupiter Lander.
7892600	7895280	I actually played Le Mans when I was a kid.
7895280	7896680	I remember that game.
7896680	7898720	So those aren't totally obscure games.
7898720	7902240	Some of those, uh, are pretty well known Commodore 64 games.
7902240	7906040	All right, before we get back into more news, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.
7906040	7910360	Uh, we always ask before the show for you to send us your topics to twitter.com slash
7910360	7915800	O-L-R and if you're not following us on Twitter, why not follow us?
7915800	7922600	Enjoy our twit spam twitter.com slash O-L-R is our username OB Orange Lounge Radio.
7922600	7926480	Sturlock tweeted us tonight wanting to know, I'm curious what your guys' opinion is on
7926480	7929480	the visually impaired gamer suing Sony.
7929480	7934520	As a blind gamer myself, I find it to be a bad move and I had no idea what Sturlock was
7934520	7936120	talking about, but I found it interesting.
7936120	7937120	So I tweeted back.
7937120	7938600	I said, give me a link.
7938600	7940480	And Sturlock gave me a link.
7940480	7944800	And so we have, I hadn't heard about this, but you know, keep in mind I was a little
7944800	7946160	bit out of it for a week.
7946160	7951640	So here's the story has to do with, um, a visually impaired gamer who has basically
7951640	7953120	sued Sony.
7953120	7957800	And a lot of this has to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that quote,
7957800	7961640	no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and
7961640	7965760	equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations
7965760	7970240	of any place of public accommodation by any persons who owns leases or leases to or operates
7970240	7971760	a place of public accommodation.
7971760	7977120	So in other words, you know, you can't discriminate against somebody for a disability, whether
7977120	7981340	that be blindness, deafness, uh, can't use your legs.
7981340	7985360	So you're bound to a wheelchair, you know, whatever it is, uh, you have to kind of have
7985360	7987900	equal opportunities for everybody.
7987900	7993080	So anyway, um, according to this lawsuit, Sony has apparently ignored requests through
7993080	7999640	mail, email, and so forth to make modifications to the games to make them more accessible.
7999640	8005040	Um, I don't know why though, but I guess this thing actually gets into massively multiplayer
8005040	8010600	online titles requesting the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations
8010600	8014360	for gamers with disability impaired visual processing.
8014360	8019280	Um, so it's kind of interesting to hear this lawsuit comes to light.
8019280	8021840	I would have liked to hear more about, and I think Strelok's in chat, I'd kind of like
8021840	8029640	to hear more about his feelings against the story, um, cause I think that's kind of interesting.
8029640	8032680	Um, you know, it's, it's tough.
8032680	8039080	I can imagine it's, it's very tough to have a disability such as blindness or deafness.
8039080	8042560	And this isn't the first time we've had a listener who has a major disability, it's
8042560	8044220	kind of talking about games.
8044220	8048480	And I think a lot of these things that we take for granted sometimes, like for instance,
8048480	8053600	have we ever sat here and said, oh man, the graphics in the game were awesome and just
8053600	8057520	everything looks so real and the water effects were so cool.
8057520	8062680	And we have to sometimes realize like, not everybody like sees that, you know, I know
8062680	8067840	what they do in the movie world is that, um, they actually will release movies into theaters.
8067840	8072380	Um, at particular showings throughout the day or a special, you know, theater time or
8072380	8078080	whatever where they actually have, or a device that actually describes the scenes to folks
8078080	8080320	while they're watching the movie.
8080320	8084120	You know, because if you can't see what's going on, it might actually say, you know,
8084120	8088080	Tom Cruise's character is walking into a bar or something, you know, like that type of
8088080	8089080	thing.
8089080	8091560	It'll actually kind of describe the scenes for you, which, you know, makes sense.
8091560	8096200	Just like we have close captioning for deaf folks, you know, who can't, you know, we'll
8096200	8100240	see that and it'll be little musical notes of someone singing or what have you, you know,
8100240	8102000	there's other little ways they accommodate.
8102000	8105840	Video games don't really have a lot of that.
8105840	8108980	Does the ADA really apply here though?
8108980	8110080	I'm not so sure.
8110080	8112880	I think it might be a little bit of extreme to say that.
8112880	8119800	I think certainly though, there is a statement being said here though, that a game company
8119800	8126080	that could cater to this could certainly bring in an audience that a lot of folks seem to
8126080	8127080	be neglecting.
8127080	8129080	Does that make sense?
8129080	8130080	Well, yeah.
8130080	8137160	It's just, there's, there's certain things that I think people need to have a reasonable
8137160	8142000	expectation about that this is for an MMO, right?
8142000	8144840	Well, I think in part, but this is about games in general.
8144840	8146480	I mean, imagine if you were blind.
8146480	8155060	There are some, yeah, that it has to do with the type of game with, like, for example,
8155060	8163320	if it's, if it's something that as a game requires a number of visual clues, if I personally,
8163320	8167040	this is just me cause I, you know, for example, okay.
8167040	8172800	When my hand was hurting, I could not physically play any game except for singing in rock band
8172800	8176280	and I don't like to sing, but I sing in rock band so I could play.
8176280	8180760	I know that's a weak excuse, but I'm just using it as a personal example.
8180760	8186160	I think that if, if it's a game that yes, modifications can be made to it so that someone
8186160	8192560	can participate, there needs to be a release or like a server or some way that you can
8192560	8197840	enable somebody to do that, but if it is something that requires, you know, visual clues so strongly
8197840	8206360	that there is no possible way to simulate the same feel of the game through any other
8206360	8210560	course of action, like if you could do it with sound, that would be great, especially
8210560	8214240	if you could have a big speaker set up over your monitor that you could use directional
8214240	8215520	sound like that.
8215520	8222800	That's one thing, but you're talking about, um, this has to do with the bottom line.
8222800	8228420	The company's main concern is going to be, is your business going to be worth the money
8228420	8232000	that we're going to spend to keep your business?
8232000	8237400	And I don't, I don't really think that it applies, that the ADA is going to apply, apply
8237400	8245160	to that because I mean, like for example, you know, say that, um, I say that I damaged
8245160	8248240	my larynx and I really wanted to sing in rock band.
8248240	8251320	There's no possible way they can make me able to sing.
8251320	8252320	I'm sorry.
8252320	8253320	They can't do it.
8253320	8256720	You know, maybe I can play a keyboard or something with it.
8256720	8257720	That's reasonable.
8257720	8263440	But do you see what my point is is that there are just some things that you cannot compensate
8263440	8264440	for.
8264440	8267040	I think the bottom line though, and I think the point that Strelok was trying to make
8267040	8270920	with the story is that, you know, the lawsuit's not really the way to go about making your
8270920	8271920	point.
8271920	8273160	And I think that's what he disagrees with.
8273160	8277160	Um, you know, and I, I to some extent say, yeah, you know, a lawsuit's a little silly.
8277160	8279200	We have enough frivolous lawsuits in this country.
8279200	8284720	I think the key is reward the companies that address your needs.
8284720	8285720	Exactly.
8285720	8291320	You know, if there's MMOs out there that give those better audio clues to the things that,
8291320	8296040	you know, sometimes we take for granted as visual, you know, descriptions or, you know,
8296040	8300960	giving you more directional type of, you know, sound or clues or whatever it may be, reward
8300960	8302680	those companies for their efforts.
8302680	8304120	Or even a special video mode.
8304120	8308920	Cause I know that in some cases, certain colors will register in, in different types of blindness
8308920	8313200	that others won't have, like, you know, a special color filter mode cause you can easily
8313200	8314200	do that.
8314200	8318300	And you know, some games do that, like a lot of puzzle games, you can switch from colors
8318300	8319300	to patterns.
8319300	8322120	You know, there's little, little things they do.
8322120	8324640	Some games have had colorblind mode.
8324640	8328300	Or even, and I think this is kind of funny to joke about it as a disability cause it's
8328300	8330680	really not, but lefty mode in a lot of games.
8330680	8334920	Let's face it, there's a lot of things that sometimes the right-handed folks take for
8334920	8335920	granted that left...
8335920	8338080	Changing flashes in DDR for epilepsy.
8338080	8339080	Interesting.
8339080	8340080	Yeah.
8340080	8343680	So there's, there's lots of very interesting little subtle changes that they, they try
8343680	8347700	to do in games to make them more accessible and I think, you know, we reward companies
8347700	8348700	that do that.
8348700	8353280	Well also the, and I hate to say that this stinks of, of that situation where there's
8353280	8357960	a one lawyer, um, wheelchair bound, who was going around to, actually not even going to
8357960	8363200	some of these places, picking places like, uh, Julian California, they did it there,
8363200	8368440	um, forcing businesses to either go out of business or spend all this money to make places
8368440	8374320	accessible when the places were accessible anyway and you're going back and suing places
8374320	8375320	that he had never been to.
8375320	8380560	You know, some people actually seek to, and this is, this is a problem that I have with
8380560	8385600	the American Disabilities Act is that, and I, I, there's a lot of good that came from
8385600	8386600	it.
8386600	8387600	Don't get me wrong.
8387600	8388600	I think there is a lot of good that came from it.
8388600	8394760	And I think that if a company wants the business, they do need to cater to everybody.
8394760	8397840	They need to be courteous.
8397840	8400680	I don't think there should be a law to force people to be courteous, but they should be
8400680	8401680	courteous.
8401680	8404400	They should be mindful of their clientele.
8404400	8409920	At the same time, I think that it opened up a lot of doors for abuse, a lot of doors for
8409920	8414760	abuse because now, and, and see, and again, I'm actually out of work right now under the
8414760	8418600	American Disabilities Act because I physically could not use my hand.
8418600	8419680	I was grateful for it.
8419680	8424000	It gave me the recovery time I needed, but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to go
8424000	8425920	to work and say, you're forcing me to do my job.
8425920	8428640	I'm suing.
8428640	8431200	You know, it's the same thing.
8431200	8440800	I think that it's actually trying to, trying to take advantage of your disadvantage.
8440800	8441800	You know what I mean?
8441800	8442800	Yeah.
8442800	8445460	So I don't, I don't want to drag this out for too long, but I think maybe the bottom
8445460	8452000	line of the story is that don't forget blind people, deaf people, you know, whatever, all
8452000	8454660	these different types of disabilities have money too.
8454660	8458560	And if you're going to cut them out of your game, you're not going to get their money.
8458560	8464080	So something developers have to be mindful for seriously, just playing the one, the one
8464080	8465080	suing.
8465080	8466080	Yeah.
8466080	8467080	Well, play another game.
8467080	8469200	If they're going to be bitches, why do you want them to have your money?
8469200	8470200	All right.
8470200	8473120	Anyhow, let's move on with some more tweets.
8473120	8476140	Fernando on the Twitter says Philharmonic band.
8476140	8477140	Yes or no.
8477140	8480720	I, I, it's kind of a broad question.
8480720	8484680	If you're, if you're going to join a Philharmonic band, um, I was a band geek.
8484680	8485800	Dark soccer was a band geek.
8485800	8487200	Loki, were you a band geek?
8487200	8488200	Nope.
8488200	8489560	If you're a band geek, one out of three say join the band.
8489560	8493360	It's a, it's a good experience, but I don't know, it could be talking about like a CD
8493360	8494360	coming out or something.
8494360	8495360	I don't know.
8495360	8496360	It's kind of broad.
8496360	8503560	Um, Ray Iannami says, OLR modern warfare two gets a 9.5 from IGN and a 1.5 reader average.
8503560	8507120	And I actually tweeted back cause I was kind of like, okay, well the sales figures don't
8507120	8508120	say 1.5.
8508120	8511720	So I said, Oh, is this people like spamming it with negative reviews?
8511720	8513880	Cause they're like, they're doing the Amazon thing.
8513880	8517120	They're spamming negative reviews cause they're pissed about the server lockout.
8517120	8520800	And Ray Iannami says, yes, people who bought the PC version claim it's like paint playing
8520800	8523440	a console FPS on a PC.
8523440	8530600	Well don't buy it and don't let us catch you on a steam play in the game and get screenshots
8530600	8531600	of it.
8531600	8534920	Cause that says way more than a silly 1.5 average on some side.
8534920	8538520	I don't even read anyway, ever will.
8538520	8540080	I don't know what else to say about that.
8540080	8546160	Rhetortainment says, uh, of these three major releases recently, which is the best uncharted
8546160	8549240	2, the ballot of gay Tony or modern warfare 2.
8549240	8552400	See, I haven't played any of those games.
8552400	8554680	Yeah, it just depends on the person you ask.
8554680	8557840	Uh, certainly those are all games that are going to be up there and we talk about game
8557840	8561940	of the year, maybe not so much gay Tony cause it's an expansion last year's game.
8561940	8566520	But um, if you're talking about which one do I have the most hype for, I really want
8566520	8571000	to check out uncharted 2 cause that just seems like the game I would enjoy most out of the
8571000	8572000	three.
8572000	8573000	But that's just me.
8573000	8575340	You know, I think they're, they're just different games.
8575340	8578320	It really depends on the type of gamer it is.
8578320	8581020	Um, blue swim tweets.
8581020	8584960	What do you think of crush 40 of Sonic adventure fame coming to the rock band network?
8584960	8589300	I hadn't heard, but I guess it was inevitable that some of these, um, you know, video game
8589300	8591440	related bands are going to come out through the rock band network.
8591440	8592440	That's pretty cool.
8592440	8596240	Also, any thoughts on Steven Tyler leaving Aerosmith?
8596240	8598240	He's not going to leave Aerosmith.
8598240	8599760	It's all, it's all for show.
8599760	8602040	They're fighting like any family does after a while.
8602040	8604000	He had a diva tantrum.
8604000	8605000	He had a diva tantrum.
8605000	8606000	Exactly.
8606000	8607000	He had a diva tantrum.
8607000	8608000	They'll work it out.
8608000	8610800	They'll probably be on break for a little while, but they'll bring it out.
8610800	8612920	Um, they were on a break.
8612920	8617040	The seg who we had on the show a couple of weeks ago says if you have time, review child's
8617040	8620720	play charity and mention not only umlaut, of course we had on the show a couple of weeks
8620720	8624520	ago, that event happening in just a few weeks at this point, God umlaut it's like a month
8624520	8629740	away and other events like desert bus on events page at child's play.
8629740	8633160	So yeah, this is the season for child's play, obviously the holiday season.
8633160	8635840	So I'm definitely check out some of the stuff they're doing.
8635840	8641740	I'm just looking at this desert bus tweet, which is a desert bus D E S E R T bus on Twitter.
8641740	8643480	It is the desert bus for hope charity.
8643480	8648240	I wonder if this is the same thing that they did from last year where they actually sat
8648240	8652760	and played that desert bus game on the feed.
8652760	8656680	I guess they are desert bus.org and actually go and look at the feed and watch them play
8656680	8660320	this incredibly boring freaking game, but it's all for a good cause.
8660320	8664080	Why don't you play a better game for a good cause?
8664080	8665080	That's my thing.
8665080	8668040	I mean, it's like, seriously, if you're going to do it anyways, just play a better game.
8668040	8671680	Well, I think it goes back to that whole thing, like people like to pay to watch other people
8671680	8672680	be tortured.
8672680	8679660	Well, then they should play was at that, uh, the, uh, it was a, uh, Takashi game.
8679660	8684440	They had one member Takashi hated, uh, games and so it made it really hard.
8684440	8685440	Oh yeah.
8685440	8686440	I heard about that.
8686440	8688220	Um, let's see.
8688220	8691480	One other thing I want to say, I can't get to all the tweets and there's a lot of stuff
8691480	8693400	mixed in here.
8693400	8700000	Um, Tiger Claw sends us one that says modern war, modern warfare two is banned in Russia
8700000	8705200	and actually sent us a link here to a website, uh, that talks about console versions of modern
8705200	8709780	warfare two have been banned in Russia and it's due to the content of the no Russian
8709780	8713240	mission and that's the controversial airport massacre level.
8713240	8717480	And uh, I guess the Russian government didn't like that.
8717480	8722220	He's the ire of the Russian gaming public as well as some politicians.
8722220	8727400	That's the problem when you do games that are like loosely based on faux historical
8727400	8728400	events.
8728400	8729400	You know what I mean?
8729400	8730580	Like you kind of make up these things that happen.
8730580	8734880	You're probably going to piss some people off, you know, whether it's fake or not.
8734880	8738380	So um, hopefully they get all that worked out.
8738380	8741680	Probably they'll have to release an edited version of the game if they want to release
8741680	8742680	it there.
8742680	8746240	Cause if the government wants to ban a game, they can.
8746240	8747240	And they will.
8747240	8751080	In Soviet Russia, I can't play you.
8751080	8754280	All right, let's move on with some more stories here.
8754280	8757240	Uh, Loki started us off with a story about Gran Turismo.
8757240	8762520	Yes, Gran Turismo, the game that will just never come out and now it's just taking even
8762520	8768440	longer because they're saying that it's being held up for marketing reasons, which is retarded.
8768440	8770280	Just say development, okay?
8770280	8774480	Not marketing because then that just says, oh yeah, we could release it, but we're going
8774480	8775900	to be assholes.
8775900	8781440	So Gran Turismo 5 will not be coming out now, um, well I guess it will be released in Japan
8781440	8783440	March 2010.
8783440	8786100	Everywhere else is kind of up in the air.
8786100	8791360	So um, no word on when we're going to get it, but Japan will get it possibly in March
8791360	8795280	2010 unless there's some more marketing they have to do over there.
8795280	8796280	Marketing reasons?
8796280	8797280	That's so weird.
8797280	8802240	Yeah, it says, we will release Gran Turismo 5 March in Japan, but for other regions it
8802240	8805400	has not been decided yet.
8805400	8809920	And this is asked by a motoring magazine, what the holdup was in the western release
8809920	8811240	of the game.
8811240	8819980	That's more depending on Sony Computer Entertainment America's marketing decisions.
8819980	8824800	What is the problem with just releasing a game and then marketing it?
8824800	8827200	Like why does it have to be marketed right out the gate?
8827200	8830000	Are day one numbers that critical to a game's success?
8830000	8835680	Yeah, but also you have to figure that, I'm not positive if it falls with them, but at
8835680	8840160	the same time, you know, they're going to be having God of War 3 coming out, at least
8840160	8841160	in the US.
8841160	8843600	Um, that's supposed to be sometime in March.
8843600	8850120	So perhaps they're going to try to, you know, sandbag the next year numbers by releasing
8850120	8855440	it in the first quarter of their financial 2010 year, or 2011, I don't know how they're
8855440	8859840	really counting it, but um, and usually a lot of the game companies, their financial
8859840	8863440	year starts either in April or kind of at the end of March, and that's why you'll see
8863440	8871320	kind of a second, or I guess the first big push for games, kind of sandbagged into March
8871320	8875080	because they're trying to pad their numbers to make their years look better, and then
8875080	8879760	all of a sudden they'll be just a big dead lol for the rest of the summer until the fourth
8879760	8880760	quarter.
8880760	8884360	So, that's kind of probably what they're doing.
8884360	8891720	Alright, well, uh, moving on to the games that are a lot closer to its release.
8891720	8895840	One versus 100, of course, had its early first season happen, and then the games kind of
8895840	8898240	disappeared for a little while, but guess what?
8898240	8902600	Season 2 is starting November 19th at 5 o'clock Pacific.
8902600	8907800	One versus 100 extended play begins then to get you all warmed up for season 2.
8907800	8912440	More than a half a million people competed in the 15 week beta season, and they're trying
8912440	8915200	to get even more people to show up for round 2.
8915200	8918840	Extended play, I guess, is now going to have themed trivia every weeknight, although I
8918840	8923360	assume they'll still have kind of some general trivia too, and then of course the more extended
8923360	8927200	play you play, apparently you have a better chance of being picked as one of the mob,
8927200	8933040	or even the one themselves, and you get to compete for actual prizes, woo!
8933040	8937000	Two million Microsoft points apparently were given during the first season.
8937000	8939060	No you get Microsoft Space Bucks.
8939060	8941840	It's not really cash, but in Microsoft's world it's cash.
8941840	8944320	It's not like Smash TV.
8944320	8945960	So there you go.
8945960	8949000	More money, more prizes, I love it!
8949000	8952720	As much as we're kind of making fun of it now, this actually is, of sorts, kind of like
8952720	8956840	a groundbreaking game, and I think is one of the huge things that Xbox 360 has going
8956840	8959240	for it right now that no other system has.
8959240	8962240	My only wish is that they would do more games.
8962240	8964560	Like why another season of one versus 100?
8964560	8968880	How about some like Price is Right or Press Your Luck, or I don't know, I understand
8968880	8969880	one versus one.
8969880	8970880	Price is Right would be so awesome.
8970880	8971880	Amazing.
8971880	8976000	Amazeballs, as they say.
8976000	8977720	But I'll take one versus one hundred season two.
8977720	8979120	Everybody loves a good trivia game.
8979120	8980360	It'll be a lot of fun.
8980360	8984480	So, Dark Sakura, any plans to join in on one versus one hundred season two?
8984480	8985480	Nope.
8985480	8986520	Well, fine.
8986520	8987720	I'll play by myself.
8987720	8989840	I have other stuff to play.
8989840	8990840	Like what?
8990840	8995200	Like a game that's coming out on the 8th of December over here in the US.
8995200	8996960	Yes.
8996960	8998840	Silent Hill Shadow Memories.
8998840	8999840	Woo hoo!
8999840	9007800	Which is the Wii-make of the original PlayStation 1 with twists here and there.
9007800	9011600	It's actually a re-imaging of the first one.
9011600	9020080	So you can go through it with the Wii mode as a flashlight and, well, there's no combat
9020080	9021200	in it.
9021200	9027120	But the cool thing though that Climax is keeping is all the stuff that Akira Yamaoka did for
9027120	9031200	the music, so that's going to be really happy.
9031200	9033200	I'm just really, really looking forward to it.
9033200	9035480	I think it's going to be fantastic.
9035480	9039240	And it better scare the crap out of me.
9039240	9040240	Just saying.
9040240	9044920	It was one of the more fun demos I played at E3, so I'm excited about it.
9044920	9046200	I saw something.
9046200	9047520	What are you gasping at over there?
9047520	9051720	On an ad for this article that made me just go, ahh!
9051720	9052720	What?
9052720	9054720	A boy and his blob!
9054720	9055720	You didn't know that?
9055720	9056720	Like a few weeks ago.
9056720	9057720	A few weeks ago.
9057720	9058720	I didn't know!
9058720	9062720	And apparently no one else did either because it only sold like 9,000 units.
9062720	9065160	Dude, I have to get this!
9065160	9066160	9,200 actually.
9066160	9067160	Wow.
9067160	9069160	Well, it's about to be 9,201.
9069160	9071160	Dark Soccer's very happy.
9071160	9072160	9,201.
9072160	9073160	Alright!
9073160	9080600	But see, seriously though, boy and his blob, no advertising, 9,200 units, I mean we could
9080600	9082240	easily do that with President Cat.
9082240	9087320	This is why, again, I heard those stories about President Cat only selling 100 copies
9087320	9090560	and I know I went off on the last show we had.
9090560	9091600	I just don't believe it.
9091600	9092600	I'm sorry.
9092600	9097600	Like if a game like boy and his blob sells 9,200 in this country, I can't believe President
9097600	9098940	Cat only sold 100 units.
9098940	9101920	And by the way, there was an awesome article on Kotaku.
9101920	9105720	I don't want to talk about President Cat every week on the show, but Kotaku did an awesome
9105720	9110600	piece that kind of called out those sites that were showing like the pictures with nobody
9110600	9114840	in them where you could clearly see there were barricades, so the booth just wasn't
9114840	9115840	open yet.
9115840	9120080	Fucking called those sites out by showing another picture later in the day that had
9120080	9121360	a lot of people there.
9121360	9125200	And like basically kind of saying like, well all these sites are just misrepresenting what's
9125200	9126200	going on.
9126200	9131720	Although, granted President Cat probably wasn't in the top 50 sales figures, well, I mean,
9131720	9134480	I don't think any of us really thought it was going to be.
9134480	9136920	But see the thing is though- But neither was boy and his blob, that's for
9136920	9137920	sure.
9137920	9140880	The people who were there, I'm sure, you know, I mean, the fact that they actually had like
9140880	9145360	a booth and were doing signings or whatever, that's more than you can say that, you know,
9145360	9148360	big buck hunting or buck fever is going to do.
9148360	9151720	I mean, buck fever is going to sell a lot because people are like, oh, hunting game
9151720	9152720	me buy.
9152720	9154480	You know, I mean, whereas with-
9154480	9157560	That's exactly what they say too at Walmart.
9157560	9160440	Well, with like, you know, President Cat people are going to be like, oh my God, cute cat
9160440	9161440	game.
9161440	9162440	And they're going to buy that.
9162440	9163440	And that's what's going to happen.
9163440	9169840	And boy and his blob, they're like, uh, uh, blob, no, boy, I like boy, no, no, I don't
9169840	9170840	like boys.
9170840	9171840	That's wrong.
9171840	9172840	You know?
9172840	9176360	Where in the hell were you going with that, Loki?
9176360	9177920	I don't even know.
9177920	9178920	That's funny.
9178920	9184640	No, but you know, again, I, I, I love that they called out those sites that like, you
9184640	9187740	know, what are you, what are you guys trying to start?
9187740	9190460	Like really know your facts before you report on them.
9190460	9194680	And there were some pretty big sites that were running this story that, you know, this
9194680	9201160	big failure of a launch event or whatever, you know what, there's a lot of launch events
9201160	9205240	that aren't going to cause lines to line up around the block.
9205240	9206240	You know what I mean?
9206240	9207240	That doesn't mean it was a failure.
9207240	9211480	I'm telling you, if that game came out over here at $20, it would sell like hotcakes.
9211480	9212480	And you know why?
9212480	9214680	Because people consume those $20 games like nothing.
9214680	9215680	It doesn't matter.
9215680	9217000	Everybody fucking loves cats.
9217000	9219080	It doesn't matter if it's good or not.
9219080	9221440	Your average consumer doesn't give a shit.
9221440	9226240	If it has cats and it looks like it has games in it, they're going to buy it.
9226240	9227240	And you know what?
9227240	9232840	If you just spend some time marketing it, um, just to even blog sites or even just,
9232840	9238840	you know, in, in store advertisement or something like that, it would sell like hotcakes.
9238840	9239840	It's just the effort.
9239840	9244040	And a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, don't put any effort out there.
9244040	9246640	They expect everybody else to kind of just sell it for them.
9246640	9250760	Anyway, I just want to give major props to Kotaku for calling those people out that ran
9250760	9251940	that story.
9251940	9254600	Think twice before you dish out your haterade, folks.
9254600	9255920	Think twice.
9255920	9259360	Anyhow, uh, Loki, next story.
9259360	9260360	Yes.
9260360	9265680	So the iPhone gets all sorts of crazy games, and there's a new one now that has you in
9265680	9269880	the role of a firefighter called Firefighter 360.
9269880	9273600	And it's actually kind of an augmented reality game.
9273600	9280560	It will create fires, um, using the camera, um, on the phone actually creates fires in
9280560	9285000	real life, but not really real fires, just it makes it look like there's fires in real
9285000	9286000	life, you know.
9286000	9289840	And you put them out, and you save, you know, digital people that happen to be, you know,
9289840	9294840	kind of wandering around in your augmented reality fire.
9294840	9301400	But uh, yeah, it's kind of neat, and um, of course, it will, it's um, out already.
9301400	9305040	And the price, you can't beat the price, 99 cents.
9305040	9309960	That's a good, that's, the only price that's better is free, but that's, for a game is
9309960	9311400	a pretty good price.
9311400	9315780	Very strange though, so like, if I were to download this game right now, and hold out
9315780	9321760	my phone like this, like, I would, there would be a fire on Loki, Loki would be on fire and
9321760	9326320	I would have to put it out with my water gun.
9326320	9330960	That's kind of strange, but I love that idea of kind of like using the iPhone camera and
9330960	9335920	making a game out of it, even though this sounds a little cheesy, that's kind of interesting.
9335920	9340680	I don't, like, it's interesting that more developers are thinking of how to use like,
9340680	9345360	you know, how can we use some of these devices that are unique to the iPhone to make a game
9345360	9346360	out of it.
9346360	9350720	So although this game sounds a little cheesy, I think the whole idea that it exists in the
9350720	9352120	first place is kind of cool.
9352120	9356880	And someone asked, what happens when you point it at real fire, does the fire catch fire?
9356880	9357880	Nice.
9357880	9361840	That's crazy deep.
9361840	9366120	That's kind of like that question about what happens when a tree falls in the woods or
9366120	9367120	something.
9367120	9371040	It goes, ah!
9371040	9373680	Is that it that's going on in the iPhone world, Loki?
9373680	9378640	Well, there's other things, and this is actually something more of Jamie's alley, though.
9378640	9384080	R-Type is coming to the iPhone, or iPod Touch, I guess.
9384080	9393600	It's basically, I don't know, it looks kind of neat, and they're basically collaborating
9393600	9401000	with Irem Software Engineering, I guess the company in there put it out, and they didn't
9401000	9404400	say which version it was going to be based off of, but hey, it's R-Type, it's on the
9404400	9405400	iPhone.
9405400	9406400	That'd be cool.
9406400	9409720	Hopefully it doesn't control like shit, because that's a lot of the problem with these console
9409720	9410720	ports to the iPhone.
9410720	9411720	Yeah.
9411720	9412720	They just control like shit.
9412720	9413720	That is a problem.
9413720	9418440	They just put a touch screen on the iPhone, iPod Touch, whatever, and that doesn't work
9418440	9419440	for a lot of games.
9419440	9423760	I'm sorry, but the whole like fake joystick thing sucks.
9423760	9429040	Apple, if they want more games, they should just release something that plugs into the
9429040	9431580	bottom that gives you a little controller.
9431580	9432920	How hard would that be?
9432920	9434440	How hard would that be?
9434440	9438160	Not very, exactly.
9438160	9441800	But then I guess the whole thought would be, well, not everybody would have one, so then
9441800	9446400	these games wouldn't be open to everybody, da-da-da-da-da, well, you know, have like
9446400	9448760	control scheme choices or something.
9448760	9449760	I don't know.
9449760	9451440	Have a detect if it's there, and use that.
9451440	9453360	If not, it uses the on-screen thing.
9453360	9456640	I just think gaming on the iPhone could be so much better if there were like more to
9456640	9459880	control with than just the touch screen, because, you know, there's only so much you can do
9459880	9461640	with your fat thumb.
9461640	9464200	Trust me, I know from experience.
9464200	9467700	Here's one game that I don't think I'll see on the iPhone anytime soon, but I just might
9467700	9471200	see it on the virtual console, Moonwalker.
9471200	9476040	It's actually coming out for the virtual console if the European rating PEGI site is to be
9476040	9477040	believed.
9477040	9480880	Of course, the rating board websites in various countries often seem to spill the beans when
9480880	9485240	it comes to what games are soon coming out on virtual console or, you know, PlayStation
9485240	9487200	Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and so forth.
9487200	9491080	Remember back in the day when they said that the ESRB wasn't going to do that anymore,
9491080	9492080	yet they still do?
9492080	9494640	Now it's just the foreign websites that are doing it instead, because this is from the
9494640	9495640	European websites.
9495640	9498600	Well, anyhow, of course, Moonwalker was a pretty epic game.
9498600	9501380	It was in the arcade and then, of course, on the Sega Genesis.
9501380	9505440	I'm imagining that this is the Sega Genesis version that's gonna come over, but, of course,
9505440	9508820	they do have arcade games emulatable on the Wii.
9508820	9510280	It's going to be the Genesis version.
9510280	9511280	Yeah.
9511280	9512280	Because I don't think they have any Sega games.
9512280	9513480	No, I guess...
9513480	9514480	No, they do, actually.
9514480	9517860	Didn't Golden Axe come out on the emulator thing?
9517860	9519680	I think you not only can get Golden Axe on the Wii.
9519680	9520800	I think you can get the arcade board.
9520800	9523360	I think Golden Axe Arcade came out, on Wii.
9523360	9526280	So it could be the arcade version, but it's probably the Genesis one.
9526280	9530520	I think it's the Genesis one, because I think that's the one that they actually, um, had
9530520	9535980	like it was, I don't know, it was the one that they had on their wet-listed.
9535980	9540180	This is gonna go the way of my Excitebike review. You'll download it, play it for ten
9540180	9544760	minutes and go, God, Moonwalker was pretty fucking awesome, but I'm already bored of
9544760	9547560	it, and then you'll never play it again, like a lot of virtual console games, but it won't
9547560	9554840	matter because Nintendo and Sega have your money, haha. But, you know, Moonwalker was
9554840	9559440	kind of neat, it was different, but I don't know if it's aged well, I think it's probably
9559440	9563560	more of just cashing in on Michael Jackson's death, which is kind of sad, but, you know,
9563560	9570200	a lot of people are doing it. There's a lot of money to be made in death. Anyhow, I wish
9570200	9573780	they would just do a new Michael Jackson game though, seriously, give us like an awesome
9573780	9578880	new music game that just uses Michael Jackson music, or Michael Jackson and Friends or something.
9578880	9584120	So, alright, anyhow, uh, let's move on to the mailbag. I don't know if we got any emails
9584120	9587640	tonight, I'm hoping we got at least one, because it was looking pretty empty earlier, but of
9587640	9590720	course, then again, you know, it's our own fault, because the shows have been behind,
9590720	9595280	but we'll go ahead and open up the mailbag anyway at mailbag.orangelauncherator.com and
9595280	9598240	see if anything's come in. I did see some tweets about emails, so I imagine there's
9598240	9601840	got to be at least one or two emails in there. So Dark Soccer's going to dive into the mailbag
9601840	9607800	head first and read some emails for us. Yep, um, actually just one from Spazinator. Alrighty
9607800	9612480	then. It's long. Well, it's just one. Hi folks, I was initially going to call in about this
9612480	9617960	subject tonight, but after seeing your tweet asking for mail, I decided to email you instead.
9617960	9623120	This email will be a first for me on your show for one single reason. You see, despite
9623120	9627620	the fact that I've been a fan of Sony Systems since 97, I've decided that it's time to virtually
9627620	9633280	rip Sony a new one. Suffice to say, based on that last statement, it is safe for everyone
9633280	9638320	to assume I'm not happy with Sony right now. Not at all. And it's all due to one reason.
9638320	9644840	Their worthless piece of motherfucking POS DRM on their movies slash video downloads.
9644840	9649760	See the thing is, I have been sinking good hard money into that service every week for
9649760	9654640	movies, TV shows, etc. that I had built up a decent collection, backing it all onto an
9654640	9660240	external HDD as I buy it all. In all, I had sunk several hundred dollars into the video
9660240	9663980	service, while as of this past Friday, all that money went down the drain. See, here's
9663980	9668040	the thing. I was about to launch a game and it had to update before I could play it, but
9668040	9672840	the system froze while it was updating, requiring a hard reset. That, of course, corrupted the
9672840	9678280	game, leaving a large unusable file on my HDD. So the kicker was, I couldn't delete
9678280	9682120	it by highlighting it, pushing triangle, and selecting delete, thus requiring me to reformat
9682120	9687640	my HDD to get rid of it, which I did. I started redownloading my games as per usual, and tried
9687640	9692520	putting my video content back onto my internal HDD and watch it. Here's the so-called good
9692520	9695640	part. I could transfer the videos back, but the DRM was all followed up and the videos
9695640	9699960	were unplayable. As common sense would suggest, I called Sony and explained to the rep what
9699960	9703700	happened. Unfortunately, the response I got back was less than optimal, to put it lightly.
9703700	9707320	To paraphrase, they said I was shit out of luck and had to buy everything all over again.
9707320	9715920	I have to say it, but this is 100% pure, unadulterated, grade A fucking horseshit. I love that term.
9715920	9719760	On one hand, I can sympathize with the fact that they want to curtail any kind of piracy,
9719760	9724040	which is fine, but this could have been handled very differently and in a better manner. I'm
9724040	9727600	reasonably sure that they kept records of what each customer purchases, at least for
9727600	9732840	their own bookkeeping purposes. Also, obviously for videos, one can only have one system activated
9732840	9737000	at one time, so it's not like I could share these videos if I wanted to, not that I would
9737000	9741080	mind you. Frankly, it kills me that I've been supporting them for so long and sunk so much
9741080	9745960	money into that, in the end all, I practically get a fuck you from them and get spat in the
9745960	9751360	face and kicked in the junk. This really is making me seriously consider becoming a rabid
9751360	9756200	360 fanboy, so in closing, and in the event that Sony is listening to the live broadcast
9756200	9761360	or the podcast, I have to say this, fuck you and fuck the drama initiative sharks that
9761360	9767640	you rode in on and subsequently jumped. If Sony wants to keep me as a customer and avoid
9767640	9772840	some serious negative PR, I seriously suggest they fix this issue ASAP. This email was brought
9772840	9778040	to you by Sony's borked DRM, thus rendering this email unreadable. I will say one thing,
9778040	9785200	it's not with Sony, but with Apple. When I had to completely reboot my iPhone and lost
9785200	9791560	everything I downloaded since, well let's see, I did it in February and lost everything
9791560	9796900	since November, the year before. And when I called in, because they keep a record of
9796900	9800760	all of my purchases, I explained to them what happened, I said yeah, I was updating my iPhone
9800760	9805320	for the first time in four months, and I was like, oh okay, well we'll just reauthorize
9805320	9810840	everything up to the last date of your last update. And they did that, and so it was just
9810840	9815360	those things that they set up for me to queue to re-download. Why can't Sony do something
9815360	9818640	like that? It's fucking Sony.
9818640	9823220	That is interesting, you know, I've not heard a lot like that. I'm kind of sitting here
9823220	9826960	a little bit in awe because, you know, I was listening to the first half of the email,
9826960	9829860	I was kind of sitting here going, well you just need to call Sony, and then they reset
9829860	9833680	things because I think that's what Microsoft does. Granted, I don't know so much about
9833680	9839800	the video end of things, I just know that they do that with the games, is that, you
9839800	9843600	know, they can reset the licenses. Hell, you can do it yourself, I think once a year you
9843600	9849240	can reset your licenses. Same thing with Apple, does something very similar. Like, you know,
9849240	9854480	if you have to reinstall Windows or whatever, and you get five plays per account or whatever,
9854480	9858120	you know, this is, they don't even sell music with DRM anymore anyway, they got rid of it.
9858120	9864800	For the DRM music that you still have, you get like up to five computers, I don't know.
9864800	9869040	Regardless, I'm kind of sitting here in shock hearing this story. This is a little bit surprising
9869040	9874400	to me that I haven't heard this before, but granted, I don't know a lot of people that
9874400	9879320	use the video marketplace so heavily. You know, I don't think there's a lot of people
9879320	9883680	that are really into the digital distribution. You know, I know you've called in the show
9883680	9887200	several times talking about various automates and stuff, so, you know, I know you're a heavy
9887200	9892280	user of this, so this is kind of surprising to me. So, I think you've done a good first
9892280	9896920	step by starting to get the word out there that this is going on. The way I see it, you
9896920	9902960	have a couple of options from here. You can call Sony back, and if you don't like the
9902960	9908120	answer that you're getting from the rep, you can ask to speak to a supervisor. Not that
9908120	9914100	that's probably going to do anything, but you probably want to get clarity on why. What
9914100	9920740	is the policy? Why is it that you can't, if you legally purchase this, you know, item,
9920740	9925680	you can't watch it? Why are they unable to reset something from their end? Maybe try
9925680	9930200	to get a clear answer about what their policy is on it, because, you know, I'm hearing that
9930200	9936840	the rep told you that you were shit out of luck, but I just, as a consumer activist,
9936840	9940820	if you will, that has a podcast, I want to know a little more about the why. Why did
9940820	9946120	they tell you that you were shit out of luck? Your other options, once you've figured that
9946120	9949760	out, and once you have a really good solid reason and you understand their policy, you
9949760	9955200	can do one of two things, or you can do both. You go to the Better Business Bureau and file
9955200	9960880	a complaint, and quite frankly, I wouldn't usually advise this, but if this is true,
9960880	9966520	what you're saying, that Sony does say you're shit out of luck for something you legally
9966520	9971160	purchased yourself when you had to fix something that they broke, right, he said his drive
9971160	9978420	corrupted, right? Yeah, and he had to do a hard reset and it corrupted his game data,
9978420	9985640	so he had to, the only way to get rid of it, because it wouldn't delete, was to reformat
9985640	9995400	it. Or you could, and if you want, you could try to get your story out there a little more,
9995400	9998860	once you kind of know, understand the policies a little more, email some of your favorite
9998860	10002160	game blogs, see who might run the story, especially if you do end up sending a complaint to Better
10002160	10006680	Business Bureau, you could see what happens. Now granted, there's also other things to
10006680	10010600	check out here, and this is where our chat room's piping up, something very big to consider
10010600	10015820	here. Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, but why should Sony let them play it again? A
10015820	10020800	store does not replace your disc if you lose or scratch it. And certainly that's a valid
10020800	10025640	devil's advocate argument is that if you just damaged the data, you're shit out of luck
10025640	10029580	if it were a Blu-ray disc that you dropped on the floor. It was an accident, but you
10029580	10035520	dropped it, you broke it, you're screwed, right? This is due to their... I know, there's
10035520	10040900	just something where I totally respect where Brad's coming from with that statement. There's
10040900	10045840	just something about what Spazinator's saying that just doesn't sound fair to me. Isn't
10045840	10051840	this part of the reason we do digital distribution? Yeah. Is so that I don't have a physical...
10051840	10056600	The advantage is supposed to be that I have a digital version of it that doesn't get damaged
10056600	10061440	the way a physical copy does. We always talk about the pros and cons about why should people
10061440	10064920	have physical versions instead of digital versions, but we don't often talk about why
10064920	10071360	should people have digital versions instead of physical ones. And if Sony... And again,
10071360	10076420	if Apple and Microsoft have these competitive DRM management schemes, then Sony should be
10076420	10087680	taken to task for having one that is less than ideal, I suppose. So, very interesting.
10087680	10091640	I don't know what else to think of this. I would say call back, talk to a supervisor.
10091640	10098560	If you can't hear from a supervisor, get their complaint address and write them a letter.
10098560	10104100	Make sure also when you talk to their people that you document names, what time you called.
10104100	10110300	You want to know who you spoke to, who their supervisor is. You want to record all of that
10110300	10114240	because the next step after writing them a letter is if you get nothing from that, go
10114240	10119960	to the Better Business Bureau. And for the... I just would like to know what is their policy?
10119960	10123560	And you know, I could go onto Sony's website and actually read the little blah, blah, blahs
10123560	10126360	and probably figure it out for myself. I don't have time to do that while trying to do a
10126360	10129960	live radio show, but I would kind of like our listeners to try and figure that out for
10129960	10133640	the next week and maybe we'll see some emails on that. What exactly is their policy when
10133640	10138460	it comes to this stuff? Just the whole your shit out of luck response. I mean, I'm a customer
10138460	10141960	service trainer. That's not the type of thing you tell a customer ever is that you're shit
10141960	10147520	out of luck. There's always something that you... Even if that something is, here is
10147520	10151640	our complaint address if you don't like the policy. This is our policy and if you don't
10151640	10155480	agree with it, here's an address to complain about it. That is better than, well, fuck
10155480	10162040	you. You know what I mean? Just what I'm hearing, just as the customer service trainer in me
10162040	10163720	is crying a little bit. So...
10163720	10169360	Well, no. And keep in mind, you know, I used to take escalated calls at my work. So I used
10169360	10174360	to talk to all the pissed off people. And I know that there's something that can be
10174360	10178880	done. If you want to keep someone's business... Because keep in mind, this is... I don't know.
10178880	10182840	I'm going into a little bit of the world of business and maybe this is something you can
10182840	10189840	use, Rob. We actually remember going through a couple of training seminars that were called
10190460	10197460	a complaint as a gift. And was talking about for every eight people who get a bad... No,
10199920	10204980	for every eight people that have a bad experience, at least two of them will talk about it. Two
10204980	10208680	of them will talk to eight more people. You know what I mean? And they'll keep passing
10208680	10214800	it around by word. For every, I think... I've heard the same thing, just not with numbers.
10214800	10217720	I think the numbers always seem to change. But you know what I mean? That principle.
10217720	10222200	But you're also going to run into the person who is an activist. The person who's going
10222200	10224640	to take the initiative and get up and write the letter.
10224640	10231460	The Jamie. Well, you know, I actually adopted that whole attitude after taking that seminar.
10231460	10238460	And I'll tell you this, if any place has given me bad service for any reason, if I know specifically
10238920	10243520	that yeah, they haven't done things that they should do, I will say something about it.
10243520	10248520	Because if no one says anything about it to the company, how are they going to know to
10248520	10254600	fix it? How are they going to know that maybe so-and-so rep screwed up until you call them
10254600	10260600	on it? You know? I think there's not enough people who call other people on their bullshit.
10260600	10265360	And to be fair, if I know we have had people that work for... We have been mentioned on
10265360	10271040	the official Sony PlayStation 3 Twitter before. This show. On the official Twitter. Yes. Because
10271040	10277400	we've had friends that work at Sony. So please, by all means, Sony, the floor is yours. If
10277400	10282420	we are misrepresenting these facts, if this emailer had a bad experience and needs to
10282420	10287840	be corrected, please contact us. You know how. There's many different ways to do it.
10287840	10293440	State your side of the case. If we are misrepresenting you, we want to make it right. But on the
10293440	10296160	other hand, if your policy sucks, we also want to call you out on it. Sorry, but that's
10296160	10302800	what we do. So, by all means, let's hear both sides of the story. Okay. That's pretty much
10302800	10309760	what I was getting to next, is that there's always two sides of the story, but again,
10309760	10313560	they don't know the situation exists until it's brought to their attention. Right. And
10313560	10318000	this could, unfortunately, be just a bad experience with the customer service rep. And if that
10318000	10328360	is their policy, this could be a step to changing it. Who knows. We'll see. But Spaznator, don't
10328360	10331640	necessarily just stop with this, I think. But if you do write a letter, make sure you
10331640	10336580	actually write a letter. Don't do it over email. Emails get lost, deleted, and are harder
10336580	10340360	to trace. Trust me. You can type it on a computer, but just send it to the good old fashioned
10340360	10347680	post office. You'll thank me later. Okay. Anyhow, that was actually a really good email.
10347680	10353120	So is that it for mailbag, then, for now? That's the one and only. All right. Well,
10353120	10357360	mailbagorangeonstrader.com. That was a good email. It was a good discussion. So mailbagorangeonstrader.com,
10357360	10361400	if you want to, and he always gets through on the phone, so I'm sure he's going to call
10361400	10367460	in later to talk about it. So it'll come up again later, I'm sure. But it was an interesting
10367460	10373560	discussion, and I would be very curious to see, and if you run a game blog out there,
10373560	10377880	I'm too lazy to do this, so here you can take this story and just say it was inspired by
10377880	10382860	this show, okay? Throw us a bone. I would like to see the DRM policies of the various
10382860	10387800	companies side by side. I would like someone to make that nice little chart that says,
10387800	10392480	here's what it is with Microsoft. Here's what it is with Nintendo for their limited video
10392480	10396000	service in Japan, which I think they have. Here's what it is for the US. I would like
10396000	10400560	to see that kind of side by side so the consumer can be better informed going into this. I
10400560	10407440	would like to kind of see that. Anyhow. I agree. All right, let's get into the FUs of
10407440	10413800	the week, and I was supposed to have a story, and I neglected to link it, so I've got to
10413800	10418280	bring it up real quick. So FU starts to me for not being prepared tonight. You know what,
10418280	10423080	we'll do this a little bit out of order tonight because I am so terrible and broken tonight.
10423080	10427080	We'll do our FUs first, and then I'll read the inspiring story tonight.
10427080	10443080	This is fun. All this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is... This is fun.
10443080	10455320	This is soccer. My FU goes to pissy attitudes. That's it. Loki. FU to the stores that think
10455320	10460680	that it's necessary to break street to compete with GameStop and other stores. You just suck
10460680	10472360	and make my job harder. My FU just goes to the swine flu. I mean, really. Need I say
10472360	10475160	more? You heard the first 20 minutes of tonight's show.
10475160	10479960	Finally, we found that story that's supposed to inspire tonight's FUs. You remember this
10479960	10484440	came from a couple weeks ago. Do you remember hearing about the raid where the police guys
10484440	10488520	busted into the house and started playing the Nintendo Wii during the raid?
10488520	10489520	No.
10489520	10492680	Maybe this was the show you weren't here because you did miss a show or two because you had
10492680	10496500	other things going on. There was actually police that broke into a house and started
10496500	10502180	playing the Wii that was there. Just seriously, really? You're professionals and you're sitting
10502180	10508920	there playing the Wii or whatever on the job. Well, apparently what happens is that as punishment
10508920	10514360	did these officers get fired? Did they get suspended without pay? No. They're going to
10514360	10519500	have to go through some retraining. The officers even, those names are being withheld because
10519500	10524280	they are undercover police and the company is saying they are learning from their mistakes.
10524280	10527840	So in other words, these officers that were screwing around playing the Wii on the job
10527840	10533640	got a slap on the wrist and are getting sent back to training. And as a trainer, you know
10533640	10536800	what, I, you know what? No, for the sake of separating my job from this, I'm not going
10536800	10541560	to get into it, but there's, there's certain things about that excuse that really strike
10541560	10543640	a nerve with me and that's all I can say.
10543640	10549880	Well, I'll put this, well then I will talk about my experience as a person who is required
10549880	10553760	to take a certain number of training classes a year. I think that they're just going to
10553760	10556560	be more inconvenienced than anything else to go to a class to learn stuff that they
10556560	10560520	already know. Because there's a difference between knowing something and caring enough
10560520	10565860	to put it into practice. That's my point. It's just going to be, oh, we have to sit
10565860	10572280	in the class for a day. You know.
10572280	10575840	There is so much I want to say, but can't. I just can't. I'm sorry.
10575840	10577420	Say after the show so you can get it out.
10577420	10580200	After the show, I would love to share it with you personally, but I can't talk about it
10580200	10584560	on a platform where people, I don't know who has access to it and who could share it with
10584560	10586600	who, but there's just so much I could say about it.
10586600	10590880	I will say this though, and I will tell you this out of, because I do know our trainers
10590880	10597820	and I know the hard work that they put into it. That's why I usually at least pay attention,
10597820	10599880	but all of them know I already know it.
10599880	10602160	But do you think these guys are going to sit there and pay attention?
10602160	10603160	Probably not. They're dicks.
10603160	10607080	So this is probably a waste of everyone's time, right?
10607080	10608080	Yeah.
10608080	10611000	Anyhow, let's move on with some other stories.
10611000	10615120	I don't think playing a Wii is cause for suspension, but still.
10615120	10620280	At the same time though, like really, you're there to do a job.
10620280	10623680	I think the bad press for the police itself.
10623680	10624680	Is punishment enough, I suppose.
10624680	10626040	Might be bad enough, yeah.
10626040	10631080	I suppose. All right, Loki.
10631080	10636520	All right. Anyways, so this is kind of cool, because of course, you know, huge Grand Theft
10636520	10646880	Auto fan. Grand Theft Auto IV for the PC just recently got an update to, I believe, live.
10646880	10650760	The games for Windows Live also kind of got an update as well.
10650760	10656560	And with that, the download content for The Lost and Damned, the achievements are showing
10656560	10660320	up now on Game for Windows Live.
10660320	10662640	So that can only mean one thing.
10662640	10668060	That the download content that once was exclusive to the Xbox 360 is coming to PC.
10668060	10670880	And that makes sense, because if you think about it, Microsoft paid to have that download
10670880	10675000	content made, or at least paid for the exclusivity.
10675000	10681200	Games for Windows is still Microsoft, so perhaps we will see both episodes eventually released
10681200	10686280	for the PC, and probably sooner than later.
10686280	10687280	That's pretty sweet.
10687280	10691000	Sorry, PC, or PS3 owners, no word on that.
10691000	10692000	Interesting.
10692000	10693000	Interesting.
10693000	10695640	Although, it could open the door to that, possibly?
10695640	10696640	Not necessarily.
10696640	10699720	I mean, they could literally port this in a heartbeat.
10699720	10705880	I mean, everything that's on there, it's a multiplatform anyways.
10705880	10710400	It could be ported, like, seriously super quick, because they already have the hardware
10710400	10711400	done.
10711400	10712400	I mean, the engine's already done.
10712400	10714720	They don't really have to change too much.
10714720	10717280	But they're just not gonna, because they're under contract.
10717280	10725200	And especially if, you know, $50 million does, that kind of buys some time, I should say.
10725200	10727400	It probably will never make it over to the PS3.
10727400	10731120	Well, dudes, I got one more story for you.
10731120	10733120	Dudes, do you like Barbie?
10733120	10738840	Of course you do, because how else is the Xbox Live Marketplace selling Avatar clothing?
10738840	10740900	Because that's basically what it is.
10740900	10743360	It's Barbie for dudes.
10743360	10745400	And dudettes, of course, too.
10745400	10749000	But hey, some people like to buy these clothes and dress their own little character and buy,
10749000	10753160	you know, the Malibu Beach backgrounds and whatever else you can get on Xbox Live Marketplace.
10753160	10757200	Pretty soon, you're going to be able to get from the Avatar Marketplace Assassin's Creed
10757200	10758200	2 gear.
10758200	10763960	That's right, 28 awesome outfits for your Barbie avatar, both girly and boy versions
10763960	10765740	in Barbie and Ken models.
10765740	10769540	You can get Renaissance masks, hats, wristbands, and so forth.
10769540	10773040	But if you want the really great stuff, the guard armor, the Altair outfit, you know,
10773040	10777120	like the deluxe Barbie evening gown wear, I'm sorry, the Assassin's Creed 2 equivalent
10777120	10780220	of that, that'll cost you 400 Microsoft points.
10780220	10782880	That's five bucks, just so you know.
10782880	10788020	Also of interest, a DaVinci's flying machine, if you want to get that, 240 Microsoft points
10788020	10789020	for that.
10789020	10790020	Well, that's also from Assassin's Creed 2.
10790020	10791020	I actually kind of want that.
10791020	10792800	Yeah, I know.
10792800	10793800	I don't know.
10793800	10795280	I kind of, you know what, I can see...
10795280	10797520	Also, the DJ Hero stuff.
10797520	10800440	I can sit here and make fun of this stuff a little bit.
10800440	10802400	You know, granted, I'm no better.
10802400	10806880	I spent $10 on a Warcraft pet this week, so I'm really no better.
10806880	10811640	But I do find this stuff to be a little silly, and even I can admit, what I did was silly
10811640	10816800	too, but I just think this whole, like, buying for your virtual costume, when a lot of games
10816800	10821360	don't even really use them, I mean, I guess a few do, like Guitar Hero does and stuff,
10821360	10825000	maybe more will next year or what have you, but pretty soon it's all gonna be in a tall,
10825000	10827940	so you will be in the game anyway, not your avatar.
10827940	10829840	So I don't know.
10829840	10834680	Whatever, though, there you go.
10834680	10842320	Anyhow, some folks in chat are complaining that the stream has died, but I am seeing...
10842320	10847200	Oh, we did drop for a minute, but we're reconnected now and we're good, so I guess the stream
10847200	10848200	did drop for a minute.
10848200	10850280	I don't know what happened there.
10850280	10851280	Technical glitch.
10851280	10852280	It happens.
10852280	10853280	Don't know what to do.
10853280	10854280	I was downloading all that porn.
10854280	10855280	Sorry, Rob.
10855280	10856280	There you go.
10856280	10857640	Knew it.
10857640	10861920	And again, live folks, keep in mind, there's not a lot we can do when the stream goes down.
10861920	10865560	It does usually tend to come back right away, so our biggest advice to our live listeners
10865560	10868640	would be just wait patiently 30 seconds and reload.
10868640	10869800	You usually won't miss too much.
10869800	10873880	You just miss me making jokes about how the Xbox Live Marketplace is like Barbie for dudes.
10873880	10874880	That's all.
10874880	10875880	All right.
10875880	10876880	You didn't miss much.
10876880	10877880	All right.
10877880	10883040	Let's get into the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can give us a call, username Orange
10883040	10884860	Lounge Radio on Skype.
10884860	10885860	Go ahead and give us a call.
10885860	10890240	Speaking of technical difficulties, I hate the new Skype.
10890240	10894280	If you've been listening the past few weeks, Skype got a makeover the last couple of months,
10894280	10895280	and I hate it.
10895280	10898320	I miss the old one so, so, so much.
10898320	10901280	I miss the first version of Skype we used several years ago.
10901280	10905560	I would see everybody that was calling in, so everybody would have a fair shot of being
10905560	10909380	on the show, because I could actually pick callers that I didn't recognize were calling
10909380	10911480	in, and you'll rotate it a little bit.
10911480	10913560	I don't even get that now in Skype.
10913560	10916320	Now Skype likes to randomly drop calls and do all this stuff.
10916320	10918200	I just hate it.
10918200	10919200	But we're going to go to the phones anyway.
10919200	10920200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10920200	10921200	Who's this?
10921200	10922200	We all hate it.
10922200	10923200	Hey.
10923200	10924200	What up?
10924200	10925200	This is X-Link calling from Melbourne, Florida.
10925200	10926200	Hey, X-Link.
10926200	10927200	How are you doing?
10927200	10928200	What's on your mind, buddy?
10928200	10929200	Oh, I'm doing great.
10929200	10930520	Wonderful knowing there are cops spending their time to say catching criminals playing
10930520	10931520	Wii bowling.
10931520	10933320	Was that in your neck of the woods that that happened?
10933320	10934320	No.
10934320	10935320	It didn't happen around me.
10935320	10938600	It happened in a different part of town, but it's great to know that these wonderful cops
10938600	10942640	who get sworn to duty have nothing better to do than raid a house and play Wii.
10942640	10944660	And the fix is more training.
10944660	10945660	Is the fix.
10945660	10946660	Yes.
10946660	10947660	Yes.
10947660	10949600	Not suspension, not getting fired, but more training.
10949600	10953400	Because clearly, they were not trained properly the first time.
10953400	10954400	Yes.
10954400	10956240	This is how you bowl a 300 game in Wii.
10956240	10961240	So the responsibility falls upon the trainers of the company to do the... Never mind.
10961240	10962240	Go ahead.
10962240	10963240	What's on your mind?
10963240	10964240	Excellent.
10964240	10966880	Anyways, I called because I want to call about a PSP game that recently came out, but before
10966880	10970240	I do that, Spazinator, quick tip.
10970240	10978920	I don't know why he couldn't have a copy hooked up his PS3 to the PC or through his PSP and
10978920	10984500	then copy it onto his PC, because every time when I get something new from the... Downloaded
10984500	10989440	from the place in the store, I always try to make a copy available on my hard drive
10989440	10994840	just in case if something would happen or crash, I would have that backup as a storage
10994840	10999560	to go into and re-put on like my game saves and stuff like that, so that way I don't have
10999560	11003120	to end up starting over and losing a lot of stuff.
11003120	11007400	Also in the game store, on the top right-hand corner, they have an area where it called
11007400	11008400	View Downloads.
11008400	11009960	It's right next to the checkout.
11009960	11014680	You hit it once, and it usually gives a download list of the last few things you have recently
11014680	11016080	downloaded from the store.
11016080	11019680	Now, I don't understand why he could go in there and re-download the stuff again.
11019680	11021680	I think that's what he said he did.
11021680	11022680	Yeah.
11022680	11025340	I think in the email, he talked about doing some of that, but for some reason, whenever
11025340	11028320	it happened, he was still locked out of it.
11028320	11031120	I think it had something to do with the flush of his hard drive he did.
11031120	11036840	It's like it reset his console ID or something, which seems very strange.
11036840	11037840	That's kind of a weird situation.
11037840	11038840	Yeah.
11038840	11039840	It's very weird.
11039840	11044120	That's why I'm kind of sitting here going, whereas I think Spaznator has some very valid
11044120	11045120	concerns.
11045120	11046320	I feel like there's a piece of the puzzle.
11046320	11050880	I need to hear Sony's policy on this because I feel like that piece is missing, and we
11050880	11054200	might be misrepresenting their policy a little bit, and I don't want to do that either.
11054200	11057200	I don't see why he could do it as long as he has his ID and everything.
11057200	11059240	I don't see whether there would be a problem with it.
11059240	11061320	I'm very curious to see how this further develops.
11061320	11062320	I think he'll do it.
11062320	11064120	I think he'll follow up on it and let us know.
11064120	11065120	I think he will.
11065120	11066800	Well, I had an interesting situation kind of earlier on.
11066800	11067800	I'm trying to make this quick too.
11067800	11068800	Sure.
11068800	11072320	I bought Mass Effect a while back for the PC, and unfortunately, I didn't have the CD
11072320	11077960	code, though I could have easily gone on a torrent and got a CD, no CD fix and stuff
11077960	11078960	like that.
11078960	11081560	I really wanted to have it legalized.
11081560	11089560	I actually went through the EA website, talked to somebody through the chat, which was absolutely
11089560	11090560	horrid.
11090560	11093840	The guy told me just to call the manufacturer and get a key from them, which I don't think
11093840	11097040	he understood that it wasn't a download.
11097040	11103240	So I ended up calling the long-distance phone number for the tech support, was put on hold
11103240	11105560	for 20 minutes, got through to a guy.
11105560	11107920	The guy was very nice, very civilized.
11107920	11113280	I explained to him very nicely my problem and explained to him about it, and we went
11113280	11114280	through all the steps.
11114280	11119320	He told me, he sent me an email, he said on the email, he goes, go to this page, he goes
11119320	11124280	with your response, and he goes, send up some photos of the booklet and show the fact that
11124280	11126840	you didn't get a CD key.
11126840	11131500	Did it, and the very next day, another person from the tech support sent me a CD key so
11131500	11134960	I can actually have a legit version of my game, which was very cool, instead of paying
11134960	11138880	like 10 or 20 bucks for a CD key for it.
11138880	11141000	I'm glad to hear this good customer service story.
11141000	11143800	You know, it's kind of too bad you had to be on hold for 20 minutes long-distance.
11143800	11149120	You know who else, though, has great customer service in my experience, Blizzard, because
11149120	11153840	you know my WoW account got hacked a couple months ago, and that was not a pleasant experience,
11153840	11158040	but once I finally got through to their freaking customer support, they were very helpful.
11158040	11160560	I just need to hire more of them.
11160560	11161560	Yeah.
11161560	11167080	But that's good that you had a good experience with EA, you know, sometimes amongst all these
11167080	11170920	crappy customer service stories, it's good to hear some good things, and plus, tough
11170920	11171920	times at EA right now.
11171920	11175440	I don't know if this affected their customer service division, but they had a huge workforce
11175440	11176440	layoff.
11176440	11179480	I think that happened in the week that we missed, and I know some people that were personally
11179480	11184360	affected by that, and it's, as always, layoffs are never any fun to talk about, so certainly
11184360	11188560	our thoughts go out to those that were affected.
11188560	11194800	I'm not at liberty to say specifically people I know that were affected by it, but some
11194800	11200520	names you might remember from the shows yesterday year, so it's very unfortunate, and we hope
11200520	11201520	for the best for our fans.
11201520	11202520	Definitely.
11202520	11206160	I know one or two from the Tiburon, but like you said too, I'm not going to mention any
11206160	11207160	names either.
11207160	11208160	Yeah.
11208160	11211280	Obviously, we want to respect their privacy and wish them the best of luck, because layoffs
11211280	11212520	are never any fun.
11212520	11213880	Most definitely.
11213880	11216920	I've been playing a game for the pinball.
11216920	11218680	It's the Pinball Heroes.
11218680	11222400	It's the $3.99 one that recently came out on the PlayStation Network.
11222400	11223400	It's a very good game.
11223400	11224400	It's $3.99.
11224400	11225400	Pinball.
11225400	11226440	I like it very much.
11226440	11233200	The only problem I had with it was the fact that for each of the tables, it's $3.99,
11233200	11238120	but it has a great scoring system.
11238120	11239360	It keeps a little achievement.
11239360	11243680	I think there's trophies you can get for it too if you hook it up to the PS3 through
11243680	11247720	their trophy system.
11247720	11253560	It keeps on scoring not only for local when you play the PlayStation, but also you can
11253560	11257600	go against other people from around the globe that has the game on the network.
11257600	11263920	It will upload your score and go against other people's score, which is very awesome.
11263920	11266640	The only problem I had with it was the multi-ball.
11266640	11273160	The screen would zoom outward, and the table would get much smaller.
11273160	11276940	When it's done, it will zoom back in, but if you're in multi-ball and you really have
11276940	11281520	a hard time seeing, I can see that being a part of a problem, seeing the little balls
11281520	11284320	and the guys that go around and hit stuff.
11284320	11286600	Other than that, I've been having a lot of fun with it.
11286600	11289320	For a four-hour game, it's not that bad.
11289320	11294600	Well, we appreciate the perspective and all that, so I'm going to go ahead and let you
11294600	11296120	go though so we can get some more calls.
11296120	11297120	No, no problem.
11297120	11300840	You had a hometown buffet of stories tonight, but I like it.
11300840	11305840	I like hearing all the different stuff, so some reviews and customer service goods and
11305840	11306840	bads all rolled into one.
11306840	11307840	I just thought it was ironic.
11307840	11311520	It was this whole customer service thing, and then I had the customer service this week,
11311520	11312520	so.
11312520	11313520	There you go.
11313520	11314520	All right.
11314520	11315520	Thank you, Gil.
11315520	11316520	Take care, and hey, have fun on World of War crack.
11316520	11317520	Thank you.
11317520	11318520	I appreciate it.
11318520	11319520	Thank you for that crack.
11319520	11320520	Hey, you're welcome.
11320520	11321520	You're welcome.
11321520	11322520	I'm going to win myself out of it.
11322520	11323520	Good luck.
11323520	11324520	All right.
11324520	11326560	That was X-Link here on Orange Launch Radio.
11326560	11328560	We'll take a couple more calls.
11328560	11334200	I'm sorry, 1877 Game O-L-R. You think I know our own freaking phone number by now, but
11334200	11335200	apparently I don't.
11335200	11337680	Let's go to the phones and see what's on the line.
11337680	11338680	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11338680	11339680	Who's this?
11339680	11341680	It's Legend of Zaku right here.
11341680	11342680	Legend of Zaku.
11342680	11343680	What's on your mind?
11343680	11344680	Oh, nothing much.
11344680	11345680	Just chilling in my new MacBook.
11345680	11349880	Actually, I wouldn't say new MacBook, but new refurbished MacBook.
11349880	11353560	Zaku, you're the type of guy that's into modern warfare, right?
11353560	11354560	Well, yeah.
11354560	11361520	And I mean, I would play it if they had dedicated servers on the PC, then I would have justification
11361520	11363120	to spend money on it.
11363120	11366840	Oh, so you're one of the protesters that is actually protesting.
11366840	11367840	Yes.
11367840	11369720	I mean, I have the money right now.
11369720	11373920	Even if I didn't have the money, I wanted to see how this would play out first, just
11373920	11379040	so I could see how this new matchmaking would work on the PC.
11379040	11383640	And lo and behold, it was just like the 360, it was like the console versions.
11383640	11388160	Well, props to you sticking to your guns and actually meaning it and actually sticking
11388160	11390100	to the cause.
11390100	11393520	Can you try to explain to me, though, I don't want to make you go against your protest,
11393520	11396760	but what is the allure of modern warfare 2?
11396760	11402000	Let's assume for a minute, make believe, none of this crap with the servers is going on.
11402000	11407160	Why is it so big that people line up to get it?
11407160	11409160	It's almost like the Halo effect.
11409160	11415600	Have you ever seen how the subsequent Halo releases, like Halo 2 and 3, and you see people
11415600	11420200	lining up for midnight launches, it's kind of that.
11420200	11426760	When you have a game that manages to develop a big following on the first type of game,
11426760	11433240	the first non-World War II game in the Call of Duty franchise, and yet that game managed
11433240	11442600	to get Halo numbers for its sequel, which it took a Bungie 3 just to get that amount,
11442600	11449480	whereas Infinity War just got it on the second try, because it was a surprise hit.
11449480	11455560	No one would have thought Modern Warfare would outdo the whole Call of Duty series.
11455560	11457200	That was completely unexpected.
11457200	11465080	I guess I'm understanding a little more, because I actually got Halo 3 the day it was released.
11465080	11468760	You know I'm not that great at first person shooters, especially Halo, but even I bought
11468760	11469760	into it a little bit.
11469760	11471560	I was a little excited about Halo 3.
11471560	11478880	I bought Halo 3 just for shits and giggles, because I had my 360 back then, but to be
11478880	11481080	honest, I never got into the campaign mode at all.
11481080	11487040	I was just trying to do multiplayer, because I don't play shooters on consoles.
11487040	11490760	I just play it with the keyboard and mouse, a bit old-fashioned.
11490760	11496240	Alright, but to summarize though, you still say though that folks shouldn't get Modern
11496240	11501080	Warfare 2, at least not on the PC, until they address what the fans want.
11501080	11506560	In other words, basically if they want a good single-player experience with the keyboard
11506560	11512240	and mouse, then by all means they should buy it, but you have to really stick to your guns
11512240	11519960	if you really want to wait out until if any war decides to come to their senses and release
11519960	11527720	something for the community that it apparently backstabbed when killing off the dedicated
11527720	11528720	servers.
11528720	11532180	You know buddy, I'm sure I don't even have to ask, but what about this rumor that they
11532180	11536880	might allow the dedicated servers later on for more money?
11536880	11542120	Well that depends on whether or not that actually comes to fruition, whether or not it's just
11542120	11545760	a rumor, so you'd rather take it with a grain of salt.
11545760	11549280	What I heard recently was that the hackers managed to outdo them already.
11549280	11555320	They already had dedicated server support and the console, the little console that you
11555320	11559720	hit whenever you press the tilde key on the keyboard, just like any other first-person
11559720	11560720	shooter.
11560720	11564880	Now you have the hackers managed, you know, someone managed to hack the game and add console
11564880	11568080	support, dedicated server as a proof of concept.
11568080	11569080	No surprise, none.
11569080	11570080	None.
11570080	11573520	In the hacker community, when they set out to do something, they fucking do it.
11573520	11575720	So I have to say I'm not surprised at all.
11575720	11582440	But basically, you know, it won't be that long before Vinny Ward gets steamed to add
11582440	11588400	that in the blacklist for their back, and then all the folks that run the hacked version
11588400	11589400	get banned.
11589400	11591560	Um, Zaku, I know you may not have called in.
11591560	11593520	I made you kind of talk about Modern Warfare 2.
11593520	11596680	I don't know if that's originally why you called in tonight, but before we let you go,
11596680	11600120	I wanted to let you get out whatever you wanted to actually call in and talk about tonight.
11600120	11606840	Oh, man, I'm trying to basically play DJ Hero for the first time last night, under the influence
11606840	11607840	of alcohol.
11607840	11612480	It was a little bit, you know, it's a little bit of a transition, since I'm more of a 2DX
11612480	11615960	kind of guy, but, you know, it's gonna take a while.
11615960	11622440	I mean, I don't see it as a game I would normally play on my own, just because it has, most
11622440	11625000	of the songs are of a genre that I don't listen to.
11625000	11631000	I mean, there are some good ones, you know, the stuff that with Tiesto and Paul Van Dyke,
11631000	11636920	for example, and even the, you know, Tears for Fears and Pajamas, like, you know, mixed
11636920	11637920	up.
11637920	11639880	But it's really not like 2DX at all, is it?
11639880	11644480	Of course, it is, of course, I kind of see it that way, because it's basically, in this
11644480	11649440	game you actually scratch and you actually move a crossfader, so I guess in a sense Activision
11649440	11650840	made it more realistic.
11650840	11652240	Yeah, it's different.
11652240	11655760	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the call, as always,
11655760	11656760	and take care, okay?
11656760	11657760	Have a good one.
11657760	11658760	Later, you too.
11658760	11662840	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to get in, maybe we'll
11662840	11663840	take, like, one more call.
11663840	11667560	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
11667560	11671880	Not really, but here's what I got.
11671880	11675320	They're gonna be doing possibly, well, there was a possible spinoff they're talking about
11675320	11680200	doing for Modern Warfare, starring, and I had to laugh because the character's name
11680200	11685720	is Ghost, so it'd be like a Modern Warfare ghost, kind of like Starcraft Ghost, but
11685720	11686720	not.
11686720	11687720	But not.
11687720	11688720	Anyways.
11688720	11689720	Hey, we got a phone call.
11689720	11690720	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
11690720	11698760	Good evening, OU across the ocean, OU in the land of the free, or so we'll just say.
11698760	11702000	The state that falls into the ocean in 2012, that's where we are.
11702000	11703400	Oh, well, what the hell?
11703400	11704400	We're all dead.
11704400	11706640	Oh, hello there, OLR, this is that one, Aki Ripper.
11706640	11709920	But John Cusack survives, so the hell with the rest of us.
11709920	11712640	Aki Ripper, it's been forever since we've heard from you.
11712640	11714640	What is on your mind, buddy?
11714640	11717600	Ooh, what's on my mind?
11717600	11722480	Once again, I've given a reason, actually, to buy a Wii, since, well, I saw footage of
11722480	11728640	that new Super Mario Brothers, and, well, since I still actually haven't bought a Wii,
11728640	11736720	even though I actually have, like, four games, four, actually already have four games, so...
11736720	11740600	Wait, so you already have the games, but you just didn't have the Wii?
11740600	11741600	Yeah, exactly.
11741600	11742600	Wow.
11742600	11746800	That's kind of the backwards way of doing it, but okay.
11746800	11751600	It really was, like, I love that point of, like, there was, like, this plenty of games
11751600	11758820	that I'm really interested in, but I don't have the, I either choose to buy the console
11758820	11764920	and have no games, or buy the games or have no console.
11764920	11767560	That's why you're the crazy Swedish guy, that's no problem.
11767560	11775520	But oh well, I'm like the, it's, once again, it's quite fun in a way, since I'm the kind
11775520	11777880	of collector in a way, and...
11777880	11779200	That's cool, though, that's cool.
11779200	11780200	Let me ask you, though...
11780200	11783040	And having things on my shelf is like a bonus.
11783040	11785820	Let me ask you, though, about new Super Mario Brothers, because obviously the game just
11785820	11786960	came out over here today.
11786960	11790960	I was actually kind of surprised, I haven't touched the game myself yet outside of my
11790960	11795840	short experience with it at E3, and, you know, you don't judge a game based off an E3 build,
11795840	11800600	but I'm kind of surprised, because of course the gaming community did a little bit of backlash
11800600	11805020	with the game, with the whole easy button, you know, stuff that's going around, although
11805020	11808040	we've talked a little more about how that's actually integrated into the game, and it
11808040	11810460	kind of sounds like it might be interesting.
11810460	11814080	But the other thing, I was looking at some of the Metacritic scores for this, the game's
11814080	11815720	getting glowing reviews.
11815720	11818960	The game is probably going to end up on people's top ten lists when all is said and done at
11818960	11822720	the end of the year, many critical websites are giving it A-pluses.
11822720	11830800	The reason I'm basing, in a way, though, the video I saw was on Giant Bomb, and they were
11830800	11842160	playing four-player co-op, and that looked hilarious fun, really, so that had me stoked
11842160	11843720	for it.
11843720	11847440	When I actually have three of my friends come over to play video games, it'll be great.
11847440	11851880	But my only concern is is single-player mode fun, too?
11851880	11856880	Because sometimes I have to play video games by myself, in fact, that's most of the time.
11856880	11864080	Here's another thing, in a way, though, is that the following week, in a way, though,
11864080	11871200	if I get my Wii, I will still be busy, in a kind of way, with the new Sims 3 expansion.
11871200	11872920	I'm right there with you on that.
11872920	11875400	You are not alone in this studio with that.
11875400	11879520	And now, one question, though, do you have President Cat sitting on your shelf?
11879520	11883400	No, I don't, unfortunately, not yet.
11883400	11895320	And speaking of which, since we have a mod-friendly one around your block, so to say, and I was
11895320	11905720	wondering, is it, since I heard about the 360 bannings and such, well, I own a 360,
11905720	11911200	but I have no plans whatsoever on shipping that one, but I was thinking about getting
11911200	11917240	a shipped, getting a flashed or shipped Wii.
11917240	11922040	Is that like any, how does that work out, so to say?
11922040	11927320	Loki, do you recommend people do this to their Wiis, or is this a risk you don't want to
11927320	11928320	take, or what?
11928320	11934400	There's mods now that, seriously, it's, you open the Wii up, and you have to have a tri-wing
11934400	11937040	screwdriver to do that, but that's easy to get.
11937040	11940800	They have it now where you literally unplug the ribbon cable from the CD-ROM drive, plug
11940800	11944140	that ribbon cable into the mod board, plug the other ribbon cable that's from that mod
11944140	11947520	board to the back of the CD drive, put it all back together, and you're done.
11947520	11948520	Why the old Saturn ones?
11948520	11951560	Yeah, I mean, it's, some of them are that easy now.
11951560	11954680	But you're still avoiding your warranty, and you still have to open up your Wii, and you
11954680	11956000	might break the whole damn thing.
11956000	11957840	I mean, there is still that little chance.
11957840	11961040	It's very unlikely that you will break it up, especially when you're not soldering it.
11961040	11966640	I have to solder my chip in, and from a person who can't solder for shit, soldering hair-thin
11966640	11970900	wires on there, I'm surprised it works still.
11970900	11974200	But it does, and if I can do it, then anybody can do it.
11974200	11979160	So yeah, seriously, a new board, so they have some that literally will just plug in, and...
11979160	11980160	Was it worth it?
11980160	11986080	I mean, you have to step away from the I-did-it-because-I-can mentality for a little bit to, you know,
11986080	11987080	absolutely.
11987080	11988080	Absolutely.
11988080	11989080	Interesting.
11989080	11998320	Yeah, well, and once again, well, the clarification whatsoever, I'm not really interested in pirating
11998320	11999320	games.
11999320	12001920	Well, it's still, you can do it for like, you know, playing Regent Freestyle.
12001920	12003640	I couldn't play President Cap.
12003640	12010360	When you do such a thing, from my point of view, is to buy imports.
12010360	12013480	Yeah, like I said, I played President Cat on it.
12013480	12016840	I also, back in the day, I imported, you know, Smash Brothers before it came out.
12016840	12018160	Sorry, you had the Japanese Smash Brothers.
12018160	12019160	You had, uh...
12019160	12023560	Yeah, I remember that when you premiered that on, what was it, Uprade?
12023560	12026000	No, it wasn't Uprade, it was Justintv or something.
12026000	12029160	It was either our Ustream at the time, or no, I'm sorry, we've never been on Ustream.
12029160	12032080	We actually have a Ustream channel, we just never used it.
12032080	12034160	It's Justintv, or what was before that?
12034160	12035160	It was...
12035160	12036160	Op11.
12036160	12037160	Op11.
12037160	12038160	That's the one.
12038160	12040040	All Games was all up on that channel for a while.
12040040	12043960	We, you know, being the supportive affiliate we are, got in on that too for a little while,
12043960	12045840	but then I guess they just kind of disappeared.
12045840	12049120	I haven't heard anything about Op11 in forever, so.
12049120	12053480	I did hear something that came out, speaking of All Games, just like completely randomly
12053480	12054480	off the cusp.
12054480	12057520	I don't know how many of you guys follow Scott on Twitter, but I saw like a random tweet
12057520	12062760	this week that they've got some facility again in Southern California.
12062760	12064840	That's exciting.
12064840	12067780	I wonder, I don't know what plans that is for the network.
12067780	12073280	We usually find out about that stuff after it's already set in motion, but certainly
12073280	12076240	when I read that tweet, I was like, oh, that's pretty exciting for them, because I kind of
12076240	12084360	miss having that spot to, you know, just the best E3 I still think was the year that we
12084360	12086480	had the arena and that whole thing going on.
12086480	12090520	I don't know about you guys, that was my favorite E3, was just getting, I mean, it was also
12090520	12093360	the one where we probably worked the hardest and were the most tired afterwards, but just
12093360	12097680	getting to kind of all convene afterwards with the other podcasters, very much like
12097680	12102960	us in that really fun, almost frat house kind of place that I'm sure just lost somebody
12102960	12109360	a shitload of money, poor Ron, but God damn, it was fun while it lasted.
12109360	12114520	So anyway, sorry, got a little off the tangent there, but it was worth mentioning.
12114520	12121600	Well, what more, well, what more, um, well, it's been released like more than a few games
12121600	12128480	around and I'm still haven't, I have barely in a way though installed Dragon Age and played
12128480	12131800	it for like two minutes in a kind of way.
12131800	12135720	I don't know how it did make the show roll tonight, but I heard about the gay sex in
12135720	12139980	Dragon Age and the lesbian sex and all this stuff and I saw the sex with an animal or
12139980	12140980	something in that.
12140980	12148080	What, what, no, seriously, no, no, no, no, no, what, what, not follow up my big story
12148080	12153120	about gay sex in a video game that's not completely tacky with, Oh, by the way, you can also have
12153120	12154320	sex with an animal.
12154320	12157360	You sound like a prop eight supporter right now.
12157360	12158840	You sound like, sorry, go ahead.
12158840	12159840	Sorry.
12159840	12160840	No, I'm kidding.
12160840	12161840	I'm just, I don't have anything else.
12161840	12165720	Let me, let me finish up with AKA Ripper, then we'll talk about Dragon Age.
12165720	12168200	What were your thoughts before I brought sex into it?
12168200	12169960	What were your thoughts on Dragon Age?
12169960	12175840	Uh, it looks really nice and, uh, well, you don't need a super computer to actually run
12175840	12182560	it since, well, uh, I run it on mine and that one isn't, that one is all a bit, actually
12182560	12189320	a bit old, so, but well, but in a way also, uh, my other computer actually being in a
12189320	12196560	kind of, or my primary gaming rig blew up the other, the other, the other month, and
12196560	12201080	uh, well, I had to replace it and well, I'm up and running once again, so, oh well.
12201080	12204720	I have heard glowing reviews on Dragon Age though, a lot of people really into this game.
12204720	12206840	In fact, I've almost wanted to pick it up.
12206840	12214840	Once I get the time to play it, it will probably be good, but the, but for, for the, for, uh,
12214840	12219720	I was being stupid actually the other day, the other week also, since I actually bought
12219720	12221480	Borderlands 2.
12221480	12227000	So I have, so I now have plenty of games and in a way though, I'm not playing anything
12227000	12228160	kind of.
12228160	12229160	You sound like Loki.
12229160	12230160	That's me.
12230160	12231160	All right.
12231160	12232160	Okay, River, we got to let you go.
12232160	12236040	So we wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling in as always and best of luck
12236040	12240320	with obtaining the Wii and, uh, getting, getting your gaming rig up and going again.
12240320	12241320	Okay.
12241320	12242320	Yeah.
12242320	12243320	Thank you.
12243320	12244320	All right.
12244320	12245320	Later, dude.
12245320	12246320	All right.
12246320	12247320	We're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.
12247320	12248320	Sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but, um, of course you can always send us
12248320	12251520	an email if you didn't get through mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or of course we're
12251520	12256360	on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash O L R. Um, real quickly with last minute stories,
12256360	12259440	I don't know if you had anything else, Loki, but I just want to say about dragon age, I,
12259440	12264920	I did see the scene on YouTube and you know, I like, I like what they do, not just the
12264920	12266240	man on man, but the woman on woman.
12266240	12268840	I saw them both or whatever and I just liked it.
12268840	12273480	It's just kind of there and it's a little bit cheesy, but then again, sex and video
12273480	12274480	games is cheesy.
12274480	12275480	Well, I'm not positive about the animal.
12275480	12278720	I read that a long time ago when they're covering it and I'm like, what?
12278720	12280400	I haven't seen a YouTube on that.
12280400	12281400	I have like fable.
12281400	12283920	That sounds like some fable would do.
12283920	12284920	Yeah.
12284920	12285920	Anyhow.
12285920	12287720	No, I just, it was funny anyway.
12287720	12292440	Um, but in, in the end I'm not going to buy a game just because it has gay sex in it.
12292440	12294080	I want to buy like a good game.
12294080	12299240	So, um, it looks like it might actually be, I'm hearing really good things on it.
12299240	12303000	It's a good game that has gay sex.
12303000	12304000	It's win win.
12304000	12305000	All right.
12305000	12306640	Do you have any of the last minute stories for us?
12306640	12307640	No, not really.
12307640	12308640	Not anything I ever want to cover.
12308640	12313800	Um, I got a text message from a buddy of mine that I guess would qualify as the last minute
12313800	12317880	story who went and saw 2012 yet again, all these people going to see 2012.
12317880	12319280	I know I don't get it either, Jamie.
12319280	12320520	I don't get it either.
12320520	12326480	But um, Prince of Persia movie trailer from Disney looks fantastic, even better than 2012
12326480	12327480	itself.
12327480	12330000	Full theater cheered for it.
12330000	12331100	That's stupid.
12331100	12336240	No one cheers for 20 or for Prince of Persia.
12336240	12339640	I would cheer if they actually are making a decent video game related movie of which
12339640	12344240	I hear Prince of Persia just might be for it might be seen that, that just struck me
12344240	12346840	as interesting though, that, that the theater would cheer for a trailer.
12346840	12347840	You're right.
12347840	12352520	You don't hear about that a lot when it's not Harry Potter or um, you know, one of those.
12352520	12353520	So sure.
12353520	12356680	They weren't cheering for like the new moon trailer or something like that.
12356680	12357680	Maybe they were cheering.
12357680	12359380	Maybe it was Jake Gyllenhaal fans.
12359380	12360380	Maybe that's what it was.
12360380	12363720	You know, I don't write the news.
12363720	12364760	I just report it.
12364760	12365760	There you go.
12365760	12366760	All right.
12366760	12367760	Yeah.
12367760	12372520	And we have folks in chat that agree Prince of Persia does look awesome.
12372520	12373960	I I'm interested in the movie.
12373960	12374960	Of course.
12374960	12377600	I, I like Jake Gyllenhaal, but you know, I'm also interested in the movie.
12377600	12379400	It just looks like it might be pretty good.
12379400	12380400	So we'll see.
12380400	12381400	All right.
12381400	12382400	All right.
12382400	12383400	All right.
12383400	12384400	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, I guess.
12384400	12385400	Start to wrap things up.
12385400	12388760	I'm assuming Dar Sakura doesn't have any, uh, last minute stories, but I will give her
12388760	12396040	her chance to make the final thought blue and what a deep final thought that was.
12396040	12397040	Yeah.
12397040	12403400	Loki, your final thought tonight, um, shopping around, shopping around, what are you shopping
12403400	12404400	for?
12404400	12411720	Just looking at stuff, stuff, porn, porn, all right, and we'll have to 300 and nine
12411720	12413400	and one jam a card.
12413400	12415280	He's trying to find you a burger time, Rob.
12415280	12416920	No, it's all right.
12416920	12420640	And my final thought for the night is I do want a main cabinet.
12420640	12421640	I think.
12421640	12422640	I think, I think I want one.
12422640	12423640	So I can play this.
12423640	12427560	I want to play miss world, new 96 and my own convenience, whatever.
12427560	12429240	That would be the game I would play too.
12429240	12430240	You know it.
12430240	12431440	That's going to be the first game I fire up on that.
12431440	12436120	The 309 and one card has miss world, new 96 on there.
12436120	12437120	Amazing.
12437120	12438400	I'm surprised it's even included on there.
12438400	12439400	What is that?
12439400	12441120	Is that a, it's a, it's a card.
12441120	12442120	Is that a super gun?
12442120	12443120	No, no, no.
12443120	12447920	I was thinking about building a super gun out of it or building a bar top out of it.
12447920	12454040	It's basically a, um, Shamma card that has like four gigs worth of games on there.
12454040	12457840	Um, like including all the fighting games and all the beat them ups and stuff like that.
12457840	12463280	But for some reason they also have miss, miss nude world 96 on there and I'm not sure why,
12463280	12465280	but everybody move your body.
12465280	12467680	I'm just like, Oh, Rob would like that.
12467680	12468680	But yeah.
12468680	12469680	All right.
12469680	12470680	Anyhow, that's it.
12470680	12472120	That's going to do it for another week here at orange launch radio.
12472120	12474320	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.
12474320	12478960	Even when we are not always punctual with either the podcast or just being here because
12478960	12482320	we get sick or what have you, but we do appreciate the support of our fans.
12482320	12484880	I was actually checking out the listener accounts tonight.
12484880	12488000	We actually had a lot of people listening earlier on in the first hour, you know, before
12488000	12489360	people start to go to bed and so forth.
12489360	12493040	So, um, thank you guys so much for that and for your continued support of our show.
12493040	12494040	We really appreciate it.
12494040	12496000	We'll continue to be here for you guys and be free.
12496000	12501140	All we always ask is, um, just tell somebody you know about the show, help spread the word.
12501140	12502140	It's word of mouth.
12502140	12504020	That's what helps an independent podcast survive.
12504020	12508200	We don't have marketing dollars or, um, you know, advertisements in magazines or billboards
12508200	12510360	or any of that fun stuff or E3 booths.
12510360	12514680	So please, please continue to tell friends and spread the word about not only what we're
12514680	12517760	doing here on orange launch radio, but what the all games network is doing.
12517760	12520880	Because if you hate our show, you might like one of the other ones on the network might
12520880	12523480	be talking about the games that you're interested in hearing.
12523480	12524800	It's a win-win situation though.
12524800	12528660	I'm continuing to grow independent podcasting because we tell it like it is.
12528660	12534460	So we'll be back to do it all again next week, barring any outbreaks of, um, malaria or something
12534460	12535460	here in studio.
12535460	12537840	So, uh, we'll see you guys next week.
12537840	12567800	Until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.
12567880	12568880	Probably right.
12568880	12569880	Anyway.
12569880	12598880	See you next week.
