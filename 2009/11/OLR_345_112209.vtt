Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and the Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, November 22nd, 2009

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Both Sony Consoles get some new firmware

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Will Microsoft face a lawsuit over their recent bannings?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Will we soon get to simulate Sonic the Hedgehog in Little Big Planet?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
www.allgames.com

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me every week as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Jamie Summers

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yo

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you doing?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Um, my hands are sore

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
From what?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
From crocheting

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Crocheting?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Is that where they're calling it now?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh no, I see you actually have yarn there that you are crocheting something

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
What is that? Are you?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm making a pot holder

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Are they kitten mittens?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh okay

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Actually this is just my practice sheet because I'm probably going to put it over there with my dolls or something

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
But my mom, I actually called my mom to ask her to crochet something for me

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And she's like, well I've got arthritis now I can't do it

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
She's like, you can teach yourself how to do it

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I was like, well I haven't done it since I was 10

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
She's like, oh I bet you could

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So I was like, maybe I can

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
So I sat down with a needle and lo and behold I taught myself how to crochet again

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Don't you love it when little dares like that inspire you to do something?

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Well now though I found tutorials on how to do like hats and stuff

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
So I think I'm going to make hats for everyone for the holidays

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh fun

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
So everyone gets a hat

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
OLR hats

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Everyone gets a hat!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm poor, everyone gets a hat

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I wish I could say that OLR was started out of spite

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
But OLR was started because we were really bored

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hello

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
How are you Loki?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm good

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Do you have a hat on in your neck of the woods?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Crocheting?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Sorry, excuse me

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
No

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
By the way though I know you catch that Kitten Mittens reference

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And I watched that episode last night finally

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Because they have that on the

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
They have the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on On Demand

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And I was watching it

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
LOL

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
That's all I have to say

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
LOL is all I have to say

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
They were selling them

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Is that a real website?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah it's a real website

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
You can buy dick towels

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Love it

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
If you guys don't know what we're talking about

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Does your cat make too much noise?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I just have to say

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
In 2009, I know we talk about video games

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
We talk about a lot of other crap too

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Just deal

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
That's how we fill three hours here at Orange Lawns Radio

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
A lot of great television this year

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I haven't usually been so much into TV

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Because I'm too busy playing WoW among other video games

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
But there's just been a lot of great shows this year

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Modern Family I love

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
That show is hilarious

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Glee is great

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
It tickles my gay fancy

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
There's just been a lot of great shows this year

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
V has been pretty cool

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I hear it's sacrilege to the original

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But since I didn't watch the original

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm not as attached

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I don't know how Dark Sakura feels about the new V

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It's alright

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm loving it

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I like it okay

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
If I had never seen the original

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I actually watched the original

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
All of them when they aired

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I hope sci-fi network airs them

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Or something so I can go back and watch it

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I've actually got DVDs

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
So if you ever want to have a V party

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That would actually rock

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
My roommate is really interested in watching the old one too

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
One of the aliens was played by Robert Englund

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Nice

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
The funny, silly one, Willy

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I heard about that

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
His first thing he says

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Can you help me? I am just

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
There's a clip on YouTube

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Of the hamster scene

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
What with Diana opening her mouth up

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And swallowing the guinea pig

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Amazing

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I hope they reference that in the new one

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Anyway sorry

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
OMG spoilers

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Not really though

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Because we don't know what's going to happen in the new one

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
The new one is taking a lot of liberties with the old one

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
But if I'm right it's the same guy

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Doing some of the writing

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And the other half of the creative minds behind the new V

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Is the folks that did the 4400

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Which was a pretty good sci-fi show on USA

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
If you ever saw that

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And one of the lead actors is from it too

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But I'll tell you what though

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
If I sit you down through the original series

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Then you have to read the book that I got

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
The guy who wrote the original series

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
And you can tell he's obviously a screenplay writer

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
But he wrote a book finishing it the way he wanted to finish it

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Instead of how the final battle was

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This would be the perfect like thanksgiving

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Post thanksgiving plan

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
If I didn't already have plans

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Well I have plans on Friday night anyway

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Don't

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah me too

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Saturday

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I can't I'm going to be gone for the weekend

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Well you're no fun

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I know I know

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Monday

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
But I'll be back Sunday

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But we have the show so

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Sunday morning

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
We'll figure something out

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Sunday morning bagels and V

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
We'll figure something out maybe

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
If I'm back in time

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
We'll see

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
We'll get um

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
We'll get jelly donuts and pretend that they're hamsters

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And watch our lizard people

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I would say this though

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
V would make a pretty kick ass video game

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Spoiler

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
They're lizards

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
V would make a pretty kick ass video game

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I think there was one

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Was there really?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I think that there was one

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I bet there was one like on like the apple 2e or some shit

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
That's what I want to say

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Let me let me find out

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Please do

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Meanwhile

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Let's get into the way we always start off the week show

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
And how was your gaming week

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Don't get your google foo on just yet

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
DarkSakura

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Because uh

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
A the chat room

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Our lovely chatters at chat.orangelaunceradio.com

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Will probably beat you to finding it

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Tigerclaw is probably already halfway there

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Tigerclaw

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Tigerclaw

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Tiger

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I can't talk tonight

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Tigerclaw is probably halfway there to finding it already

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Um

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And uh

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
You got to do your gaming week

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
How was your gaming week DarkSakura?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Well um

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I actually did not play any well

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Cause again I have to remind myself that I still have the game

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Actually no I take that back

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I did pull it up

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
And then um

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I had to go some more

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Um

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I played some Sims um

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
I've watched Dan play through some modern warfare 2 and ODST

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
And um

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
He got these awesome headphones

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I love them

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
They're the best present

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
He ever got himself for me

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Because I can't hear a damn thing that's going on on TV when i'm trying to sleep

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
No Sub Warfare going

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Boom

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Whenever I'm trying to you know

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Go to bed

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Especially now since I have to go back to being at work at 6am

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
But I've been playing a lot of peggle. I've actually really gotten back into playing a lot of solitaire.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm trying to learn how to play the Baker's Game on solitaire and Spider solitaire, which I kind of don't like.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And now I'm crocheting.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Isn't Spider solitaire included with Windows XP?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, but whatever.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
They only have themselves to blame.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
They should have called it solitaire 2.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
Now, this is something I'm going to try to do, because it is kind of gaming related since I miss playing Breakout on my Linux box.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
You can just download it.

07:10.000 --> 07:22.000
I sent my laptop back to be fixed, and I swear if they put that Windows shit back on it, I am going to start off that laptop booting Linux, installing Linux, and then asking them for a refund of my Windows license.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I found out you can do that.

07:24.000 --> 07:44.000
Never boot up Windows. When you order anything from Dell and put in a different OS on it, you can put in, as long as you've got proof and everything, you can put in for a refund of your Windows license so that you do not have to, if you're not paying for Windows, if you're not using Windows, why should you have to pay for it?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Interesting.

07:46.000 --> 07:59.000
I always assumed, because it was part of what you were buying, sometimes you buy maybe a bundle of movies, like for instance, recently I bought the Star Trek Next Generation bundle of Blu-rays, because I wanted all the movies on Blu-ray.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
I didn't really need Nemesis, but it just comes with it, so I might as well take it, right?

08:04.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, that's kind of a different thing, because you pay, I think, $150 for a Windows license when you get Vista, XP came on my laptop. I didn't use it. I actually never used it.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
Quick side question. What do you think of Google OS, because there was a lot of news about that this week, which is kind of based on Linux. Really? It looked interesting.

08:29.000 --> 08:43.000
I think what they're going for with the whole netbook thing, I could not see myself using it on a desktop. Again, granted, maybe I need to see a little more about it. It doesn't look like a desktop OS to me, but it looks like a great little netbook thing, which is what they're going for anyway.

08:43.000 --> 09:06.000
I might give it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I am as happy as I could humanly be with Linux Mint on my laptop. It does everything I need it to. Multiple desktops. I mean, literally, you slide your screen over, and you have a new desktop to put shit on. But you can monitor everything through your little thing.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
So like a Mac?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Does a Mac do that?

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Or like my computer at home with icons that just scroll on to like...

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
You have to hook up four monitors to see them. I remember that. It was funny.

09:18.000 --> 09:33.000
But no, in this case, it's like you could have multiple monitors hooked up, or you could just go slide. Hold it down, and slide it over, and it gives you a little arrow to pick your desktop. You can have it show up in a cube, so you can rotate your cube and pick the screen that you want.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
You know, usually screen real estate isn't a problem for me, because I run my windows at the smallest possible resolution where I need magnifying glasses installed in my eyes to be able to see the screen.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
I'm talking about on a netbook. On that little... My netbook is a 10-inch netbook. This is perfect for me.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's not the size. It's how you use it.

09:51.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah. But it means that I don't have to deal with everything cluttering up my taskbar. I can just go from window to window and don't have to worry about anything.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Since we are a show about games, do you do any gaming on Linux Mint, or is that not really...

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, I told you I was playing Breakout.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh, okay.

10:07.000 --> 10:18.000
Also, one of the things that I downloaded right before my laptop decided that it was going to take a bath in the backseat of my car was Doom.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
Because Doom and Doom 2, they opened the source code, so they actually have them on Linux.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Nice.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
And so I was thinking about going back into Hurt Me Plenty mode, just because I love the name of Hurt Me Plenty and Ultraviolence.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
All right. Comments from chat. Got to start reading some comments from chat, because there's some good stuff here.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Gold anthro in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, which, by the way, I need to throw this plug out there at some point.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You don't even have to be attached to the web anymore to get to our chat room.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
Thanks to the allgames.com iPhone and iTouch app that is out there, if you look for that on the store.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
They built this into the app now. If you click on the schedule button, connect to chat, there's a new function.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Now, allgames.com has their own chat room, and for whatever reason, I can't even explain this.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
It's a historical thing. I don't know. We have our separate chat room from Orange Launch Radio.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
But they actually built it into their chat room. So if you type slash O-L-R, you join our chat room.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Isn't that neat? I thought that was very cool and they didn't have to do that.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
So whatever you want to do just getting that to the chat room, do it.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
That means I might have to just randomly hop into the chat room while I'm at work.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
You should. I know. I'm thinking of doing the same thing on my phone. It's kind of a neat little app.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I mean, while I'm on my break at work.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Of course, of course. Hey, anyway, comments from chat, such as this one.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
Goldanthro says, I got Linux Mint because of Jamie, and so did my best friend, and it's a great alternate OS, even for us PC gamers.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So there you go, a little endorsement there.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, another thing, too, that I really like, since we're kind of on the subject of games and Linux Mint,

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
is that a lot of PC and Mac environment stuff, they actually do have clients that you can run within Mint to sort of emulate Windows.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
Basically, I'm trying to remember what exactly it's called. I want to say the Wine environment.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
And there's a few others, but like, I've seen screenshots of people playing, you know, Sims on Linux.

12:10.000 --> 12:18.000
And so there's all kinds of ways around it, so you can actually, I think with Linux you can have the best of all the worlds,

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
but the best thing about it is that you really don't run into having to worry about spyware or all this other crap,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
because people are like, oh, well, fuck, it's Linux. Who uses that?

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
And I got to say this. Linux Mint, it's a nice little friendly sounding name, too.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
It's much more friendly than say, like, Linux Anchovies or Linux Meatloaf or Turkey Surprise.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
Another good thing about it is that it is made understanding that you're going to have users coming from Windows or Mac backgrounds,

12:46.000 --> 12:54.000
and that, it's very easy. In fact, when you have to do a kernel update, I've done two kernel updates, and it's freaking easy.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
And if you have a problem with one, you have the option when you boot up of picking an earlier kernel so you can go back and modify it.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
So if you get something that may say, oh, well, we'll optimize your memory better, then you can download that one and run it,

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
or we'll optimize your graphics better, then you can download that one and run it. It depends on what you want to do.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
It's, like, super customizable. I love it.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
All right, other comments from our chat room. Tigerclaw was unable to find anything on a V video game,

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
so I'm convinced it doesn't exist, because Tigerclaw has the best Google Foo skills of, I think, any of our listeners.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
However, uh-oh, Jamie's ready to throw down. But, here, Tigerclaw does say,

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
I saw a Q&A from the VentureBeat site about video game creator Jace Hall, and it does mention about a potential video game based on V.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
And he links to an article over there in our chat room. So, there you go.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
All right, more gaming weeks. Loki, how was your gaming week?

13:48.000 --> 13:58.000
Still very slow. Just playing Grand Theft Auto, still.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Actually, haven't really played a lot of other stuff. Still trying to get a chance to play Borderlands,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
but I keep getting distracted by working on the arcade cabinet, which is coming along quite well.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
It's actually, I got all the ROMs on there, all the themes I could find for Hyper Spin on there.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
Now, I was actually this morning going through and taking out some of the themes that are for clones and stuff like that,

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
because I'm gonna try once I get everything on there, because I just kind of downloaded all the ROMs for MAME all at once,

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
because I didn't know really what I wanted. So, I was just like, okay, I'll just get everything. Makes it simple.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
Problem is, though, there's like multiple ROM dumps, multiple clones.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
So, you get all these extra games you gotta scroll through, which is absolutely annoying.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean, I know there's way to do lists and whatnot, but I actually want to physically delete these.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
So, I'm gonna go through eventually and delete all the clones I have on there,

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
and then I have to go and actually make some new themes for some of the games I play a lot, like Gals Panic and that kind of stuff.

15:01.000 --> 15:17.000
So, that's why I started today, and just had to compile a new version of MAME that actually gets rid of the NAG screen and that kind of stuff.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
But I got to test a few things out. I tested a little bit of Street Fighter this weekend.

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
I tried a little bit of King of Fighters, because I'm trying to do a different setup for my Neo Geo stuff.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
And, I don't know, all it seems to play very nice, so that'll be cool.

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
Just really kind of working on that for now, I guess, until I, I don't know, move on to something else.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
Hold on, Jamie wants to butt in here, because, Jamie, what'd you find? You found something on the internets?

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
I sure did. The V game came out for the Spectrum, the ZX Spectrum.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
And, let's see, what else? The Amstrad CPC.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
So, yeah, you can, actually, if you have the Spectrum emulator, it was actually put out in 1986 by Ocean Software.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
So, round one of Google-Fu goes to...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Dark Sakura!

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Here was an earlier one. It came out in 1985.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
And then, funny, and then there was this one, also in the ZX Spectrum 48K.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
But, the one in 1986 was the better of them.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I will link this other link in the chatroom.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Alright.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Because it has the picture of the lizard person face.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Better luck next time to our dear pal, Tigerclaw.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Alright, sorry, Loki, anything else for your gaming week?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
No, that's pretty much it, yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
Alright, my gaming week was more of the same. I've still been playing WoW and all that other crap I play week in and week out.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
But, I did spend some quality time with a new game that I decided to check out this week based on some happy, positive things I was reading around the internet.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
And that game is Torchlight, which is a game that is by some of the team that worked on Diablo and Diablo 2 back in the day.

17:04.000 --> 17:15.000
And it's really easy to get the demo on Steam and you can play through the first little boss in the game.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
And the game really feels like Diablo a lot, but it's a little more cartoony, kind of set in a different type of world.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
A little bit of WoW-ish type stuff mixed in because you actually have quests.

17:27.000 --> 17:36.000
The only drawbacks to the game is that there's no multiplayer and you're limited to the three classes in the game, which, you know, granted, that's what the original Diablo was limited to.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
But you can use talent points much as you could, and if I remember right, in Diablo 2, you can use those to mold your character many different ways.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
So, you know, it's not like you're just stuck in three different skeletons. You can kind of mold that.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
The lack of multiplayer is probably the biggest drawback for me, which is a little bit unfortunate.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
But here's the thing is that the game's only 20 bucks, and I think for the value you get out of the game, it's pretty cool.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Because it's such a great little retro throwback and, you know, if you like those dungeon crawler exploration games, it's great.

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
And there's many different difficulty levels within the game. Like, if you want to play on easy, like I started playing on, it's super easy.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Like, you're just not going to die. Ever.

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
And then you can step it up to basically, you know, hurt me plenty and so forth, like there is in Doom, although of course they're called other things in this game.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, again, honestly, I couldn't even really pay attention to what the plot was in the game because I just kept thinking,

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
this is so much like Diablo, but it feels like, you know, kind of like a new, I don't want to say like a sequel,

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
because obviously there's an official Diablo sequel coming, but a new game in that sort of same vein as Diablo 2.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
And I think fans of these games, like if you ever played Diablo Diablo 2, which were huge PC games, you're going to like Torchlight and get a little kick out of it.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
Even if not, I think it's worth just trying the demo because the demo will entertain you for like two hours at least, and it's free.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
So go grab it on Steam and see if you like it. You got no reason not to.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
And again, I really want to encourage you, even though the game does have its drawbacks, you know, that there's no multiplayer,

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
and that was what made Diablo 2 such a huge thing, for 20 bucks, the value is awesome.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
Because like Diablo 2, they still charge 30, 40 bucks for, I want to say, like the battle chest.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
I think they still charge 30 bucks for. I don't have a store in front of me, but I think that's about what they charge.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
So, you know, you get a great deal with Torchlight, and so I definitely think it's worth checking out.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
That's probably the only new game I played this week, but I had fun with it.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
So I am making it a goal of mine to make sure I check out at least one new game every week for the show,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
because, you know, I'm going to co-host a radio show about video games, and I probably need to make sure I play a lot of games.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
But it can be an expensive habit, because remember, video games, unlike your favorite websites out there,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
video game companies do not send copies of games to us for free.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Very rarely. It's happened before, but very rarely.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
So usually that type of game playing is coming out of our own pockets,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
and the economy is taking its toll on us here at OLR, just like it has anyone else.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So we'll try our best, though.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
We certainly will try to play as many demos and all that fun stuff as we can.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
So, let's see.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Questions from the chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Ricky Go Mac asks, does WoW work on a Mac?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Yes, it works on a Mac. World of Warcraft works on a Mac.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
In fact, Blizzard is one of those companies that's always been very good about getting their games to work on PC and Mac.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
I want to say, I don't know so much about Diablo. I can't state for sure that one,

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
but I think Warcraft 3 plays on both, and all the future WoW expansions play on both.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
So there you go.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Deakman in chat says, loving Torchlight, it's the first Diablo-like game I've ever liked.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Before we get into gaming news tonight, and speaking of Deakman,

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
I do want to take a minute to acknowledge and further thank the masterminds behind our website,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
and that's Deakman and VX Jason XV.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
They both do kind of separate stuff for our website.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
VX Jason XV kind of does the server admin stuff,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
whereas Deakman is kind of like in charge of the actual website itself.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And both of them do a great job really helping us out,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
because I don't know about Dark Soccer and Loki,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
but I'm just not smart when it comes to building websites anymore.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
So, you know, their knowledge has been so good for us,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and the reason why I bring it up, especially this week,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
is because we had a lot of server issues this week.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
In fact, if you tried to send us email towards the end of the week,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
it probably bounced because we were having some server problems.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
But they fixed it, and they do all this for free.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Just like we do, they do it all for free because they love the show,

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
and just, you know, we need to acknowledge them as part of what makes OLR work,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
the part that you don't hear every week on the show.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
But it's important.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, I do have some other news on a technical nature,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
something that we discussed before the show too.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Sure, what's up?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm going to be doing new album art for us.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
That's great, because I was just thinking earlier this evening,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
and to segue into this, we now have a Facebook fan page.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
An official Facebook fan page is out there now.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Although we've always had a Facebook group,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Facebook about a year ago,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and we really should have jumped on this when it first started,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
made it a lot easier to make like a fan page

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
where we can deliver updates to your feed,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
and we promise we're not going to spam like crazy.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You know, we'll do it tastefully,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and just kind of have a central hub that I think will work

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
a little more better functionality-wise

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
to have like an OLR fan page.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
So we've added that on Facebook,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
and we're trying to get up to 100 fans,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
because once we get 100 fans,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
that's when our little like,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
that's when we move into the next stage of having a fan page.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
We can have like a short URL and all the statistics.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
It's kind of like in Spore, how you have different levels.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
You know, your little cell becomes a living creature.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
See, we're in the cell game right now.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Once we get up to 100 fans,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
we'll actually get to build a creature.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That's basically what we're waiting for.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
So check that out on Facebook.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It's awful. It's awful, awful, awful.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I was such a big Dragon Ball Z fan back in the day

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
that when you said cell game,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I instantly started thinking of that.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
No, not cell shaded.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
But you know the game that's like flow?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
No, cell game.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
There was a whole art called the cell game.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Oh, okay. Gotcha.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Gotcha.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
But anyway, what was making me think that is

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I was trying to find artwork to upload to our Facebook,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
and I was thinking, you know,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
as I was uploading the album art,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I was like, dang, we took this picture back in like,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
2005, you know?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And even though we took some new pictures since then,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
sadly, none of the pictures of that photo shoot

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
were really workable for album art, you know?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Sometimes it just doesn't come out.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
So we might have to try either A, another photo shoot,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
or B, Dark Sakura, I think,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
is going to cook up some hand-drawn album art,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
which will be fun.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah, I'm considering ripping off one of my favorite bands.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
TigerKlonChat says,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
It won't be long until someone makes an official OLR iPhone app.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
You know, I don't have the first idea how to do something like that,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
but hey, if you're interested in that sort of thing,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
you're into development,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
we can give it our blessing.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Just show us what your ideas are,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
and we'll help promote the crap out of it.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
All we ask is that it's a free app,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
because, you know, the show's free,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
so we'll have to figure out other ways to pay you,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
such as love and adoration.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I don't know.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Anyhow.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Porn.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Porn.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Tripple porn.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Tripple porn.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Tripple porn is just watching them eat.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I think that's all the housekeeping I wanted to get into tonight.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Facebook fan page,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
which I'll link and chat shortly if someone else hasn't already done it,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and all that fun stuff,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
and Twitter, of course,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
we're on there, OLR,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and all that great stuff.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Did you drop your yarn?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Are we okay?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Dark Sakura just had an incident.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
She dropped the yarn.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Luckily, Shermie didn't run to attack the yarn.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Is Shermie, the cat, a fan of yarn?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Shermie's a fan of sitting on her ass.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Okay, so no yarn play for her.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Loki, start us off.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
You got a slew of updates for us tonight, don't you?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yes, lots of stuff.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Well, we had some updates from Sony Online.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
They were covering the PlayStation Network in a big ol' presentation,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
which, of course, they put out on the internet as well.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And there's some interesting changes that they're talking about

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
making and some other ways they're planning on expanding the Sony Online brand.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
One of the things that they're planning on doing, of course,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
is expanding the PlayStation Network infrastructure to non-gaming devices.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
And what that means is you may see, you know,

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
connectivity with, say, like, Sony branded TVs, perhaps.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Sony, you know, Vio computers.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Who knows?

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Mobile devices, possibly Sony phones.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
So, you know, it's interesting, I guess.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
And they're going to try to kind of connect everything together that way.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm always wondering if they should just change the name of the PlayStation Network since,

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
you know, like maybe Sony Online Network or something like that.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't know.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
One of the other things that's also going on is they're trying to also kind of create a brand with this,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
you know, online network as well.

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
And they're saying that one of the major selling points, you know,

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
of the PlayStation Network is also all the features like downloading games, music, and movies and whatnot.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
And they're thinking that expanding that to, you know,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
all their devices would be a good value for the customers.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
Kind of like a little bit like how iTunes works and stuff where you can, you know,

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
download stuff to your, was it the, I think your media center for iPhone.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Apple TV, is that what they call it?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Apple TV, that's what I meant, yeah.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
You can download stuff to that.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't know.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It's interesting.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
Well, I mean, this is Sony's whole thing this year is this whole it only does everything.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Well, and that whole thing, it only does everything, you know,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
is that they're trying to sell this machine based on only games.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It will not make me waffles.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I've tried.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It looks like a Foreman grill and it doesn't make me waffles.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
It does look like a Foreman grill, so it will at least look like a grill.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Not so much now, though.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
It's slightly slimmer.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's like a Foreman slim, you know.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
But this is their whole marketing thing this year, which, you know, to be fair,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
we've given Sony its fair share of shit on this show.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
And, you know, like I always say and like we always say,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
we will razz a gaming company when they deserve to get razzed,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
but we'll give them praise and they deserve to get praised.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
And I think Sony is finally getting it this year, you know.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
They've done a lot of smart things this year.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
And one of them is this whole it only does everything campaign

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
because I think that's really the PlayStation 3 strength.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I think it really does do everything, you know.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I want it to play good games.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
There are a lot of great games.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Which it doesn't really do.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
No, there's a lot of good games on PlayStation 3.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't know.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
It doesn't do everything, but it does do a lot, so.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I want it to do things well.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
I still say Blu-Ray is worth more weight than I think a lot of people gives it credit for.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm not trying to be a Sony fanboy, but I'm telling you.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
No, but all I use my PS3 for is the Blu-Ray.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
It doesn't have any games on it that are really good that we can't already get on Xbox 360.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Little Big Planet, Demon's Souls, some of the PlayStation Network games like Fat Princess,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Pixel Junk.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I really didn't care for Little Big Planet that much.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
But the thing, though, about Blu-Ray, though.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
That was my favorite game that came out last year.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I mean, it was fun and then the novelty wore off.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
It's not as big of a draw as it was with DVD, though,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
because people don't give a shit about upgrading to Blu-Ray right now.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
I mean, not as much as they did with DVD where everyone's like,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh my God, a DVD! Let's go and replace our library with that shit.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But then now, a few years later, like,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Hey, wait a second, I just bought a bunch of DVDs.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Why am I going to go buy Blu-Rays?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
So they haven't really adopted it as much.

28:26.000 --> 28:32.000
It does help sell the system, but it's also not really something that kind of,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't know, it's not a huge driving force for it.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Well, on top of that, you can also, for people who want a Blu-Ray player,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
you can get better Blu-Ray players for cheaper than a PS3 costs.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
But that being said, though, it's a lot easier to update your Blu-Ray player,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
or even with the PlayStation 3 firmwares and stuff,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
because I hear a lot of complaints from people,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh yeah, I bought this Blu-Ray disc and I went and popped it into my player,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
and I need a new firmware update.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Well, how the fuck do you do that with a Blu-Ray player?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Well, unless you have it connected to the internet,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
you have to actually go burn a disc, pop it into your player,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
and do all that stuff on your PC.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
That's going to be eel, because I heard one of the big things

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
that's supposed to be a Black Friday deal this year

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
is that Walmart's going to have a $98 Blu-Ray player.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
And I'm thinking, well, that's cool for people that want to get into Blu-Ray.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Certainly that's much cheaper than a PlayStation 3,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
but I'm thinking in the back of my mind,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
does this thing connect to the internet?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Is it going to have Blu-Ray live?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Granted, how many people really use that Blu-Ray live stuff?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Probably a minority.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
So the average family will probably be able to do just fine with this player without it,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
but you make a good point about the firmware,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
is that unlike DVDs, you have to make sure these Blu-Rays are on top of the firmware.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm surprised they don't come on the discs.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Well, they can't because there's so many different players out there.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
I mean, you could probably fit all the firmwares on that disc,

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
but they're just not going to because they don't care.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Something else that they're looking into is also a possible revenue stream

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
for their online service as well.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
What does that mean?

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
That there's going to be some content on there that's going to be a paid service.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
So whereas everything is free right now, that may change.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
They're talking about possible models including PSP rental services,

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
also maybe some MMOs and whatnot.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
I don't think they're going to just all of a sudden change the whole service to being paid,

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
but there may be certain optional aspects that you may have to pay for later on down the road.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
But of course, they haven't announced anything officially yet,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
but it's something that's probably going to come.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
And then finally, Sony is expecting the PlayStation Network to pull in 50 billion yen

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
in their 2009 financial year.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
And of course, they're saying that right now they've got 33 million registered accounts

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
on the PlayStation Network, which is a lot more than they have actual systems out there.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
So of course, people have multiple accounts because you can make as many as you want.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
I have four.

31:05.000 --> 31:14.000
They have a high ratio of active users, about 5.4 million daily unique user sign-ins,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
and 1.4 million daily PlayStation Store visits.

31:18.000 --> 31:26.000
And of course, downloading volume has been increasing, 25 petabyte downloads a month.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
That's a lot of downloads.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
And of course, their digital sales is really growing.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Going to some comments from our chat room, DJ Rama S is actually correcting me.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
The Black Friday Magnavox player that's at Walmart, $78, not 98.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
That's a good price.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It's not bad at all for a Blu-ray player.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
You have to make sure it's a good Blu-ray player.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
And it's going to be bottom of the barrel if it's $78.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Let's face it.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Come on, get what you pay for.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Game Guru says in chat, this firmware junk is going to kill Blu-ray.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
It just makes Blu-ray more complicated than DVD.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I've got to be honest.

32:04.000 --> 32:10.000
I don't know if I see it that same way because that whole firmware thing is not very well advertised.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
I think a lot of people don't know.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
I put it in the same vein as HDTV.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
That's even worse, though, if they don't know

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
because then they're going to pop in.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Say they go rent a movie and they pop it in.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
They're like, what the fuck?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I can't play it.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
And then they're pissed off.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah, but they've already bought the Blu-ray player.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
It doesn't matter.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
They're still pissed off, though, and now they're just like, fuck it.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
I'm just going to buy my movies on DVD.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Well, okay.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
My other thought, though, is that the HDTVs.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
A lot of these, this is going to be a huge thing this holiday season, too, is HDTVs.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
And you see this in a lot of Black Friday ads is that HDTVs are coming as low as like $200, $300.

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
But what a lot of people don't realize about those very cheap HDTVs is that a lot of them are 720p.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
Those TVs are only capable of 720p, which is considered high def.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
And to most people, they're probably never going to notice the difference.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Like, grandma is going to notice the difference from her old TV,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
but she's not going to know that she's missing 1080.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
She's not going to notice that that's missing.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
Like, for instance, even the HDTV I own, because I adopted kind of early and still tried to keep it cheap,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
my HDTV won't do 1080p.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It'll do 1080i, but it won't do 1080p.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
And I'm kind of at that point where I'm like, dang, I wish I'd gotten a TV that did 1080p.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Honestly, you're not going to be able to tell unless your TV is like 60 inches and, I mean...

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Which it's not.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
And so that's why I haven't replaced it, but, you know.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
But the reason why I bring that up, I think a lot of people that go out and buy these deals and buy these TVs

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
don't know that what they're getting is not the, I guess you could say, quote quote, real high def,

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
or the high high def, or whatever you want to call it.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
And, you know, folks in chat are saying, do you really need 1080p?

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
I don't know. Maybe I'm just weird. I can tell the difference.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
But just barely. But I can tell.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It's not that big a deal.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
A lot of those Sony games only play at 720p anyways.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
And that's true, and a lot of TV shows only broadcast to 720p.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
But your Blu-rays will go up to 1080p.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
So, anyhow.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Just thought I would bring that up.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
Let's move on to some other stories that also have to do with Sony, and it comes with firmware updates.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
There's been a lot, a lot of firmware updates in Sonyville this week.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
We'll start with the PSP, which got a firmware update to 6.20.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
And a lot of what is new in this firmware update, and of course this being Sony's portable system,

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
is that now they have the PlayStation Network digital comics reader installed.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
That's in the new extras section of the cross-media bar.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
But keep in mind, this service is not actually launching until December, is when it's going to launch in most regions.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
That would be Australia, UK, US.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
There will be, early 2010 is when you're going to see it in French, German, Spanish, and so forth.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Japan will get their manga service very soon.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
There's also some other little updates there as well, is that, you know, you can do some things with playlists,

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
and that apparently there's now TV in there as well.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I guess there's a TV category.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
I wonder if that's for the TV shows.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I think it's just TV shows.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
So that they're not looped in with movies.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
I don't think it's like suddenly a TV tuner, or we'd probably hear much more about it.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
I think it's just a different way of sorting some of the content from the PlayStation Store.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
That was the big news on the PSP this week.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
PS3, I would say, got a significantly bigger update, unless of course you're a big comic book fan.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
PlayStation 3 got firmware 3.10, and some of the big changes they made in this

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
is that now you can pick a color for your little friends card, or whatever they call it,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
and that's also what shows up in the bar as you scroll through your friends list,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and you can elect your own color.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
This took me a little while to find how to do this, so just a tip from me to you.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
Go in and view your own card, like on your own friends list,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
and then you'll notice on the side is a little color swatch thing,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
and you can pick that, and you can pick between like 20 different colors.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
So I picked green, of course, because my PlayStation 3 name is Green Sky,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
so it would make sense to pick green.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And then some other folks picked other colors.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I see my friends list filling up with colors.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
And of course the other big, big change is that they now have Facebook integration,

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
and this is where now you can't really view Facebook on your PlayStation 3

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
unless it's through the web browser, and they do say they made changes

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
or updates to the web browser to make Facebook more friendly,

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
but don't expect to see it streamlined in your cross-media bar or anything.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
No, I would say your PlayStation 3 will now serve as Bejeweled Blitz,

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
Farmville, Mafia Wars. It will now publish to your profile.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
The nice thing is, though, there are different settings,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
and you can turn them on or off, whatever it's going to do.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
So you can set it to publish trophies to your profile.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I think that's the one I have turned on.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
You can set it to publish whenever you download things from the store to your profile,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
and that would include demos.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I turned that one off because that's kind of private.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
I don't want anyone knowing that I'm downloading Hannah Montana.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Porn!

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
All right. You can't get porn on the store.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
And then the third thing is that you can turn it on for game specific,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
like if developers want to implement Facebook editions in their game,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
think about how Uncharted 2 would publish to your Twitter, that type of thing.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
You can turn that on or off.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
So I have it off right now until I see what developers are doing with it,

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
because you know there's going to be some games that just really don't use it tastefully,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
but there will be other games where it's kind of cool.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
More stuff for me to block.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
And that's what a lot of people are saying, more stuff for me to hide.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
I went ahead and turned on the trophies because I said,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
okay, this isn't much different from the Bejeweled Blitz trophies.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
If people are going to publish those, then I can publish my trophies,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
but the rest of it I turned off for now.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
By the way, also, one other non-really advertised update in Firmware 3.10,

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
now you can actually report your errors directly to Sony.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Kind of like when your Windows system crashes in a program,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
you can click a button to submit information to Microsoft.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
That whole type of thing is built into your PS3.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
It's been hard for a lot of the gaming blogs to test

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
because you can't really force your PlayStation 3 to crash very easy,

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
but Sony assures that that functionality is in there.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
So maybe you'll hear more about that later.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Also not widely talked about, there is a new photo application

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
that you can download into your media bar.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I haven't played a whole lot with this,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
but it basically kicks your photo viewing up to the next level,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
does some different things with the gallery and the viewing.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
And one feature of your PlayStation 3 maybe you've never thought of before,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
you could have it cycle through photographs while you're at a party or something

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and be a virtual picture frame, if you're into that.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know, not everybody wants to show off their pictures like that,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
but just an idea of how you could use that.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
So lots of updates to the various Sony platforms this week.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Well, in Virtual Console there's been some updates

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
that I'm pretty sure are making people happy.

38:46.000 --> 38:52.000
Coming on the 23rd, we get to see the SNES Mario Kart for 800 points.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
That's pretty cool.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
And I guess they're trying to give us more things to be thankful for.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
Also coming out, even though there's not a date for it,

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
is the SNES version of Pilotwings and the N64 Smash Brothers.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Prices and dates are pending.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
So that's pretty cool.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Do you guys notice a trend here with Nintendo in the past month?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I don't know if anyone else has picked up on this,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
but they've been really trying to do a lot of this fan service in the past month,

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
and I'm not sure if this has any correlation to the holidays or what's going on.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Loki, I'd be curious your thought on this.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I mean, look at this.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
All these fan games are promising to deliver now.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
All the games we've been wanting since Virtual Console first launched.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Pilotwings, Mario Kart, Smash Brothers, etc.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
And we just got Final Fantasy last month and so forth.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
We're getting a lot of these big, big games on Virtual Console.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
And we're finally seeing awesome updates to 8-bit games,

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
like we wish they'd done a long time ago, with Excitebike.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
And finally, demos for WiiWare games.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
All this happening in the past two months.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
What gives?

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Well, I think it's just about time that they put them on there,

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
and also just some stuff for Christmas to get people interested,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
especially people that just buy new systems,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
to get them interested in what's coming out.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
So maybe to entice these people that are jumping ship to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this Christmas.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I just think it's just a matter of time that they've released this stuff.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I don't know.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelandtraded.com.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
ActDef says, yeah, Super Mario Kart. Pilotwings sucks, though.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Bite your tongue. I love Pilotwings.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Now, do they have Pilotwings 64 on there?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I don't know if that's on Virtual Console.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I have yet to check that out, if it's there.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I never played Pilotwings 64. I just remember the old school one.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
That was a launch title on Super Nintendo, if I remember right.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
They should do some new Mario Kart games.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
Like, do a new Mario Kart game, done the Super NES way or something like that,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
with multiplayer and everything.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That would be all kinds of awesome.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Although, I've got to say, Mario Kart Wii was still pretty decent.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
It's still decent, but you can make new tracks and stuff like that pretty easy,

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
or even import some of the Game Boy Advance ones or something.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
That would be kind of cool, though, if they could go on that retro kick.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I love Pilotwings.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Even though there was only maybe five or six different sports you could do in there,

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
the game went on for a while, and it was a very, very hard game.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
I love Pilotwings. That was one of the best Super Nintendo games.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
I think that's one I don't have, actually.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
The launch games on Super Nintendo all held up really freaking well.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Amongst almost any console I can think of,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I think the Super Nintendo has had some of the best launch titles.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I mean, think about it. Mario World, F-Zero.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
No, actually, I don't think Mario World technically launched with a console.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
If I remember right, that came out a couple weeks later.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
It was a holiday bundle.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
I think the only games that launched with the system were F-Zero and Pilotwings.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I could be wrong on that.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
It's been many, many years.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
It's been a good 15-some-odd years since that console launched.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
But I seem to recall that F-Zero and Pilotwings were the launch titles.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
And they were both awesome, awesome games.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Loki, let's move on with some more news.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Yes, and it's kind of funny, though.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
We may have talked about it in the past.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
I know we've talked about it in the past, about how people were boycotting Modern Warfare 2

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
because no dedicated servers.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
A lot of the stuff that they thought Infinity War was kind of ignoring and just removing out of the game.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
And of course, as you would expect, because it is a PC title,

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
hackers have already gotten their hands on it and have pretty much fixed the problems, actually.

42:44.000 --> 42:51.000
They have actually enabled their own dedicated servers and also some other cheats or whatnot

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
or fun stuff to play around with on the dedicated servers as well,

42:55.000 --> 43:02.000
including super jumps, infinite ammo, rapid-fire grenades, all sorts of crazy stuff.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
But it's actually pretty awesome, at least now that you can actually play around dedicated servers.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
And that should make a lot of fans happy as well.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
In fact, I remember seeing, they were showing the sales for the PC version of Modern Warfare 2.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
And actually, it didn't seem like the sales were affected too much by any sort of boycott.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
And that's kind of also prevalent with the stuff we talked about last week,

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
where there was a screenshot showing the clan of people boycotting Modern Warfare 2,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
actually playing Modern Warfare 2.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
But it is kind of cool, though, that hackers can come around and actually add value to the game.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And one of the other things that they found out as well, kind of with all the hacking and stuff,

43:45.000 --> 43:51.000
is that there's some new game modes that haven't quite been unveiled yet,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
possibly stuff that they're going to patch in later on,

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
including a new mode, VIP, which apparently is very similar to Counter-Strike,

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
which captures a flag with, I guess, a single flag between two teams,

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
and Global Thermonuclear War, which one side has to capture the nuke

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
and hold it for a certain amount of time in order to win.

44:12.000 --> 44:21.000
And of course, this stuff you can enable using the hacked-in debug console, which is in there,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
which is kind of cool.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
And the thought is that this is going to come out later on as possible download content,

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
maybe even on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions as well.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
So it makes sense that they would add value to it later on,

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
but it's kind of neat, though, that this stuff's already there.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
I guess, I don't know, people don't pay to unlock content too much,

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
but if this is going to be a free patch later on, that might be kind of cool.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
But if we've got to pay for it, that kind of sucks. I don't know.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Did we already kind of suspect that this was where the game was going,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
is that we're going to have to pay for all this extra stuff,

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
which is why they locked it out in the first place?

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah. And I kind of think it's funny, it only took them like a week or two

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
to actually unlock all this stuff that's on there.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
I mean, it just goes to show you, you can piss people off enough,

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
especially in the PC versions, you know, there's hackers out there that will find a way around it

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
to get the game to do what they want.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
And that kind of makes me think, you know, when StarCraft II comes out,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
that sucker's getting cracked open immediately.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
It's very interesting how game companies are convinced that their games are hack-proof,

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
and I think, you know, people need to realize that that's just not possible.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
Anything you don't want to happen with your game, you better not include on the disc,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
because it will be found and it will be implemented, you know?

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
It's just one of those things, with the technology the way it is now, it's just not possible.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
It is not possible to keep this stuff hidden from hackers.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Especially, you know, and a lot of this sometimes comes to, you know,

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
I hate to revisit a topic that's years old, but I think it's partially relevant.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
A lot of it has to do with lazy coding or un-coding,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
and I would go back to hot coffee in Grand Theft Auto.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
That shit should have never been an issue.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Should have never ever been an issue, because you know what?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
That truly was supposed to be taken out of the game.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
I believe it.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
That should have been taken out of the game, but you know what?

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
Lazy coding, they took out the pointer that would call up that little subroutine

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
that would run the hot coffee game, and lo and behold,

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
if you left the data on the disc, it was going to be discovered.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
All a hacker had to do was put that pointer back in.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And going to Rockstar, I mean, all their stuff is kind of lazy coding anyways,

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
because everything is in text files.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
They're easily editable.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I should know.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
If you want something taken out of your game, you have to take it out of the game.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
It's crazy.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Toagak in chat asked a question.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Wasn't there like porno hidden on a disc for some console and the author got sued?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
I don't remember.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
There was one, I think it was like Bloody Roar 2 on the Playstation 1

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
had some sort of like erotic pictures or something like that

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
of the actual characters or something like that in there.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I want to say that was the game that had that.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
And then of course there was, you know, SimCopter with all the gay sex or whatever.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, yeah. No, SimTower, wasn't it?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
No, SimCopter.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Was it Copter?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah. Funny.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, anyhow, moving on to something not so funny.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Lawsuits and what some might actually consider a frivolous lawsuit.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I don't know. You be the judge.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
Apparently there is a law firm out there, Abington IP.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
They're investigating what they call a convenient wave of Xbox Live banings

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
that have happened recently.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
The firm is saying that the tens of thousands of banned Xbox Live subscribers

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
who use their consoles, they deserve damages, money, what they call recompense

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
due to the timing.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
They think because this banning happened just before Modern Warfare 2 happened

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
was released and, you know, well after Halo 3 ODST came out,

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
this was to make Microsoft as much money as possible

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
because clearly that was the motivation behind this whole thing, right?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
So what is...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh, sorry. There's a...

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Dan's iPhone.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Oh, a cell phone ringing behind me. This is throwing me off.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Please, when entering the OLR Studios, be sure to silence all cell phones and pagers.

48:22.000 --> 48:29.000
All right. Anyhow, now this is weird because they're trying to do this class action lawsuit here

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
that apparently they're going to try and get a refund for the pro-rated

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
what was left on your Xbox Live subscription.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
But it's weird because they didn't really ban the accounts, did they?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
No, and that's the thing is they didn't understand it.

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
What they thought was their thinking behind it is that people expecting to play these games online

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
or whatever bought more of a subscription for their accounts

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
in preparation for these new games coming out.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
And because of that, then Microsoft went ahead and decided to ban consoles.

48:57.000 --> 49:03.000
Well, they're totally ignoring the fact that one, these people modded their consoles in the first place.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
So they're responsible for it.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
They need to know what's going on.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
I mean, come on. If you mod your console, you know at one point or another,

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
especially if you're playing it online, that you're going to get banned eventually.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
By the way, Microsoft responded this week, or just actually today, I should say,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
made a response to this whole thing

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
that basically, to sum it all up, they say that they have every legal recourse to do what they did.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
They were well within their legal rights. That's the quote.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Of course they were.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Well within their legal rights.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Of course they were, and that's why this whole thing is really retarded

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
because, once again, they aren't banning their live accounts.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
They're just banning the console from connecting on live.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
And at the same time, kind of removing a little bit of the features of the console,

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
but nothing major, like you can't install your games to the hard drive anymore,

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
which, whatever, that's fine.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
And also that, you know, obviously the console can't connect to the live anymore,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
and you can't take your profile from the console or whatever to earn achievements offline

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
and then move them and connect them online, whatever, because it's corrupt.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Although there is a workaround for that.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
But isn't this all in the agreements that you accept when you play games,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
that you're not going to fuck around with the...

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
If you have your console modded, you're playing burned games,

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
whether it be a backup of your game, whether it be a modded copy of the game,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
or a pirated version of the game.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
You're playing burned games, and that's unfortunately, you know,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
they're just assuming that you're a pirate.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
And I mean, probably 99% of the people out there are pirating games,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
especially if their console's modded.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Now what sucks, though, is the people that say didn't know their console's modded

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
bought it used, and then they get banned.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
That kind of sucks.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
But then again, once it, you know...

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
But that would be a reason to sue where you bought it from, not a reason to sue Microsoft.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Exactly.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Buyer beware.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Buyer beware, and then...

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of these used places probably have clauses in their contracts, too,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that protect them.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Yeah, and people also trying to return these consoles, you know, to stores or whatever,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
trying to exchange them out for a good one.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
Of course, you know, if that security seal's tampered with that, you know,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
you can't return it.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Of course, you can always buy a new security seal to throw on top of it,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and then return it, but hey, that's another story.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Dirty, dirty.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
But yeah, there's a lot of things out there that you can do,

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
but really it comes down to it's the user's fault.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
They knew what they were getting into, and you know what?

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
If you really want to go legit and buy another console, you can do that,

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
and then you can take your account, restore your account to the new console,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
and you're good to go.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I had two consoles banned this week.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I had one.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
So we play, you know, we used to play modded Grand Theft Auto games,

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
and you know, so all four of our consoles are modded.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
So far, though, only two of them have been banned, and that's fine.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
I mean, because I knew that was going to happen,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
and we have preparations for that.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
But the thing is I went and bought a new console, restored my account,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
took like a few minutes, and I was good to go.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I mean, there's no real issues.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
I mean, later on I have to actually go through there and change the...

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
so that all my download content works on my new console

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
without being logged in live.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
I'll eventually do that, but haven't gotten around to it yet.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
This almost sounds like a game to you,

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
like this whole, like, getting around it and everything,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
because you're definitely not pissed off about this.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
You knew the risks going into this.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
No, I knew the risks. I knew it was eventually going to happen.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Especially, okay, we are playing a modified game,

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
so basically all the stealth crap that would be involved...

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
And to be clear, this is the number one reason why you're doing this in the first place,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
is not to pirate the games like crazy,

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
but because you are modding the Grand Theft Auto games for lols,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
and it's not something you typically take online,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
although it sounds like you did, and that's what got you in trouble.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Well, yeah, because we had to play, you know, we played against each other,

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
and you can only play that online.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
If it was a System-Link game, like, say, if I could do that with Saints Row,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
we would have never taken it online.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
We would have just been playing, you know, via LAN.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Gotcha.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
And, god, I wish I knew how to mod Saints Row 2, because I'd do that.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
But, you know, we can't, so...

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
And that's also funny, too, because when our consoles got banned,

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
we played Saints Row 2, because, you know, the Kinect, it's alive.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
We got a backup game for everything.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
You know, but, yeah, so it's an inconvenience,

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
but, you know, I knew what I'm getting into, and whatever, you know.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
I have, luckily, you know, my first console got banned.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
My sister has a modded console.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
She doesn't play online because she doesn't have internet.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
So, you know, I get her games, and I, you know,

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
gave her a modded copy of Grand Theft Auto, and she plays that.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
But hers is red-ringed, and I haven't gotten a chance to fix it yet,

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
so I just gave her my banned console, and it works just fine for her,

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
because she doesn't give a crap.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
She doesn't know anything about, like, you know, connecting the live and whatnot.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
She just wants to play, you know, a game where you fly around in a police car.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
So...

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
Quick question from ToaGak in our chat room, chat.idontwinsondestrated.com,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and I don't even know if he can answer this, Loki.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
How do they know if your console's modded?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Has it been revealed how they're catching it?

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
They can tell, basically.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
It doesn't matter how, if you play in a burn game or not,

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
because, you know, we, honestly, we haven't played Grand Theft Auto,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
the modded game, since August.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I mean, whenever they patched it last.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
They can tell because your, you know, the modded firmwares or whatever,

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
they don't return the same values for, like, some of the security checks or whatever.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
They aren't sure what exactly is going wrong,

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
but there is something in there that is not returning the exact value or something

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
when they're doing a check of the disk.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
So they can tell what firmware you have on the drive.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
They can't actually read the firmware on the drive.

54:38.000 --> 54:46.000
But, you know, they can basically kind of see that you have, you know, modified firmware,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
and then they go ahead and ban your console.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Our good buddy, Dan, very, very well known to the show.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
He's been on before.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
He's standing in the doorway and wants to make a comment on this whole topic.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Please, Dan.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
They know, because they're fucking Microsoft.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
I got a quick question for you, though, because you work in retail and all this stuff.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
Have you had people try to return Xbox 360 consoles that have been banned to you?

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
No.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Do you have a way to catch them?

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
They know that I would pimp-slap them.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
You're well known in your retail company's business for pimp-slapping people that try to do that.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
For slapping the hose.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
Honestly enough, if somebody brought me a console that was banned,

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
and I tested it, and it worked, since we don't connect the consoles to Live as part of the test,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
we wouldn't know.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
But just take them to GameStop.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
They can't fucking tell.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
They're too stupid to be allowed to live.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
The views and opinions expressed by Dan do not necessarily reflect those.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Yes, they do.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
You can tell, because what they do is they can connect to Xbox's website.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
There's the whole repair thing that you can connect to,

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
and you can actually put in your serial number and you'll see if your console's banned or not.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Because when you try to enter your console serial number in there, it'll say,

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
sorry, your console's banned, fuck you, and that type of stuff.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
I think gold, anthro, and chat sums up the thoughts of the listeners very well.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
Thanks for the advice, XD.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
Some more news before we get to the release dates and soon the Classic Game of the Week.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
DarkSakura.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
Well, in other news, it's about steam.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Because they're steamy.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
It's nutritious. It's delicious. It's steam.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
It's water.

56:34.000 --> 56:45.000
Steam actually now has approximately 70% of the overall digital distribution of PC games.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
And that's actually quite a bit.

56:48.000 --> 56:59.000
And they're actually saying that the other ones, like impulse is 10% and others combined are 20%.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
So that's in terms of actual revenue.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It's pretty crazy stuff.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I'm not surprised. I use steam.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And it's a pretty good mechanism.

57:08.000 --> 57:15.000
And plus the fact that one of the major game publishers of beloved PC games is behind it.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
So they throw in a free copy of steam with everything that you get.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I'm sure helps greatly.

57:20.000 --> 57:27.000
I mean, you're talking about the creators of Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, all these huge PC games.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
That's clearly got to be part of the contribution.

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
Whereas I think all these other companies don't quite have the same tie-in like Valve and Steam do.

57:36.000 --> 57:45.000
Well, the other thing too is that they're also saying that a lot of the games integrate the Steamworks tools into their games early on.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
So that they can lock them out from other distribution platforms.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
And also it's because of how successful their DRM solution is.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
So it's pretty big.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Yeah, because the Steam's whole thing, and I haven't played a whole lot with this.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
But apparently it's very easy to take what you've kind of downloaded and go to another computer and install the software.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
I don't think you can do it unlimited, but it gives you somewhat some freedom on to how many computers you can do this with.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Because it's set by your account.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
My only complaint about Steam being a long-time user of it, I'm not a big fan of the interface.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
I kind of wish that demos were easier to find.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
And just, I don't know, the layout of the store is not exactly eye-catching or appealing to me.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
I don't know.

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
It's hard for me to put my finger on, but it's just not the most user-friendly front-end, the store anyway, to me.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
Like, I think it could be a little flashier in a tasteful way.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
I don't know if what I said makes any sense at all, but that's just kind of my thoughts on Steam.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
It's kind of sometimes hard to find things.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Sometimes, yeah.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
But I mean, it is though pretty...

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
I think it tries to be cut and dried, but in some cases it does over-complicate a few things just with the demo mixed in and everything.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
You know, how they have everything just mixed in and you have to really filter it.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Bond in chat says, they make you jump through hoops to get the demo.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And I think it's related to this.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Oh, talking about like audio surf specifically.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
You know, I didn't have a hard time with the torchlight demo at all.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
There's a little button there on the side.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
But I think it would be neat if they just kind of like just had a screen.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
You know, new demos to check out.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
You know, and I don't know.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
I don't know.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I would just lay it out a little differently, that's all.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
But otherwise, I love the idea that they took that whole...

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
What was that other gaming platform that you could bring... Xgame or something?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
What was that called? X...

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Something...

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
There was something that you could bring up inside other video games and chat with people.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah, I remember the Xfire.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Xfire, thank you.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
That's what it's called, Xfire.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
They kind of molded that with a video game store and that I think was a smart idea.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
So...

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Anyhow, those are my thoughts on Steam for being a user as long as I have.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
By the way, there is an unofficial...

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Well, no, it's really official.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
I guess, you know, because I'm on it and, you know, I don't think there's any other OLR groups.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And if you want the link to that, just go to OrangeLunchRadio.com.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
There's a whole little box on the side where you'll see the Steam logo among other big websites like Facebook and Twitter.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And you can click that and join our Steam community.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's pretty cool.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Anyhow, let's move on to some release dates.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yes.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Not a whole lot coming out this week, obviously, with, you know, Black Friday and Thanksgiving and whatnot.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The releases are kind of light.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But this week we have some miscellaneous stuff on the DS, including Photo Frenzy, which I believe is a picture-matching game.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Hello Kitty Party!

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Rob's top game on the DS.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yay!

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
What, you don't like Hello Kitty?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
No, I love Hello Kitty, but come on, let's face it, the games are all going to be crap.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's Hello Kitty Party!

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Fighting Fantasy on the DS as well.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, with very little fanfare, Karaoke Revolution.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Hurrah.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Your Shape featuring Jenny McCarthy, and it comes with a camera.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wasn't that supposed to be last week?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Because I've seen her remember making fun of this game previously.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yeah, I think I may have talked about it last week, but yeah, it's being delayed.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Seen it's Sparkle Vampire Edition coming out on the Wii, Tekken 6 coming out on PSP, and on PC Twin Sector.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And Rogue Trooper is being released on the Wii, kind of a port of the PlayStation 2 game.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And that's it.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Well, no surprise, it's kind of a slow week in releases because, you know, again, pretty much all the games needed to be out already to make it for Black Friday.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But there are still some releases over in Japan anyway.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000
We have a game called Mushi Himesama Futari, version 1.5.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I don't know if this is like an upgrade to a previous game or what's going on, but it looks like this is a game.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
This is on the Xbox 360, by the way, and that comes out this week.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It's a fighting game, or I'm sorry, not fighting game, shooter game, but I don't know, the box makes me think it's a fighting game.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's like a shooter game and it has pretty girls in the background there.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It looks like it's an upgrade of an old arcade game.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
These are all the games I'm going to be getting on the Xbox 360.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So it looks like you only have this game in original mode and some upgrades to that as well.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is a big release over there because there's a specific fighting stick coming out for it and all this stuff.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Sorry, shooter stick or whatever they call it coming out for this as well.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
On the PlayStation 3, just some price reductions.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Fallout 3, Mercenaries 2, and Mirror's Edge get some price reductions this week.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Again, all of these games coming out on the 26th.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, Naruto Shippuden Ryu Jinki comes out this week, as well as Star Sakura Puyo Puyo version 7.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Puyo Puyo!

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I know you're a big fan of Puyo Puyo.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Sim Animals Africa also makes its way to Japan this week.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Sadly though, not a lot of big releases there.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.000
.hack//The GU series is getting a big price reduction, so if you haven't checked that out in Japan, now's your time to do that.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
That's on the PlayStation 2.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
On the DS, Cooking Mama 3 comes out in Japan this week.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yes, there's a third Cooking Mama game and it comes out this week in Japan, as well as a game called Roller Angels.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Go figure.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And then lastly on the PSP this week, Gaku in Heaven, Boys Love Scramble.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Gakuen means high school.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So that's what it's called, Boys Love Scramble.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm not sure what type of game this is.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
It's an adventure game.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I do love scrambled eggs.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Well, it's a yaoi game.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I was thinking, does Boys Love me?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And then the picture came up.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Oh yes, it is that kind of boy love.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So if you want a yaoi game, here's the week to get it on PSP.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Come on, Loki, look at that screenshot right there.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tell me you're not interested in that game.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
That's on the PSP. I'm not interested in that game.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's a dude nibbling on another dude's ear and he's all blushing.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Oh, well sign me up then.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
No thanks.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'll link that in chat.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Here's another example of a game you just can't get over here in America.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And why not? And why not?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
There's actually places that will release the games in English.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
You can get them at conventions, so yes, you can get them in America.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Oh, that's okay.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I have one.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But even yaoi?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Okay.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
No, I take them back. Do I have one?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Chris has some.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
One of our giggling lesbians.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Well, there you go.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Just thought I'd bring that up.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
How about Europe release date Star Saga?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Yeah, on the 24th we have Gravity Crash.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I just think that's a cool name.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
27th, Just Dance, Karaoke Revolution, Lego Rock Band, Muramasa,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The Demon Blade on Wii, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja 5,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and Resident Evil, The Dark Side Chronicles.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
That's it?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The end.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
The end.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
We'll have more gaming news and then the classic game of the week

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
coming up in just a few minutes.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yes, lots of fun stuff.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So it's interesting.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You may remember with the DS, Disney, they're doing something very similar

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
to this called, I think, DGamer.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Well, Ubisoft, not to be outdone by them or I guess even EA,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
have a new service called Uplay.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And this is going to be something that's going to be coming out

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
starting with Assassin's Creed 2.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It's going to tie in with all the other games that are available

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
from Ubisoft going forward.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And it's kind of a little bit like an achievement trophy program.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And basically you can go online and link all these games

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
that you may own from Ubisoft going forward to this

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
and be able to share your achievements and whatnot with your friends.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's also a little bit like the Rockstar Social Club

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
that they've got there for the Rockstar games as well.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
So they've got a bunch of different services included

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Win, Help, Share, and Shop.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And right now Win is currently in beta.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And Ubisoft is saying that Uplay Win is enabling players

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
to collect units based on their actions in games

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
and exchange them for rewards such as exclusive in-game content

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
or other digital items.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
The first of which is an Altair outfit and access to the Auditor Family Crypt.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So that's kind of cool that you can earn stuff in games

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and unlock rewards in your games as well.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Is this kind of a trend where the developers are going?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Is that they're kind of like,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
well, we want our own kind of Xbox Live type thing,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
or we want our own little reward system.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Because it seems like, isn't Activision doing this too?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And certainly Blizzard with Battle.net,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
although that's different because that's PC.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Maybe though this is going to be something where they actually have

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
like, it's to kind of entice people to buy their games

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
instead of maybe pirating them.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Because in that way, with this you would get like a unique code

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
that would be, I guess, in your manual or something like that

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
to prove that you own this game.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Or buying them used.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Or buying them used, yeah.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Because I actually, console piracy doesn't strike me as

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
as big a problem as it is on PC or other platforms.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You know, it's a lot harder to do

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and so I don't think it's, you know, as impactful.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I mean, I'm not trying to belittle it,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
but it doesn't seem like it's as impactful.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
But certainly the used game market,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
if you have a code in the manual, well there you go.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's what they're really going after is the used game market.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I mean, I'm not sure.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I haven't gotten a copy of Assassin's Creed 2,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
though I'm expecting one to be coming soon.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Ubisoft usually hooks me up.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But I guess we'll find out when I play that.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I do like how you can have a rabbit as your icon.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Because rabbits are awesome.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I still gotta play Rabbids Go Home, man.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
That looks funny.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Well, in other video game news,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
especially in time for the holidays,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
you know, something that's being popular this year

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
with the economy, you know, kind of in the state it's in

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and, you know, people making less money

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and all that unfortunate stuff is that

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Layaway is becoming a little more popular.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
You know, I was actually seeing a news story on this

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
not that long ago about how Layaway is kind of making a comeback.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And Layaway in a nutshell, for those that don't know,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
is a way for you to kind of, I guess you could say reserve something.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
In other words, you buy something at the store,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
but you're not really buying it.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
You pay a portion of the money and then you make payments on it

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
until, you know, Christmas or whatever.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And then you get the item.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And this is much different than a credit card

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
because a credit card allows you to actually take the item home

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and then you make payments on it.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But Layaway is they keep it in the back

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and then once you pay off the item, then you can take it home with you.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But it allows you to make sure that you are able to get a copy of something

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
or that you get something at a certain price or what have you,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
which I suppose could be the only, you know,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I was kind of looking at this going,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I don't understand what the advantages of Layaway are,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
but I guess these are really the two big ones is that

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
you actually make sure that you are guaranteed a copy of a hot toy

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
or whatever it is and at a certain price.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Well, this is affecting the worlds of video games as well.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
In fact, Toys R Us made a big announcement this week

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
that their big gift, as they call it, the Layaway program,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
now includes video game hardware.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
This is a big request from customers

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
according to the CEO Jerry Storch of Toys R Us.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And apparently if you deposit 20% of the console's purchase,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
including tax and what it is they call a $10 service charge

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
because they are going to hold the item for you in the back,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
so think of it as a storage fee I suppose,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
you can do this cash, check, credit card, whatever.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And then as long as you make payment in full before December 6th,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
then you can guarantee that you are going to have a copy of this.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And you know with Black Friday coming up,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
this is a good way to I guess motivate people to purchase things.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Although honestly, December 6th does not give you a lot of time.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
That only gives you like maybe two weeks.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Check out what other retailers are doing though

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
because I know Kmart, you know as much as we joke about

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
nobody shops at Kmart, they do have a pretty big Layaway program there

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
from what I understand and you can put stuff on Layaway there

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
all the way right through till Christmas.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
So anyhow, lots and lots of console models and makes

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
are on the list there.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And also just a side note, Toys R Us is also expanding

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
their video game trade-in program.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Now it will be including video game hardware

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and it just began on Friday.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You go to the guest service desk and then they're going to scan your items

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and they'll make an offer and if approved,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
you get a little gift card for the value.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So lots of folks want to get in on that used game market

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
and now it's used consoles as well,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
although I highly doubt you could put a used console on Layaway.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So there you go.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Going into some comments from chat,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
AlphaCananagram says,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Layaway equals an ancient Walmart version of pre-ordering.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Frisbee says,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Layaway is also a good place to hide gifts from people.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
That's a good thought.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I never thought of it that way, but that's really cool.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Let's see,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Bochekawa says,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Layaway is awesome unless you cancel.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Usually there is a canceling fee and it takes too long

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
for them to put it back on the shelf.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
So if you're going to do Layaway, you might want to double check.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
ActDef says,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Walmart doesn't do Layaway now.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
They used to, but not anymore.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
ActDef, you might want to double check

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
because I hear it's making a comeback at a lot of stores.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I don't know if Walmart's one of them.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I know Kmart was the one that I saw on the news this week,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
but I wouldn't be surprised if Walmart does it to some extent.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And it might depend also on your store, ActDef.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I know you're in Mexico

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
and things might also be a little different down there,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
but I want to say I've still seen the Layaway department at stores here.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Also, there's actually a lot of doll sites, actually.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Like one of the ones I go through, Junkie Spot.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
If you're into the ball jointed dolls,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
they've had a Layaway program forever.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So that just illustrates that specialty stores will also do Layaway.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Hey, if they can make a sale one way or another,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
even if they have to hold on to the merchandise a little longer,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
they're willing to do it, which is pretty cool.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You're also dealing with vile resin dolls

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
that cost upwards of 700 bucks sometimes.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Wow.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Expensive hobby to have.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
See that big one there?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Yeah.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
She probably cost about 1,000 bucks after she was imported.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Boy, oh, boy.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But you do have some lovely little dolls over there.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
She was a gift.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And I see you just put your crochet work on one of your dollies over there.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You might want to take a picture of that for our website

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
so the listeners can see your hobby.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I'm starting a hat.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Fun.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Right now it's the size of a thumbnail, but it'll get bigger.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Yeah. I'll take a picture.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
All right.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Anyhow, well, don't get up with the camera just yet

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
because it's your time to take us through the vault

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and take us on a trip of yesteryear's games

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
in a segment we call the classic video game of the week

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
where Dark Sakura dives into the video game archives

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
and selects one game that she thinks,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
damn it, you ought to be playing this game.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I pulled out a sticky one.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I pulled out Ergize.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Ergize.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Or as it came out in America, God bless the ring, Ergize.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Let's take a listen to some of the music from Ergize real quick.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Go!

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Sorry.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's extremely loud.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I apologize.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
That actually does sound like you're doing this a little bit wild.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Okay.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So Ergize, the big thing about Ergize when it came out,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
now keep in mind I actually did play this in the arcade,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
but the big thing about this one is that for the home version

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
you can play as a bunch of Final Fantasy VII characters.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
You can play as Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Yuffie, Vincent, and Zack.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Well, the arcade still had Cloud and Tifa.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Yeah, I played that in the arcade.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
But the home version had the other unlockables.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
This is actually now a fairly rare game

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
because it didn't get a greatest hits release

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and it's not being re-released.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So this is one of those ones like Einhander

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
that you're just not going to be able to find.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
But anyway, the game actually has the same fighting system

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
as the Tobol series.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So it kind of plays a bit more like a grappling type of game.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
You have your fixed view from one place.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
You actually get pine characters and stuff. It's pretty neat.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But it actually, because it was done by Dream Factory,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
it was developed by Dream Factory,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
which is the same group that did the Tobol series.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It was put out by Namco in the arcades

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and then published by Square in the U.S. for the console release.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And actually it is on the Playstation Network, I forgot to say.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But yeah, it's a big fighting game.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Is it really on the Playstation Network?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
In America?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It came out last year.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Oh crap. I didn't know that. That's cool.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Well, I don't know if it's in America.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Maybe it's not, but it says it was.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Maybe one of the chatters knows.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
The other cool thing about this though is that

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
you actually have a quest mode in it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And the quest mode is actually really in-depth.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Like, you go through and...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It's like a hack and slash kind of action RPG sort of thing.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Where you can go and, you know,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
smack things around in a randomly generated dungeon

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and then go to town and sell stuff and do things.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I mean, it's the full-on action RPG mode.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And then you can do your character development

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
by one of those little five-point charts that

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000
raises attack, magic, dexterity, defense, and speed.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Which you can actually raise by consuming

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, or lipids.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
So I would sell those since...

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I don't really get it. Anyway.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
So you can, you know, adjust your skills

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
that way by what you consume.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And then you get recipe books and you can

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
trade wine for recipes and buy stuff that way.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
You get kind of like a stock market sort of...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
monetary system going on here.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I'm kind of surprised this game wasn't

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
bigger than everything when it came out.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Because of the fact that, you know,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Final Fantasy VII was so freaking huge.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You know, this game came out during the period of my life

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
where I wasn't playing a lot of video games

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
because I was busy with college.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Which I've talked about frequently on this show.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
But Final Fantasy VII I had plenty of time for at the time.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I made time for that game because it was so freaking epic.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And I remember playing this and thinking it was awesome.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Although I have to admit I never bought it.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I think I rented it or something.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
But I'm just surprised it wasn't a huge freaking deal.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
What do you think made this game kind of slip under the radar?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Is it because maybe the rest of the characters

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
weren't as recognizable or what?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I think that might have been part of it too.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Now keep in mind, the place that I used to go play this

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
in the arcade was at rescue lanes.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
If you remember back in the days when they had a cool arcade.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's the same place you used to go play like Blazing Star and all those.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And Dan and I used to just go and play this all the time.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It was really cool.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So we got it because we already knew the series.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And I think that the people that didn't get this game

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
got it for the Final Fantasy VII characters.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But I don't really think that it was promoted the way

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
that it needed to be promoted.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And on top of that, it really, as a fighting game,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
is not, I would say, spectacular.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Nothing outstanding.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
It's interesting though, because now we have Dissida

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
out on the PSP, which is basically a Final Fantasy fighting game.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And from what I understand, that game is doing much better.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Dissidia plays a lot different though.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yeah, and for what it is.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
A big battle game is what it is.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And it's also, you know, keep in mind, it's on PSP,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
so the expectations are a little different.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It hasn't penetrated the marketplace quite the way

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
the PlayStation 1 did, which was epically.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Anything else to say about your classic game of the week?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Yeah, actually one of the regular characters in there,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I actually liked using her more than the Final Fantasy characters.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
She was the yo-yo girl who attacked with yo-yos.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
She was a lot of fun.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But also the one thing to tell you is that when you play with Sephiroth,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
the background music is one big angel.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
That's her.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That's your yo-yo girl.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yeah, I was going to say, Yoko is the, Yoko yo-yo.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Well, her name is, let me go through the names.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Yoko Kishi-bojin.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
You've also got Ken Mishima, which always makes me think of Tekken.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Although he looks like Ryan Fury in Tekken.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Han Dehan, who's a Taekwondo guy.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Prince Doza, who I always just laugh at his name.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Lee Shuen Sasuke, who's the ninja, because I mean his name's Sasuke.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yasha Inoba, and Wolf Girl Joe, who was raised by wolves.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Oh, and you also have Koji Masuda, Clara Andrews,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
who I guess is the token, I guess, gaijin of the game.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And Django, who's a sub-boss, I guess.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It has a cool soundtrack to it too, I think.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And, um, Air Guys actually did get re-released in Japan in 2000

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
that had a digital clock and a character diorama

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and it came out with the Square Millennium collection.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So, and this is, um, it actually did, now this I barely want to forget.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
For the US version it had an Air Guys Championship Tour

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
that was held at EB and Babbage's.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Oh wow.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
1999.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It started in New York.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
But yeah, and DigiCube released the soundtrack.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Alright.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It was also one of the joint ventures that Square did.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
One of the only ones, I can think of.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Yeah.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Alright, well there it is, your classic video game of the week, Air Guys.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Available on the Playstation 1.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And certainly for a lot of Final Fantasy fans,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
this game holds a place near and dear to people's hearts.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Weren't you a big fan of this one, Loki?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I seem to remember you talking about this one.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Yeah, it was awesome.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
In fact, I have it on my cabinet, so I just have to see if it actually plays in MAME.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Very nice.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Very nice.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Alright, well, now that we've covered our classic game of the week,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
it's time for us to bring Part A to a close.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
But don't worry, we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Part B is coming right up, and in tonight's Part B we'll take your Twitter topics.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
So if you have anything you want to fire at us,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
quick, get to the Twitter and send us a message at OLR.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And then of course our rapid fire news tonight.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And we're going to talk about the video game awards.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
The nominees were released.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And some Phoenix Wright coming to WiiWare.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Sounds pretty exciting.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So we will be right back in just a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 22nd of 2009.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
A happy early Thanksgiving, of course,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
to those in America that have the Thanksgiving holiday coming up.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And good luck on Black Friday, you guys,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
if anybody's actually going to brave it out there at these stores.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Be safe, for heaven's sakes.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Don't step on anybody and kill them.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Although it sounds like a lot of stores are taking a lot of precautions with all that this year.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Also, people in retail, I'm sorry.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I'm sorry.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Exactly right. I'm very, very sorry to hear about that.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I'm checking out the Facebook, by the way.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
We already have 64 fans on our Facebook page.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And we only need 100, again, to get from a cell stage to a creature stage.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
So it looks like we might hit it, hopefully, by the end of tonight's show.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And we have one of our listeners commenting here on Twitter.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Alex Carson, I'm sorry, not Twitter, Facebook.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Alex Carson says,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I'll help you reach at least 100 fans if you mention me on the next show.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You're welcome.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So there you go. I did it.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So now, hopefully, I don't know what magical, mystical powers he has over Facebook,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
but we'll take a chance there by giving a shout out.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Rob, you have now made us whores.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Although he does post a follow-up, I just sent out over 650 fan suggestions.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Awesome.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But careful, guys. Just make sure you're not spamming,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
as long as folks you think would be truly interested in it.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But just I don't even really know what the fan suggestions thing is.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So just, you know, just want to check, just making sure.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
All right. Anyhow, we're going to get back into tonight's show with some Twitter topics.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Heading on over to the Twitter, looking at our messages at OLR.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Just a couple of them tonight, because stupid me forgot to ask for them until just before tonight's show.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
But, let's see, lots of comments, random things.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
ActDeaf made some sandwiches to eat while listening to OLR.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Ironically enough, Loki had some sandwiches before the show tonight, didn't he?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
So, delicious.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Subway, yes.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yes, delicious.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Gamergirl wants to know, what's better, Super Mario DS or Super Mario Wii?

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
This is hard for me to answer, because I haven't really played the Wii one yet.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And I don't know if any of us really have.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I did play it a little bit at E3.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
You know, I think they're just different.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And I hear that Super Mario Brothers Wii is like a great multiplayer game, but it's kind of, it's okay.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
It's a single player game.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Whereas I think Super Mario DS is a great single player game.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And I have played that one, and it's a lot of fun.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So, maybe that's the distinction you want to make, is that if you're into a single player game, get DS.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But if you want to get a multiplayer game, get Wii.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Although at the same time, keep in mind the other big difference is that the DS one can go with you anywhere.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And it's probably a little bit cheaper, too.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So, I don't know.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
For those reasons, the DS one might have a slight advantage if you haven't either one of them yet.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:08.000
But if you have some brothers and sisters or, you know, other family members, people that live with you, whatever, significant others that would play this game with you, then maybe Super Mario Wii would be awesome for you.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And the last question tonight from Scoop20906 on Twitter says, Microsoft's new Zune Marketplace on Xbox 360 looks pretty cool and makes me consider getting a Zune HD.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Loki, have you checked this out on the Xbox 360 at all?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I know it was in the latest update.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Mine is still borked, so I haven't got a chance to look at it.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
No?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I have not played with anything except for that one time that I tweeted on my 360, and that was the end of the update.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Which, by the way, I don't think I have seen a single tweet from the Xbox 360 from anyone outside of hi from my Xbox 360 or lol tweeting on 360.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I don't think I've seen anybody post an update from their 360 that wasn't about the fact that they're posting from the 360.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Because it's a pain in the ass.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Actually, there is something cool, speaking of tweeting on something other than, you know, your computer or your phone.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
They created a way to use brain impulse to tweet.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
What?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
It's on times 50 inventions of the year.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Now, it takes like a full, I want to say, 15 minutes to do an 8 character tweet.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But they're working on technology so that like, you know, quadriplegics or amputees can use the internet.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Wow. That's crazy stuff.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But it's not the type of thing where it's like reading your brain and...

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It works on the type of impulses you get when imagining something.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Well, wouldn't you be nervous about like a tweet going out like, I just pictured this chick naked.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You picture it by letter, by character.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That's still creepy.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Yeah, it's on times webpage.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
That's kind of creepy. Like, I don't want my thoughts tweeted.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Even letters that I think about because what if I'm having a dream about Sesame Street?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Never mind.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Alright.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I'm sorry, it's just a little creepy for me.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Like, you know, if we're reading people's thoughts about letters.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I mean, although I appreciate that they're trying to think of ways to get handicapped folks that have severe handicaps to be able to do that stuff.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
That's just a little creepy to me, doing it through the brain.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because it's just a matter of time before the government installs a chip in the back of your brain and they know everything you're thinking.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Ah!

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
A matter of time before Johnny Mnemonic becomes real?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Yes.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Whoa.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Dude.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Ah, reading some comments from chat.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
AlphaKananagram says, as long as it doesn't bring thought police any time in my lifetime, I'm okay with it.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Wasn't that like the plot of Minority Report or something?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I don't remember.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Or 1984, thank you.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
AJ Mixx in chatroom says, wait, I'll guess. I can read your brain.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Oh my, is that true? Did you fall in love with some pretty girl?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Dark Tetsuya says, OLR is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I see what you did there.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some fast news tonight. We call it rapid-fire news because they're just little things we want to talk about before we get back into some discussion. Loki's going to kick it off tonight.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Monopoly is coming to the iPhone. It's actually the regular version of Monopoly. I didn't know there was another version of Monopoly, but apparently it is.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:38.000
The version Monopoly Here and Now, The World, which was the one that came out originally. This is not. The original Monopoly, $5 in the App Store.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
So if you want to play Monopoly on the go, there you go.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:54.000
3D Dot Game Heroes is coming to the US, which is awesome. Atlas is bringing it over, and it will be coming out over here on May 11th.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000
So no need to import it, although I know some people will. Although I don't know if I'm one of those people that will do that.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Keep in mind the PS3 kind of encourages it by being region-free, that's all I'm saying.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:21.000
True. And then coming to Rock Band this week, actually, there's going to be some new songs, including a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers live anthology pack, including songs A Thing About You.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000
These are all live versions, of course. American Girl, Even the Losers, Here Comes My Girl, Mary Jane's Last Dance, and Refugee.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Aww, who doesn't know The Last Dance of Mary Jane? That song was awesome. Isn't that the one where he's dancing around with the dead body in the video?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It's Kim Basinger.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
That's what Rock Band needs, music videos. Don't get me wrong, I like the epicness of the...

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Remember how Amplitude and stuff would play music videos in the background while you were playing some of the songs? Rock Band needs that a little bit, I think.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:03.000
That'd be kind of neat. And those are available, of course, for $2 each, or the equivalent on your system. Of course, you can get them in a pack, save yourself two bucks, and it's for 800 Microsoft points or $10.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And then an individual song's coming out this week as well. The Go-Go's with Our Lips Are Sealed.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Epic.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Islands of Seals.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Why are they releasing that song and not Since You've Been Gone? Talk about an epic karaoke song. I haven't been to karaoke in a little while, but I'll tell you, I used to go to gay karaoke all the time.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
A little gay bar did karaoke all the time. And I'll tell you what, some diva, male or female, would always be up on that stage singing,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Since you've been gone, I can't breathe. And that diva was you, of course, right? Usually. But I can't believe, when I wasn't too busy doing ABBA, when I can't believe that that epic karaoke song is not making its way into Rock Band yet.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Maybe it's coming to Lego Rock Band. I don't know.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Maybe. And then also, Pink, Who Knew? All those are available for 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $2.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:10.000
All right. Well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news tonight. Talking about Dragon Age Origins, which has been getting quite a lot of press lately, there is some download content called Return to Ostagar.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's coming to the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It's only going to cost you five bucks, and they're saying it's coming out during the holiday season.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:29.000
This will allow your character to revisit Ostagar, the site of the Grey Warden's darkest hour, to reclaim the honor and learn the secrets of Ferelden's fallen king. So, nice to see that there's expansion.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:40.000
From what I hear, the game itself is, like, epically long. So, if you're already bored with Dragon Age, maybe you gotta go outside. I don't know. I'm just saying.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:51.000
All right. Hey, Cooking Mama is coming to arcades. That's right. Cooking Mama is making its way to arcades, and it's using a touch screen that kind of reminds me a little bit.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I don't know. When I'm kind of looking at it, it looks like, um, um, oh, God, the name escapes me. The big PSP game on, um, that made its way to, uh, ah, the PSP beat-matching game that's like 2DX that made its way to arcades.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:18.000
DJ Max. Thank you, DJ Max. Right? That's, yes, Technica. That's the one that's in the arcades. God, why did the name escape me? It looks like that when you're kind of looking at it.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:26.000
But you use your finger to do all the things that you would usually do with a knife or whatever. But, uh, some of the early screenshots of the game show raw fish.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:35.000
So, it's like you're having to, like, chop off, chop up raw fish with your finger. Looks a little scary, but, uh, if you fuck up, don't worry. Mama will fix it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Hey, uh, this week, by the way, was a big holiday for fans of Bomani, Konami's series of music video games, which, of course, this show started all about.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:57.000
One of the big ones, Dance Dance Revolution. Well, it's still alive and kicking, and, uh, 20 November was the perfect opportunity for Konami to announce Dance Dance Revolution X2 and the location tests that are happening in Japan.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:08.000
It looks like the first one scheduled for November 25th through December 3rd is when the first location test is happening there in Japan. For more information, you can head over to Konami's Japanese website, konami.jp.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Although, if the last few iterations of DDR, uh, are any indication, these games will make their way over to North America eventually, but they will be subpar.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Oh, I went there! How about some-

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
You did.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I sure did. How about, uh, more, uh, rapid-fire news? Dark Sakura.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Sorry, my needle was stuck. Well, Brazil, guess what? You got a PS2 now. The PS2 has finally launched in Brazil.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
PS2.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
The PS2.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Okay.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Yeah. So, um, they- and it's actually out for, um, $7.99, um, I'm not quite sure what BRL stands for. I know it's their monetary system, but the equivalent is $461.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So, yeah. Um, Super Monkey Ball 2 is coming to the iPhone. It will have 115 new levels, local multiplayer, um, enhanced controls, improved graphics, monkey bowling, monkey golf, and monkey target.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And, um, actually the former three are going to be free updates in 2010, but it will be, um, actually, um, out for, uh, 2 pounds 39 pence, so, over in the UK, so.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Um, and Star Trek Online, the open beta, is, uh, going to be starting on, um, uh, it looks like from the 12th to the 26th of January next year.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Uh, keys will be first come, first served. Um, you can get them on Star Trek Online dot com. Um, and you can actually still apply for a closed beta spot, but the, uh, closed beta is, of course, I don't think going to be lasting much longer.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Um, you can, um, the actual game, though, comes out on February 2nd. And I- sorry, February 2nd in North America, the 5th in, um, Europe.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Pardon me, can I fanboy for a minute?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I'm looking for-

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I am so excited for Star Trek Online, you don't even know. Like, that's how big of a colossal nerd I am.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Oh, I'm gonna be, um, on this, um, like, waking up early in the morning to get my, uh, my, uh-

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I'm so excited. Like, I just- the more I watch Star Trek, the more I love it. Like, seriously, I watched the new movie again over this weekend, and it was a bunch of us, uh, gay nerds getting together to watch the Star Trek movie.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And we were basically Mystery Science Theater-ing it, you know, making fun of it and stuff. I just had so much fun. And I- I loved Star Trek, and especially the new one, and hearing that this, um, is gonna kind of tie into the new one a little bit is very exciting.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
So I'm very excited for Star Trek Online. I think it's the one thing that will finally tear me away from WoW. For good? I don't know.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Um, also, can I revisit the Brazil story real quick? Because I think one thing to keep in mind, although we're sitting here going lol at this whole thing, is that keep in mind, you know, in some of the countries we're in, you know, the US, Japan, even the UK, even though you guys bitch about release dates over there.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:26.000
God, look at this Brazil. And, you know, we've had listeners call in from some foreign countries that aren't often well represented in video gaming.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Um, you know, kind of talk about this, that this is, you know, a problem, and why piracy runs so rampant in their countries is that, unfortunately, there's not a lot of official support in their countries for this.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Um, but, you know, a lot of the reason for that is, again, gaming is expensive, and often there aren't enough people to maybe support the launch of these systems.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So it's, even though we kind of sit here and lol at the PS2 just now being launched in Brazil, I guess maybe it's just because economically and, you know, the demand-wise, it makes sense.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Although, it is weird to hear, and I was seeing some comparisons, that to buy an official PlayStation 2 costs more money than it is to just, like, import one from the US.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So, WTF is the point. I don't know. But, regardless, one way or the other, it's out. So.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I guess they can play games in Portuguese?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Perhaps. Uh, Brad from PodCulture is pointing out, I'll probably be picking it up, too, in reference to Star Trek Online, my first PC MMO, actually.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Um, we're gonna have to figure out how to get, like, a clan or a guild or whatever, an alliance, a federation, I don't know what the hell they're gonna call it on there, because everybody's gonna be a captain of their own ship.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000
We're gonna need to figure out how to get, like, some type of official OLR, OL Army, in outer space.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I am officially making the OLRE in race, though.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That's awesome, but I think I just wanna play a Vulcan.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I wanna be a sassy Vulcan.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Yo, logic is shit.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Anyhow.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
This is wrong.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So wrong.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
What the hell you thinkin', bitch?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Anyhow.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And Act F says, uh, the USS Ferret. Dark Tetsuya says, the OLR prize. I'm so excited about Star Trek Online, you don't even know. Like, this is gonna turn into the Star Trek podcast for, like...

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Loki is gonna have to be the one that keeps us grounded when this game comes out.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I signed up for the beta, but I'm probably not gonna play it. Just like I do with all the...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Give me your key!

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I signed you up, too, okay?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Thank you.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I signed you up first.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, sassy Vulcan. Isn't that just a Romulan with PMS? You know, I should just be a Klingon.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Honestly, if I'm gonna be sassy, then I need to just be a Klingon, but forget it.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
She has to go around calling everyone a PTAH.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I totally wanna swear at people in Klingon. That's amazing.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I just know that's a... I used to know how to say your mother has a smooth forehead.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
For your sake, I hope you are initiating a mating ritual.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Anyhow, sorry. I watched all the Star Trek movies when I was sick with swine flu, okay? Leave me alone.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I'm gonna try to find it. Everyday Klingon phrases. There we go.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Loki news, quick! Save us!

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
The Spike video game awards are gonna be coming soon, and of course the nominations are out.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.000
With Uncharted 2 getting 8 nominations, Batman Arkham Asylum getting 7, Modern Warfare 2, and Left 4 Dead both getting 6.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Let's go through some of the nominations, shall we, and see what we've got here to start with, of course.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Game of the Year!

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
And the nominations are...

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Assassin's Greed 2, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Left 4 Dead 2, and Uncharted 2.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Interesting enough, all but one coming out within the last month or so.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
No President Cat. I am most disappointed.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Exactly. No write-in nominations either. That's kinda sad.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Studio of the Year. They have Infinity Ward. That's funny.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Naughty Dog, Rocksteady, which did Batman Arkham Asylum, and Valve. Of course, Valve is probably gonna win that.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
What awesome celebrities are we gonna see at the VGAs?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I have no idea, nor do I care.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I've never watched the VGAs. Can I just kinda throw that out there? Never, ever. Report on it on this show, but never bothered to watch it.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Best independent game. They have Splosion Man, Flower, Osmose, and Trials HD. Those are all actually pretty good.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Yeah, those are all actually pretty good. Those are some good picks. Out of curiosity, what do you think is gonna land Game of the Year?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Modern Warfare 2.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You think?

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Yeah.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
You don't think they'll go a little more avant-garde?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
No. Modern Warfare 2.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Uncharted 2?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Is Uncharted 2 getting the highest scores?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It's by user vote. Modern Warfare 2.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Oh, Modern Warfare 2. Yeah, okay.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Best downloadable game. Battlefield 1943, Fat Princess, Plants vs. Zombies, and Shadow Complex. I'm thinking Plants vs. Zombies is gonna win that.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Yeah, it's kinda crack. Ricky Gomack in our chat says, Jenny McCarthy, as far as celebrities go. I said celebrities.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Since when has Jenny McCarthy been relevant? Oh wait, she has a game to promote, huh?

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I guess she's been a guest on Oprah, so that makes her relevant. I don't know.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Best soundtrack. Brutal Legend, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, and the Beatles Rock Band. I hope DJ Hero wins, but I have a feeling the Beatles Rock Band is gonna win.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
That's, you know what, I gotta say this though. As much mad respect as I have for the Beatles Rock Band, that's kinda cheating. Come on. That music's like 40 years old.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And granted, it's timeless music, but come on.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:49.000
It's not really a soundtrack so much as it's just your entire music album, their whole catalog.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I would say though, DJ Hero by far has the best soundtrack. I mean, if you throw out the Beatles, cause that's cheating.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000
And of course, best music game, you have DJ Hero, Guitar Hero 5, Lego Rock Band, and the Beatles Rock Band.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
No surprises there. Have there been other music games out this year that have been as notable? No.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Yeah. No Poppy Music? No Poppy Music. No Karaoke Revolution. Sorry.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Let's decide Curiosity. Best RPG. Borderlands, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age Origins, and Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Congratulations, Dragon Age Origins, for winning that category, cause it will. Although, need to see Demon's Souls.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I don't know. Borderlands is pretty fucking awesome. But it's kind of like, huh? In the RPG category, it's a little weird.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000
It's more of a shooter, I think. One more category, then I wanna move on with other stories.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:52.000
We'll do best performance. Oh, let's see here. Best game based on movie slash TV show. Best graphics.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Let's do one of the weirder ones here. How about, oh god, most anticipated game? Really? That's an award?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Interesting. And I'm anticipating it loading. And the nominees are, for games that no one's played yet, but are wanting to play,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Bioshock 2, God of War 3, Mass Effect 2, and Starcraft 2.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I have an idea. I have an idea. You know what I'm gonna say, right? Oh, wait, wait. Guess what? Yes?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Write in your own choice. You know what I'm gonna ask, right? You know what I want, right?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Star Trek? Nope. Suki Bonshoa Renawee. You need to go onto, this is what I want the OLR me to do.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Suki Bonshoa Renawee. This is what I want the OLR fans to do. I'm gonna tell the people there.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Although, oh, doesn't it say something about it has to be an already announced game?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
An already announced as it's coming out. Well, hold on. That's just that category. What about best Wii game?

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Front them anyway.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Maybe, um, you can't write in that. But you can write in the most anticipated game, so if we do that, I guess.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Why not? Why not? We'll do it anyway. So I want folks to go and write in-

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
President Cat?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.000
To write it in and then put in parentheses President Cat. And if enough of us do it, here's the idea behind it, guys. Here's the idea.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:17.000
If enough of us do it, they'll show it in a clip compilation. So our goal here, guys, here's the goal.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:24.000
To get President Cat to show up for half a second on the VGAs. That is the ultimate goal. Okay?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
So in order to do that, we need like 500 of you to submit that as your vote.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah, so you can go to Spike.com slash event slash VGA 2009, and I'll be on there. I will post the link in chat where you can actually submit your vote for the write-ins.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Chatters? Damn it, no. You don't write in boys love scramble. You write in President Cat. Damn it. Have I taught you nothing?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah, make sure you put in- I'll put it in the chatroom. Sukeban, Shacho, Renna, Wee, parentheses President Cat.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And I'll post this to the Facebook and the Twitter, too, before the night is over.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
So it'll never happen.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It will never- no, this is all we want. Maybe they'll go- who hosts this? Samuel L. Jackson or whatever?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
The fuck is President Cat?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:32.000
No, is that he'll have to get up there and show you, you know, well, Bioshock 2 is the most anticipated game of the year, but let's take a look at some of the stuff that you want to see in the write-ins, and they'll show like a little compilation of all these other things.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And then all we want, President Cat, half a second of airtime. It's all we want. All we want.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
But if it won the award, that'd be even better.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Mine's it. It's in there.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Alright, I'm gonna submit, too.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Just done.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And can I say, OLR listeners, I love you. I really do.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Now to do it through Internet Explorer.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Alright, moving on, while you guys are furiously submitting your votes for the VGAs, and I'll put that on Twitter and all that fun stuff later.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Phoenix Wright, now this is also an awesome series, is coming to WiiWare. It's a courtroom battle game coming to the WiiWare, and this was revealed in Famitsu Magazine.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Apparently it's gonna be like an episodic thing, because they're gonna start in January in the US, and they're gonna come out every other month for ten bucks apiece.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Rise of the Ashes, which was the extra case that was added to DS Ace Attorney, will be coming out in May, I guess, for just a buck. Go figure.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
So these games are gonna come out, and I guess you actually get to swing the Wii Remote to present evidence or something.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I don't know if this is a mock-up somebody did, or the real deal, but I can totally see this being the real deal.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
That's the real deal.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Oh wow, that's awesome. So you'll actually get to throw out the Wii Remote, well not literally throw it, but like you're objecting.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
So this is gonna be pretty epic, especially for those that maybe didn't get into the DS ones.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
By the way, the very first game is just a port of the original Game Boy Advance title, but enhanced for the Wii, of course.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Lots and lots of screenshots already being leaked, so I guess this is the real deal. Awesome. Ten dollars? That's not bad at all.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Now sadly the games are not being ported to widescreen or anything like that. They'll be bordered like a lot of those classic video games are.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:19.000
But hey, ten bucks for a video game that is almost like cult status, if you wanna say. Not bad at all, right?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
No, not at all. There you go.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Dark Sakura, moving on.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Well, for people who are fans of LittleBigPlanet, there's something pretty cool for those people.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
As soon as I close down my 50,000 submissions of President Cat.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Yeah, there are going to be Sonic the Hedgehog themed outfits for LittleBigPlanet.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:47:03.000
You have, looks like Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, I guess that's supposed to be Shadow, and Eggman. Or Robotnik, sorry.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Do they need to have a Mecha Sonic one? That would be cool.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
That's pretty neat. They look cute.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Kind of interesting.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
They look like, the Knuckles looks like a monkey.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I think this is the first time besides, and I could be wrong, besides the God of War characters, that you're seeing other characters coming into LittleBigPlanet.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:31.000
You know, and especially the fact that it's coming from a third party this time. It's not one of Sony's properties directly. It's actually Sega's giving their blessing. That's kind of a big deal.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
The Knuckles looks like, they all look like monkeys except for Eggman.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Well, you know, they still have to retain that LittleBigPlanet Sackboy look.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They look like big monkeys.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
It's just going to be hilarious for all those people that make knockoff levels from Sonic.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I want, okay, listeners, I challenge you. Make a really kick-ass casino night. And then show us.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:10.000
They do have some levels that are in LittleBigPlanet that are basically mockups of Sonic the Hedgehog already. Too bad they don't have super speed with those costumes. That would be kind of cool.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:18.000
It would be cool if, yeah, kind of like how they implemented in the Metal Gear. You have the gun, like maybe implement super speed. We'll see.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Well, something not quite that cool and actually quite disturbing. Apparently, there's a guy who's really into his dating sims, including the dating sim Love Plus.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:43.000
So much so that he decided to get married to it. Yes, that's right. You heard me right. A guy got married to his DS game.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:57.000
And you can only do this in one place, apparently. Guam. The guy was pronounced man and wife with his copy of Dating Sim Love Plus.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And apparently, he married one of the characters in the game, Nene Onigasaki, one of the three virtual girlfriends in the game.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And apparently, he's having a reception and everything. He's invited the media. It's just ridiculous.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Come on. Are you that much of a loser that you married a video game? And Guam, what is your problem? You're actually performing a ceremony for somebody that wants to marry a video game?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I just don't get it. Like, really? He married his video game? How does that even work? Is this just a stunt for publicity or something someone made up to see if it would get coverage on blogs?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I don't even understand how legally that works. I don't know, but apparently... So you're telling me gays can't get married yet, which are two living, breathing people that pay taxes, yet you can marry your video game?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:22.000
This is in Guam. Well, still... Is there gay marriage in Guam? I don't know. But it's just, the whole thing's just, like, what? I think the guy did it for attention.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Attention, whore. Yeah, apparently, I don't know, they're... I'm not sure if this is the same guy, although I find it a little odd if there's someone else in Guam that's also, you know, walking around with his DS.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:56.000
But apparently some guy, I'm thinking the same guy, also went and visited the Love Bell, which apparently brings good luck to couples, and you're supposed to pull the rope together with the couple, or both of you are supposed to pull the rope together, and of course he had his DS in his hand and pulled the rope with the DS in his hand.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Loser! Tigerclaw in chat. Here's the thing. What if they come up with a sequel to that video game? Will he divorce the previous one and marry the new one?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Will he have to... What if you leave your estate to a video game? How does that even work? Does that mean that the video game developers would get the money?

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Yeah, I'm kind of inclined to agree with Bond. Leave the story alone, let's walk away from this now, step away from the show, get away from the news article, but seriously? Seriously? You married your game?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.000
And also, I mean, come on, the chick in it, she's underage looking, man. I mean, that's gotta be illegal.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Alright, well, things are just gonna go from bad to worse here in a minute here. You might remember there was this attention whore out there, Eric Estavillo, who was banned from the PlayStation Network, and he ended up, because he made some hateful comments in the Resistance community, he actually sued Sony twice, and it got shot down by Judge Ronald White, because Sony is not part of the government, you know, the free speech First Amendment doesn't apply.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:26.000
So what does he do? He decides that in order to find fairness and right in this world, he sues Microsoft and Nintendo. That's right, he's suing $75,000 to Microsoft for the undue stress and sadness caused by the Red Rings of Death.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Quote, Microsoft should have to bear the burden that is now put on the shoulders of this disabled plaintiff. Nintendo is being sued for interfering with the, quote, pursuit of happiness by deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel and Ocarina applications via a system update.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:53:13.000
You know what I have to say? You, out of the gene pool, right now. Like, really? I mean, talk about attention whore. These are the very definition of frivolous lawsuit. First off, neither of these systems owe you anything. I mean, the Red Ring of Death thing we've seen before, I mean, get a new cause.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:34.000
The one that really jumps out at me is that Nintendo deleting, blocking, or prohibiting the homebrew channel, so protecting their rights to people modifying the console means you should get to sue them. Does not compute, syntax error ready. I mean, really?

01:53:34.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I hope, I seriously hope that they make you pay for all legal fees, seriously. The legend of Zaku says he needs to have his lawyer employ the Chewbacca defense. Dark Tetsuya says, where are the FUs of the week when we need them? Funny you should mention.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.000
In the course we dedicate our FUs of the week tonight to said person in previous story. Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:27.000
FU to people that don't know how to turn on their headlights in the dark. Yes, I see people driving around in their cars, it's pitch black outside, no headlights on. Or, even better, they have their parking lights on. I'm sorry, parking lights are not headlights.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
They need to be eaten by a grue.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Learn to drive safely.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Um, my FU of the week just goes to the fact that the weekend has been very, very short and that, you know, I have to go back to work before I'm ready. I'm just not ready, the weekend's already over. Poor baby. Poor me.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Well, FU number one, me going back to work full time now that I'm officially off of my leave now that my hand works. And, um, also to getting this stuff all over my hands. Uh, acrylic medium for textiles. Gross.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Uh, by the way, the chatters think that, um, this is how the judge should react in that case when the guy walks into the courtroom and, uh, suing Nintendo and Microsoft, that this should be the judge's response. Check it out. Let's see if, um, you guys would agree with, uh, the judge's stance if this were it.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:38.000
It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal. You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You bumped into the ceiling, which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
God, I hope that's exactly how it goes.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Let's get to the mailbag, something a little more pleasant. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we pick some of our favorites and read them here on the air, or, uh, we pick some of our not-so-favorites and read them on the air anyway to make fun of them.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Snark Socko, why don't you dive in the mailbag head first, pull out some emails, and, uh, read them.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Well, one's from Spazinator, and actually I'd like to go ahead and say that the, because I've been following up on Twitter, um, the situation was resolved. We followed our advice.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I remember this whole thing from last week, and hopefully the listeners do, too. I know the podcast hasn't hit the feed yet, but in a nutshell, um, Spazinator lost the rights to his video content. I think it had something to do with when he backed them up to his drive or something.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Uh, he had to ref- I don't remember the details, sorry guys.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
He had to reformat because of an install error that caused his game to- it, like, glitched or something.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And Sony basically told him, you get nothing, you lose, good day, sir, and we said you need to call back and speak to a supervisor, escalate it, figure out what part of the policy this falls under, and so the situation was resolved.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Well, he says, hi, I'm writing this literally as 11-16-09's show is ending. I tried to call in, but couldn't get there. We actually did talk to him, didn't we?

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Not on the phone, only email last week.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Um, I just thought I'd give you some additional info regarding my last email and answer some of the questions and whatnot. Firstly, I think either XLink or AKRipper asked why I didn't back up the stuff.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I- I did, on two Western Digital Passport external HDDs. I don't own a PC yet, by the way. I do the same for my game saves and music.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:21.000
VideoStore works a bit differently from the GameStore. While the GameStore maintains a list of everything you download, the VideoStore doesn't, aside from trailers and other free content.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Once you download a paid video, it disappears from the list, so you can't re-download it. Also, Sony used the excuse on Friday of their EULA for why they won't let me re-download the videos, but he did get it resolved, did escalate it, and did get all of the stuff, his content returned.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And that happened after this email, right?

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Yeah.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Okay. And I'm sure, you know, he likes to call us a lot, so I'm sure he'll be on the phone later on to tell us more about it, so let's just go ahead and go to the next call. Hopefully he gets through.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Okay. The next one up is from someone who didn't name themselves, so I'm just gonna say Brandon, because that's the first name.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Anyway. Dear OLR and gamer crew, I have some monster reviews for DS and PSP slash PSN games plus news, Hannah Montana the movie DS. Okay. Um, I know, I know, I know what the living hell is. Seventeen year old boy playing a game for little tween girls that's only the audience. The sound is MP3 quality, it gets a 3. Okay.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Dude. Grammar. Next, DJ Hero. Okay, Is does not have a Z. It's IS, not IZ. Gosh.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Alright. This is the ultimate DJ Sim. The genre's range- okay, he uses genre, but doesn't know how- anyway. Ranged from rap to Motown, easy learning curve, and great. Great does not have an E at the end. For music and gaming fans alike, I give it a 10.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Peace out, oh, DS Lover. No wonder. This is sponsored by BeatMania, the Losers- Losers is not spelled L-U-Z-E-R-S. I'm not reading anything else from you.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Let's go to the grammar judges on that email.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Sorry. Okay, this last one comes from, um, someone.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Hi. This is my first email, so let me start off saying I love the show, it's pretty much the closest I get to a video game discussion. Most of my friends play Wii Sports and minigame collections.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys a question. What was your first midnight release game you stood in line for? And what was the longest you waited for? My first was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which was interesting because I was only 14, and they didn't ask for ID back then.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:46.000
It was okay, though, because my mom and dad watched me play Vice City and said they would answer any questions I had.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:59.000
The longest wait was when the Wii was launching. Three friends and I waited 33 hours in 20 degree weathers to buy it. The only reason we had to wait outside was two days earlier people were waiting in the store for PS3 and were opening toys and trashing the store.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I mean, why would you do that? I'll say people should not be jackasses and smoke in line. Amen.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I was in line for Modern Warfare 2 and these people were smoking joints. I'm not against weed, but seriously, do that in privacy, not in public. They did have a sober driver, at least.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Well, I look forward to your answers. I hope the podcast feed is updated soon because my computer has been fried for a month and I'm using the PSP to listen to you guys.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Two episodes went up today. Go get them now.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
By the way, this email is brought to you by Lil' Catz, where you can house cheeseburger and invisible items.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I have to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the midnight releases. It's usually freaking cold out. The last one I can honestly remember going to, actually I think the first one I went to was when the Wii was released.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
My first was the Dreamcast.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And even then, I didn't wait in line all night. We went out to go take, remember we did this whole cute little promotion thing where we took cookies and orange soda to people in line?

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Chris and I were taking donuts and coffee.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:06.000
It was a cheap promotion for our show, basically. But people seemed to genuinely appreciate it. At first, people were kind of weirded out by it, like, whoa, people are bringing us stuff.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:14.000
We're like, no, we're just trying to promote our show. And people were pretty cool with it. In fact, remember that? Some dude at Target was listening to our show on his iPod.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000
That was such a trip. He knew who we were. So that was awesome.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:28.000
So yeah, that was cool. And you guys ended up staying at Target and got your Wii. And then I sent my roommate, Christopher, to go so I could sleep in my nice warm bed and I didn't have to wait all night for a Wii.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Well, my first midnight launch that I think I went to was when the Dreamcast came out. September 9, 1999. We'd already had a Dreamcast by then, for the record.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Because we had an import Dreamcast. But Dan and I waited in line, and we were really only there for about maybe three, four hours.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:55.000
My friend Mel, not Mel as in Mel and Melody, but Mel that manages the GameStop.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Yes, I know Mel.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:05.000
She and I actually sat in line and we actually walked over to Barnes and Noble, bought cheap books, and just sat in line reading cheap books off the clear shelf.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:15.000
You know, I usually don't go to midnight releases. I'm patient enough to wait until the next day. With my job, I can't stay up all night playing a video game. I have to go to work the next day.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Well, the launch for the Wii, though, that was over a weekend. Because I remember Marissa was in town, and we went to see Marissa, our buxom friend Marissa, at some music convention for indie artists or something.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:44.000
It was a pretty cool thing. And then you called us to let us know what you and...

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Because literally it was a last minute idea. Like, we were like, let's go out and take cookies to the people in line and then say it's from Orange Line Radio.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Chris and I bought our place in line. Seriously, we're like, dude, we're gonna go out and get donuts and coffee. And we will give you some if you let us get in line. Okay. So we got in line.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
So they held your place, basically.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
They held us the place in line.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And from what I remember at Target, anyone that was in line before like 5, 6 a.m. ended up getting one anyway.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Well, this one woman walked up, just as they had given out all the numbers, and everyone who was there got a number. Except her.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:29.000
She comes prancing her little butt up at 7 in the morning, going, so where's my number? Um, you missed out, ma'am.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And this was, of course, when the Wii was still hard to get, so it was... I think that we were smart. We took the Ferengi rules of acquisition to heart and swallowed, I think, was it...

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Dignity and an empty sack is worth a sack.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Can you believe that was three years ago?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Yeah.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And that all went down?

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Alright.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
So yeah.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Now, uh, I guess, uh, any other emails tonight?

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
No!

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Lowkey, did you ever do a midnight launch? They're not really my thing. You don't have to, because of your industry. You get them early anyway.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Not always.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Not always.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
A lot of times I do.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Now I get Dan to reserve stuff.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I think I did with Grand Theft Auto IV. I think I went and picked it up at midnight.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I went to a Final Fantasy XII midnight launch. There was hardly anybody there.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
I used to for all the other Grand Theft Auto games. I used to go there and pick it up at midnight.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
That's cool.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Alright, we got a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Just a tip, folks. If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please, please, pretty please call the Echo Test Service first.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
That's Echo123 is the username.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
And make sure you can hear yourself and the nice little British lady that does the little voice check with you.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:55.000
It will help save the pain of us having a failed call.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Yes.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So this is kind of cool.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Of course, we were talking about modders doing stuff to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 earlier.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Well, of course, the other game that came out very close to that, of course, Left 4 Dead 2.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
They also have some modders doing stuff for that as well.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Including the modders over at Left4DeadMods.com, or L4DMods.com.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
They have found a way to implement the original maps from Left 4 Dead 1 into Left 4 Dead 2.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And although Valve hasn't released the software development kit yet for Left 4 Dead 2, they had to, I guess, do some workarounds in order to get it to work.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:44.000
So basically, it just requires you to change some files in the original game.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
And of course, you have to own both games before it's work.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And then you can go ahead and play those maps in your new game.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
That's kind of neat.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Well, we kind of knew the hackers would do this.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
This is just inevitable.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:06.000
By the way, speaking of editing levels, and I suppose this was inevitable as well.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Whenever there's a way to edit worlds in a side-scrolling game, it's inevitable that someone is going to make World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
But has it been done in a Super Mario Bros. game before?

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I don't know, but it's been done with Super Mario Bros. Wii.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Within 48 hours of the game release, there were level editors already out for it.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
And sure enough, somebody made World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Now we're looking at a video here in studio of this actually running.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
But the thing to keep in mind, this is actually running on an emulator.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
So it's kind of slow. You can see that there's frame rate issues.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
And I don't know if it's because the dude's trying to record it to YouTube.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But, I mean, it's a pretty faithful recreation of World 1-1, except the fact that it runs slow.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
But I'm sure in just a matter of time, they'll have this up to full speed.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
I just couldn't believe there's already emulators for Wii games.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I guess I seem to remember reporting on it on the show before.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
It faced off the GameCube hardware, so they should use the GameCube emulator.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
The important thing is if it's got the invisible...

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Oh, it does. It has the invisible 1-up cube.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I didn't see dude go down the pipe, though. Maybe he doesn't want to show that off. I don't know.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
When there's a will, there's a way. Somebody figured out how to do it.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Now my question is, I guess you can't really actually play this on a Wii yet.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Because there'd be no way to burn the disc and it would run, right?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
You have to use an emulator for this.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Yeah, because this stuff is signed.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
There may be a way. Because you can do...

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Well, that might have been with... Because I know you can create hacked Smash Bros. games.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
So maybe you could do that with New Super Mario Bros.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I don't know. I think a lot of this stuff needs to be trunk...

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
What was it? Trunk-a-shine?

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
What was it? Trunk... I don't remember how they pronounce it.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
It's some sort of signing that they have.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Some user created a program to re-sign everything in there.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Because everything's encoded, of course.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
It's just a matter of time before the hackers figure it out.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
It's time for you to give us a call.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
If there's a particular news topic that we didn't talk about tonight that you think we should give a little time to,

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
now's the perfect time to get through.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Keep in mind our number is toll free in the US and Canada,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
but if you're in another country besides that, you want to play it safe and use Skype.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
While we're waiting for some phone calls...

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Oops, I think we might still be in do not disturb mode.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Oh, we're getting a call. I guess we're not.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Talk about tonight.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Hi, this is HackDeaf.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Hi, HackDeaf. What's on your mind?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Nothing much, but I want to talk about the PS2 launching in Brazil.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Please do, because I know you have probably a unique perspective on this,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000
because you live in Mexico, which is closer than we are to Brazil.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:55.000
But all joking aside, you live in a country that isn't always supported by the game companies, correct?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
True.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
So what's your thoughts on the game launch in Brazil of PS2?

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Basically, just government, just doing the wrong things when importing electronic stuff and new technologies.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Here in Mexico, we have the problem of...

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:23.000
It's not very big as Brazil since we already have PS3s, 360s, and Wiis here.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:38.000
But there in Brazil, they charge like 200% over what the electronic device costs.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Good lord.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.000
They charge you $400 for a PS2 in Brazil.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000
And that's a tax? That's just money that is collected as a tax for whatever purpose?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Yes.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
That's crazy.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Here in Mexico, we have that tax too, though it's not that high.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:07.000
We get charged like double of what a game costs in the US.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Like for example, the Beatles Rock Band, it costs $60 in the US.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It costs Mexico like 1,000 pesos, which is around $70 for a game.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Though we have the consoles, we cost here 4,000 pesos, which is around $350 US dollars.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
But to be fair, a lot of this happens when you import from country to country too.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.000
For instance, if we were to buy stuff from Japan, we'd be looking at very similar overheads.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:51.000
But at the same time, and help me clarify this, when we import stuff from Japan,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
it's because we're paying a fee from whoever is grabbing it from Japan.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.000
But are you talking about that even when the companies release things directly in Mexico,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
that there's still this overhead?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Or are you paying an overhead because your Beatles Rock Band copies are coming from the US?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Yeah, we basically pay the import fees because it comes from the US.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:19.000
They sell it in official retailers here, and it's official software and merchandise.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Though because it doesn't get made here exactly, it gets imported from the US,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
we get charged that much.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:37.000
The only company that does distribute officially here in Mexico and makes their games in Mexico is Microsoft.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:44.000
For example, Halo 3, Years of War, Forza 3, all cost around 600 pesos,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
which is maybe even less than it costs in the US.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Interesting.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Describe briefly for our listeners, before we have to go to another call,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
how big the gaming scene is in Mexico.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Is it something that's only for rich people can get into?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Or is it something that it seems like it's pretty commonplace?

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Or does Mexico seem kind of behind where maybe everyone owns a Super Nintendo

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
because those are easier to get now?

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
They're not that behind on hardware.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Like I said, people have here PlayStation 3, 360s, Wii.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:36.000
So maybe the people that don't have that kind of money to purchase a console from this generation have a PS2,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:46.000
which also costs a lot, but it's cheaper considering Wii costs over 1000 pesos more than a PS2.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.000
I got to say, that's not too dissimilar from what happens here because even though I'm sure listening to the show,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
it sounds like we all have PS3s because the hosts of the show do.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I know a lot of people that haven't taken that plunge to the 360, to the PS3, in a lot of cases even the Wii,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
because they just can't afford it, starving students or what have you in this day and age economy,

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.000
that PS2 is a lot more lucrative when it's only 99 bucks.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Yeah, it's not that different from the US.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Like I said, in Brazil, the official release this year and after the official release,

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:30.000
and pretty much everyone else is just crazy.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:38.000
That's why Mega Drive or Genesis Systems is pretty big over there because it's cheap.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Though, it's cheap and also it's affordable for everyone there.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.000
And you know, if it's cheaper to pirate it and if it's cheaper to import it,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
or if it's cheaper to get it not the official way, that's what people are going to do, sadly.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Well Act Def, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls,

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
but thank you as always for the worldly perspective, we appreciate it.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Thank you, you too.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Alright, take care buddy.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Loki, any quick last minute stories before we get to another call?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Yeah, we'll talk real quick about the Sonic Classic Collections coming to DS.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And that's like all the old school Sonic games?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Yeah, just like the one on 360.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So that they've re-released like 50,000 times?

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Yeah, but not on the DS.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Alright, hi, we got another call.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Hey everyone, it's Ronma.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Hi Ronma, how are you doing?

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I'm good, how are you guys doing tonight?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Good, hey, real quick, this is why they don't give us Virtual Console on the DS.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Because if they gave us Virtual Console on the DS, they couldn't be making the Sonic Collection.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Just saying.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Very true.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Just saying.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Hi, Ronma, sorry about that, just had to get that thought out there.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
No problem.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
What is on your mind, my friend?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
We haven't heard from you in a few weeks.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I have to say, I've missed you a little bit.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Oh, I've missed you guys too.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Aww, big hug.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000
But our aim's improving.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Aww, what's on your mind?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Yes, I know, I told a bullet go by about a few seconds ago.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Besides the fact that I just got back from another convention last week, I was at a Nintendo

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
World for another special event.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
And what was that?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000
The release of New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Of course, of course, how did that go?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
It was fun, despite all the rain and the wetness.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
You didn't have to compete with the tree lighting, did you?

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Nope, but the tree was already there, but mostly everyone was there to check out New

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Super Mario Brothers Wii, believe it or not.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Wow, okay.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Even though this makes for great radio, I am posting a link in the chat room where they

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
can check out pictures.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
May I plug my website?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Of course you may.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Just go over to DJRonS.net, click on the scrapbook, and go to events, and you'll see the pictures

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
from that Saturday.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Did you dress up as Black Luigi?

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
No, I decided not to.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Well, now I see a Princess Peach, I see a Mario, but no Black Luigi.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
I just decided to wear just the hat, and when I got there, there were people dressed up

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
as Propeller Mario and Propeller Luigi.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I'm like, well, next time.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Cute.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Oh, there's a little kid dressed up as Mario.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
That's precious.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I like that.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Yeah.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
By the way, I don't know if this is me or if we're all hammering this now, but some

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
of your links are coming up broken, so just double check your gallery.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Yeah, there's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on all the broken links,

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
there are actual images there from the event.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Okay, I believe you.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
By the way, now that we have the whole Facebook group, go ahead and feel free to post the

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
link there, too.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Oh, that I will do.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Yeah, see?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
It has a practical purpose.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
We should have had this a year ago.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
That's all right.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the event.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
You were at a convention this weekend, right?

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Yes.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Okay, tell us about it.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Or is it worth talking about?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Well, it's called Anime USA.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000
It's not a small anime convention.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
They've been around for about several years.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
It was in the same location as Capcom this year.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I went as a dealer and as press, and it was fun.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.000
In a way, it reminded me of anime because everything was practically open all night,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000
including the fact that we had a five- and six-hour rave going on.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Wow.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
That was fun.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Leaving, and half the fun was leaving trying to find water, and we couldn't find water

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
trying to find cups for water.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Now, I always ask this about conventions because I know a lot of you go for the anime,

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
but we talk about the games here.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
So what kind of gaming room setup did they have?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Or any tournaments or anything?

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I didn't get you to check out the tournaments, but the gaming rooms were slightly different.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.000
I remember I had mentioned how one convention I went to, they had a dark room just for Rockman.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000
They pretty much had that for both gaming rooms.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.000
And they had two main setups, one for Tekken 6 and one for Street Fighter IV.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Attached to, I believe, a 40-plus-inch television, which was also connected to a massive projector as well.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Wow.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Everybody likes to see things bigger and better, so projectors are always welcome, I'm sure.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Oh, definitely.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Well, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go to get more calls tonight?

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Not thus per se, but I wanted to know, did you guys try New Super Mario Brothers Wii?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Because I wasn't able to listen to the show last week.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
You know what? Sadly, I haven't been able to pick it up yet.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:21.000
I played some other games this week instead, and it just seems like nobody here has just really had the incentive to run out and get it.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
That's right.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
The economy's taken the toll on us all, DJ Rama.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
We have to pick and choose our games carefully.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000
We can't run out and buy things, and game companies don't send us stuff for free because we're just some shoddy little independent podcast.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I hear you completely.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I still did play it at E3, and I would like to play it, you know, because it's so different.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Playing things at E3 is not the same as playing them in your living room.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I know, I know.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:51.000
My biggest concern about the whole thing, though, is that I hear multiplayer is the superior aspect of it, and I don't really have anybody to play with.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I mean, I bet my roommate would play, you know, once or twice with me, and then, you know, my friend Victoria, who's over all the time, might play a couple times with me.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
But I don't have anybody that really would want to, like, sit there from beginning to finish to play with me, you know what I mean?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
True, true.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
But I will say this much about Super Mario Brothers Wii, and I'll be on my way.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:16.000
If you liked Super Mario Brothers 3 and the elements of Super Mario World, you're definitely going to like New Super Mario Brothers Wii. Simple as that.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Well, those are two very, very big Mario games near and dear to my heart.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:27.000
You know, I am hearing, I have heard glowing reviews from, and this is important to say, not just you and the folks who listen to this show.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:37.000
But the day the game came out, my Facebook page was littered with people that I sometimes forget play video games because they don't really talk about it very much that were excited about this release.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:44.000
For instance, Rama, you know, because you met her when I went to New York, you know my friend that I go to visit in Brooklyn, who I knew since college, right?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Right.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Who thought it was a little silly that we were all getting together to go to that video game store, right?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:56.000
She's one of those people that posted that was all excited about the release of New Super Mario Brothers Wii, because she loves the old school one.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:02.000
And didn't we all go to that game store just to get her a copy of the Guardian Legend, or was it just for yourself?

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:13.000
That was for me to buy for her, because she recently hooked up her 8-bit Nintendo, and I said, if you're going to hook up your 8-bit Nintendo, you need a copy of the greatest game ever made.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:21.000
By the way, on a completely unrelated tangent, I went to the local flea market here, which I'm finding can be an awesome place to find video games.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Although I didn't pick it up, and I really am kicking myself now, I should have, I saw a copy of Guardian Legend for two bucks, and I was like, oh, kind of want.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000
You don't need to have...

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I know, I know, but I just don't have...

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Two dollars, Ron!

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:44.000
I know, I should have just bought the damn thing, but I didn't. Final Fantasy cartridge, 20 bucks, but it was still there. I held it in my hand. It was godly.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Anyway, Ron, we've got to let you guys get some more calls, but thanks for the conversation as always, and have fun with your convention going.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Fanime 2010, maybe?

02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I already have event plans that weekend, but I do believe there's talks of OLRG cons, like that round, Fourth of Joy weekend, something like that.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I'm all for that. You know what, we need to set up some type of mini-con. We just need to make it happen. I don't know how to do it, but I have a friend who's into event planning, so I might have to seek some outside help, and we have to have ourselves an OR mini-con.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I don't know how many people will come to Sacramento for it, but hey, if we can get like 30 people to show up, I'd call it a success.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Hey, if Jamie can get me to travel 3,000 miles and twist my arm to make it out there, it won't be hard to get everybody else to do so.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
We'll try our best. All right, take care, Ron. Have a good one.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
All right, laters.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Later. 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio. Other last minute stories tonight, Loki?

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Yeah, they're actually doing a dedicated store for EA Sports Active. There's actually one that they opened up in Boston and San Francisco, which seems kind of odd. I don't know how you could have a whole store for EA Sports Active.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Well, I mean, you know, if Wii Fit is doing as well as it is with its storefront set up and so forth, I'm kind of not surprised.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Yeah, but it's a dedicated store, though.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Yeah, that's weird. Okay, hold on, we got another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
This is Deathwishing.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Hi, Deathwishing. Another caller we haven't heard from in a while. What's on your mind?

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Well, I haven't heard from you. I've been on a concert binge, but it's all about just Modern Warfare 2 lately with me.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Good, because, you know, I don't know if you heard last week's show, which you probably haven't because the podcast, you know, has taken a while to get up, and I admit that's my bad.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I'll go to the concert.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
What concert, Sad Curiosity?

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000
My concert. It's from my choir.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Oh, okay. Oh, you're in Glee Club.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.000
No, it's, I love, I just do it because I like to sing.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Oh, well, I just, I love Glee. That's alright. Anyway, what was I going to say?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Well, if you want me, I can show you a couple of things, because I went to the minute I released the one of things, so if I can, if you guys can see the video feed on Skype.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Um, no, we don't have video. Sorry.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I'll take a full picture. I have a poster and a big cardboard cutout that I won from a GameStop.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Usually the video feed, like, kills our Skypes. That's why we don't usually have it.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Yeah, so I have a, I'll take a picture of it. I have a big, you know, I have a big, huge cardboard advertisement that you can get, and then I have a poster.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:21.000
On the other hand, I heard a couple of things, like, I heard there were going to be aliens and zombies, but they got cut out.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Of Modern Warfare?

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Just from, what's it, the Inside Gaming Twitter. I heard something about that.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Interesting. I hadn't heard anything about that.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
A Call of Duty MMO being made, and possibly a movie.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Now, here's the thing. This came up on last week's show, and we didn't get a whole lot of feedback on this, but this is what I want to ask.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:47.000
You know, obviously, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, this isn't usually the type of game we get into, and it's not to knock on the game.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:51.000
It's just that I suck at first-person shooters, so I don't really get into these games usually.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000
What is it about Modern Warfare 2, as opposed to all these other types of shooter games that are out there?

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Halos of the world and everything else. What is it about Modern Warfare 2 that is making it the must-have game of the year?

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Because it's borrowing aspects from just all these other games. Like, it's borrowed aspects from, what's it, I want to say Halo, because it has, like, medals and stuff now you earn.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:19.000
It actually, funny, see, here's the thing. It borrowed stuff from Street Fighter, with the titles and emblem system, and it's exactly like Street Fighter for titles and emblems.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And, like, when they interviewed them about the emblem system, I guess the Infinity Ward guys, they played a crapload of Street Fighter.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:33.000
They kind of put the third person, they're trying to take the rap at Gears of War.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:43.000
So, it's really, if you kind of want to look at it, it's really, you could say it's just another copy and paste, but the thing is, they do it more well.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.000
It's, like, a lot of underlying stuff you have to do with, like, the way guns handle. It's really balanced.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Like, if there's a guy that's really good, you can still find a way to take him out. It's not like on Halo where you have to be skill-based, you know?

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Or, like, if you don't play Halo at all and you go online, you just, like, can't do anything.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:09.000
You do, you get raped in the face. That happens to me all the time. When I try to sign up and play Halo, it's like, bam, you're dead, bam, you're dead, bam, you're dead.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Yeah, my friend, he doesn't play at all. He can maybe at least, on a good night, pull at least four or five kills in a match.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Wow, and Halo, he was finally getting one, and the rest was just respawning.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Wow. They need to make, like, I really wish Microsoft would make, like, Halo Remedial Edition for people like me.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:35.000
No, what they should make, really, was, like, what they said they would do in the first place was have skill matching so you play with people your skill level, which I never saw implanted.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
That true skill thing that was complete bullcrap.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Because a lot of people reset their skills or create new profiles, and then, you know, you get all these really skilled people that are starting from ground level one.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Is there a way to make that console attached, you know? They kind of just made it for the console.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I wish, but sadly, that feature doesn't seem to work too well.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.000
And, funny thing you should say, remember how you were talking about the global thermonuclear warfare thing?

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Yeah.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.000
That's also a call sign in the game, so that kind of was a little weird.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Do you want to play a game?

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Uh, okay, okay, okay, uh, dude from Sol, I forgot his name.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
No, it's, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Do you want to play a game?

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
It's a war game.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
It's a war game.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I know, the kid wasn't even born yet, probably.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Alright, Death Wishing, do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Um, are there any good fighting games coming out?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Super Street Fighter IV, and, you know, if you don't really want to take the plunge on that,

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Street Fighter IV has gotten a big price reduction in a lot of retailers, so if you haven't picked that up yet, you haven't?

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Tekken 6.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Tekken 6?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I've heard, I'm going to tell you, I've heard mixed things on Tekken 6.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
It's Tekken!

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.000
So, I don't know.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
It's Tekken, therefore it's worthy.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
You might want to run it first.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I don't know of any other big, big fighting games that people are very excited about right now. I think Tekken 6 was kind of the anchor for the year.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Um, I would bet there's a new Soul Calibur announced pretty soon, and some other games we'll be looking at next year.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:17.000
But, um, nothing outside of Super Street Fighter II that I, or, sorry, Super Street Fighter IV that I know of, unless somebody in chat happens to know. Don't know.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
So, we'll see.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Alright, well, Death Wishing, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you so much for the call, as always.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Call of Duty now.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Later!

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
We'll take one more call.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
What the hell?

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
1877 Game O.L.R.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
No last minute stories.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
That's it?

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Well, there's not much I want to talk about.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Holy crap!

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Alright.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Somebody in chat is saying, did you notice your Skype hit 250 contacts?

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
No, I don't think we have 250 contacts. Do we really?

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Maybe. I've never bothered to check or count them all up.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Alright, we'll see if we get any more calls here.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000
And then we're going to call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Of course, we still have the afterbirth for the live listeners, for the podcast listeners.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Tune in live sometime.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Chatters, by the way, BlazBlue in chat, I'm sorry, ActDeft in chat says BlazBlue for the PSP.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Aren't you going to introduce me first?

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Hello?

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
This is Legend of Zaku.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Hi, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Nothing much, just killing another Sunday evening with my MacBook trying to do the ritualistic whittling of code and listening to your show.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Um, yes.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:38.000
So I kind of realized that certain companies in particular are starting to hate on certain platforms.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Case in point, Gameloft.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:46.000
You may have heard of them from such mobile games as...

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I'm trying to think of a good Gameloft game.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:53.000
What the hell, are you typing onto your Skype headset?

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
All I hear is clack, clack, clack, clack.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
It's as bad as Jamie when she puts the mic down next to her keyboard.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Long story short is that they're giving up on Android, even before it's even hitting its peak.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:26.000
The reason I'm bringing this up is because this proves that the sheer number of, you know, the fact that iPhone is so prevalent and people are basically using it as a massive baseline, like some unreachable bar for other platforms to jump over.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:43.000
In this case, they're just saying because we can make 400 times as much on the iPhone, on the Apple Store with Apple's bullshit in terms of going through the approval process, they could easily just kill funding for Android.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:50.000
You know, a lot of people have been getting pissed off at iPhone's little approval process, and one of them, it seems like, is Google.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I like how Google tried to throw down the gauntlet saying, hey, we've got this free turn-by-turn navigation app that is going to make TomTom shit their pants that we're willing to release on the store, you know, whenever Apple decides they want to let us release apps on the store.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I mean, I can understand the rationale. Money comes first to them. I mean, in that sense, they have every right to make as much money as they please, but, you know, they kind of gave up on it. They're acting a bit premature by just trying to, like, not give it a chance.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I guess it's because of the fact that an Android, you could actually get a refund and, you know, and all the try before you buy. So that's really scaring them off.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:45.000
You know, there's a comment in chat, fuck Apple in the ass from ToaKak. You know, there's a lot of people that are of that mindset, but the problem is Apple has a lock on this shit right now. Like, seriously.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.000
People, lots of people have iPhones.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Well, one could argue that the way they, you know, the way they set up their store, you know, their platforms, you know, the fact that it's almost video game-like where you need, like, to pay licensing just to get it up is kind of more streamlined.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Granted, you do have its growing pains with the approval process.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Well, I'm not going to disagree with you. I think Apple's approval process stinks, but at the same time, I don't think there's a lot we can do about it, especially when they're largely in charge.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:31.000
If another phone steps up and actually gives them competition, but as of right now, there isn't anybody even close, except maybe Crack Berries, the Crack Berries storm, but even then...

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I mean, I worked on Black Berries, and even then, you know, you could easily distribute your apps on your own. I mean, it's just now that Rin managed to get a Blackberry app store.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:48.000
But aside, let's divert our attention. I think we're straying, we're deviating a bit too from the actual nature of this show.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Sure.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Basically, I'm trying to bring up a little story that I saw on Kotaku about how Team Fortress 2 managed to get a lot more updates than any other Valve game to date. At least almost 97 updates, to be exact, ever since its release.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:15.000
True. It does seem like we've been reporting a lot on Team Fortress 2 on the show. Like, there'll always be a new class or a new mode in the game. They've done a lot of changes to that game.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I want to play as the sandwich.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I guess people have thrown the argument that maybe it's because they actually care about their platform. I actually saw a little tidbit from what they actually quoted, that every time that Valve releases an update for Team Fortress 2, their sales go up 20%.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Whereas, when you have Modern Warfare 2, where Activision is planning to sell you DLC that's already in game, and it may not be worth the money you're actually paying for it.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:55.000
You know what, Zaku, that's a very good statistic that I think a lot of people sometimes don't take to heart, is that when a lot of these games do these massive updates, they continue to sell.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Let me give you another example. Burnout Paradise was cranking out a lot of very big updates to it that would change the game significantly. It was a way to keep the game relevant and newsworthy and continue to get it on all the blogs and create awareness for the game.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:26.000
But the fact of the matter is that Valve basically put those Team Fortress 2 updates for free. You're talking about class updates, new game modes, literally for free.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:41.000
You see where Activision, and Microsoft's also guilty of this as well, for trying to nickel and dime people.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Well, money talks, my friend, and if people say that they're not going to get nickeled and dimed by the Modern Warfare 2 DLC, and they switch to hacking, as a lot of people are doing, then somebody's going to get the message, loud and clear.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:34:04.000
For the $60 you're paying for the PC version, it's kind of like you're getting ripped off of the fact that even in Call of Duty 4, you got the maps for free, and console players had to shell out money for it.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I don't know. I guess it keeps in line where Activision's starting to come up with these crazy methods of trying to maximize profit on just about every game they release, but that's them. I guess that's their rationale for trying to be EA's for the early, middle of this decade.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Alright. Saku, I gotta wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call and getting us to talk about topics that we might not otherwise talk about.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Alright.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Have a good one, buddy.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Apologies to those that didn't get through. It was a pretty busy night on the phones tonight.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:35:12.000
You can always send us, of course, an email mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com, or you can send us a message on Twitter, or now we have Facebook and the official Orange Launch Radio fan page on Facebook, which I'm going to give one more link to in our chat room and hope that maybe we can get 100 fans by tomorrow, so that way we can grow our Facebook page into the next evolution of Facebook pages where we get our short URL and not an ugly-ass number there.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Anyhow, if there's no other last-minute stories, DarkSakura, Loki, nothing, I don't think I have anything either.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
In other news, I like fire.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Well, that's not news.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:29.000
They have a Neo Geo two-slot system over here, full-size arcade, some guy's moving, he's already sold his house, $300.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Wow.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Nice.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
If you need one for your garage.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:42.000
I'm tempted, but there might be some changes going on in Rob's life that I can't get into right now, but maybe later.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Anyhow, I'm going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Thanks, everybody, as always, for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Independent podcasts rely on word of mouth, and so we really appreciate it when you guys do tell your friends about the show, such as the dude who told all 650 of his Facebook friends, but just keep in mind again, don't spam it.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
What are we at now?

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
78.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
We're almost there.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:10.000
So especially considering we set it up today, I'm very impressed, and much love to the O.L. Army for all their help, because he wasn't the only one that posted on Twitter.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I saw like four retweets, and all of that is very much appreciated.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Thank you guys so, so much.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Dark Sakura.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I want dinner.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Loki, your final thought.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I guess we'll sign up for the fan page.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Haven't done it yet.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
You haven't done it yet?

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I'm going to go do that, Matt.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I know you might not be a fan of the show, but you should probably go do that at some point.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:42.000
And my final thought is I don't want to have to grade the big stack of papers that's sitting at home waiting for me.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
So anyway, that's going to do it.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Even though it is a holiday weekend, we will still be back here next Sunday, right?

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Nobody's got anything planned.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.000
So we will be back here next Sunday for more of Orange Launch Radio to do it all over again.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000
So until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
