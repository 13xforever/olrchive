Tonight, November 1st, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video game?

I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.
I stayed home and passed out candy to
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.
It's like, where's this country coming to?
I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.
It says, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.
Nice.
Um...
Well, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.
Like, I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and LiveJournal and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.
You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick-or-treating anymore.
And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know.
Like, I even know when I was growing up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor, and before we were allowed to eat it, we had to, you know, sift through it to make sure there were no needles in it.
Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but never mind.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill haunted house, which I know we were talking about at length on the show previously.
You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to... Well, I mean, I'm just saying the haunted house is probably crap.
Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.
They went to the haunted house, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay...
YouTube YouTube
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I try not to look into Halloween too much.
I realize it has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in.
But I'm just like, it's just kind of a... Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.
I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.
But it's just a day to be silly and have fun.
Wear a costume, have fun.
What are they letting these pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.
It's like...
Whoa, hey, uh, what, you decided to go with slut?
I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
Well, also, I don't know, and I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think, like, it's a way that you can actually do cosplay, like, legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.
Like, that's kind of what Halloween is, right?
Well, my last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.
Awesome.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, did you find some YouTubes?
That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called a fag as well.
This is true.
In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually came home from Target, and I actually showed my roommate, and by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the Snuggie to my roommate, and I'm like, look!
Look what I got!
Look what I got!
He's like, you fag.
No, he didn't really say that, but that was his reaction, pretty much.
So, anyhow...
Oh, so we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube, it looks like.
You find the good stuff.
I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.
The camera's too shaky.
See if there's a scary pyramid head or something if you manage to make it that far in.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I was mad.
And I actually didn't play any Sims.
And I watched Dan play some of the palette of Gay Tony.
It was interesting.
I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting at home.
How depressing is that?
You dork.
I know.
Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years, and I just kind of like, I'm too busy playing WoW.
Oh, oh, oh.
Yes?
I actually played some Rock Band last night.
Good times.
I miss Rock Band.
It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end of the year, promise.
Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.
Yeah.
I can bring over my Rock Band No, don't encourage me, because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need to get mine fixed, Loki will bring Rock Band He's an enabler Alright, yes, you're an enabler Well, Loki, the enabler, how was your gaming week?
Speaking of which, I was actually, um Well, it looks neat, I mean, because it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted set, or something
Oh, they're getting scared.
Oh, I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.
That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.
What is that?
This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.
I think he fell.
Whatever.
This is crap.
If Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.
Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?
I picked up LEGO Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock Band 2.
The track list is pretty cool on it.
I like a lot of stuff that's in there.
It's going to be fun to actually be able to put it all into Rock Band 2.
And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you know, LEGO stuff running around.
And the story modes kind of need to have little cutscenes and stuff that you expect from, like, another LEGO Telltale game.
I don't know.
It's just pretty much what you expect.
But the track list is awesome.
So I'd say pick it up for that reason only.
Um, then of course, you know, because this week we had the, um, Ballad of Gay Tony come out, of course I picked up Episodes of Liberty City.
Um, and the game's pretty sweet.
Um, the, I like a lot of the stuff they add in there that's really over the top.
The new weapons are pretty nice.
But Rockstar has this...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know, big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections of the map that weapons will spawn now.
So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your deathmatches in, which...
DarkSakura.com
Deathmatch, Parachutes
Deathmatch Deathmatch Deathmatch
Go Lost and Damned are the original game.
Other than that, though, it's pretty sweet.
All the new weapons are awesome.
They even added some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super punch, which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.
Falcon Punch?
Something like that.
But it's great with the super punch so you can kick people in the nuts and they kind of fly into the air.
So that's pretty sweet.
DJ Hero I played a little DJ Hero this week
Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene, though.
LOL.
And that's from chat.orangesoundtrader.com if you're just joining us tonight.
Join us in our chat room.
Is there controversial something-something going on in the new expansion, or are we just all desensitized to it now?
I don't think it's anything new.
I mean, it's the way I think he's talking about it.
If you dance well enough, I guess, in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them in the bathroom.
It doesn't show anything.
Just like real life.
Amazing.
Just like real life, yes.
Only if you're a politician.
It's just as censored as, say, the original game.
It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all.
It's just something funny.
And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.
You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.
That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex.
But I think if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.
Just saying.
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.
I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.
No, I'm just kidding.
They're all like 30 years old.
How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One new game I did play this week though outside of World of Warcraft DJ Hero
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
and some of these other little highlights.
But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.
And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.
I mean, really, to take...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Zero in common with Beatmania.
So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the eye and you tell them you're a fucking fool or a sheep or something.
Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.
The games both have falling notes.
and DarkSakura.com
DJ Hero
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.
But you know what?
I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.
I don't really care for Jay-Z.
I can't stand Eminem.
I think he's the biggest overexposed artist I can think of in the past 50 years.
Cool.
I don't like him.
I don't like his personality.
I don't like his songs.
I hate him.
But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed the songs together are actually kind of cool.
Like that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny.
And I dug it.
And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.
It felt like this whole new different song I never really heard before.
And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.
Like the whole like...
The Jacksons and Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind I freaking love that song and I gotta say I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is like my favorite song in the game right now and it gets stuck in my head during the day like the little back and forth so you know I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long time and I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it
You have the three buttons.
You have the scratching.
You have certain direction scratching.
You have cross fading.
You have the euphoria button.
You have the sampling that you change with a little knob.
You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.
Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
There's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool, and even Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up to 11.
Or, like, in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that all the stages were set around.
And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the game, something to tie everything together.
DJ Hero doesn't really have that.
It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.
and the game never really walks you through the menus you don't really know like am I supposed to play these custom set lists or can I just do my own thing and I can't really do my own thing anyway I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song it's a little weird
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and the song list and making that all perfect and they did a kick-ass job but the rest of it feels just kind of like tacked on like everything that kind of streams it all together so for that reason I can't say it's a perfect game oh and online
Thank you for watching!
could be there that's not.
But is this a real kick-ass first entry in a future franchise?
Yes, yes, yes.
It's a great first game.
You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that too, where there wasn't really a lot of glue holding it together.
I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.
But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.
And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.
It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.
TigerClaw says, so there's no Battle of the DJs mode?
Not really.
I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy, I guess you say, a frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.
I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.
In fact, it's kind of funny.
I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3 or I really am better than I give myself credit for because I'm in like the top 100 on a bunch of songs right now.
Of course, the game just came out last week.
I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.
So...
I'm trying to look at some more chat comments.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Vanis Lux, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.
And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment.
It's a $120 investment.
So...
and DarkSakura.com.
But, you know, again, $120 is a big investment.
Until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it will, but as the chatter said there, not for about a year.
Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?
I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.
TigerClaw on chat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music for DJ Hero.
Imagine if they released a trance pack.
You know what's funny?
One of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.
I like the Yo-Yo Girl song.
Thanks for watching!
But when you have 93 songs to choose from, it doesn't really bother me at all.
And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the GameStop code.
And they're both great.
But we'll talk more about that later in the show.
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.
Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.
This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, Alpha Cananogram, and it's running on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country.
But I had to say this because the article is called, Wii's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.
The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the worst-selling Wii title ever, Tsukiban Sachao Rena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership of a talking female cat, Rina.
It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies.
Then they linked to a couple of YouTubes.
Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity, creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.
Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup, and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debacles,
Some might wonder if perhaps some kind of quality seal system might be useful.
Now, obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even cite what source they're using.
You know what's funny?
I bet it's 100 copies imported to the U.S.
is probably more like it.
Yeah, 1% of their sales!
I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter has 200 some odd followers alone.
I mean, really?
Like, give me a source of some sort, please.
I think they also published something that said it sold more.
yeah so I don't know how I feel about that but that was linked by a chatter and if in case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from foreign countries such as that one you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangelandreda.com I just wanted to let you know please source or GTFO so there you go
And Loki, you're going on to VGCharts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?
Of course!
Of course you are.
I don't know if they'll actually have... It just came out.
I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.
Well, they're pretty quick.
Of course, this is downloading very slowly.
And... I don't even know if this is on here.
I don't know.
Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only sold 100 copies.
Please deny.
Okay, well, let me put it this way.
We would...
It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.
Easy.
Easy.
I know.
I know.
I don't know.
There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to kick President Cat while they're down.
This site is like the Glenn Beck of gaming.
I'll ask them on Twitter.
What?
I'll ask them on Twitter.
Yeah, ask them on Twitter.
Alright.
I know.
I agree with GamerGirl in chat.
How can you not like Prez Cat?
GameGuru says, quality seal.
Dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game worked on the system.
True enough.
GameGuru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.
And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.
They don't have any sort of...
Anything.
There's no sales figures yet.
And Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom, chat.orangeentradio.com says, It was former president Dogg spreading the rumors.
I bet.
I'm President Dog.
Prime Minister Dog.
Alright.
Let's move on.
Let's move on.
Actually get to some real gaming stories.
I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean.
And you're a douche.
No, I'm just kidding.
I understand.
But our Twitter is twitter.com slash OLR.
You can also follow us on Facebook.
We have a club there, the OL Army, and all that fun stuff.
Awesome.
Yes, DarkSakura.
I just finished the most amazing French toast.
Congratulations.
Where was your French toast from?
It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli Will it give you a magic voice back?
Will it give you your voice back?
Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi Because remember, I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop Would you like one?
Actually, I would love that.
I'm a little hot in here.
I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because of your disease, but... My disease, thank you.
Your affliction.
No, it's like I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm, and actually I wear a scarf to work, is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start coughing, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.
Loki, start us off if you would tonight.
So, Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service to the PS3.
Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox 360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from Netflix.
Basically, using this disc, it'll
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But what I find fascinating about this is that just last week on the show I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke while we were live last week.
We just didn't catch it.
But I was just talking about, like, hey, you know, if Microsoft wants to compete with Sony... Because what's Sony's big thing right now?
It does everything.
You know, and to be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP.
And to some extent the PS3.
It really does a lot of stuff very well.
But...
Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system which includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix.
And, you know, streaming Netflix could kind of compete with Blu-ray in a way.
Oops!
Now the PS3 has Netflix too!
Yeah, but you have to order it.
And mainly they were saying, like I said before, one of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around a clause that they had...
for their contract with Microsoft saying that basically this cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something like that.
So it's not appearing on a dashboard.
It's actually a program now that someone else is running.
So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.
I don't know, what do you think this means for the whole console wars?
Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground?
No, I don't think it means anything.
Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.
It's just it's good for Netflix.
That's basically it.
I mean, because I think...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works.
If it works as well as it does on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard, it's just a Blu-ray disc.
So it'll be interesting.
The Microsoft interface is very bare bones.
So I'm wondering if it won't be a little more flat.
I can't imagine the look is going to be the same because on Netflix 360, the look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.
So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all.
So I'm kind of curious if it's going to be maybe better.
I don't know.
I mean, it could be worse too.
It could go either way.
It could be interesting if it uses like a crossbar style interface where all your genres maybe are in the crossbar.
It'll probably be like...
DeadPixel Live on weekdays.
If it uses BD Live like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray player that is BD Live capable?
Well, you know, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this Blu-ray Live thing.
And the Wii sometime as well.
This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.
This is about Netflix getting what they want.
So I don't know about this particular update.
I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that...
I would just have a hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player... I mean, because they don't really have strong processors in them.
I mean, I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would be difficult, I would think, to stream... Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video...
And having it look good, you know, it does require some processing power.
I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's beating live cable would be, you know, capable of that.
I could be wrong, but I would think it, you know, it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does, you know, streaming video.
I don't know.
Tropic in our chat room, chat.org.com wants to remind us, too, the disc-based Netflix for PS3 is supposed to be a temporary solution.
They said the disc won't always be required.
And you were talking about the contractual stuff maybe until 2010.
So it makes sense.
But, I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.
Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value.
And it's a win for Netflix.
And it's a small win for Sony.
But also Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room.
Isn't it a little late to put this into the console wars concept?
Most everyone that will ever get this gen systems already have one.
I'm not so inclined to agree.
I don't think Blu-ray has really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.
I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right.
But remember, we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which we is kicking butt at right now.
The problem is the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step.
Now, DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick.
And people are kind of hesitant.
Like, well, if I...
Convert my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray.
How soon is the next thing going to be that comes along?
I don't want to do that.
I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and just save some money that way because it's not really that big a difference.
Or, hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case there is no difference.
I don't know.
It's just not as...
Not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.
5thDream in our chatroom at chat.org.com comments, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current-gen stuff.
So certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.
I mean, if 5thDream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.
They don't own a current-gen system yet.
And let's not forget, current-gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.
and you know whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for like a college kid trying to pay for books and working a part-time job $200 is still an ass load of money you know that's like ramen for a year so you know not everybody's jumped on board with this yet you know it's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at right the PS2 got down to $99 finally right yeah that was back in March so there you go
We're going to get into the next story here, but first, I'm actually going to take a little detour because from the show roll we had, I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute ago.
So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.
Hello Hey, is this Mel B?
The one and only How are you doing, Mel?
Long time no talk since we've had you on the show Oh gosh, yeah, it's been quite a while since, you know, we've actually, you know, I mean, I've been chatting a few times here and there But yeah, actually, being a caller in, it's, oh yeah, it's been a good while, you know, it's up to you, hey, to, you know, DarkSakura and Loki
We're always happy to have you here on the show.
We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House, because I don't even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how, well, eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago, and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have got to come down here.
I will even pay for your ticket to go.
It was that good.
So I was like, okay, I
Oh, wow.
I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing a maze over in Brea, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.
and they were doing like essentially the equivalent to a human maze that was based on Silent Hill.
And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into the game, I've worked on some stuff and all that.
We're like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?
So we got to do it on a Halloween night.
So that was, yeah, just last night.
And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like essentially the maze was created inside
What I thought it would have been a abandoned movie theater or something like that, because there's actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and all those types of things.
You're more standard scary stuff.
Yeah.
When you get in, the first thing you do is, like, say, take a picture just sort of like for a bit of a souvenir type thing.
Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust up there right behind you, like,
Get your shock reaction, obviously.
So you can tell these people are about to get you pretty startled pretty bad.
And once you're going in, once you actually enter the maze, it's like indoors, it's really dimly lit with a lot of crimson lighting and just real dark and stuff.
And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people tops.
So it's pretty narrow.
It has a very claustrophobic feel.
So already it's just
You know, kind of creeping yourself out, especially if you play the game.
You know, a lot of it is just, it's not so much, you see creepy things everywhere, you know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know something's going to happen, you don't know when it will, and that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can make, like, you know, one turn, then the second turn, you didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off in the side, first monster, you know, just jumps out at you and, you know, scares you, like, stops and like, ahhh, and for me, because
I get pretty jumpy just on about anything.
It was like, whoa, you know, you jump.
But you can tell the monsters are coming after you, but the good thing the way they set it up is you can't touch them, they can't touch you.
It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.
It's like a strip club.
Strip club rules.
It's like what?
It's like strip club rules.
For lack of a better term.
Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll sort of just sort of bang on the door, well, walls, and start kind of following you.
That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know, corridor or whatever.
And when I first heard that, I was amazed.
So, like, one of the things they mentioned on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?
They said, it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed.
But, um, cool thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.
There is sort of, like, a mess to all their madness.
There are, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.
Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like, Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.
Then, occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll see, like, those faces, like, the, when the
Evil Spirits start coming out.
They'll just come out through the wall and start chasing you.
Oh, weird.
You'll see, like, those evil dogs that you normally see.
I think they're, like, in Part 4 and Homecoming.
Yeah, you saw them before.
You'd see, like, occasionally a dog, you know, in a cage trying to come after you.
They do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3.
Like, there was this one setup that they have, like, on the side room.
It's, like, at the bottom there's a television screen and you can see sort of, like, the
Rollercoaster
That's like the scene out of the movie.
Wow.
Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear Depends just to get through the photo shoot.
But our chat room is dying to know, how was their Pyramid Head?
Did they have a Pyramid Head?
Oh, please say they had Pyramid Head.
Oh, yeah, Pyramid Head was the payoff.
I mean, anyone who, you know, the fan always knows Pyramid Head is what you came here for.
So that was, um, that was actually the last thing that you see.
So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming.
Like, they have that part there.
It's funny, as you leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
So it was like, hmm, kind of, you know, interesting.
So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's like this sort of kind of like shrine over there.
At the top, you see a figurine, like a big busted pyramid head, which is like really well done.
It's like, wow, that's kind of cool.
And so you still fixate on looking at that, just trying to internalize that.
Then out of a gate, popped out pyramid head, huge, you know, pyramid head, like the big sword, you know, that just must be at least five feet long.
So he starts coming after you, starts like, you know, pretending to stab.
It'll push you back a little bit.
I would have broke down and cried.
I would have broke down and cried.
You would have had to carry me out.
Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the building.
I would have cried.
But yeah, I mean, for me, it was just like, I mean, it's funny because Melody, I mean, after she's gone through, she said, wow, I wasn't really scared.
And I was like, how could you not be?
But then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled or doesn't invest herself in the game because when we're going through, like, all the bathrooms and stuff, we see all the
Oh my gosh.
So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they do a good job?
I thought they did a really, really good job.
They really got you inside.
They created...
The Vs, especially if you did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you.
So, like, you all always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner.
You know, in some places, when you go into the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain.
And so, you know, it's like the black curtain.
You gotta, like, peek through it.
You just don't know.
So, you know, fear is in there.
So it's overall tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you know, just experiencing
And just to clarify, some folks in the chatroom wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape you?
No bodies were defiled during the haunt.
Oh, that's right, they can't touch you.
He had his, you know, gate on the side, and you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but for all we know, you know, they might be adding something, you know, they're made over something I didn't catch.
Maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.
Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.
Alright, Mel, thank you so much.
I really appreciate you coming on the show.
I know you guys are driving home right now.
You're calling us literally from the road, probably driving up I-5 or something.
Have a safe drive back.
Thank you guys so much for coming on the show.
We'll hope to see you in studio in the near future, okay?
Okay, take care.
I think we might have just lost him at that point.
Wow, I didn't even think of that.
Hold on, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for a little bit.
October 30th, 1999 was what, the first time you played Bimani?
Ten years later, look at how everything's gone and
Still fans, still doing it, and look where it's taking us.
Thanks for making me feel old, Mel.
No, I'm kidding.
It looks like I'm breaking up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe we'll talk about it more next week.
All right, thanks, man.
Y'all be good.
Alright, thank you very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message notice.
I appreciate that.
Alright, that was fun.
I don't know, it sounded pretty good.
I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so Jamie, if it comes back next year, I think we're gonna road trip.
But make sure I bring diapers.
Alright.
We'll bring you... Or make sure I at least void myself before we go into the haunted house.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll just get you a big pack of oops, I crapped my pants.
Sounds good.
Alright, hey, moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.
In fact, the only thing it was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing.
There's another DSi coming out.
That's right, this will be the fourth version of the DSi coming out.
It's coming out in Japan very soon, the DSi LL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and, yes, America, as the DSi XL.
The DSi LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.
Basically, the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with 4-inch screens.
TSI, Leonardo Leonardo
No, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.
It's also the DSI XL over there.
It's just in their language, it's LL.
So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.
Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.
It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until next year.
It has been confirmed for all the regions.
And I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay.
Well, to be fair, I never bought the DSi.
But if I did buy the DSi, I might feel a little bit irritated.
Because if I bought stuff on the DSi store, it's not like there's a cable that's going to connect my two things.
It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP.
There'd be no slot for me to put the discs in.
At least I could still play the games.
But yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people who didn't jump on board with the DSi the first time, like me.
I don't know.
Loki, how has the DSi been selling?
Is there a need for this?
What was your take on all this?
Well, this is just for old people.
Basically, they've said it's for so other people can watch you play the games.
So basically, you're advertising for Nintendo now.
Sort of.
Game Boy Advance slot back in there.
Since, you know, now size isn't the matter.
Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?
I understand that, but, you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance a lot, and, you know, other games have... Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...
Yes, that's true, but... Ha, I win.
I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down the system to make it smaller, and, you know, it couldn't fit, they couldn't fit that in there.
Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore.
So, in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.
Yup.
Hmm.
I don't know how I feel about this.
Well, and also, too, I mean...
You're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.
I mean, I don't know.
And do I really need a 4-inch screen, or at least two 4-inch screens?
I can see it just fine.
I don't need glasses to read the text on that screen.
If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me put it on my television.
Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.
Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
Yeah, something along those lines.
Or like the dev kits.
Yeah, bingo.
Thank you.
And then Actdeft in chat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld.
Now, thanks.
Yeah, that's right.
We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn well it could play them if it wanted to.
Yeah.
because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.
Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?
Remember that?
Good times.
And also remember how you could get free Nintendo games streamed to your Game Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?
And there was like...
You know, 30 some games in there.
Oh, but you don't get that anymore.
In fact, we're just going to keep Animal Crossing the same.
I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.
I just want you to know that.
I don't care what they do.
I don't care if it's the greatest thing on Earth.
I'm not buying it.
I don't know.
This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 is unnecessary handhelds.
I don't know.
I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need it.
How's the PSP Go selling is what I want to know.
That's a good question.
I'd be curious about that.
Yeah.
Well, anyhow, there you go.
There's the information on the new DS.
Take it or leave it.
I'm sure there's some folks that are going to be excited about it.
I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi I think will be more into this.
Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that will be all over this no matter what.
It's also more expensive, remember.
Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.
I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.
Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS Lite.
I never got on board with the DSi.
But right now, I'm not feeling it.
That's where I'm at.
If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.
But for now, I'll pass.
Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.
Yeah.
For very similar reasons, oddly enough.
Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online
We ban you!
Yes.
Anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?
God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit, I'm going to sue you again!
So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.
And on top of all that, um,
This is just awesome.
He is also not going to have a lawyer.
Once again, he's going to be representing himself.
Because only a fool represents himself.
Yes, he will once again opt out of using a lawyer.
And the best part about it was he said before that his First Amendment rights were basically being trampled on and that's why he should get $55,000.
The judge says no and dismissed the case.
And so now he's trying it again.
But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.
It doesn't cost anything.
Free!
It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.
It's free!
Okay, Devil's Advocate.
What about all the purchases you made on your old account that are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?
Well, then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the Terms of Service.
That's right.
I think Sony's covered in their Terms of Service, hence why the Constitution does not apply.
You agree to be signing up for a club, an exclusive network, where the First Amendment rules don't apply.
If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you can't complain and say, wah, wah, wah, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.
They have every right to do that.
It's private.
It's private.
Same goes with any kind of web forum.
So, this guy's just kind of a douche.
I like how we all said a different word in tandem there.
That was great.
Mo-ran.
There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system just look stupid.
I mean, I understand.
In this case?
Mm-hmm.
Because they're going to have to throw it out again.
I mean, the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally setting a precedent that this is stupid.
Well, and at least he's not wasting money on... Well, I guess he's being smart and not wasting money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.
The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff.
And if you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well...
It's hard for me to feel a lot of pity for you.
Because what you said probably would have offended me.
Just guessing.
Probably would have.
And I don't get offended very easily, by the way.
But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.
One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the PlayStation 3 has lost them quite a bit of money.
$4.7 billion to be exact.
Billion dollars.
Apparently, this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that Sony came out with this week.
The PS3 has lost Sony $4.695 billion.
Keep in mind...
Game companies really lose money every time they sell a system.
They're losing money on parts and so forth.
Game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later with things like...
Let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-ray, so they get money back with every Blu-rays that are sold.
They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.
They make the money back in other ways.
If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.
So, hold on a minute.
Before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger and say, Aha!
Thanks for watching!
These game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.
So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet.
Or anytime soon, really.
I think, if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.
Yeah.
I think this money could possibly turn around by next year or the year after.
And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce, saying, "...the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20 percent.
Within the year, it could be in the single digits."
will be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term
And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later on.
As we've been trying to tell them since the launch.
$600?
Are you crazy?
Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.
They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they won.
HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.
So they won that gamble.
so maybe this really truly was you know when they were talking about this 10 year plan and all that that's when this is probably going to end up really really paying off for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants blu-rays and so forth so we shall see anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're already an hour into the show we haven't even gotten to release dates
Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool, and I would like to see more of this going on, is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.
He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game, he shouldn't have to take out any of the, you know,
I have one very simple rule everything is allowed no limits as long as it makes sense in the story and is not gratuitous
Why is he having to defend himself?
Why?
Why is this allowed?
It just seems loud because you're... Anyway, I don't understand why the guy is being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.
Like, it's ridiculous.
Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?
Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things, but, like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now...
Why did you decide to show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?
Did you really have to show her boobs?
No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.
Why is this guy having to defend his game, or any creator having to defend their games and the artistic choices they make?
Oh, I see, because games aren't really art, according to some people.
Well, get over it.
I hate this, and I'm sure you all do, as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard
with video games versus movies.
It's all the same kind of thing.
Well, a lot of us who were anime fans back in the day got into the same thing.
People go, oh, it's cartoons.
It doesn't matter to me.
Well, no, it's just another way of communication.
It's just another medium.
Video games are the same thing.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.
I want my eight bucks back.
I'm a plaintiff.
Plaintiff?
I'm a plaintiff!
Damn, that was a great show.
Yeah, it was.
He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.
He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.
Oh, really?
Sweet.
That might be fun.
It might actually be a good movie from him for once in the past, like, ten years.
Big American Party.
I liked Dogma.
All right.
Moving on.
A few more stories in release dates.
And, of course, the classic game of the week before too long.
Yes, apparently piracy on handheld systems is not limited to the DS and the PSP.
Apparently, also quite rampant on the iPhone, or at least the App Store, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even like 95%.
One...
I love their developer's name too.
One iPhone developer, SmellsLikeDonkey, says about 80% of all downloads of TapFu were illegally downloaded.
And they have a way, I guess, of telling that.
And apparently, the game was marked down to $1.99 and it still didn't affect the piracy rate.
Which is interesting.
You know what this story, do you know honestly what my gut reaction was to this story when I read it?
I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?
How?
Actually, I have a lot of them open because I have a few friends who have jailbroken iPhones.
Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?
Well, he says that he did, but there's other places.
I think they do have to be jailbroken.
Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear.
Huh.
Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.
I mean, I haven't, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.
I was never going to.
Me neither.
But I have a first-gen iPhone, and they're supposed to be super easy on that one.
That'd be something to do with an iPod Touch, I would think.
is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures though because like if the game didn't sell that much in the first place and you know this handful of people pirated your game well then you say a certain percentage has pirated your game when not that many people bought it to begin with because
Maybe the app store is just too flooded with crap right now?
Yours isn't sticking out?
They claim, like, for example, this other iPhone developer, Fishlabs, they said their game, Rallymaster Pro 3D, received a 95% piracy rate on its first day of release, and they said that that equates to about a few thousand copies.
So... Hmm...
I could see that you know if we're only talking a couple thousand I could see it there's a couple thousand people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games and a lot of pirates especially with something as little as an iPhone game because it's not like any of those games are that big probably just download them to download them play them once and throw them away I would bet you that's what most of those people do
Remember when the Dreamcast piracy was a big thing?
That's really a lot of them.
It's like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.
Or here's a great example, something that came up earlier in the show.
Mame ROMs.
How many people pirate Mame ROMs?
I think that's one of those things kind of like everybody does, but no one really talks about it.
I do it.
Tons of people download the main stuff from the 80s.
Those games aren't making money anymore.
Who cares?
I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent.
It doesn't matter.
I feel justified.
There's some games in there.
I don't even know what the hell they are and I'm probably going to try them.
And you play them once and you delete them.
That's still piracy.
You're still pirating a game.
Thanks for watching!
Oh man, seriously?
If you've never played this on MAME, it's the one MAME ROM everybody has to play, is Miss Nude World 96.
It's just, it's so bad.
It's awful.
I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.
Basically, it's the game, like, Kicks.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
everybody move your body oh it's it's awesome but yeah I mean there's a lot of hack stuff out there and it's not practical for people to buy arcade cabinets and stuff and even still I mean a lot of the stuff you're buying secondhand anyways the developers already made their money off that stuff I don't know it's not like they're making new Miss Nude World 96 you know boards out there I don't know
Vanis Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new, there's nothing wrong with downloading it.
Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.
To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.
I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to just pirate it.
Which, yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.
I don't
DRM Free MB3
Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes.
They are not.
Just what I use.
Convenient.
Yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.
You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.
Anyhow, let's move on to another story here and then we'll get to release dates.
Was that all to say about the piracy story?
Yeah, it's just crazy.
That's really what it is.
Going into an article here about Rock Band...
Apparently, there's kind of talk going around that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had with Rock Band The Beatles.
Roger Daltrey, who of course is the lead singer of The Who, was speaking to The Republican recently, saying, quote, The game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.
There's one planned.
The idea is fabulous.
Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.
Now, of course, you know, sometimes these...
Old Rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.
He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made a similar mistake earlier this year.
They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.
I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge download pack before.
And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack, that there's so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.
I don't know, do you think The Who's...
Do you think that would warrant a whole new game?
I gotta admit, and I'm gonna get hate mail over this, but hear me out.
I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.
I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.
I know, hate me if you want.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.
Don't agree with me?
Then release the damn game.
Prove me wrong.
It's niche.
There could be like a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but like, you know how they do those disc releases of like, say, 20-some songs or whatever?
I could see that happening.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
And only the Beatles, I think, can justify.
I honestly can't think.
And I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different bands in chat right now and all this.
But I really don't think there's any band I can think of that justifies that.
Some of the Guitar Hero games.
Like, okay, Metallica.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.
Aerosmith.
I can see where they're getting a game.
Van Halen.
I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license anything after 1984.
Because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff.
But hey, that's just me.
Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.
Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means the last song in there was 25 years ago.
When most of the people buying these games are probably in their young 20s and teens.
A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.
Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.
It's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.
So there you go.
but again it's like it's so interesting because like then every argument I'm saying here against this game you could say well what about the Beatles what about the Beatles but the Beatles are the Beatles there's just there is no comparison seriously try it there's no comparison no I agree with you
So, anyhow, that was my little rant.
So, you know, and I'm cool.
Hey, you know, I realize, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right now, Rob, how dare you?
You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there, and, you know, especially, like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger group who just has an appreciation for classic rock.
Pinball Wizard.
You go!
Pinball Wizard's an awesome song.
There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new $50, $60 game?
Hell no!
Only for, you know, fans that...
The Who Justifies That
Hater's Gonna Hate Lady Gaga
P.S.
Rob, you're a dork.
But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.
People bought Britney's dance beat.
Damn it, Lady Gaga can have a game.
Alright, anyhow.
Sorry, release dates.
Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?
No, not this week, I'm afraid.
This week actually starting... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
TigerClaw on chat.
Just made me lol.
It would be called Lady Gaga Game.
That's so stupid yet so funny.
Lady Gaga Game.
Or that'd be Lady Gaga Me.
I'm putting the mic down so I won't interrupt.
My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.

Band Hero.
Also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

WeChair got a sequel?
Yes.
I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the Cat game, President Cat, is the worst Wii game ever made.
Yet WeChair gets a sequel.
I'm just saying.
Trust me.
Anything made by Destiny is the worst Wii game ever.
Not President Cat.
President Cat's awesome.
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves is making its way out game only on the Wii.
Of course, it's been released before, but now they're kind of re-releasing it because that's what Konami does.

The rest of the versions will have to come later.
Christmas Carol, tying in with the new Disney movie, out on the DS.

Sorry, I was looking at preview information on Band Hero.
And let's see here, a couple more.

It's your fishing sim.
And then also...
becoming not a Walmart exclusive anymore.

And let me tell you this much, you probably could get it way cheaper than that.
And let's see here.
Oh, some more random stuff.
Team elimination games from the Wii.
Yet another generic party game.
Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime a dozen.
Or hey, how about this?
Another deer hunting game.
Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer.
Buck Futter.
Merry Buckfutter
That's the game I'd like to see.
Buckfutter.
Did you ever see that Celebrity Jeopardy sketch?
Oh, forget it.
And then lastly, a week from today, Sean White snowboarding world stage will be coming out on the week.
And that's it.
Moving over to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.
Now I want a game called Buckfutter, just to say I have it.
Can we get that on the indie games marketplace?
Xbox 360 in Japan.
We get Fallout 3, gets a price reduction over there.
Dirt 2 gets its release in Japan.
Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out.
I'm assuming that's very similar to a collection of what we got over here before.
NBA Live 10 comes out.
And Tayutama Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.
That sounds dirty.
It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DT.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
If you are curious about that, that is coming on the Xbox 360 this week On the PlayStation 3, a game we're going to talk about a little bit later on 3D.GameHeroes comes out I just want to point out, region free If you want to import it, but we'll talk a little more later about why you might not want to Dirt 2 comes out as well on the PlayStation 3 Infamous gets its release in Japan this week As well as NBA Live 10 And of course, World Soccer Winning 11 2010 Also a PlayStation 3 bundle
have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles that's kind of interesting
I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten warranted the two different systems being bundled with it.
Interesting.
Lego Batman.
Oh, good call.
That's PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360.
Nintendo Wii gets a few releases in Japan as well.
Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo.
I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.
But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario & Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.
Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.
And Mario & Sonic at the Olympics actually sold pretty well.
I know a lot of gamer...
and DarkSakura.
Nintendo DS has a handful of releases.
It's getting pretty busy over there in Japan.
Wireway comes out as well as Tamagotchi.
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
No, Narikiri Shaniru.
I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.
Summon Night X, Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.
And Sakura Note.
Imanitsu Nagaru Mirai
Let's move over to Europe!
We have a number of releases.
We have on the fourth, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the sixth, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins, Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues, Need for Speed Nitro, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala We Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron.
Very cool.
Yep, pretty interesting stuff, I think.
Yep.
All right.
Well, many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.
Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning.
Thanks for watching!
and so because of that they've taken action against um you know some people and of course you know with each update that the console gets with each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles so um it's kind of interesting though you know myself i have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on live so yeah you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online right
We played modded Grand Theft Autos online all the time.
Really?
Yeah.
No problem.
But see, here's my theory on that, though, is that they have ways of individually checking consoles to see if the game is modded or, like, the console's modded, but it doesn't... For them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess, would be impossible for them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.
So...
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that are playing it online.
Okay, now we have a list of 100 people to check on versus a list of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, once again, also, they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives.
They just released a new firmware to, you know, support what they call the Wave 4 disks, because basically each disk that comes out, they have, you know, the current update in there.
There's also a video track that if you're a dumb idiot and it puts your 360 in a DVD player, it says, hey, stupid, this is a 360 game, not a video, so, you know.
Did it really say that?
Hey, stupid!
No, it should, though.
And basically, they check the sizes of those to make sure that...
Thanks for watching!
Basically, each side, both Microsoft and the Pirates, they keep updating their tactics.
It'll never end.
Huh.
Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs.
And honestly, if you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what?
You kind of deserve it.
So, there it is.
By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, Ikuma JP, one of our listeners in Japan, who has really been just a great listener for us because he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes because we're so far away.
He actually linked us to a news article talking about how only 30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go.
And you know how sometimes, like in Japan, line, line, line, line.
Only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go.
You never found those sales figures, huh?
Oh, I didn't even look.
I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.
That's all right.
Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
It's where Dark Sakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you guys should really check out.
It's called the Classic Game of the Week.
DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?
So, what month is... Because, as I neglected to put on the little thing, there's no background music in this game.
So what I put up is an actual example of conversation in the game that I found intensely hilarious from some guy's YouTube.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them and they turn into these fish with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something and they talk to you and you can have conversations with them and
As they go, you have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff as well as prepare a terrarium because you're going to eventually let them evolve into a frog and then they're going to run away.
So... Jesus Christ!
Because they're so needy and then they just dump ya?
Kinda.
Kick those semen to the curb.
But you can... They breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just kinda weird.
But your first stage is a Mushroomer, which is what they originally looked like.
And then you have Gilman.
And there's the ones that go, Mar-Mar-Mar.
That's all I remember them saying.
You get Podfish, and then after they mate, the male Podfish dies.
And you get Tadman, and Frogman.
And it's a very weird little game, but very fun.
I remember watching Dan talk to his fish.
for a long time and it also had Christmas Seaman that came out in Japan it also had a Red Translucent Dreamcast with it and then there was a PS2 version that got released later on and then there was a sequel that came out which is a lot more evolution involved but it was a fun little game
Now, even though you were making fish and frogs, you never ate them, so you weren't swallowing the semen, right?
Just checking.
Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue so you can hear some dude interact.
This is intensely hilarious.
Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his semen.
Your birthday in... October.
You were born in October.
Let's try that again.
In what month were you born?
October.
You were born in October?
Yes.
I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?
Treat.
Like the spice?
Yes.
Well, you can look, but don't touch.
This makes no fucking sense.
I know, it's great.
Just keep going, because I like the part where you suck the fish to fuck off.
What do you want?
To touch you.
I don't know that word.
You just said it.
So, what day is your birthday on?
Second.
The second?
Yes, bitch.
Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
I hope you are as peaceful as he.
I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
By the way, this is from... Fuck you!
Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.
Besides, what would the neighbors think?
Fuck them!
I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.
Ebola World is the name of it.
E-B-O-L-A World, okay?
Just before I play the rest of this.
Fuck them!
Hey, why all the noise?
Your mama.
What?
Your mama.
Mama.
Nope, I'm just fine.
Wait.
Sorry, I'm busy.
You don't look busy.
I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
Just don't get any ideas about me.
Let's just be friends.
For now.
I'll friend your butt.
Are you coming on to me?
Yes.
Yes!
Put this tongue in that mouth.
Dream on.
No food for you.
Now go think about what I've said and we'll talk again later.
Rob is red in the face.
This is fantastic.
We need to get this game immediately.
I have it.
Do you really?
Hold on.
Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the games we play for an hour.
That was awesome.
Well, there you go.
That's right.
This is a classic.
Oh, she just brought out the game.
See, man, there it is on the Dreamcast.
They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.
I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.
Big thanks to the YouTube user, Ebola World, for the lols there.
That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.
Pictures going up on the site.
GameGuru in chat says, I agree.
I don't know what they're going to call it.
Alright, anyhow, clearly we need to take a break here in studio.
We'll be right back though with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news stories tonight, including some rapid fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on the N-Gage.
Probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.
Alright, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Stay tuned.
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the 1st of 2009.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.
For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
I hope...
DarkSakura.com
So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and safe Halloween.
Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from the classic game of the week.
We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll get into Twitter topics after that.
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.
Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this will be the classic Doom.
The original, well, not the original first-person shooter, but...
Sort of kind of ties in there.
I don't know.
Majesco is publishing a new DSi game.
I guess it's a DSiWare game.
Actually, it's going to be called Ghostwire.
And it's what you would call an augmented reality game.
You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts.
In which case, then you capture them.
I guess sort of like...
I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort of.
You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame.
I don't really know if that's capturing.
Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.
Hopefully it's not too expensive.
Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the PlayStation Network.
It's a brand new game with the classic Frogger gameplay and rats that are absolutely huge.
In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway car, so we should be concerned.
Must be in New York.
FROGGER
The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was 12.
It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.
It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.
And that's just what GameStop's charging for it.
Not necessarily what the price will have to be.
Thanks for watching!
Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out including About a Girl, Blue, and School and a Joan Jett song coming out Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week of course if you're playing on PSP there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged and lastly from me tonight Guitar Hero is also getting some download content they are getting a variety of things throughout November
Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.
Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so this should be fun to jam to.
Those are going to be out on November 12th.
November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from Kiss, Modern Day Delilah, Lick It Up, and I Was Made For Loving You.
Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.
That's free.
DarkSakura?
for anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content there actually will be some stuff out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live or at least if you're in Europe it'll be 497 pounds on PSN there is a 50 cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga which is pretty funny
Um, there will be, um, uh, Gorillas and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool.
And then, um, on the 24th, um, we get the, uh, um, David Guetta Mix Pack, which is, um, some, uh,
One called When Love Takes Over and Sexy Chick and On the Dance Floor.
Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge club song.
It's a big, big dance song.
Like Energy 92.7, Before They Went Under, that was their number one song on the station.
So that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.
Okay.
and those songs that came out this last week both very good, the Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing
I like the other one better.
It's good too.
That's the Gorillas and Dare.
Public Enemy.
I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillas in it.
There's like four or five Gorillas mashup things in it.
Keep in mind...
Their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey album, which got him in a lot of trouble.
So it seems to me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.
Spazinator PSN wants to know...
not so much a topic, but a debate the pros and cons of both Sony's and Microsoft's video marketplaces i.e.
compare and contrast, etc.
Well, I've used both.
I've downloaded stuff on both of them.
I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.
Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture studio, so they get movies there, but I find that...
Dark City Dark City
I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.
I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.
So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.
Well, now, though, with the new, when they're going to be converting it to the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer it to your Zune HD or something like that.
ActDeft sent us a link...
10.
Jet Set Radio Future 9.
Space Giraffe 10.
Space Giraffe
Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.
That's not a WTF game.
I don't think that's a WTF game either.
I think the writers put that there for shock value.
Number 7, Shaq Fu.
Now there's a good WTF game.
But wasn't that kind of decent?
No, Shaq Fu is ridiculous.
But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.
They had a fan sequel, too.
That's even better.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah.
Number six, Big Rigs, Over the Road Racing.
It's just a horribly bad... It's not even really deserving of attention.
I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.
Actually, it's quite boring.
Number five is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which I don't know if it's a tie-in.
I don't think that's really strange.
That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.
I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but... Sega and Sega loves Michael Jackson.
And the game actually was pretty awesome.
I don't know if I could really consider that a WTF game.
It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.
Number 4, Monster Party.
I don't even remember this game.
It was on the NES.
I don't even know what the hell that game was.
Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.
Now that's a WTF game.
Number 2, Custer's Revenge.
Of course, you can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.
This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.
Number one, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but again, a lot of effing fun.
You know what game is missing from that list?
What's that?
You know what game is missing?
What game is missing from that list?
WTF?
That's right, there was a game called WTF.
Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which is definitely a WTF game.
Choaniki is, yeah.
And Noby Noby Boy.
I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.
But thank you anyway to Actdeft for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion on that list.
That was a horrible list.
Yeah, wasn't that great?
No, seriously, I mean, I can think of a couple already.
I mean, Oonga Boonga.
Unka Bunga is definitely a WTF game.
There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.
It's another arcade game that's really weird.
Xlink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.
There was the Spice Girls game.
That was kind of strange.
It was hilarious though.
There was another game where you played a UFO or not a UFO, an alien or something.
It was a Sega game where you scared people.
I don't remember what that was called.
Incredible Crisis.
I'm not that that's the game.
I mean that that would be a good
That is a good WTF game.
Irritating Stick.
Somebody in chatroom, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible game?
I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.
Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.
Zombies vs... or what was it?
Ambulance vs. Zombies.
Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.
Or they had...
I'm trying to think if there are some other weird ones.
There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.
Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.
That was a great entry too.
Good job.
So there you go.
We just already came up with 10 games.
I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.
Here's another weird one.
Goo Goo Soundy.
Which I think I have this somewhere.
And who could forget?
President Cat is a little bit WTF.
No, no.
Apart from that, also... Seaman?
The Ribbon.
Seaman's a little bit WTF.
Thank you for watching!
Actdeft wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since Reno We is kind of like a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet President Cat, nowhere to be seen?
I want to be President Kitty.
Perhaps they need to give out copies of that game with purchases at, say, PetSmart or something like that.
Go the whole Sneak King route.
That's a good idea.
Alright, let's move on with some more long-form news.
Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.
Exactly.
Well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on.
That would be the Nokia N-Gage.
Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage.
Honestly, to me, this seems like one of those situations where you're...
God bless them for trying God bless them for trying
They were dedicated.
God bless them for not trying that hard, though.
That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled the sounds of decaying in her cats.
Which is a true story.
Ew.
Gross.
Which goes to show you that cats are popular.
Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying, Game Boy is for kids.
And that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage.
And I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.
Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.
The N-Gage was kind of ridiculous.
They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because the N-Gage didn't work.
And this little thing called the iPhone came out.
Whoops.
Just didn't know how to do it right.
You just don't make your system look like a taco.
No side tacos.
Ooh, I want a taco.
You know what sounds good right now?
Gym Boys.
Mmm, taco.
Don't make that face, DarkSakura.
No, Gym Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.
Really?
Yes.
That's like me and Chipotle.
Does it make you bleed?
Don't be disgusting.
Alright, moving into...
If the show could distance itself from South Park.
Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man.
Explosion Man, of course, is a game on the Xbox 360.
It got an update this week.
Now there are some Avatar awards.
You can actually get clothes for your Avatar now.
And they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game.
Which is pretty cool.
But also what's very interesting about this is that the...
Developers TwistedPixel has teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in it wants mood, hundreds of top quality steak fillets.
You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pick and then if you play some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak.
for playing Explosion Man.
I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.
I own a Tropic in chat.
I knew somebody was going to say it.
It says, I'm a vegetarian.
So, yeah, what do vegetarians get?
Tofu.
Nothing.
Can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?
They have cake.
They sell cake.
Oh, the steak people sell cake?
Yeah.
And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.
I guess that might work.
If the place is giving you a gift certificate, I guess you could do that.
Or baked potatoes.
They have baked potatoes or...
You know a lot about this company.
I had to buy steak from there.
What did you buy steak for?
I was buttering up some of my publishers.
Wait, so you bought the game publishers steak?
Yeah, the reps.
Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?
Maybe that's where they got the idea from.
No.
They're a developer, not a publisher.
Oh yeah, my bad.
I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.
No, no, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.
I remember it was last year or the year before last.
Thanks for watching!
It's just it's not worth it buying.
There's like plenty other places.
And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me that's, you know, I'll just go buy from there.
Alright, well we're going to get into our mailbag segment and every week you guys send in emails and DarkSakura likes to pick a few of her favorites and read them live on air for all of you to hear.
I'm going to ask DarkSakura though, are you okay to do this tonight or do you want me to do it with your voice and everything?
I can try.
Alright, DarkSakura's going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and read some emails for you guys right now.
I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had anything.
Alright, then let's read them.
So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery because I'm an impatient bastard.
Anyway, the game is weird but fun kind of.
I can't figure out half of the minigames because my Japanese isn't that good and some of the games may just be broken.
But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear playing one of the exercise minigames from the game.
It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.
If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.
Cheers, IzzyHP
I can open that up right now.
I'll go dig it in the mailbag.
It's only 40 seconds?
Yeah.
Oh, that's not that bad.
Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.
I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.
Go for it.
Hey guys, happy Halloween's end.
I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a Tingle costume handing out candy.
Just a thought.
And that's from Cheeseburger.
Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?
Just a Tingle.
Shut up.
Um, I don't know, it didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.
Um, I don't know, have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Launch Radio?
This'll be a first.
I don't know if we'd do anything on... What's that?
I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday, you know.
Let me double check.
Wouldn't you think that'd be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something like that?
I would think.
I guess it kind of depends what's going on.
It is indeed on a Sunday.
I guess it depends.
Well, it's a year away.
We'll see.
Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?
Remind us in a year.
Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas.
Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.
or with one of the Seaman.
You can just sit here and do the show.
I'll be your friend.
I'll friend your butt.
I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the Seaman.
Oh, so one of our serial callers calls in?
The people they get on every week?
I could wire that up.
Have it be a segment, talk to Seaman.
I could wire that up.
Keep in mind, you have to check them every day.
I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the Seaman Fish.
But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.
That's what we've done.
Are you a Libra?
Besides, what would the neighbors think?
Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary on.
Well, that's definitely Spandex.
This is the official channel.
That's the cat punch exercise.
Is it?
And his corgi's like, what the fuck?
I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever, because they have a bunch of people doing that.
It is.
He just looks like he's kind of dancing.
It looks like he could be holding the Wiimote doing that.
His dog seems entirely amused.
I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.
No, this isn't from the game.
This is a contest they have on their website.
It's some dance or something that the cat does.
Gotcha.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.
But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before.
I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil.
And I think it translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.
Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan, who listens to our show on Monday afternoon, live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise.
You know, like company exercise in the morning?
That's what dude's doing.
It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting the air like little kittens.
That's what the cat does.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Have fun.
Freedom of speech.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you heard a comment like that, okay?
Just saying.
You didn't hear it here.
But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.
Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?
That's all you have to do.
All right.
Moving on.
No one would believe you because no one watches that garbage.
Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.
Yes.
I don't know.
I didn't really play too much of the original game.
Actually, I think I played some of it during the show one time.
Sorry.
Got it.
I learned it from Oprah.
Okay.
There you go.
Excellent.
That wins.
I guess the Flash version of Line Rider...
has been tweaked a little bit.
They've added some new support to the game.
Now you can actually play as two different riders or torture two different riders.
It's a brand new dual rider mode and they've added a new, you can select the starting point for the second rider as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually decelerate the rider as well.
I guess you could use this to say dual
Races or some sort of synchronized run or something like that.
But the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for I guess the iPhone.
They're also going to do like a Line Racer game or something.
So that's kind of neat.
I don't know.
A free update.
I like free.
And the game is popular and it's pretty they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
And, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?
Track editor?
A track editor with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in America because that's how lazy the translation was because it was originally a Famicom disc game overseas.
Thanks for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Wow, have you ever watched that show?
Like, I think it must be written for a seven-year-old or something like that because it was really difficult to watch.
Like, it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo.
And when I say really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.
In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.
I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excitebike trailer.
I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.
It's that bad.
Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week.
But we have a little bit of a story to inspire the FUs of the week.
Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.
There we go.
Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the week tonight.
A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.
Silent Hill is not often always seen as the thing that the games made me do it.
Somehow this game tends to escape that.
But apparently there was a 35-year-old man that said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.
His name was Jan H, at least that's all they're calling him right now.
Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.
So what did he do?
He broke into Sofia Hospital in the Netherlands in April.
I guess maybe now it's just going to trial.
He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.
People were trapped in elevators.
Doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.
Thank God nobody died.
By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.
Why?
The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.
I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head?
I don't know.
But that story is just all kinds of strange.
So F you to strange things.
That's ridiculous.
You're always trying to restore power, never shut it off in Silent Hill.
DarkSakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?
Um, I want my voice back, and I want my foot to stop hurting.
That's about it.
Loki...
F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.
Not one handful, one candy.
Not that we ran out because there wasn't that many people, but seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this, and you're too greedy.
F you to the Bay Bridge.
Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you know what?
Let me put it this way.
I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.
So I bought an audio book to keep me company.
I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.
I highly recommend it.
It wasn't funny.
It was just good.
It's six and a half hours.
I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.
That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge.
Terrible.
So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causing the damn thing to break.
And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.
Oh, it's going to be open Friday.
Oh, you know what?
Fuck it.
It'll be open Monday.
And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.
And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first time, stop teasing me.
And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.
I don't know.
You don't really pay us enough to do it.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3D Dot Game Heroes
Which is kind of an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.
Very much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.
Well, thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.
It's not seen who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from software, because how they bring games over here sometimes.
But, um...
at some point it is going to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter no need to import 3D Dot Game Heroes for PS3 it's definitely coming to NA spread the word, more to come
So, awesome.
And have you seen the loading screens for this game?
I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.
I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh, that looks kind of neat, but I just don't really know.
I haven't really done my research on that game, I guess.
The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games, including Mega Man, Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.
But they're just inspired, right?
Because you couldn't rip those things off.
Well, they look very similar.
They're just done in this art style or whatever.
So it's similar enough.
So you kind of get the homage.
But the game looks awesome.
Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation or the PS3, I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things up like that.
I love it.
I wish all the consoles had been region-free.
Oh yeah.
But whatever.
Stupid like laws.
Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import.
Are Blu-rays region protected?
Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays were the same region as Japan.
Interesting.
Well, maybe Japan might want to import this or...
Who knows?
But there's a Blu-ray release of District 9 coming out.
That was obviously a big movie over here in the U.S.
And it's coming out on Blu-ray very soon.
Guess what it's coming with?
It's coming with a video game demo.
That game, God of War 3.
Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th.
I guess it's going to cash in on the gift cards after the holidays.
And that's, by the way, after the God of War collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo.
But some folks that already had the first two games may not want to re-buy them.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.
Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of games based on movies.
You're going to have to think way back here.
There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where you can play as a stealth plane.
Oh, wow.
I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though.
Even though I was never really into the first two games, I think I'm going to pick up that collection.
Because everybody tells me, you've got to play God of War.
You've got to play God of War.
So I'm kind of glad I waited.
Now I can play them in high def.
Anyhow.
One more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.
As always, Orange Lounge Radio.
But one more story for you guys first.
Yes.
This is kind of interesting.
Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.
They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.
They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers.
Thank you for watching!
English Russia reported it was impossible to put an attention of those hopeless men off the game.
It was drawing too close and the ladies were sweating as much as they could.
But the eyes of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.
And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it.
And man, they tried everything.
Huh.
It's just two things that you think would go together naturally.
That's just, you know, now we're... Or what I like to call the coolest gaming tournament ever.
Maybe they should do a gaming... Do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that here in the US?
Oh, it would... Everyone would complain.
But it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever!
What if a strip club did it?
What if a place of sin did it anyway?
Like, can you imagine if Centerfolds did... You know what we need to do?
I have a great idea!
We need to approach Centerfolds about having an Orange Lounge Radio gaming tournament at Centerfolds.
Wouldn't that be amazing?
That would be expensive.
I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I drive by all the time.
There's Showgirls and City Limit and a lot of these other clubs too.
We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.
Wouldn't that be fun?
That would be funny.
The wife would go?
That would be funny.
I don't know if that would work or be feasible or even make money, but it's a funny idea.
Well, I mean, I think it's funnier, though, because I had no idea it was coming.
I mean, if you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.
But I'm just saying, you know, like, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before.
That, like, you know, just games and strippers, like, together in one room.
It would have to be, like, something that... As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.
Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.
It's like, holy shit, nah.
Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.
I don't know.
That would be tough, you know.
I don't know.
If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't you give us a call?
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is now open for business.
We've already got a call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, it's Ray Iannami.
Well, hello, Ray Iannami.
How are you?
What's on your mind tonight?
Okay, I just came back from YowieCon.
YowieCon!
Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?
No.
Um, San Mateo specifically.
I believe this is the third year they're holding it in San Mateo.
Apparently I missed the boat.
Well, okay, so you went to YaoiCon.
That must have been interesting.
How was that?
It was alright.
The other thing is you couldn't tell it was a con specifically for Yaoi.
If you were to look inside the hotel lobby, you have to go to the panels or all the interesting activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.
Now, I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question, and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?
Mostly straight.
So, okay, so what were you doing going to YaoiCon?
Just, uh... Because that's where all the horny women are?
For the hell of it.
Oh, okay, for fun.
There you go.
Also... Yeah.
Also, it's like... But I think mostly straight, it's just like... We lost guys, and made me go, meh.
It's mostly, like, anime and video game guys that...
Make me say I'm only mostly straight.
Be who you want to be.
Just, you know, don't...
I went to a few panels and stuff like the Shonen Auction which where things started to really get interesting like their bids for this thing is high like $500 and guys can have their clothes on
Like, the guys on auction doing 1500 quotes left and right, some other things.
Can we explain what it is?
Okay, go for it.
Okay, basically, Yaoi is like male-on-male erotic anime or manga.
but it's not but this is important to also state it's not porn like it's just like yeah I have some anyway yeah what I've noticed from what few Yaya have seen is mostly focused on the romance like like if I walk into a random room showing Yali there's a very low chance I'll walk into a sex scene interesting like I'll just walk into them having a conversation
A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.
A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.
They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.
Parasite Paradise on PS2 on HGTV, which translates to, yay, lag!
And they also had Rockman and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.
Mm-hmm.
I have to, this is a great description, I'm sorry, this is a great description from SSJ100Matt in chatroom, saying, it's Brokeback Mountain romantic type manga.
But even Brokeback, you know, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain had a sex scene.
Like, there was a scene where Heath Ledger, like, friended Jake Gyllenhaal's butt.
Uh, anyway.
Um, what else about the gaming did you want to say?
But, yeah, like, I tried playing Paradise on their dev there, and it was on AGTV, and
Anyone who's played on Sunnyvale Girlfriend's 3DX machine between 2003 and 2007 knows how bad rhythm games are on HDTV with no upscaling.
Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, if your TV lags, then sucks to be you.
I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.
Do you think you're going to go back next year?
hopefully one of these years I'll go I always say I'm going to go to YaliCon but then it's just like it's always just at a bad time for me but one of these years I'll get there hopefully next year I liked it the one time I went I at least want to make a cameo alright well anyway we're going to let you go Ray so we can get some more calls but thank you very much and we'll talk to you again soon okay
I'll see you later.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
While we wait for some calls, although I saw the... Oh, here, it's ringing again.
Oh!
I hate, can I just say this?
I hate the new Skype.
I cannot stand it.
Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing.
If I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.
I can't answer it.
I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.
I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay.
We got another one.
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
This is X-Link.
Hi, X-Link.
How are you, buddy?
What's on your mind?
Hey, doing good.
Just celebrating my birthday yesterday.
Had a lot of fun doing that.
Well, happy birthday.
Wait, you were on Halloween?
I was calling in.
You were on Halloween, baby?
Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.
All right.
Yes, yes.
Unfortunately, I was one of the few.
You're probably sick of people commenting on that.
I was calling in because...
I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having a lot of fun with, was Precious Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon and it was released on Tuesday.
I didn't even realize this.
What system is this for?
The Wii?
It was for the Wii.
I picked up the PC version.
because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.
Oh, I loved it.
It was exactly like it would play on the game show.
The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they will give out a question,
You have to buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally you would say on the damn show, they'll give you four choices.
It's based on the selection.
If you have the answer for the question right, and you're the first one to buzz in, you would get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for having the right answer.
They do four questions per round.
No whammies, no whammies, stop
Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.
If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.
If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.
That's how it's more strategic, if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,
Oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player and I have an extra spin.
You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money to overpass you in the amount.
Does the game have the cool whammy animations?
But I love it.
Yes, it does.
And in fact, the loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.
It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.
You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck.
It sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
Yes, definitely.
If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii Remote.
It's a lot better than it is on the PC.
These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of fun.
Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games as shovelware.
I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those that don't regularly play games.
Everybody knows Pressure Lock.
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, and for $20, you can't really beat that price for something like this, too.
Oh, that's a very cheap price.
That's a really good price.
Well, thank you very much for the review, X-Link.
I might just have to pick that up.
Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?
I just can't believe that guy didn't get in trouble for the hospital bit.
You would think for sure he would get in some kind of trouble.
That would be like me going out shooting somebody in cold blood and going, Oh, well, I've seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot somebody for real or GTA.
Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.
No, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.
still though it's a darn good thing no one died darn good thing no one died actually we're going to let you go but have a great week later definitely you too we're going to try to take some more calls here I just want to stress I really hate the new Skype in fact I want to find the old version and download that instead if I can we'll try to do at least one more call here tonight 1-877-GAME-OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
Hi, this is Spazz here.
Hi Spazzinator, what's on your mind?
Oh yeah, a couple things.
First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I had some news about home.
Yeah, what's up?
Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought I would...
Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex at home?
Is that the update?
Well, not really.
I don't know if you check the mall weekly or not, but if you go to the furniture store on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there.
Yeah, quite literally.
They've got toilets in there now.
Wait, like, you can buy poop?
Well, I think you have to supply the poop yourself, but they've got toilets in there now.
We're with two of them.
In fact, I'm in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them.
There's a golden toilet, and they're calling it the Golden Throne.
and they're selling it for, oh, damn it, I got the error for price.
It's kind of expensive.
Last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.
So I can pay $3 to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.
That's amazing.
Yeah, and they got a second one there.
It looks like a porcelain toy and they're calling it, you know, take a load off the chair and they're charging $0.99 for it.
Maybe I should buy one of those.
I need to buy one of those for the Oil Army Clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.
Yeah, in fact, that's a perfect transition for the second topic.
They mentioned a tweet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, yeah.
The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but to other listeners out there, is that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club.
The least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation and use the club that you shell out the money for, you know?
It seems like John Doley one day ever shows up in there and every time I show up there, there's no one there.
Maybe one of these nights we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something.
We'll have like a Sony home night at 7 o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck dance party.
Because I don't know what else you do at home but dance.
Hopefully somebody will show up in a hamster outfit.
We'll do a dance party in Sony home.
What's great is that Jamie's... Hold on.
Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.
Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.
I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.
It wasn't the hamster thing.
It was the whole Sony Home thing.
Oh, the whole Sony Home thing.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, sorry I was passing you.
Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?
Uh, you know, I did have something... Oh, yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to... You know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.
Yes.
Uh...
Yeah, at least in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software,
It doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call I have a slight speech impediment.
Thanks for watching!
I can't promise the semen thing is never going to happen.
So just so you know.
Alright, later.
Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.
We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with Skype tonight.
And it's not the callers.
Not at all.
The callers are great.
The program itself, I'm a little mad at.
I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.
I don't know.
It's just... I don't know.
We do have that extra... Yeah, we got that extra thing.
Where's that computer?
It's still in my room.
Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this beast into that thing.
Let's play Jigsaw Puzzle with the new computer.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.
I have some final stories.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot we didn't do those yet.
Rob did mine for the FU.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to talk about this movie.
Yeah, the Silent Hill movie is going to start filming next year.
Well, there you go.
I didn't take your story.
And a dude was pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
What dude?
Oh, the writer?
Oh yeah, I heard about that one.
What a mess.
Don't drive drunk.
Loki, last minute stories.
Yes, Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3G internet with its next-gen DS system might be something that they're working on.
Apparently, Iwata is quoted saying that, "...I'm interested because it's a new business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications cost."
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
That would be pretty awesome if you could get unlimited 3G internet through a DS or something.
But the problem is, one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.
They haven't embraced online yet, so all the free online thrown into your next-gen console doesn't mean shit to me since...
You haven't really braced online.
I mean, okay, yeah, WiiWare and DSiWare, but your infrastructure sucks, and your friend's code sucks even more.
Yeah.
Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment, and I know I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.
It's a game called Baby and Me.
But I was completely unaware of this brand new...
I guess they have.
It's a special edition.
This is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.
Basically, it has a remote holster for a baby doll.
But!
But!
That's not all.
Apparently, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition.
And what does this special edition include?
But a baby doll attachment for your Wii Remote.
Yes.
Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii Remote into that baby.
Wow.
That's kind of crazy.
And then, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.
The Return of Alice.
It's going to be the next game that he's doing.
He's got a nice little teaser trailer online.
And it looks creepy.
So I'm sure that's going to come on the PC later on.
Return of Alice, American McGee
Oh yeah, that's true, and I think that's kind of it.
Like, I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the American McGee one, because you'll get your Dark Tim.
But American McGee's gonna be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like, you know, bubblegum dark, you know?
He's like, he's like Hot Topic dark, okay?
I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend for Halloween.
They're my friends that I play Warcraft with now.
And we watched some movies.
This was Halloween.
We watched Showgirls because you have to watch something scary.
But then we started... Darling.
Except I love Showgirls.
Don't get me started.
That's one of my favorite movies.
It's so bad, it's good.
We need to watch that again.
Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3
None of them are good as good as we knew that.
We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was similar to the remake.
Which, by the way...
to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie.
Next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.
It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.
And if you've never seen it, and you don't know anything about it, good.
Keep it that way until you watch the movie, because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever.
Ever.
That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?
And it's a very little quotable movie, too.
It's so bad, it's funny.
So there you go.
They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.
Ridiculous.
Tiger Claw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.
And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.
Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.
What?
Yeah, it's supposed to center around Hope, which was – do you remember there was kind of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?
Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her.
I'll one-up you with this.
The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody because this movie was supposed to be huge was supposed to take place in L.A.
or Hollywood.
That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away – OMG, spoilers – they're going to L.A.
because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have been –
Why don't they do that?
She's not doing anything.
She hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?
No, she doesn't do anything.
She's unemployed right now.
I mean, come on.
I love it.
We've already seen her breasts.
It's not even that big a deal anymore.
Salacious Pop in chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote there.
No one wants to fuck a penny.
They want to fuck a heather or a hope.
Forget it.
And he estimates Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.
Just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR live event.
Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.
Go around and get everybody's... I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?
That was it.
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Loki, I'll start with you.
Your final thought.
Final thought is I need to find a steering wheel for my main cabinet.
My final thought is, I really want a taco from Gym Boys, even if Jamie hates it.
Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?
Did you watch The Grudge for Halloween?
No.
I remember when you were really into The Ring and those books and all that, or Ringu and all that, this gal at my work dressed up as Samara, and she did a really good job.
It was such a really good costume.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Just made me think of you because I know you used to really be into that whole series.
I'm still into it.
Actually, I need to find my copy of Loop again so I can read it because that was my favorite of those books.
All right.
Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next week.
Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.
Oh, wait, wait.
I've been challenged.
To what?
Ionotropic says extended death rattle.
What?
No, knock it off.
No, stop.
I'm going to unplug.
Where is she on the mixing board here?
Stop it.
I need to get my thing.
Then you can death rattle us out.
Oh my god, that's annoying.
Shut up.
Alright.
Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
After that, I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game company behind us.
We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.
Alright.
Okay, X-Link said it again.
Because the things that come out of that are filthy.
So until then, have a great week.
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Oh my god, her noise made the dolls fall over.
Happy Halloween!
