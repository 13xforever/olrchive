1
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:24,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 1st, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video game?

2
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:32,544
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

3
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.

5
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I stayed home and passed out candy to

6
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,191
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

7
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.

8
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:11,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, where's this country coming to?

9
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:16,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.

10
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:25,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.

11
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

12
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:27,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

13
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.

14
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and LiveJournal and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.

15
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:41,097
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick-or-treating anymore.

16
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know.

17
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:53,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I even know when I was growing up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor, and before we were allowed to eat it, we had to, you know, sift through it to make sure there were no needles in it.

18
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:57,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but never mind.

19
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,336
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

20
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:16,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill haunted house, which I know we were talking about at length on the show previously.

21
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:21,796
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to... Well, I mean, I'm just saying the haunted house is probably crap.

22
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:30,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.

23
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,648
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to the haunted house, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay...

24
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:36,129
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube YouTube

25
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,641
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:36,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to look into Halloween too much.

27
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in.

28
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:44,870
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just like, it's just kind of a... Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.

29
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.

30
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:51,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just a day to be silly and have fun.

31
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Wear a costume, have fun.

32
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:57,778
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they letting these pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.

33
00:04:57,818 --> 00:04:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

34
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:03,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, hey, uh, what, you decided to go with slut?

35
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:06,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.

36
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:15,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, I don't know, and I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think, like, it's a way that you can actually do cosplay, like, legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.

37
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's kind of what Halloween is, right?

38
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:25,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.

39
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

40
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,155
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:49,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you find some YouTubes?

42
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called a fag as well.

43
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:55,881
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

44
00:05:56,402 --> 00:06:08,791
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually came home from Target, and I actually showed my roommate, and by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the Snuggie to my roommate, and I'm like, look!

45
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Look what I got!

46
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Look what I got!

47
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:10,933
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you fag.

48
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:14,376
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he didn't really say that, but that was his reaction, pretty much.

49
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:15,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow...

50
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:21,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube, it looks like.

51
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:23,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You find the good stuff.

52
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:26,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.

53
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,214
[SPEAKER_06]: The camera's too shaky.

54
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:32,719
[SPEAKER_04]: See if there's a scary pyramid head or something if you manage to make it that far in.

55
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,642
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

56
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:03,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I was mad.

57
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually didn't play any Sims.

58
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I watched Dan play some of the palette of Gay Tony.

59
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It was interesting.

60
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:20,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting at home.

61
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:21,267
[SPEAKER_04]: How depressing is that?

62
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You dork.

63
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

64
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years, and I just kind of like, I'm too busy playing WoW.

65
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh.

66
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:28,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

67
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually played some Rock Band last night.

68
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:34,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss Rock Band.

70
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end of the year, promise.

71
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.

72
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

73
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:53,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring over my Rock Band No, don't encourage me, because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need to get mine fixed, Loki will bring Rock Band He's an enabler Alright, yes, you're an enabler Well, Loki, the enabler, how was your gaming week?

74
00:07:54,235 --> 00:08:04,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I was actually, um Well, it looks neat, I mean, because it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted set, or something

75
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:08,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're getting scared.

76
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.

77
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.

78
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:14,156
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

79
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,786
[SPEAKER_04]: This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.

80
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he fell.

81
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:22,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

82
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:23,588
[SPEAKER_06]: This is crap.

83
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,230
[SPEAKER_04]: If Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.

84
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?

85
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up LEGO Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock Band 2.

86
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,456
[SPEAKER_02]: The track list is pretty cool on it.

87
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a lot of stuff that's in there.

88
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be fun to actually be able to put it all into Rock Band 2.

89
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you know, LEGO stuff running around.

90
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:56,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story modes kind of need to have little cutscenes and stuff that you expect from, like, another LEGO Telltale game.

91
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

92
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pretty much what you expect.

93
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,039
[SPEAKER_02]: But the track list is awesome.

94
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say pick it up for that reason only.

95
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:15,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then of course, you know, because this week we had the, um, Ballad of Gay Tony come out, of course I picked up Episodes of Liberty City.

96
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:20,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the game's pretty sweet.

97
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:25,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, I like a lot of the stuff they add in there that's really over the top.

98
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:26,888
[SPEAKER_02]: The new weapons are pretty nice.

99
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rockstar has this...

100
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:31,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

101
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:45,198
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

102
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:23,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know, big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections of the map that weapons will spawn now.

103
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:29,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your deathmatches in, which...

104
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:30,796
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

105
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathmatch, Parachutes

106
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathmatch Deathmatch Deathmatch

107
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:45,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Lost and Damned are the original game.

108
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, though, it's pretty sweet.

109
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,435
[SPEAKER_02]: All the new weapons are awesome.

110
00:11:50,455 --> 00:12:00,021
[SPEAKER_02]: They even added some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super punch, which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.

111
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Falcon Punch?

112
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:02,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

113
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,905
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's great with the super punch so you can kick people in the nuts and they kind of fly into the air.

114
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty sweet.

115
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,076
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Hero I played a little DJ Hero this week

116
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:44,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene, though.

117
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:45,022
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL.

118
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's from chat.orangesoundtrader.com if you're just joining us tonight.

119
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:49,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Join us in our chat room.

120
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:56,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there controversial something-something going on in the new expansion, or are we just all desensitized to it now?

121
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's anything new.

122
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the way I think he's talking about it.

123
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:07,057
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dance well enough, I guess, in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them in the bathroom.

124
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't show anything.

125
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:09,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like real life.

126
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:10,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

127
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like real life, yes.

128
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you're a politician.

129
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:16,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just as censored as, say, the original game.

130
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:20,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all.

131
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:22,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something funny.

132
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.

133
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.

134
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex.

135
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:39,419
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

137
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

138
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.

139
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:51,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.

140
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:52,325
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

141
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,089
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all like 30 years old.

142
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?

143
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:57,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

144
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,061
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: One new game I did play this week though outside of World of Warcraft DJ Hero

146
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,089
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

148
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,555
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of these other little highlights.

149
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,040
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.

150
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.

151
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, to take...

152
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

153
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:10,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero in common with Beatmania.

154
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:19,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the eye and you tell them you're a fucking fool or a sheep or something.

155
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.

156
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The games both have falling notes.

157
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,052
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

158
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:47,629
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Hero

159
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:02,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

160
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:20,816
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:47,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.

162
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:48,476
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

163
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.

164
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:53,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care for Jay-Z.

165
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stand Eminem.

166
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's the biggest overexposed artist I can think of in the past 50 years.

167
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:01,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

168
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like him.

169
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like his personality.

170
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like his songs.

171
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:08,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate him.

172
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:15,470
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed the songs together are actually kind of cool.

173
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny.

174
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And I dug it.

175
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.

176
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like this whole new different song I never really heard before.

177
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:29,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.

178
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:30,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the whole like...

179
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:58,517
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jacksons and Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind I freaking love that song and I gotta say I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is like my favorite song in the game right now and it gets stuck in my head during the day like the little back and forth so you know I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long time and I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it

180
00:18:58,877 --> 00:18:59,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the three buttons.

181
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:01,199
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the scratching.

182
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You have certain direction scratching.

183
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,602
[SPEAKER_04]: You have cross fading.

184
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:06,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the euphoria button.

185
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:09,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the sampling that you change with a little knob.

186
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:11,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.

187
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.

188
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:14,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

189
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:49,613
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool, and even Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up to 11.

190
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:55,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, like, in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that all the stages were set around.

191
00:19:55,537 --> 00:20:01,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the game, something to tie everything together.

192
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,904
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Hero doesn't really have that.

193
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.

194
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:24,640
[SPEAKER_04]: and the game never really walks you through the menus you don't really know like am I supposed to play these custom set lists or can I just do my own thing and I can't really do my own thing anyway I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song it's a little weird

195
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,021
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: and the song list and making that all perfect and they did a kick-ass job but the rest of it feels just kind of like tacked on like everything that kind of streams it all together so for that reason I can't say it's a perfect game oh and online

197
00:20:58,902 --> 00:20:59,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

198
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,089
[SPEAKER_04]: could be there that's not.

199
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But is this a real kick-ass first entry in a future franchise?

200
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:22,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great first game.

202
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:30,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that too, where there wasn't really a lot of glue holding it together.

203
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:33,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.

204
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.

205
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.

206
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:42,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.

207
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,282
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, so there's no Battle of the DJs mode?

208
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:48,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

209
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:57,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy, I guess you say, a frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.

210
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.

211
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:04,119
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it's kind of funny.

212
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3 or I really am better than I give myself credit for because I'm in like the top 100 on a bunch of songs right now.

213
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the game just came out last week.

214
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:20,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.

215
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:20,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

216
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to look at some more chat comments.

217
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:33,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Vanis Lux, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.

218
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:40,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment.

219
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:41,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a $120 investment.

220
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:41,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

221
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:44,732
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

222
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, again, $120 is a big investment.

223
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:20,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it will, but as the chatter said there, not for about a year.

224
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:26,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?

225
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:27,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.

226
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:36,343
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw on chat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music for DJ Hero.

227
00:23:36,643 --> 00:23:38,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if they released a trance pack.

228
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:39,306
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

229
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.

230
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Yo-Yo Girl song.

231
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:56,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

232
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you have 93 songs to choose from, it doesn't really bother me at all.

233
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:32,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the GameStop code.

234
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're both great.

235
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:37,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll talk more about that later in the show.

236
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.

237
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.

238
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:56,879
[SPEAKER_04]: This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, Alpha Cananogram, and it's running on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country.

239
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had to say this because the article is called, Wii's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.

240
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:16,583
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the worst-selling Wii title ever, Tsukiban Sachao Rena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership of a talking female cat, Rina.

241
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:20,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies.

242
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they linked to a couple of YouTubes.

243
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:38,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity, creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.

244
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:47,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup, and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debacles,

245
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:54,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Some might wonder if perhaps some kind of quality seal system might be useful.

246
00:25:55,271 --> 00:26:05,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even cite what source they're using.

247
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:06,775
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

248
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's 100 copies imported to the U.S.

249
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:12,457
[SPEAKER_04]: is probably more like it.

250
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 1% of their sales!

251
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter has 200 some odd followers alone.

252
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really?

253
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, give me a source of some sort, please.

254
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they also published something that said it sold more.

255
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:50,633
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah so I don't know how I feel about that but that was linked by a chatter and if in case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from foreign countries such as that one you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangelandreda.com I just wanted to let you know please source or GTFO so there you go

256
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, you're going on to VGCharts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?

257
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course!

258
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you are.

259
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they'll actually have... It just came out.

260
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.

261
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're pretty quick.

262
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:08,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this is downloading very slowly.

263
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And... I don't even know if this is on here.

264
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:13,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

265
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only sold 100 copies.

266
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Please deny.

267
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, let me put it this way.

268
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We would...

269
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:24,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.

270
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.

271
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:27,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.

272
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:31,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

273
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:31,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

274
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

275
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:37,956
[SPEAKER_04]: There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to kick President Cat while they're down.

276
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:40,197
[SPEAKER_04]: This site is like the Glenn Beck of gaming.

277
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:40,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask them on Twitter.

278
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

279
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:43,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask them on Twitter.

280
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, ask them on Twitter.

281
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

282
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

283
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:49,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with GamerGirl in chat.

284
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you not like Prez Cat?

285
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,477
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says, quality seal.

286
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:57,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game worked on the system.

287
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: True enough.

288
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,942
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.

289
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:15,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.

290
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:17,890
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any sort of...

291
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:20,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.

292
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,732
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no sales figures yet.

293
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom, chat.orangeentradio.com says, It was former president Dogg spreading the rumors.

294
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.

295
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm President Dog.

296
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Prime Minister Dog.

297
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:37,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

298
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:39,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

299
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

300
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually get to some real gaming stories.

301
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean.

302
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're a douche.

303
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:48,968
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

304
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:49,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

305
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:52,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But our Twitter is twitter.com slash OLR.

306
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:54,310
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also follow us on Facebook.

307
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,131
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a club there, the OL Army, and all that fun stuff.

308
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

309
00:28:58,271 --> 00:28:58,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, DarkSakura.

310
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I just finished the most amazing French toast.

311
00:29:01,552 --> 00:29:02,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

312
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:03,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was your French toast from?

313
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli Will it give you a magic voice back?

314
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:08,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it give you your voice back?

315
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:19,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi Because remember, I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop Would you like one?

316
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I would love that.

317
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little hot in here.

318
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:27,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because of your disease, but... My disease, thank you.

319
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Your affliction.

320
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's like I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm, and actually I wear a scarf to work, is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start coughing, so...

321
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:45,551
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.

323
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:04,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off if you would tonight.

324
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:14,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service to the PS3.

325
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:25,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox 360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from Netflix.

326
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, using this disc, it'll

327
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:29,688
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

329
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,815
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

330
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:54,349
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I find fascinating about this is that just last week on the show I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke while we were live last week.

331
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:55,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We just didn't catch it.

332
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just talking about, like, hey, you know, if Microsoft wants to compete with Sony... Because what's Sony's big thing right now?

333
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It does everything.

334
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:07,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and to be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP.

335
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:10,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And to some extent the PS3.

336
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:11,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does a lot of stuff very well.

337
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:12,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

338
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system which includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix.

339
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, streaming Netflix could kind of compete with Blu-ray in a way.

340
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:23,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops!

341
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the PS3 has Netflix too!

342
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you have to order it.

343
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:39,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And mainly they were saying, like I said before, one of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around a clause that they had...

344
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:49,966
[SPEAKER_02]: for their contract with Microsoft saying that basically this cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something like that.

345
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:52,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not appearing on a dashboard.

346
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a program now that someone else is running.

347
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.

348
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:03,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, what do you think this means for the whole console wars?

349
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground?

350
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:07,297
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think it means anything.

351
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.

352
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:13,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's good for Netflix.

353
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:14,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically it.

354
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I think...

355
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:19,258
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works.

357
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: If it works as well as it does on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard, it's just a Blu-ray disc.

358
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:51,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be interesting.

359
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,154
[SPEAKER_04]: The Microsoft interface is very bare bones.

360
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:56,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if it won't be a little more flat.

361
00:33:56,636 --> 00:34:03,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine the look is going to be the same because on Netflix 360, the look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.

362
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:07,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all.

363
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:10,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of curious if it's going to be maybe better.

364
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:11,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

365
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it could be worse too.

366
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:13,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It could go either way.

367
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be interesting if it uses like a crossbar style interface where all your genres maybe are in the crossbar.

368
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably be like...

369
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:21,417
[SPEAKER_02]: DeadPixel Live on weekdays.

370
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: If it uses BD Live like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray player that is BD Live capable?

371
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.

372
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:48,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this Blu-ray Live thing.

373
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Wii sometime as well.

374
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,581
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.

375
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,422
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about Netflix getting what they want.

376
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:00,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know about this particular update.

377
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that...

378
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:14,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just have a hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player... I mean, because they don't really have strong processors in them.

379
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:29,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would be difficult, I would think, to stream... Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video...

380
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:34,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And having it look good, you know, it does require some processing power.

381
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:40,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's beating live cable would be, you know, capable of that.

382
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:47,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong, but I would think it, you know, it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does, you know, streaming video.

383
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:49,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

384
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:56,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Tropic in our chat room, chat.org.com wants to remind us, too, the disc-based Netflix for PS3 is supposed to be a temporary solution.

385
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,557
[SPEAKER_04]: They said the disc won't always be required.

386
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:02,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were talking about the contractual stuff maybe until 2010.

387
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:03,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense.

388
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:08,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.

389
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value.

390
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:12,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a win for Netflix.

391
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:14,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a small win for Sony.

392
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But also Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room.

393
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:22,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it a little late to put this into the console wars concept?

394
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Most everyone that will ever get this gen systems already have one.

395
00:36:26,924 --> 00:36:28,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so inclined to agree.

396
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:32,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Blu-ray has really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.

397
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:36,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right.

398
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:42,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which we is kicking butt at right now.

399
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:50,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step.

400
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick.

401
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are kind of hesitant.

402
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:57,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, if I...

403
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Convert my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray.

404
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,946
[SPEAKER_02]: How soon is the next thing going to be that comes along?

405
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:06,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do that.

406
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and just save some money that way because it's not really that big a difference.

407
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:16,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case there is no difference.

408
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:17,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

409
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not as...

410
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.

411
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:31,271
[SPEAKER_04]: 5thDream in our chatroom at chat.org.com comments, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current-gen stuff.

412
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.

413
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:37,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if 5thDream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.

414
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:39,613
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't own a current-gen system yet.

415
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:44,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's not forget, current-gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.

416
00:37:46,395 --> 00:38:15,160
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for like a college kid trying to pay for books and working a part-time job $200 is still an ass load of money you know that's like ramen for a year so you know not everybody's jumped on board with this yet you know it's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at right the PS2 got down to $99 finally right yeah that was back in March so there you go

417
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:35,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into the next story here, but first, I'm actually going to take a little detour because from the show roll we had, I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute ago.

418
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.

419
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Hey, is this Mel B?

420
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,542
[SPEAKER_04]: The one and only How are you doing, Mel?

421
00:38:52,602 --> 00:39:09,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time no talk since we've had you on the show Oh gosh, yeah, it's been quite a while since, you know, we've actually, you know, I mean, I've been chatting a few times here and there But yeah, actually, being a caller in, it's, oh yeah, it's been a good while, you know, it's up to you, hey, to, you know, DarkSakura and Loki

422
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:14,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always happy to have you here on the show.

423
00:39:40,537 --> 00:40:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House, because I don't even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how, well, eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago, and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have got to come down here.

424
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I will even pay for your ticket to go.

425
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:03,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that good.

426
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:05,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, okay, I

427
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

428
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:15,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing a maze over in Brea, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.

429
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:40,269
[SPEAKER_09]: and they were doing like essentially the equivalent to a human maze that was based on Silent Hill.

430
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:46,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into the game, I've worked on some stuff and all that.

431
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,812
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?

432
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got to do it on a Halloween night.

433
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:53,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was, yeah, just last night.

434
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:59,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like essentially the maze was created inside

435
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:16,146
[SPEAKER_09]: What I thought it would have been a abandoned movie theater or something like that, because there's actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and all those types of things.

436
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:17,526
[SPEAKER_04]: You're more standard scary stuff.

437
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:19,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

438
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:24,508
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get in, the first thing you do is, like, say, take a picture just sort of like for a bit of a souvenir type thing.

439
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust up there right behind you, like,

440
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:32,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your shock reaction, obviously.

441
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:36,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can tell these people are about to get you pretty startled pretty bad.

442
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:47,084
[SPEAKER_09]: And once you're going in, once you actually enter the maze, it's like indoors, it's really dimly lit with a lot of crimson lighting and just real dark and stuff.

443
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:52,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people tops.

444
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:53,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty narrow.

445
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:55,889
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a very claustrophobic feel.

446
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:57,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So already it's just

447
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:00,788
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, kind of creeping yourself out, especially if you play the game.

448
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of it is just, it's not so much, you see creepy things everywhere, you know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know something's going to happen, you don't know when it will, and that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can make, like, you know, one turn, then the second turn, you didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off in the side, first monster, you know, just jumps out at you and, you know, scares you, like, stops and like, ahhh, and for me, because

449
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I get pretty jumpy just on about anything.

450
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, whoa, you know, you jump.

451
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,163
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can tell the monsters are coming after you, but the good thing the way they set it up is you can't touch them, they can't touch you.

452
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:43,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.

453
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,525
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a strip club.

454
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:45,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Strip club rules.

455
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:46,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like what?

456
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:47,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like strip club rules.

457
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:49,607
[SPEAKER_09]: For lack of a better term.

458
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:57,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll sort of just sort of bang on the door, well, walls, and start kind of following you.

459
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:02,483
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know, corridor or whatever.

460
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I first heard that, I was amazed.

461
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:10,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, one of the things they mentioned on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?

462
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:13,946
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed.

463
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:18,424
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, cool thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.

464
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:20,386
[SPEAKER_09]: There is sort of, like, a mess to all their madness.

465
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:23,348
[SPEAKER_09]: There are, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.

466
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:40,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like, Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.

467
00:43:40,802 --> 00:43:44,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll see, like, those faces, like, the, when the

468
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:46,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Evil Spirits start coming out.

469
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,569
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll just come out through the wall and start chasing you.

470
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:49,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, weird.

471
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:54,411
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see, like, those evil dogs that you normally see.

472
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're, like, in Part 4 and Homecoming.

473
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you saw them before.

474
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:03,375
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd see, like, occasionally a dog, you know, in a cage trying to come after you.

475
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3.

476
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:09,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there was this one setup that they have, like, on the side room.

477
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:13,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, like, at the bottom there's a television screen and you can see sort of, like, the

478
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:15,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Rollercoaster

479
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,355
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the scene out of the movie.

480
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:46,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

481
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:49,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear Depends just to get through the photo shoot.

482
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But our chat room is dying to know, how was their Pyramid Head?

483
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:53,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they have a Pyramid Head?

484
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:55,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please say they had Pyramid Head.

485
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:16,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, Pyramid Head was the payoff.

486
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:20,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, anyone who, you know, the fan always knows Pyramid Head is what you came here for.

487
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:24,548
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was, um, that was actually the last thing that you see.

488
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:31,491
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming.

489
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:33,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they have that part there.

490
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:39,675
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny, as you leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

491
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:42,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was like, hmm, kind of, you know, interesting.

492
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:47,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's like this sort of kind of like shrine over there.

493
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:52,089
[SPEAKER_09]: At the top, you see a figurine, like a big busted pyramid head, which is like really well done.

494
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,449
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow, that's kind of cool.

495
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:56,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you still fixate on looking at that, just trying to internalize that.

496
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Then out of a gate, popped out pyramid head, huge, you know, pyramid head, like the big sword, you know, that just must be at least five feet long.

497
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So he starts coming after you, starts like, you know, pretending to stab.

498
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:09,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll push you back a little bit.

499
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have broke down and cried.

500
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have broke down and cried.

501
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:14,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You would have had to carry me out.

502
00:46:15,136 --> 00:46:17,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the building.

503
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:19,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have cried.

504
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:30,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, for me, it was just like, I mean, it's funny because Melody, I mean, after she's gone through, she said, wow, I wasn't really scared.

505
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, how could you not be?

506
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:39,945
[SPEAKER_09]: But then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled or doesn't invest herself in the game because when we're going through, like, all the bathrooms and stuff, we see all the

507
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:41,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

508
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they do a good job?

509
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:46,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they did a really, really good job.

510
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,495
[SPEAKER_09]: They really got you inside.

511
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:47,935
[SPEAKER_09]: They created...

512
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:18,910
[SPEAKER_09]: The Vs, especially if you did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you.

513
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, you all always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner.

514
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:26,293
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in some places, when you go into the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain.

515
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:28,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, it's like the black curtain.

516
00:47:28,194 --> 00:47:29,275
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta, like, peek through it.

517
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:30,155
[SPEAKER_09]: You just don't know.

518
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, fear is in there.

519
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:36,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's overall tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you know, just experiencing

520
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:47,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to clarify, some folks in the chatroom wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape you?

521
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,760
[SPEAKER_09]: No bodies were defiled during the haunt.

522
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right, they can't touch you.

523
00:47:52,601 --> 00:48:03,589
[SPEAKER_09]: He had his, you know, gate on the side, and you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but for all we know, you know, they might be adding something, you know, they're made over something I didn't catch.

524
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.

525
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.

526
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:11,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Mel, thank you so much.

527
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:13,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you coming on the show.

528
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys are driving home right now.

529
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,863
[SPEAKER_04]: You're calling us literally from the road, probably driving up I-5 or something.

530
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:20,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a safe drive back.

531
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for coming on the show.

532
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hope to see you in studio in the near future, okay?

533
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, take care.

534
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:32,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we might have just lost him at that point.

535
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:36,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I didn't even think of that.

536
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:39,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for a little bit.

537
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: October 30th, 1999 was what, the first time you played Bimani?

538
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:43,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten years later, look at how everything's gone and

539
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:06,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Still fans, still doing it, and look where it's taking us.

540
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:07,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for making me feel old, Mel.

541
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

542
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like I'm breaking up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe we'll talk about it more next week.

543
00:49:13,844 --> 00:49:15,105
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thanks, man.

544
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:15,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all be good.

545
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message notice.

546
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

547
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:30,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was fun.

548
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:31,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it sounded pretty good.

549
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:35,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so Jamie, if it comes back next year, I think we're gonna road trip.

550
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:37,832
[SPEAKER_04]: But make sure I bring diapers.

551
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:39,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

552
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:46,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring you... Or make sure I at least void myself before we go into the haunted house.

553
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:47,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

554
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

555
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:52,324
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just get you a big pack of oops, I crapped my pants.

556
00:49:53,439 --> 00:49:53,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

557
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hey, moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.

558
00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the only thing it was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing.

559
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:03,505
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another DSi coming out.

560
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,967
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, this will be the fourth version of the DSi coming out.

561
00:50:06,387 --> 00:50:13,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out in Japan very soon, the DSi LL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and, yes, America, as the DSi XL.

562
00:50:14,752 --> 00:50:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The DSi LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.

563
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:22,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with 4-inch screens.

564
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:23,339
[SPEAKER_04]: TSI, Leonardo Leonardo

565
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.

566
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:35,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also the DSI XL over there.

567
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in their language, it's LL.

568
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.

569
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.

570
00:50:44,894 --> 00:50:48,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until next year.

571
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:50,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been confirmed for all the regions.

572
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay.

573
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:56,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, I never bought the DSi.

574
00:50:56,943 --> 00:51:00,243
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I did buy the DSi, I might feel a little bit irritated.

575
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:05,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I bought stuff on the DSi store, it's not like there's a cable that's going to connect my two things.

576
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:09,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP.

577
00:51:09,205 --> 00:51:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be no slot for me to put the discs in.

578
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,666
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I could still play the games.

579
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people who didn't jump on board with the DSi the first time, like me.

580
00:51:20,527 --> 00:51:21,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

581
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:23,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how has the DSi been selling?

582
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a need for this?

583
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,471
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your take on all this?

584
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is just for old people.

585
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they've said it's for so other people can watch you play the games.

586
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:39,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you're advertising for Nintendo now.

587
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:40,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

588
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:42,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance slot back in there.

589
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:09,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Since, you know, now size isn't the matter.

590
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?

591
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, but, you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance a lot, and, you know, other games have... Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...

592
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true, but... Ha, I win.

593
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:37,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down the system to make it smaller, and, you know, it couldn't fit, they couldn't fit that in there.

594
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:42,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore.

595
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.

596
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:47,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.

597
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:47,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

598
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about this.

599
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:51,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also, too, I mean...

600
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:58,893
[SPEAKER_02]: You're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.

601
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

602
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I really need a 4-inch screen, or at least two 4-inch screens?

603
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:06,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it just fine.

604
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:11,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need glasses to read the text on that screen.

605
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:16,825
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me put it on my television.

606
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:23,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.

607
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.

608
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:28,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something along those lines.

609
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:29,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like the dev kits.

610
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:31,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bingo.

611
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

612
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:37,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Actdeft in chat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld.

613
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, thanks.

614
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:38,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

615
00:53:38,224 --> 00:53:43,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn well it could play them if it wanted to.

616
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:44,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

617
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:53,820
[SPEAKER_04]: because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.

618
00:53:54,201 --> 00:54:02,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?

619
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

620
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

621
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:10,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And also remember how you could get free Nintendo games streamed to your Game Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?

622
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:11,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like...

623
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:14,871
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 30 some games in there.

624
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but you don't get that anymore.

625
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:19,377
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we're just going to keep Animal Crossing the same.

626
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.

627
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know that.

628
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:24,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what they do.

629
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:27,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's the greatest thing on Earth.

630
00:54:27,629 --> 00:54:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it.

631
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:29,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

632
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:33,643
[SPEAKER_04]: This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 is unnecessary handhelds.

633
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

634
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need it.

635
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,054
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the PSP Go selling is what I want to know.

636
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:43,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

637
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:44,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be curious about that.

638
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:44,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

639
00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:45,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, there you go.

640
00:54:46,018 --> 00:54:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the information on the new DS.

641
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it or leave it.

642
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's some folks that are going to be excited about it.

643
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi I think will be more into this.

644
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that will be all over this no matter what.

645
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also more expensive, remember.

646
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.

647
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:10,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.

648
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:16,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS Lite.

649
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:17,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got on board with the DSi.

650
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:19,704
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I'm not feeling it.

651
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I'm at.

652
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.

653
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:27,349
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, I'll pass.

654
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.

655
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:29,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

656
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:33,179
[SPEAKER_04]: For very similar reasons, oddly enough.

657
00:55:55,157 --> 00:55:58,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online

658
00:56:23,134 --> 00:56:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We ban you!

659
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

660
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:34,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?

661
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:40,698
[SPEAKER_02]: God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit, I'm going to sue you again!

662
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:45,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.

663
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of all that, um,

664
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:56,109
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just awesome.

665
00:56:57,773 --> 00:56:59,135
[SPEAKER_02]: He is also not going to have a lawyer.

666
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:01,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, he's going to be representing himself.

667
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:04,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Because only a fool represents himself.

668
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:08,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he will once again opt out of using a lawyer.

669
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:19,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about it was he said before that his First Amendment rights were basically being trampled on and that's why he should get $55,000.

670
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:23,346
[SPEAKER_02]: The judge says no and dismissed the case.

671
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:24,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now he's trying it again.

672
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:29,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.

673
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cost anything.

674
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Free!

675
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:35,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.

676
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:37,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free!

677
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:38,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Devil's Advocate.

678
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: What about all the purchases you made on your old account that are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?

679
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:48,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the Terms of Service.

680
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:49,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

681
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:54,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Sony's covered in their Terms of Service, hence why the Constitution does not apply.

682
00:57:55,008 --> 00:58:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: You agree to be signing up for a club, an exclusive network, where the First Amendment rules don't apply.

683
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:10,592
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you can't complain and say, wah, wah, wah, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.

684
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: They have every right to do that.

685
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:12,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It's private.

686
00:58:12,913 --> 00:58:13,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's private.

687
00:58:14,054 --> 00:58:15,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Same goes with any kind of web forum.

688
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:20,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this guy's just kind of a douche.

689
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:23,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how we all said a different word in tandem there.

690
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,180
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

691
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:26,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Mo-ran.

692
00:58:27,162 --> 00:58:32,566
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system just look stupid.

693
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:33,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand.

694
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:34,907
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case?

695
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:35,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

696
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:38,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're going to have to throw it out again.

697
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:45,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally setting a precedent that this is stupid.

698
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and at least he's not wasting money on... Well, I guess he's being smart and not wasting money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.

699
00:58:56,306 --> 00:59:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.

700
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:08,671
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff.

701
00:59:10,032 --> 00:59:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well...

702
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:16,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard for me to feel a lot of pity for you.

703
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what you said probably would have offended me.

704
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Just guessing.

705
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:21,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably would have.

706
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't get offended very easily, by the way.

707
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:25,978
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.

708
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:33,609
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the PlayStation 3 has lost them quite a bit of money.

709
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:38,031
[SPEAKER_04]: $4.7 billion to be exact.

710
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:40,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Billion dollars.

711
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that Sony came out with this week.

712
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:51,176
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS3 has lost Sony $4.695 billion.

713
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind...

714
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:58,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Game companies really lose money every time they sell a system.

715
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They're losing money on parts and so forth.

716
01:00:03,423 --> 01:00:08,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later with things like...

717
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:13,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-ray, so they get money back with every Blu-rays that are sold.

718
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,769
[SPEAKER_04]: They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.

719
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:19,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They make the money back in other ways.

720
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,910
[SPEAKER_04]: If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.

721
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hold on a minute.

722
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger and say, Aha!

723
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:28,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

724
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:53,010
[SPEAKER_04]: These game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.

725
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:57,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet.

726
01:00:57,216 --> 01:00:58,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Or anytime soon, really.

727
01:00:58,297 --> 01:01:01,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.

728
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

729
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this money could possibly turn around by next year or the year after.

730
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:23,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce, saying, "...the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20 percent.

731
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:26,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Within the year, it could be in the single digits."

732
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:31,192
[SPEAKER_04]: will be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term

733
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:52,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later on.

734
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: As we've been trying to tell them since the launch.

735
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:55,249
$600?

736
01:01:56,209 --> 01:01:57,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you crazy?

737
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.

738
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:05,836
[SPEAKER_04]: They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they won.

739
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,738
[SPEAKER_04]: HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.

740
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So they won that gamble.

741
01:02:10,891 --> 01:02:29,605
[SPEAKER_04]: so maybe this really truly was you know when they were talking about this 10 year plan and all that that's when this is probably going to end up really really paying off for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants blu-rays and so forth so we shall see anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're already an hour into the show we haven't even gotten to release dates

742
01:02:31,656 --> 01:02:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool, and I would like to see more of this going on, is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.

743
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:58,845
[SPEAKER_06]: He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game, he shouldn't have to take out any of the, you know,

744
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:04,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one very simple rule everything is allowed no limits as long as it makes sense in the story and is not gratuitous

745
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is he having to defend himself?

746
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:31,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

747
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is this allowed?

748
01:03:50,327 --> 01:04:02,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems loud because you're... Anyway, I don't understand why the guy is being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.

749
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's ridiculous.

750
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:06,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?

751
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:16,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things, but, like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now...

752
01:04:17,814 --> 01:04:22,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you decide to show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?

753
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really have to show her boobs?

754
01:04:25,638 --> 01:04:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.

755
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:34,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this guy having to defend his game, or any creator having to defend their games and the artistic choices they make?

756
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:38,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see, because games aren't really art, according to some people.

757
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, get over it.

758
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate this, and I'm sure you all do, as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard

759
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: with video games versus movies.

760
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same kind of thing.

761
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:59,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of us who were anime fans back in the day got into the same thing.

762
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:01,462
[SPEAKER_06]: People go, oh, it's cartoons.

763
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:02,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter to me.

764
01:05:03,183 --> 01:05:09,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it's just another way of communication.

765
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:11,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just another medium.

766
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games are the same thing.

767
01:05:14,637 --> 01:05:18,919
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.

768
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my eight bucks back.

769
01:05:21,481 --> 01:05:22,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a plaintiff.

770
01:05:24,202 --> 01:05:24,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Plaintiff?

771
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:26,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a plaintiff!

772
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:28,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, that was a great show.

773
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:30,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

774
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,708
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.

775
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.

776
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:36,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

777
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:37,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

778
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:37,728
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be fun.

779
01:05:38,028 --> 01:05:41,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It might actually be a good movie from him for once in the past, like, ten years.

780
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Big American Party.

781
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Dogma.

782
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:48,653
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

783
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

784
01:05:49,953 --> 01:05:51,434
[SPEAKER_04]: A few more stories in release dates.

785
01:05:51,474 --> 01:05:53,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, the classic game of the week before too long.

786
01:05:54,298 --> 01:06:00,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently piracy on handheld systems is not limited to the DS and the PSP.

787
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:14,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, also quite rampant on the iPhone, or at least the App Store, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even like 95%.

788
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:14,246
[SPEAKER_02]: One...

789
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:19,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their developer's name too.

790
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:26,586
[SPEAKER_02]: One iPhone developer, SmellsLikeDonkey, says about 80% of all downloads of TapFu were illegally downloaded.

791
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a way, I guess, of telling that.

792
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:42,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, the game was marked down to $1.99 and it still didn't affect the piracy rate.

793
01:06:44,275 --> 01:06:44,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting.

794
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what this story, do you know honestly what my gut reaction was to this story when I read it?

795
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?

796
01:06:53,898 --> 01:06:54,298
[SPEAKER_04]: How?

797
01:06:55,778 --> 01:07:00,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I have a lot of them open because I have a few friends who have jailbroken iPhones.

798
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?

799
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he says that he did, but there's other places.

800
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:08,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they do have to be jailbroken.

801
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:10,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear.

802
01:07:10,462 --> 01:07:10,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

803
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:12,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.

804
01:07:13,184 --> 01:07:17,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I haven't, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.

805
01:07:17,428 --> 01:07:18,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never going to.

806
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Me neither.

807
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:27,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a first-gen iPhone, and they're supposed to be super easy on that one.

808
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:31,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be something to do with an iPod Touch, I would think.

809
01:07:32,518 --> 01:07:46,777
[SPEAKER_04]: is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures though because like if the game didn't sell that much in the first place and you know this handful of people pirated your game well then you say a certain percentage has pirated your game when not that many people bought it to begin with because

810
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:50,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the app store is just too flooded with crap right now?

811
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:51,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yours isn't sticking out?

812
01:07:51,639 --> 01:08:09,083
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim, like, for example, this other iPhone developer, Fishlabs, they said their game, Rallymaster Pro 3D, received a 95% piracy rate on its first day of release, and they said that that equates to about a few thousand copies.

813
01:08:11,063 --> 01:08:12,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Hmm...

814
01:08:14,326 --> 01:08:33,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that you know if we're only talking a couple thousand I could see it there's a couple thousand people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games and a lot of pirates especially with something as little as an iPhone game because it's not like any of those games are that big probably just download them to download them play them once and throw them away I would bet you that's what most of those people do

815
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:38,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when the Dreamcast piracy was a big thing?

816
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,054
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really a lot of them.

817
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.

818
01:08:42,475 --> 01:08:45,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Or here's a great example, something that came up earlier in the show.

819
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:46,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Mame ROMs.

820
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,218
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people pirate Mame ROMs?

821
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:53,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of those things kind of like everybody does, but no one really talks about it.

822
01:08:53,519 --> 01:08:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it.

823
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons of people download the main stuff from the 80s.

824
01:08:56,922 --> 01:08:59,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Those games aren't making money anymore.

825
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

826
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:04,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent.

827
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:04,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

828
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:05,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel justified.

829
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:06,630
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some games in there.

830
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the hell they are and I'm probably going to try them.

831
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play them once and you delete them.

832
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still piracy.

833
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,256
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still pirating a game.

834
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

835
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:36,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, seriously?

836
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:42,734
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've never played this on MAME, it's the one MAME ROM everybody has to play, is Miss Nude World 96.

837
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:46,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's so bad.

838
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:48,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

839
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:51,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.

840
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:54,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's the game, like, Kicks.

841
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:55,439
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

842
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:41,464
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody move your body oh it's it's awesome but yeah I mean there's a lot of hack stuff out there and it's not practical for people to buy arcade cabinets and stuff and even still I mean a lot of the stuff you're buying secondhand anyways the developers already made their money off that stuff I don't know it's not like they're making new Miss Nude World 96 you know boards out there I don't know

843
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:50,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Vanis Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new, there's nothing wrong with downloading it.

844
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.

845
01:10:57,032 --> 01:11:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.

846
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:04,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to just pirate it.

847
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:11,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.

848
01:11:11,462 --> 01:11:11,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't

849
01:11:12,563 --> 01:11:12,803
[SPEAKER_04]: DRM Free MB3

850
01:11:41,405 --> 01:11:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes.

851
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:44,087
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not.

852
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:45,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what I use.

853
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:46,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Convenient.

854
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:51,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.

855
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:57,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.

856
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to another story here and then we'll get to release dates.

857
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that all to say about the piracy story?

858
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just crazy.

859
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:09,779
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what it is.

860
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:14,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into an article here about Rock Band...

861
01:12:16,607 --> 01:12:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, there's kind of talk going around that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had with Rock Band The Beatles.

862
01:12:27,436 --> 01:12:35,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Roger Daltrey, who of course is the lead singer of The Who, was speaking to The Republican recently, saying, quote, The game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.

863
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:37,183
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one planned.

864
01:12:37,304 --> 01:12:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is fabulous.

865
01:12:38,805 --> 01:12:41,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.

866
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:44,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, you know, sometimes these...

867
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Old Rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.

868
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made a similar mistake earlier this year.

869
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.

870
01:12:56,753 --> 01:13:01,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge download pack before.

871
01:13:01,914 --> 01:13:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack, that there's so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.

872
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:12,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, do you think The Who's...

873
01:13:14,244 --> 01:13:16,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that would warrant a whole new game?

874
01:13:16,465 --> 01:13:21,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta admit, and I'm gonna get hate mail over this, but hear me out.

875
01:13:21,808 --> 01:13:24,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.

876
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:30,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.

877
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:32,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, hate me if you want.

878
01:13:32,654 --> 01:13:33,354
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

879
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.

880
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't agree with me?

881
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:02,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Then release the damn game.

882
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:02,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Prove me wrong.

883
01:14:03,463 --> 01:14:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's niche.

884
01:14:05,143 --> 01:14:14,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be like a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but like, you know how they do those disc releases of like, say, 20-some songs or whatever?

885
01:14:14,586 --> 01:14:15,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that happening.

886
01:14:17,748 --> 01:14:18,969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

887
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And only the Beatles, I think, can justify.

888
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly can't think.

889
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:49,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different bands in chat right now and all this.

890
01:14:49,379 --> 01:14:54,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really don't think there's any band I can think of that justifies that.

891
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:56,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the Guitar Hero games.

892
01:14:56,823 --> 01:14:57,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay, Metallica.

893
01:14:58,084 --> 01:14:58,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

894
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:00,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.

895
01:15:00,505 --> 01:15:01,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Aerosmith.

896
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:02,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see where they're getting a game.

897
01:15:02,446 --> 01:15:03,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Van Halen.

898
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license anything after 1984.

899
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:13,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff.

900
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:14,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, that's just me.

901
01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:18,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.

902
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:26,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means the last song in there was 25 years ago.

903
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:30,208
[SPEAKER_04]: When most of the people buying these games are probably in their young 20s and teens.

904
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:36,596
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.

905
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:38,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.

906
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:42,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.

907
01:15:44,828 --> 01:15:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

908
01:15:46,892 --> 01:16:02,001
[SPEAKER_04]: but again it's like it's so interesting because like then every argument I'm saying here against this game you could say well what about the Beatles what about the Beatles but the Beatles are the Beatles there's just there is no comparison seriously try it there's no comparison no I agree with you

909
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:06,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow, that was my little rant.

910
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and I'm cool.

911
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know, I realize, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right now, Rob, how dare you?

912
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:19,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there, and, you know, especially, like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger group who just has an appreciation for classic rock.

913
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:20,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Wizard.

914
01:16:20,874 --> 01:16:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You go!

915
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Wizard's an awesome song.

916
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:27,239
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new $50, $60 game?

917
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:28,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no!

918
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:30,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Only for, you know, fans that...

919
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:32,243
[SPEAKER_04]: The Who Justifies That

920
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:54,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hater's Gonna Hate Lady Gaga

921
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:18,792
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

922
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:19,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you're a dork.

923
01:17:48,786 --> 01:17:50,447
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.

924
01:17:51,187 --> 01:17:52,608
[SPEAKER_04]: People bought Britney's dance beat.

925
01:17:52,648 --> 01:17:53,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Lady Gaga can have a game.

926
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

927
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:56,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, release dates.

928
01:17:57,209 --> 01:17:58,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?

929
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:00,391
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not this week, I'm afraid.

930
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:02,972
[SPEAKER_02]: This week actually starting... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

931
01:18:03,232 --> 01:18:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw on chat.

932
01:18:04,512 --> 01:18:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Just made me lol.

933
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be called Lady Gaga Game.

934
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so stupid yet so funny.

935
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:14,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Lady Gaga Game.

936
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:18,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that'd be Lady Gaga Me.

937
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting the mic down so I won't interrupt.

938
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:51,249
[SPEAKER_02]: My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.

939
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:57,493

940
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:03,577

941
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:04,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Band Hero.

942
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:11,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

943
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as the full band bundle as well.

944
01:19:14,101 --> 01:19:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like dropping $200 for that one, you can just get a World Tour bundle for about half the price.

945
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Baby's Fashion.

946
01:19:23,604 --> 01:19:25,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine me not caring about this game.

947
01:19:25,725 --> 01:19:27,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's available on the DS.

948
01:19:27,945 --> 01:19:32,987

[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:05,838
[SPEAKER_04]: WeChair got a sequel?

953
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:06,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

954
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:13,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the Cat game, President Cat, is the worst Wii game ever made.

955
01:20:13,582 --> 01:20:14,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet WeChair gets a sequel.

956
01:20:15,122 --> 01:20:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

957
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:17,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

958
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:21,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything made by Destiny is the worst Wii game ever.

959
01:20:22,265 --> 01:20:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Not President Cat.

960
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:24,426
[SPEAKER_02]: President Cat's awesome.

961
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:31,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves is making its way out game only on the Wii.

962
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:35,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's been released before, but now they're kind of re-releasing it because that's what Konami does.

963
01:20:36,876 --> 01:20:40,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

[SPEAKER_02]: Cop the Recruit, out on the DS.

967
01:20:51,922 --> 01:20:52,903
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's kind of like...

968
01:20:54,622 --> 01:20:57,167
[SPEAKER_02]: What Grand Theft Auto on the DS should have been.

969
01:20:57,488 --> 01:20:58,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the PSP Grand Theft Autos.

970
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

971
01:21:03,895 --> 01:21:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Konami, what are you doing?

972
01:21:06,656 --> 01:21:10,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate Party Challenge Bundle with... Alright.

973
01:21:10,177 --> 01:21:15,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was looking at preview information on Band Hero.

974
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:36,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here, a couple more.

[SPEAKER_02]: And Hooked Again with a fishing rod.

977
01:21:45,949 --> 01:21:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your fishing sim.

978
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:48,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also...

979
01:21:50,234 --> 01:21:52,978
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming not a Walmart exclusive anymore.

980
01:21:53,159 --> 01:22:00,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band ACDC Track Pack available on all four systems for now the new low price of $20.

981
01:22:01,311 --> 01:22:04,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you this much, you probably could get it way cheaper than that.

982
01:22:09,176 --> 01:22:10,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here.

983
01:22:10,337 --> 01:22:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, some more random stuff.

984
01:22:11,297 --> 01:22:13,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Team elimination games from the Wii.

985
01:22:13,658 --> 01:22:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another generic party game.

986
01:22:15,619 --> 01:22:20,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime a dozen.

987
01:22:20,861 --> 01:22:21,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Or hey, how about this?

988
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:23,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Another deer hunting game.

989
01:22:23,162 --> 01:22:27,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer.

[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Buckfutter

01:22:58,458 --> 01:22:58,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Buckfutter.

994
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever see that Celebrity Jeopardy sketch?

995
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, forget it.

996
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:07,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, a week from today, Sean White snowboarding world stage will be coming out on the week.

997
01:23:07,411 --> 01:23:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

998
01:23:09,774 --> 01:23:12,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving over to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.

999
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I want a game called Buckfutter, just to say I have it.

1000
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get that on the indie games marketplace?

1001
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:20,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 in Japan.

[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out.

1005
01:23:27,058 --> 01:23:30,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that's very similar to a collection of what we got over here before.

1006
01:23:31,081 --> 01:23:32,322
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Live 10 comes out.

1007
01:23:32,502 --> 01:23:37,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tayutama Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.

1008
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:38,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds dirty.

1009
01:23:38,587 --> 01:23:40,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DT.

1010
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:41,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1012
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,280
[SPEAKER_04]: have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles that's kind of interesting

1013
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:47,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten warranted the two different systems being bundled with it.

1014
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:48,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1015
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:49,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Lego Batman.

1016
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:51,142

[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo.

1020
01:24:57,765 --> 01:24:59,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.

1021
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:03,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario & Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.

1022
01:25:03,447 --> 01:25:05,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.

1023
01:25:06,128 --> 01:25:08,589

[SPEAKER_04]: Wireway comes out as well as Tamagotchi.

1029

[SPEAKER_04]: That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

1030
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Narikiri Shaniru.

1031
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:43,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.

01:25:44,945 --> 01:25:48,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Summon Night X, Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.

01:26:24,577 --> 01:26:26,677
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of releases.

1037
01:26:26,837 --> 01:26:50,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the fourth, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the sixth, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins, Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 The Adventure Continues, Need for Speed Nitro, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala We Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron.

1038
01:26:52,662 --> 01:26:53,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1039
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:55,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, pretty interesting stuff, I think.

1040
01:26:56,499 --> 01:26:56,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1041
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,100
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1042
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:12,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.

1043
01:27:12,866 --> 01:27:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning.

1044
01:27:18,055 --> 01:27:18,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1045
01:27:38,131 --> 01:28:01,547
[SPEAKER_02]: and so because of that they've taken action against um you know some people and of course you know with each update that the console gets with each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles so um it's kind of interesting though you know myself i have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on live so yeah you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online right

1046
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:05,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We played modded Grand Theft Autos online all the time.

1047
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:06,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1048
01:28:06,285 --> 01:28:06,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1049
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:07,546
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

1050
01:28:07,726 --> 01:28:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, here's my theory on that, though, is that they have ways of individually checking consoles to see if the game is modded or, like, the console's modded, but it doesn't... For them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess, would be impossible for them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.

1051
01:28:29,005 --> 01:28:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1052
01:28:31,324 --> 01:28:41,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that are playing it online.

1053
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:46,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now we have a list of 100 people to check on versus a list of...

1054
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:48,583
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1055
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1056
01:29:25,854 --> 01:29:29,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once again, also, they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives.

1057
01:29:29,415 --> 01:29:37,438
[SPEAKER_02]: They just released a new firmware to, you know, support what they call the Wave 4 disks, because basically each disk that comes out, they have, you know, the current update in there.

1058
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:46,801
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a video track that if you're a dumb idiot and it puts your 360 in a DVD player, it says, hey, stupid, this is a 360 game, not a video, so, you know.

1059
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:48,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it really say that?

1060
01:29:48,322 --> 01:29:48,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, stupid!

1061
01:29:49,564 --> 01:29:50,245
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it should, though.

1062
01:29:51,006 --> 01:29:55,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, they check the sizes of those to make sure that...

1063
01:29:57,366 --> 01:29:57,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1064
01:30:22,004 --> 01:30:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, each side, both Microsoft and the Pirates, they keep updating their tactics.

1065
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never end.

1066
01:30:34,724 --> 01:30:34,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1067
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs.

1068
01:30:38,805 --> 01:30:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, if you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what?

1069
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:43,746
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of deserve it.

1070
01:30:44,446 --> 01:30:46,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there it is.

1071
01:30:47,607 --> 01:31:02,530
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, Ikuma JP, one of our listeners in Japan, who has really been just a great listener for us because he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes because we're so far away.

1072
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:07,512
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually linked us to a news article talking about how only 30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go.

1073
01:31:08,373 --> 01:31:11,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know how sometimes, like in Japan, line, line, line, line.

1074
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go.

1075
01:31:14,356 --> 01:31:15,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You never found those sales figures, huh?

1076
01:31:16,557 --> 01:31:17,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't even look.

1077
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:19,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.

1078
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:20,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1079
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:24,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:31:24,981 --> 01:31:30,164
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where Dark Sakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you guys should really check out.

1081
01:31:30,224 --> 01:31:32,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Classic Game of the Week.

1082
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:39,825
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?

1083
01:31:56,253 --> 01:32:05,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what month is... Because, as I neglected to put on the little thing, there's no background music in this game.

1084
01:32:06,578 --> 01:32:14,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I put up is an actual example of conversation in the game that I found intensely hilarious from some guy's YouTube.

1085
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1086
01:32:38,879 --> 01:32:59,713
[SPEAKER_06]: and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them and they turn into these fish with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something and they talk to you and you can have conversations with them and

1087
01:33:00,673 --> 01:33:17,255
[SPEAKER_06]: As they go, you have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff as well as prepare a terrarium because you're going to eventually let them evolve into a frog and then they're going to run away.

1088
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:19,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Jesus Christ!

1089
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're so needy and then they just dump ya?

1090
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:22,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinda.

1091
01:33:23,414 --> 01:33:24,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick those semen to the curb.

1092
01:33:25,155 --> 01:33:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can... They breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just kinda weird.

1093
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:41,785
[SPEAKER_06]: But your first stage is a Mushroomer, which is what they originally looked like.

1094
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have Gilman.

1095
01:33:44,326 --> 01:33:46,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's the ones that go, Mar-Mar-Mar.

1096
01:33:47,408 --> 01:33:48,589
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I remember them saying.

1097
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: You get Podfish, and then after they mate, the male Podfish dies.

1098
01:33:56,857 --> 01:34:00,840
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get Tadman, and Frogman.

1099
01:34:03,042 --> 01:34:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a very weird little game, but very fun.

1100
01:34:09,288 --> 01:34:11,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember watching Dan talk to his fish.

1101
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:39,442
[SPEAKER_06]: for a long time and it also had Christmas Seaman that came out in Japan it also had a Red Translucent Dreamcast with it and then there was a PS2 version that got released later on and then there was a sequel that came out which is a lot more evolution involved but it was a fun little game

1102
01:34:39,713 --> 01:34:45,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, even though you were making fish and frogs, you never ate them, so you weren't swallowing the semen, right?

1103
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Just checking.

1104
01:34:53,165 --> 01:34:56,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue so you can hear some dude interact.

1105
01:34:56,688 --> 01:34:58,530
[SPEAKER_04]: This is intensely hilarious.

1106
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his semen.

1107
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:03,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Your birthday in... October.

1108
01:35:04,435 --> 01:35:05,997
[SPEAKER_05]: You were born in October.

1109
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try that again.

1110
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:14,662
[SPEAKER_05]: In what month were you born?

1111
01:35:15,503 --> 01:35:16,283
[SPEAKER_05]: October.

1112
01:35:17,563 --> 01:35:19,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You were born in October?

1113
01:35:19,524 --> 01:35:19,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1114
01:35:21,485 --> 01:35:25,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?

1115
01:35:26,948 --> 01:35:27,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Treat.

1116
01:35:29,329 --> 01:35:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the spice?

1117
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1118
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can look, but don't touch.

1119
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:39,641
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes no fucking sense.

1120
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:40,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's great.

1121
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:43,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep going, because I like the part where you suck the fish to fuck off.

1122
01:35:46,723 --> 01:35:47,543
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want?

1123
01:35:48,503 --> 01:35:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: To touch you.

1124
01:35:50,923 --> 01:35:52,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that word.

1125
01:35:53,364 --> 01:35:54,124
[SPEAKER_05]: You just said it.

1126
01:35:54,184 --> 01:35:57,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what day is your birthday on?

1127
01:35:59,025 --> 01:35:59,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1128
01:36:00,846 --> 01:36:01,566
[SPEAKER_05]: The second?

1129
01:36:02,266 --> 01:36:02,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, bitch.

1130
01:36:04,591 --> 01:36:07,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.

1131
01:36:09,075 --> 01:36:10,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you are as peaceful as he.

1132
01:36:11,997 --> 01:36:16,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.

1133
01:36:18,402 --> 01:36:19,243
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, this is from... Fuck you!

1134
01:36:21,425 --> 01:36:27,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.

1135
01:36:29,131 --> 01:36:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides, what would the neighbors think?

1136
01:36:31,954 --> 01:36:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them!

1137
01:36:35,171 --> 01:36:37,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.

1138
01:36:37,553 --> 01:36:39,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Ebola World is the name of it.

1139
01:36:39,214 --> 01:36:40,815
[SPEAKER_04]: E-B-O-L-A World, okay?

1140
01:36:40,835 --> 01:36:42,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before I play the rest of this.

1141
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:43,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them!

1142
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why all the noise?

1143
01:36:48,381 --> 01:36:48,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

1144
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1145
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:53,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

1146
01:36:55,667 --> 01:36:56,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Mama.

1147
01:36:58,129 --> 01:36:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, I'm just fine.

1148
01:37:00,571 --> 01:37:00,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

1149
01:37:03,013 --> 01:37:04,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm busy.

1150
01:37:04,932 --> 01:37:05,873
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't look busy.

1151
01:37:06,914 --> 01:37:13,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

1152
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

1153
01:37:17,743 --> 01:37:19,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't get any ideas about me.

1154
01:37:20,565 --> 01:37:21,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just be friends.

1155
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:23,528
[SPEAKER_05]: For now.

1156
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll friend your butt.

1157
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:31,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you coming on to me?

1158
01:37:31,855 --> 01:37:32,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1159
01:37:34,471 --> 01:37:34,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

1160
01:37:38,473 --> 01:37:40,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Put this tongue in that mouth.

1161
01:37:41,534 --> 01:37:42,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Dream on.

1162
01:37:43,695 --> 01:37:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: No food for you.

1163
01:37:44,696 --> 01:37:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Now go think about what I've said and we'll talk again later.

1164
01:37:58,262 --> 01:37:59,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is red in the face.

1165
01:37:59,702 --> 01:38:01,103
[SPEAKER_06]: This is fantastic.

1166
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:04,391
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get this game immediately.

1167
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:05,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it.

1168
01:38:05,573 --> 01:38:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really?

1169
01:38:06,133 --> 01:38:06,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1170
01:38:07,654 --> 01:38:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the games we play for an hour.

1171
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:20,086
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1172
01:38:22,308 --> 01:38:22,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

1173
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:23,469
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1174
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:24,791
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a classic.

1175
01:38:31,056 --> 01:38:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she just brought out the game.

1176
01:38:32,397 --> 01:38:34,218
[SPEAKER_04]: See, man, there it is on the Dreamcast.

1177
01:38:34,859 --> 01:38:38,141
[SPEAKER_04]: They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.

1178
01:38:39,001 --> 01:38:41,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.

1179
01:38:42,023 --> 01:38:44,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to the YouTube user, Ebola World, for the lols there.

1180
01:38:44,945 --> 01:38:49,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.

1181
01:38:50,288 --> 01:38:51,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Pictures going up on the site.

1182
01:38:55,251 --> 01:38:56,712
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in chat says, I agree.

1183
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:03,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're going to call it.

1184
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, clearly we need to take a break here in studio.

1185
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:18,706
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back though with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news stories tonight, including some rapid fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on the N-Gage.

1186
01:39:19,266 --> 01:39:22,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.

1187
01:39:23,868 --> 01:39:27,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1188
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:28,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1189
01:39:34,548 --> 01:39:38,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the 1st of 2009.

1190
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:42,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.

1191
01:39:42,432 --> 01:39:53,739
[SPEAKER_04]: For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1192
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope...

1193
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:55,059
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1194
01:40:22,609 --> 01:40:26,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and safe Halloween.

1195
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from the classic game of the week.

1196
01:40:32,513 --> 01:40:37,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll get into Twitter topics after that.

1197
01:40:37,675 --> 01:40:40,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.

1198
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:46,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this will be the classic Doom.

1199
01:40:47,178 --> 01:40:50,520
[SPEAKER_02]: The original, well, not the original first-person shooter, but...

1200
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:09,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of kind of ties in there.

1201
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1202
01:41:12,722 --> 01:41:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Majesco is publishing a new DSi game.

1203
01:41:16,185 --> 01:41:17,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a DSiWare game.

1204
01:41:18,006 --> 01:41:20,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's going to be called Ghostwire.

1205
01:41:21,209 --> 01:41:23,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what you would call an augmented reality game.

1206
01:41:24,472 --> 01:41:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts.

1207
01:41:32,998 --> 01:41:34,520
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, then you capture them.

1208
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess sort of like...

1209
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort of.

1210
01:41:42,071 --> 01:41:43,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame.

1211
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know if that's capturing.

1212
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:48,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.

1213
01:41:49,705 --> 01:41:50,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's not too expensive.

1214
01:41:52,465 --> 01:42:03,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the PlayStation Network.

1215
01:42:04,354 --> 01:42:11,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brand new game with the classic Frogger gameplay and rats that are absolutely huge.

1216
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:18,003
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway car, so we should be concerned.

1217
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:18,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be in New York.

1218
01:42:22,881 --> 01:42:23,121
[SPEAKER_04]: FROGGER

1219
01:42:41,779 --> 01:42:45,741
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was 12.

1220
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:09,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.

1221
01:43:10,176 --> 01:43:12,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.

1222
01:43:12,278 --> 01:43:14,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what GameStop's charging for it.

1223
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily what the price will have to be.

1224
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:19,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1225
01:43:42,142 --> 01:44:10,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out including About a Girl, Blue, and School and a Joan Jett song coming out Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week of course if you're playing on PSP there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged and lastly from me tonight Guitar Hero is also getting some download content they are getting a variety of things throughout November

1226
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:16,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.

1227
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:22,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so this should be fun to jam to.

1228
01:44:23,024 --> 01:44:24,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are going to be out on November 12th.

1229
01:44:25,206 --> 01:44:31,889
[SPEAKER_04]: November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from Kiss, Modern Day Delilah, Lick It Up, and I Was Made For Loving You.

1230
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:35,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.

1231
01:44:35,831 --> 01:44:36,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That's free.

1232
01:44:36,792 --> 01:44:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

1233
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:25,209
[SPEAKER_06]: for anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content there actually will be some stuff out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live or at least if you're in Europe it'll be 497 pounds on PSN there is a 50 cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga which is pretty funny

1234
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:32,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there will be, um, uh, Gorillas and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool.

1235
01:45:33,576 --> 01:45:43,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, on the 24th, um, we get the, uh, um, David Guetta Mix Pack, which is, um, some, uh,

1236
01:45:45,837 --> 01:45:52,163
[SPEAKER_06]: One called When Love Takes Over and Sexy Chick and On the Dance Floor.

1237
01:45:52,203 --> 01:45:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge club song.

1238
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:00,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big, big dance song.

1239
01:46:01,072 --> 01:46:04,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Energy 92.7, Before They Went Under, that was their number one song on the station.

1240
01:46:04,455 --> 01:46:06,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.

1241
01:46:07,018 --> 01:46:07,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1242
01:46:09,635 --> 01:46:17,088
[SPEAKER_04]: and those songs that came out this last week both very good, the Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing

1243
01:46:18,243 --> 01:46:19,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the other one better.

1244
01:46:20,004 --> 01:46:20,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good too.

1245
01:46:20,804 --> 01:46:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Gorillas and Dare.

1246
01:46:27,267 --> 01:46:27,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Public Enemy.

1247
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:33,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillas in it.

1248
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:37,471
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like four or five Gorillas mashup things in it.

1249
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind...

1250
01:46:39,772 --> 01:46:56,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey album, which got him in a lot of trouble.

1251
01:46:58,356 --> 01:47:03,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems to me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.

1252
01:47:04,104 --> 01:47:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator PSN wants to know...

1253
01:47:27,845 --> 01:47:34,502
[SPEAKER_04]: not so much a topic, but a debate the pros and cons of both Sony's and Microsoft's video marketplaces i.e.

1254
01:47:34,602 --> 01:47:35,765
[SPEAKER_04]: compare and contrast, etc.

1255
01:47:38,395 --> 01:47:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've used both.

1256
01:47:40,176 --> 01:47:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I've downloaded stuff on both of them.

1257
01:47:42,917 --> 01:47:48,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.

1258
01:47:49,801 --> 01:47:57,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture studio, so they get movies there, but I find that...

1259
01:47:58,146 --> 01:47:58,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark City Dark City

1260
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.

1261
01:48:31,573 --> 01:48:33,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.

1262
01:48:33,835 --> 01:48:42,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.

1263
01:48:42,704 --> 01:48:51,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, though, with the new, when they're going to be converting it to the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer it to your Zune HD or something like that.

1264
01:48:51,564 --> 01:48:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: ActDeft sent us a link...

1265
01:49:17,537 --> 01:49:18,097
[SPEAKER_04]: 10.

1266
01:49:17,557 --> 01:49:18,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Jet Set Radio Future 9.

1267
01:49:18,137 --> 01:49:18,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Giraffe 10.

1268
01:49:19,478 --> 01:49:20,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Giraffe

1269
01:49:45,638 --> 01:49:49,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.

1270
01:49:50,364 --> 01:49:51,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a WTF game.

1271
01:49:51,325 --> 01:49:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's a WTF game either.

1272
01:49:53,068 --> 01:49:56,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the writers put that there for shock value.

1273
01:49:56,752 --> 01:49:58,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 7, Shaq Fu.

1274
01:49:58,174 --> 01:49:59,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a good WTF game.

1275
01:49:59,616 --> 01:50:01,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But wasn't that kind of decent?

1276
01:50:02,873 --> 01:50:04,614
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Shaq Fu is ridiculous.

1277
01:50:05,054 --> 01:50:06,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.

1278
01:50:07,555 --> 01:50:08,796
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a fan sequel, too.

1279
01:50:08,816 --> 01:50:09,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even better.

1280
01:50:09,637 --> 01:50:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you feeling okay?

1281
01:50:10,657 --> 01:50:11,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1282
01:50:11,578 --> 01:50:14,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Number six, Big Rigs, Over the Road Racing.

1283
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:20,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a horribly bad... It's not even really deserving of attention.

1284
01:50:20,462 --> 01:50:23,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.

1285
01:50:24,386 --> 01:50:25,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's quite boring.

1286
01:50:25,566 --> 01:50:30,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which I don't know if it's a tie-in.

1287
01:50:30,508 --> 01:50:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's really strange.

1288
01:50:31,948 --> 01:50:34,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.

1289
01:50:34,969 --> 01:50:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but... Sega and Sega loves Michael Jackson.

1290
01:50:42,691 --> 01:50:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game actually was pretty awesome.

1291
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I could really consider that a WTF game.

1292
01:50:47,252 --> 01:50:51,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.

1293
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:56,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 4, Monster Party.

1294
01:50:56,691 --> 01:50:58,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember this game.

1295
01:50:58,252 --> 01:50:59,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on the NES.

1296
01:51:00,594 --> 01:51:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what the hell that game was.

1297
01:51:02,255 --> 01:51:04,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.

1298
01:51:06,418 --> 01:51:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a WTF game.

1299
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:09,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 2, Custer's Revenge.

1300
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.

1301
01:51:15,244 --> 01:51:19,307
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.

1302
01:51:21,249 --> 01:51:26,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but again, a lot of effing fun.

1303
01:51:26,697 --> 01:51:28,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what game is missing from that list?

1304
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:29,381
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1305
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:30,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what game is missing?

1306
01:51:30,682 --> 01:51:31,684
[SPEAKER_04]: What game is missing from that list?

1307
01:51:31,944 --> 01:51:32,285
[SPEAKER_06]: WTF?

1308
01:51:33,171 --> 01:51:34,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, there was a game called WTF.

1309
01:51:35,412 --> 01:51:43,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which is definitely a WTF game.

1310
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:45,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Choaniki is, yeah.

1311
01:51:45,256 --> 01:51:46,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And Noby Noby Boy.

1312
01:51:46,457 --> 01:51:48,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.

1313
01:51:49,218 --> 01:51:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you anyway to Actdeft for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion on that list.

1314
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a horrible list.

1315
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wasn't that great?

1316
01:51:56,561 --> 01:52:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, I mean, I can think of a couple already.

1317
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Oonga Boonga.

1318
01:52:02,276 --> 01:52:04,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Unka Bunga is definitely a WTF game.

1319
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:07,299
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.

1320
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:09,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another arcade game that's really weird.

1321
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:13,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Xlink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.

1322
01:52:13,203 --> 01:52:14,463
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Spice Girls game.

1323
01:52:14,583 --> 01:52:15,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of strange.

1324
01:52:16,004 --> 01:52:16,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hilarious though.

1325
01:52:17,825 --> 01:52:22,188
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another game where you played a UFO or not a UFO, an alien or something.

1326
01:52:22,268 --> 01:52:24,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Sega game where you scared people.

1327
01:52:24,129 --> 01:52:25,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what that was called.

1328
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredible Crisis.

1329
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:29,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that that's the game.

1330
01:52:29,272 --> 01:52:30,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that that would be a good

1331
01:52:31,007 --> 01:52:33,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a good WTF game.

1332
01:52:33,429 --> 01:52:34,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Irritating Stick.

1333
01:52:35,991 --> 01:52:40,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in chatroom, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible game?

1334
01:52:40,614 --> 01:52:44,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.

1335
01:52:44,897 --> 01:52:48,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.

1336
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:51,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Zombies vs... or what was it?

1337
01:52:52,503 --> 01:52:53,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Ambulance vs. Zombies.

1338
01:52:54,384 --> 01:52:57,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.

1339
01:52:58,387 --> 01:52:58,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they had...

1340
01:53:00,674 --> 01:53:02,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think if there are some other weird ones.

1341
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.

1342
01:53:06,699 --> 01:53:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.

1343
01:53:09,101 --> 01:53:11,023
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great entry too.

1344
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1345
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:13,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1346
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: We just already came up with 10 games.

1347
01:53:16,709 --> 01:53:18,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.

1348
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:19,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another weird one.

1349
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Goo Goo Soundy.

1350
01:53:21,751 --> 01:53:23,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think I have this somewhere.

1351
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:24,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And who could forget?

1352
01:53:24,352 --> 01:53:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: President Cat is a little bit WTF.

1353
01:53:26,393 --> 01:53:26,793
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1354
01:53:26,893 --> 01:53:31,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Apart from that, also... Seaman?

1355
01:53:31,134 --> 01:53:31,534
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ribbon.

1356
01:53:33,795 --> 01:53:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Seaman's a little bit WTF.

1357
01:53:37,363 --> 01:53:37,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1358
01:54:00,106 --> 01:54:09,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since Reno We is kind of like a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet President Cat, nowhere to be seen?

1359
01:54:10,793 --> 01:54:12,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be President Kitty.

1360
01:54:12,594 --> 01:54:21,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps they need to give out copies of that game with purchases at, say, PetSmart or something like that.

1361
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:23,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Go the whole Sneak King route.

1362
01:54:24,562 --> 01:54:25,223
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

1363
01:54:25,814 --> 01:54:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some more long-form news.

1364
01:54:28,235 --> 01:54:30,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.

1365
01:54:31,135 --> 01:54:31,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1366
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:39,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on.

1367
01:54:39,797 --> 01:54:41,638
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the Nokia N-Gage.

1368
01:54:42,178 --> 01:54:46,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage.

1369
01:54:47,139 --> 01:54:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, to me, this seems like one of those situations where you're...

1370
01:54:52,267 --> 01:54:54,448
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless them for trying God bless them for trying

1371
01:55:20,131 --> 01:55:20,871
[SPEAKER_02]: They were dedicated.

1372
01:55:20,891 --> 01:55:23,252
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless them for not trying that hard, though.

1373
01:55:23,312 --> 01:55:30,135
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled the sounds of decaying in her cats.

1374
01:55:31,415 --> 01:55:32,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a true story.

1375
01:55:32,655 --> 01:55:32,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

1376
01:55:32,755 --> 01:55:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross.

1377
01:55:33,216 --> 01:55:38,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Which goes to show you that cats are popular.

1378
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying, Game Boy is for kids.

1379
01:55:48,453 --> 01:55:50,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage.

1380
01:55:50,114 --> 01:55:52,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.

1381
01:55:54,777 --> 01:55:56,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.

1382
01:55:56,858 --> 01:55:57,839
[SPEAKER_04]: The N-Gage was kind of ridiculous.

1383
01:55:57,879 --> 01:56:03,602
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because the N-Gage didn't work.

1384
01:56:03,803 --> 01:56:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And this little thing called the iPhone came out.

1385
01:56:05,724 --> 01:56:06,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

1386
01:56:07,405 --> 01:56:08,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Just didn't know how to do it right.

1387
01:56:08,746 --> 01:56:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't make your system look like a taco.

1388
01:56:11,178 --> 01:56:11,898
[SPEAKER_04]: No side tacos.

1389
01:56:11,918 --> 01:56:12,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I want a taco.

1390
01:56:12,678 --> 01:56:13,759
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sounds good right now?

1391
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:14,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Gym Boys.

1392
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, taco.

1393
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:17,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make that face, DarkSakura.

1394
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,360
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Gym Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.

1395
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:20,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1396
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1397
01:56:22,021 --> 01:56:23,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like me and Chipotle.

1398
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:26,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it make you bleed?

1399
01:56:28,162 --> 01:56:28,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be disgusting.

1400
01:56:29,402 --> 01:56:30,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving into...

1401
01:56:33,462 --> 01:56:36,223
[SPEAKER_04]: If the show could distance itself from South Park.

1402
01:56:36,243 --> 01:56:39,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man.

1403
01:56:39,763 --> 01:56:42,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Explosion Man, of course, is a game on the Xbox 360.

1404
01:56:42,484 --> 01:56:44,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It got an update this week.

1405
01:56:45,124 --> 01:56:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there are some Avatar awards.

1406
01:56:47,405 --> 01:56:49,685
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually get clothes for your Avatar now.

1407
01:56:50,185 --> 01:56:52,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game.

1408
01:56:53,046 --> 01:56:53,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty cool.

1409
01:56:53,986 --> 01:56:56,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But also what's very interesting about this is that the...

1410
01:56:58,007 --> 01:57:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers TwistedPixel has teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in it wants mood, hundreds of top quality steak fillets.

1411
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:20,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pick and then if you play some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak.

1412
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,301
[SPEAKER_04]: for playing Explosion Man.

1413
01:57:46,949 --> 01:57:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.

1414
01:57:50,692 --> 01:57:51,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I own a Tropic in chat.

1415
01:57:51,972 --> 01:57:52,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew somebody was going to say it.

1416
01:57:52,953 --> 01:57:54,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I'm a vegetarian.

1417
01:57:55,035 --> 01:57:56,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, what do vegetarians get?

1418
01:57:56,936 --> 01:57:57,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Tofu.

1419
01:57:57,316 --> 01:57:58,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1420
01:57:58,597 --> 01:58:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?

1421
01:58:00,538 --> 01:58:00,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They have cake.

1422
01:58:01,379 --> 01:58:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell cake.

1423
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the steak people sell cake?

1424
01:58:04,281 --> 01:58:04,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1425
01:58:04,921 --> 01:58:07,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.

1426
01:58:09,565 --> 01:58:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that might work.

1427
01:58:11,346 --> 01:58:13,647
[SPEAKER_04]: If the place is giving you a gift certificate, I guess you could do that.

1428
01:58:13,667 --> 01:58:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Or baked potatoes.

1429
01:58:14,308 --> 01:58:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: They have baked potatoes or...

1430
01:58:16,496 --> 01:58:17,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a lot about this company.

1431
01:58:17,877 --> 01:58:20,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to buy steak from there.

1432
01:58:20,499 --> 01:58:21,540
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you buy steak for?

1433
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I was buttering up some of my publishers.

1434
01:58:24,822 --> 01:58:29,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so you bought the game publishers steak?

1435
01:58:29,325 --> 01:58:29,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the reps.

1436
01:58:30,366 --> 01:58:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?

1437
01:58:32,507 --> 01:58:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's where they got the idea from.

1438
01:58:34,268 --> 01:58:34,949
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1439
01:58:34,969 --> 01:58:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a developer, not a publisher.

1440
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:37,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, my bad.

1441
01:58:39,611 --> 01:58:43,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.

1442
01:58:43,593 --> 01:58:47,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.

1443
01:58:48,396 --> 01:58:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it was last year or the year before last.

1444
01:58:51,926 --> 01:58:52,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1445
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:15,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's not worth it buying.

1446
01:59:15,131 --> 01:59:16,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like plenty other places.

1447
01:59:16,612 --> 01:59:23,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me that's, you know, I'll just go buy from there.

1448
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we're going to get into our mailbag segment and every week you guys send in emails and DarkSakura likes to pick a few of her favorites and read them live on air for all of you to hear.

1449
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:39,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask DarkSakura though, are you okay to do this tonight or do you want me to do it with your voice and everything?

1450
01:59:39,074 --> 01:59:39,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I can try.

1451
01:59:39,755 --> 01:59:41,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura's going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.

1452
01:59:41,937 --> 01:59:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and read some emails for you guys right now.

1453
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:49,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had anything.

1454
01:59:49,344 --> 01:59:50,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then let's read them.

1455
01:59:51,056 --> 01:59:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery because I'm an impatient bastard.

1456
01:59:57,238 --> 02:00:00,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, the game is weird but fun kind of.

1457
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:05,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't figure out half of the minigames because my Japanese isn't that good and some of the games may just be broken.

1458
02:00:05,722 --> 02:00:12,724
[SPEAKER_06]: But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear playing one of the exercise minigames from the game.

1459
02:00:13,145 --> 02:00:16,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.

1460
02:00:17,047 --> 02:00:20,379
[SPEAKER_06]: If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.

1461
02:00:20,499 --> 02:00:21,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, IzzyHP

1462
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:25,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I can open that up right now.

1463
02:00:26,025 --> 02:00:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go dig it in the mailbag.

1464
02:00:27,626 --> 02:00:28,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only 40 seconds?

1465
02:00:28,747 --> 02:00:29,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1466
02:00:29,147 --> 02:00:29,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's not that bad.

1467
02:00:30,548 --> 02:00:33,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.

1468
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:37,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.

1469
02:00:37,192 --> 02:00:37,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1470
02:00:38,053 --> 02:00:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, happy Halloween's end.

1471
02:00:40,455 --> 02:00:48,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a Tingle costume handing out candy.

1472
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:49,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a thought.

1473
02:00:49,621 --> 02:00:50,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from Cheeseburger.

1474
02:00:50,642 --> 02:00:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?

1475
02:00:52,783 --> 02:00:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a Tingle.

1476
02:00:53,844 --> 02:00:54,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1477
02:00:55,661 --> 02:01:00,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, it didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.

1478
02:01:00,626 --> 02:01:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Launch Radio?

1479
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:05,631
[SPEAKER_04]: This'll be a first.

1480
02:01:05,671 --> 02:01:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we'd do anything on... What's that?

1481
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:09,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday, you know.

1482
02:01:10,015 --> 02:01:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me double check.

1483
02:01:10,796 --> 02:01:14,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you think that'd be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something like that?

1484
02:01:14,139 --> 02:01:14,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think.

1485
02:01:14,619 --> 02:01:16,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it kind of depends what's going on.

1486
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:16,781
[SPEAKER_06]: It is indeed on a Sunday.

1487
02:01:17,081 --> 02:01:17,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it depends.

1488
02:01:17,981 --> 02:01:18,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a year away.

1489
02:01:19,182 --> 02:01:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1490
02:01:20,263 --> 02:01:22,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?

1491
02:01:22,924 --> 02:01:23,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind us in a year.

1492
02:01:24,345 --> 02:01:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas.

1493
02:01:30,208 --> 02:01:32,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.

1494
02:01:33,641 --> 02:01:34,602
[SPEAKER_04]: or with one of the Seaman.

1495
02:01:35,443 --> 02:01:37,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just sit here and do the show.

1496
02:01:37,124 --> 02:01:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be your friend.

1497
02:01:39,546 --> 02:01:40,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll friend your butt.

1498
02:01:40,607 --> 02:01:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the Seaman.

1499
02:01:46,192 --> 02:01:48,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so one of our serial callers calls in?

1500
02:01:49,035 --> 02:01:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: The people they get on every week?

1501
02:01:51,076 --> 02:01:52,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I could wire that up.

1502
02:01:53,018 --> 02:01:55,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Have it be a segment, talk to Seaman.

1503
02:01:56,141 --> 02:01:58,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I could wire that up.

1504
02:01:58,603 --> 02:02:00,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, you have to check them every day.

1505
02:02:02,969 --> 02:02:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the Seaman Fish.

1506
02:02:11,551 --> 02:02:13,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.

1507
02:02:13,772 --> 02:02:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we've done.

1508
02:02:16,573 --> 02:02:20,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a Libra?

1509
02:02:20,734 --> 02:02:23,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, what would the neighbors think?

1510
02:02:24,615 --> 02:02:28,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary on.

1511
02:02:29,637 --> 02:02:30,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's definitely Spandex.

1512
02:02:34,622 --> 02:02:35,822
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the official channel.

1513
02:02:35,922 --> 02:02:37,483
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the cat punch exercise.

1514
02:02:38,343 --> 02:02:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1515
02:02:39,083 --> 02:02:40,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And his corgi's like, what the fuck?

1516
02:02:40,803 --> 02:02:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever, because they have a bunch of people doing that.

1517
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:44,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1518
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:53,546
[SPEAKER_04]: He just looks like he's kind of dancing.

1519
02:02:53,586 --> 02:02:56,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like he could be holding the Wiimote doing that.

1520
02:02:56,167 --> 02:02:58,307
[SPEAKER_06]: His dog seems entirely amused.

1521
02:02:59,758 --> 02:03:03,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.

1522
02:03:03,861 --> 02:03:05,222
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this isn't from the game.

1523
02:03:05,242 --> 02:03:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a contest they have on their website.

1524
02:03:08,344 --> 02:03:10,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some dance or something that the cat does.

1525
02:03:10,925 --> 02:03:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

1526
02:03:13,066 --> 02:03:13,887
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1527
02:03:38,157 --> 02:03:39,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.

1528
02:03:39,998 --> 02:03:45,382
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before.

1529
02:03:45,442 --> 02:03:51,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil.

1530
02:03:53,028 --> 02:03:58,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.

1531
02:03:59,185 --> 02:04:07,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan, who listens to our show on Monday afternoon, live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise.

1532
02:04:08,087 --> 02:04:09,968
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like company exercise in the morning?

1533
02:04:10,008 --> 02:04:10,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what dude's doing.

1534
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting the air like little kittens.

1535
02:04:18,510 --> 02:04:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the cat does.

1536
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:20,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1537
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1538
02:04:47,836 --> 02:04:48,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

1539
02:04:48,536 --> 02:04:49,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Freedom of speech.

1540
02:04:49,357 --> 02:04:50,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1541
02:04:50,477 --> 02:04:55,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you heard a comment like that, okay?

1542
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1543
02:04:56,119 --> 02:04:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't hear it here.

1544
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,020
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.

1545
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?

1546
02:05:03,201 --> 02:05:03,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you have to do.

1547
02:05:04,241 --> 02:05:04,581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1548
02:05:05,542 --> 02:05:06,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1549
02:05:08,321 --> 02:05:10,321
[SPEAKER_04]: No one would believe you because no one watches that garbage.

1550
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:12,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.

1551
02:05:13,642 --> 02:05:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1552
02:05:14,742 --> 02:05:17,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1553
02:05:17,043 --> 02:05:19,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really play too much of the original game.

1554
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:22,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I played some of it during the show one time.

1555
02:05:23,384 --> 02:05:24,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1556
02:05:25,044 --> 02:05:25,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

1557
02:05:25,464 --> 02:05:26,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned it from Oprah.

1558
02:05:26,584 --> 02:05:26,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1559
02:05:26,924 --> 02:05:27,304
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1560
02:05:27,844 --> 02:05:28,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1561
02:05:29,185 --> 02:05:29,665
[SPEAKER_02]: That wins.

1562
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:35,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the Flash version of Line Rider...

1563
02:05:37,998 --> 02:05:39,498
[SPEAKER_02]: has been tweaked a little bit.

1564
02:05:39,998 --> 02:05:43,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They've added some new support to the game.

1565
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:49,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can actually play as two different riders or torture two different riders.

1566
02:05:50,120 --> 02:06:03,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brand new dual rider mode and they've added a new, you can select the starting point for the second rider as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually decelerate the rider as well.

1567
02:06:04,603 --> 02:06:06,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could use this to say dual

1568
02:06:06,983 --> 02:06:10,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Races or some sort of synchronized run or something like that.

1569
02:06:10,665 --> 02:06:17,289
[SPEAKER_02]: But the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for I guess the iPhone.

1570
02:06:17,329 --> 02:06:19,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also going to do like a Line Racer game or something.

1571
02:06:20,411 --> 02:06:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

1572
02:06:21,032 --> 02:06:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1573
02:06:23,373 --> 02:06:24,073
[SPEAKER_02]: A free update.

1574
02:06:25,895 --> 02:06:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I like free.

1575
02:06:26,835 --> 02:06:32,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game is popular and it's pretty they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for it.

1576
02:06:34,178 --> 02:06:34,819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1577
02:06:58,937 --> 02:06:59,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1578
02:07:22,248 --> 02:07:27,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?

1579
02:07:27,894 --> 02:07:28,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Track editor?

1580
02:07:28,594 --> 02:07:39,265
[SPEAKER_04]: A track editor with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in America because that's how lazy the translation was because it was originally a Famicom disc game overseas.

1581
02:07:39,585 --> 02:07:40,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1582
02:07:53,226 --> 02:07:54,567
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1583
02:08:16,087 --> 02:08:17,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, have you ever watched that show?

1584
02:08:17,889 --> 02:08:24,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think it must be written for a seven-year-old or something like that because it was really difficult to watch.

1585
02:08:24,834 --> 02:08:29,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo.

1586
02:08:29,238 --> 02:08:34,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.

1587
02:08:35,183 --> 02:08:38,526
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.

1588
02:08:38,646 --> 02:08:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excitebike trailer.

1589
02:08:42,449 --> 02:08:44,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.

1590
02:08:46,983 --> 02:08:47,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that bad.

1591
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week.

1592
02:08:59,106 --> 02:09:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a little bit of a story to inspire the FUs of the week.

1593
02:09:04,027 --> 02:09:08,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.

1594
02:09:09,289 --> 02:09:09,689
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1595
02:09:26,189 --> 02:09:28,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the week tonight.

1596
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.

1597
02:09:37,173 --> 02:09:43,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill is not often always seen as the thing that the games made me do it.

1598
02:09:43,396 --> 02:09:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow this game tends to escape that.

1599
02:09:47,498 --> 02:09:55,481
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently there was a 35-year-old man that said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.

1600
02:09:56,201 --> 02:09:59,463
[SPEAKER_04]: His name was Jan H, at least that's all they're calling him right now.

1601
02:09:59,923 --> 02:10:03,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.

1602
02:10:03,885 --> 02:10:04,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did he do?

1603
02:10:04,625 --> 02:10:08,127
[SPEAKER_04]: He broke into Sofia Hospital in the Netherlands in April.

1604
02:10:08,367 --> 02:10:09,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe now it's just going to trial.

1605
02:10:10,248 --> 02:10:13,149
[SPEAKER_04]: He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.

1606
02:10:13,209 --> 02:10:14,610
[SPEAKER_04]: People were trapped in elevators.

1607
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:18,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.

1608
02:10:18,394 --> 02:10:19,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God nobody died.

1609
02:10:20,076 --> 02:10:23,460
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.

1610
02:10:23,681 --> 02:10:24,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1611
02:10:24,382 --> 02:10:29,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.

1612
02:10:30,782 --> 02:10:36,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head?

1613
02:10:36,745 --> 02:10:37,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1614
02:10:37,746 --> 02:10:40,687
[SPEAKER_04]: But that story is just all kinds of strange.

1615
02:10:41,028 --> 02:10:42,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you to strange things.

1616
02:10:42,548 --> 02:10:43,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.

1617
02:10:43,209 --> 02:10:46,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always trying to restore power, never shut it off in Silent Hill.

1618
02:10:47,211 --> 02:10:49,452
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?

1619
02:10:50,593 --> 02:10:54,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I want my voice back, and I want my foot to stop hurting.

1620
02:10:56,136 --> 02:10:56,636
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

1621
02:10:57,477 --> 02:10:57,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki...

1622
02:10:59,764 --> 02:11:04,748
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.

1623
02:11:05,308 --> 02:11:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one handful, one candy.

1624
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we ran out because there wasn't that many people, but seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this, and you're too greedy.

1625
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the Bay Bridge.

1626
02:11:17,813 --> 02:11:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you know what?

1627
02:11:23,339 --> 02:11:24,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

1628
02:11:24,461 --> 02:11:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.

1629
02:11:33,491 --> 02:11:35,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bought an audio book to keep me company.

1630
02:11:35,313 --> 02:11:37,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.

1631
02:11:37,455 --> 02:11:38,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend it.

1632
02:11:38,096 --> 02:11:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't funny.

1633
02:11:39,397 --> 02:11:40,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just good.

1634
02:11:40,858 --> 02:11:42,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's six and a half hours.

1635
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:45,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.

1636
02:11:46,163 --> 02:11:50,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge.

1637
02:11:52,129 --> 02:11:52,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible.

1638
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:57,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causing the damn thing to break.

1639
02:11:58,496 --> 02:12:01,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.

1640
02:12:01,538 --> 02:12:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's going to be open Friday.

1641
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:03,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?

1642
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:04,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck it.

1643
02:12:04,099 --> 02:12:05,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be open Monday.

1644
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:06,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.

1645
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:14,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first time, stop teasing me.

1646
02:12:15,125 --> 02:12:23,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.

1647
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:24,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1648
02:12:25,011 --> 02:12:26,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really pay us enough to do it.

1649
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:29,091
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1650
02:12:53,952 --> 02:12:56,934
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D Dot Game Heroes

1651
02:13:09,062 --> 02:13:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is kind of an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.

1652
02:13:17,087 --> 02:13:19,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.

1653
02:13:19,549 --> 02:13:25,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.

1654
02:13:26,114 --> 02:13:35,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not seen who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from software, because how they bring games over here sometimes.

1655
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:37,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

1656
02:13:38,695 --> 02:13:50,175
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point it is going to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter no need to import 3D Dot Game Heroes for PS3 it's definitely coming to NA spread the word, more to come

1657
02:13:51,792 --> 02:13:53,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So, awesome.

1658
02:13:53,433 --> 02:13:55,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you seen the loading screens for this game?

1659
02:13:56,396 --> 02:13:58,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.

1660
02:13:58,698 --> 02:14:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh, that looks kind of neat, but I just don't really know.

1661
02:14:02,641 --> 02:14:05,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really done my research on that game, I guess.

1662
02:14:05,323 --> 02:14:21,376
[SPEAKER_02]: The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games, including Mega Man, Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.

1663
02:14:22,835 --> 02:14:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're just inspired, right?

1664
02:14:24,136 --> 02:14:25,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you couldn't rip those things off.

1665
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:27,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they look very similar.

1666
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:30,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just done in this art style or whatever.

1667
02:14:30,581 --> 02:14:32,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's similar enough.

1668
02:14:32,923 --> 02:14:36,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of get the homage.

1669
02:14:36,225 --> 02:14:37,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game looks awesome.

1670
02:14:39,301 --> 02:14:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation or the PS3, I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things up like that.

1671
02:14:49,827 --> 02:14:50,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1672
02:14:50,647 --> 02:14:52,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish all the consoles had been region-free.

1673
02:14:53,246 --> 02:14:53,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1674
02:14:53,646 --> 02:14:54,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

1675
02:14:55,227 --> 02:14:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid like laws.

1676
02:14:57,328 --> 02:15:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import.

1677
02:15:00,189 --> 02:15:03,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Are Blu-rays region protected?

1678
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays were the same region as Japan.

1679
02:15:10,553 --> 02:15:11,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1680
02:15:11,393 --> 02:15:13,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe Japan might want to import this or...

1681
02:15:14,634 --> 02:15:14,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1682
02:15:15,074 --> 02:15:17,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a Blu-ray release of District 9 coming out.

1683
02:15:18,015 --> 02:15:19,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That was obviously a big movie over here in the U.S.

1684
02:15:20,536 --> 02:15:21,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's coming out on Blu-ray very soon.

1685
02:15:22,316 --> 02:15:23,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what it's coming with?

1686
02:15:23,256 --> 02:15:24,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming with a video game demo.

1687
02:15:25,257 --> 02:15:27,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That game, God of War 3.

1688
02:15:28,158 --> 02:15:30,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th.

1689
02:15:30,738 --> 02:15:33,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's going to cash in on the gift cards after the holidays.

1690
02:15:33,939 --> 02:15:38,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, by the way, after the God of War collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo.

1691
02:15:39,101 --> 02:15:43,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But some folks that already had the first two games may not want to re-buy them.

1692
02:15:43,162 --> 02:15:43,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1693
02:15:43,922 --> 02:15:44,463
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1694
02:16:06,303 --> 02:16:15,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.

1695
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:21,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of games based on movies.

1696
02:16:21,273 --> 02:16:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to think way back here.

1697
02:16:26,156 --> 02:16:33,541
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where you can play as a stealth plane.

1698
02:16:33,922 --> 02:16:34,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1699
02:16:35,273 --> 02:16:37,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though.

1700
02:17:00,157 --> 02:17:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I was never really into the first two games, I think I'm going to pick up that collection.

1701
02:17:03,399 --> 02:17:04,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody tells me, you've got to play God of War.

1702
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:05,620
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to play God of War.

1703
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:07,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of glad I waited.

1704
02:17:07,621 --> 02:17:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can play them in high def.

1705
02:17:09,862 --> 02:17:10,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1706
02:17:11,042 --> 02:17:17,426
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.

1707
02:17:17,466 --> 02:17:19,327
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, Orange Lounge Radio.

1708
02:17:19,367 --> 02:17:20,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But one more story for you guys first.

1709
02:17:21,768 --> 02:17:21,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1710
02:17:23,947 --> 02:17:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

1711
02:17:25,147 --> 02:17:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.

1712
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:44,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.

1713
02:17:45,656 --> 02:17:50,478
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers.

1714
02:17:51,365 --> 02:17:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1715
02:18:13,001 --> 02:18:21,866
[SPEAKER_02]: English Russia reported it was impossible to put an attention of those hopeless men off the game.

1716
02:18:23,747 --> 02:18:29,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It was drawing too close and the ladies were sweating as much as they could.

1717
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:32,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But the eyes of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.

1718
02:18:33,232 --> 02:18:35,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it.

1719
02:18:35,394 --> 02:18:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, they tried everything.

1720
02:18:36,714 --> 02:18:39,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1721
02:18:40,831 --> 02:18:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just two things that you think would go together naturally.

1722
02:18:43,192 --> 02:18:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, you know, now we're... Or what I like to call the coolest gaming tournament ever.

1723
02:18:51,655 --> 02:18:55,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they should do a gaming... Do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that here in the US?

1724
02:18:55,716 --> 02:18:57,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it would... Everyone would complain.

1725
02:18:57,957 --> 02:19:00,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever!

1726
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:01,678
[SPEAKER_04]: What if a strip club did it?

1727
02:19:01,878 --> 02:19:04,259
[SPEAKER_04]: What if a place of sin did it anyway?

1728
02:19:04,579 --> 02:19:07,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can you imagine if Centerfolds did... You know what we need to do?

1729
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:11,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a great idea!

1730
02:19:13,121 --> 02:19:20,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to approach Centerfolds about having an Orange Lounge Radio gaming tournament at Centerfolds.

1731
02:19:20,562 --> 02:19:21,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be amazing?

1732
02:19:21,882 --> 02:19:24,003
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be expensive.

1733
02:19:24,143 --> 02:19:29,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I drive by all the time.

1734
02:19:30,324 --> 02:19:32,905
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Showgirls and City Limit and a lot of these other clubs too.

1735
02:19:33,405 --> 02:19:36,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.

1736
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:39,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be fun?

1737
02:19:40,601 --> 02:19:41,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be funny.

1738
02:19:41,842 --> 02:19:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: The wife would go?

1739
02:19:43,764 --> 02:19:44,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

1740
02:19:46,426 --> 02:19:55,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that would work or be feasible or even make money, but it's a funny idea.

1741
02:19:56,434 --> 02:20:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I think it's funnier, though, because I had no idea it was coming.

1742
02:20:00,278 --> 02:20:04,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.

1743
02:20:06,872 --> 02:20:11,235
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, you know, like, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before.

1744
02:20:11,315 --> 02:20:14,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That, like, you know, just games and strippers, like, together in one room.

1745
02:20:14,778 --> 02:20:17,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have to be, like, something that... As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.

1746
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.

1747
02:20:21,744 --> 02:20:24,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, holy shit, nah.

1748
02:20:25,106 --> 02:20:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.

1749
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:30,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1750
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:33,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be tough, you know.

1751
02:20:33,272 --> 02:20:33,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1752
02:20:36,185 --> 02:20:39,268
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't you give us a call?

1753
02:20:39,288 --> 02:20:43,931
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1754
02:20:43,951 --> 02:20:45,772
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is now open for business.

1755
02:20:46,293 --> 02:20:47,434
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already got a call coming in.

1756
02:20:47,754 --> 02:20:48,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1757
02:20:48,695 --> 02:20:49,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1758
02:20:49,835 --> 02:20:52,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, it's Ray Iannami.

1759
02:20:52,317 --> 02:20:53,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, Ray Iannami.

1760
02:20:53,518 --> 02:20:53,938
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1761
02:20:53,978 --> 02:20:54,739
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind tonight?

1762
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I just came back from YowieCon.

1763
02:20:58,942 --> 02:20:59,583
[SPEAKER_04]: YowieCon!

1764
02:20:59,623 --> 02:21:01,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?

1765
02:21:01,264 --> 02:21:01,304
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1766
02:21:02,998 --> 02:21:04,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, San Mateo specifically.

1767
02:21:25,342 --> 02:21:29,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe this is the third year they're holding it in San Mateo.

1768
02:21:29,564 --> 02:21:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I missed the boat.

1769
02:21:31,044 --> 02:21:33,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, so you went to YaoiCon.

1770
02:21:34,306 --> 02:21:35,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That must have been interesting.

1771
02:21:35,486 --> 02:21:36,006
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?

1772
02:21:38,908 --> 02:21:39,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

1773
02:21:39,628 --> 02:21:45,090
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is you couldn't tell it was a con specifically for Yaoi.

1774
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:54,814
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were to look inside the hotel lobby, you have to go to the panels or all the interesting activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.

1775
02:21:56,317 --> 02:22:03,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question, and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?

1776
02:22:05,563 --> 02:22:06,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostly straight.

1777
02:22:06,423 --> 02:22:08,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, so what were you doing going to YaoiCon?

1778
02:22:08,805 --> 02:22:11,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, uh... Because that's where all the horny women are?

1779
02:22:11,866 --> 02:22:12,727
[SPEAKER_04]: For the hell of it.

1780
02:22:12,787 --> 02:22:13,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, for fun.

1781
02:22:14,188 --> 02:22:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1782
02:22:15,629 --> 02:22:16,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Also... Yeah.

1783
02:22:16,549 --> 02:22:22,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it's like... But I think mostly straight, it's just like... We lost guys, and made me go, meh.

1784
02:22:22,853 --> 02:22:25,114
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mostly, like, anime and video game guys that...

1785
02:22:27,093 --> 02:22:28,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Make me say I'm only mostly straight.

1786
02:22:28,433 --> 02:22:29,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Be who you want to be.

1787
02:22:29,194 --> 02:22:30,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you know, don't...

1788
02:22:54,521 --> 02:23:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to a few panels and stuff like the Shonen Auction which where things started to really get interesting like their bids for this thing is high like $500 and guys can have their clothes on

1789
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:26,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the guys on auction doing 1500 quotes left and right, some other things.

1790
02:23:26,722 --> 02:23:27,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we explain what it is?

1791
02:23:27,323 --> 02:23:27,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go for it.

1792
02:23:27,803 --> 02:23:31,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, basically, Yaoi is like male-on-male erotic anime or manga.

1793
02:23:51,414 --> 02:24:20,699
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's not but this is important to also state it's not porn like it's just like yeah I have some anyway yeah what I've noticed from what few Yaya have seen is mostly focused on the romance like like if I walk into a random room showing Yali there's a very low chance I'll walk into a sex scene interesting like I'll just walk into them having a conversation

1794
02:24:21,516 --> 02:24:23,057
[SPEAKER_09]: A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.

1795
02:24:23,077 --> 02:24:25,700
[SPEAKER_04]: A pretty deep conversation of some sort or whatever.

1796
02:24:49,537 --> 02:24:52,120
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.

1797
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:58,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Parasite Paradise on PS2 on HGTV, which translates to, yay, lag!

1798
02:24:58,247 --> 02:25:02,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also had Rockman and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.

1799
02:25:03,713 --> 02:25:03,893
Mm-hmm.

1800
02:25:04,286 --> 02:25:12,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to, this is a great description, I'm sorry, this is a great description from SSJ100Matt in chatroom, saying, it's Brokeback Mountain romantic type manga.

1801
02:25:12,829 --> 02:25:16,571
[SPEAKER_04]: But even Brokeback, you know, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain had a sex scene.

1802
02:25:16,591 --> 02:25:20,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there was a scene where Heath Ledger, like, friended Jake Gyllenhaal's butt.

1803
02:25:20,553 --> 02:25:20,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, anyway.

1804
02:25:22,793 --> 02:25:25,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what else about the gaming did you want to say?

1805
02:25:27,495 --> 02:25:33,958
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, like, I tried playing Paradise on their dev there, and it was on AGTV, and

1806
02:25:34,679 --> 02:25:46,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone who's played on Sunnyvale Girlfriend's 3DX machine between 2003 and 2007 knows how bad rhythm games are on HDTV with no upscaling.

1807
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:58,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, if your TV lags, then sucks to be you.

1808
02:26:00,735 --> 02:26:02,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.

1809
02:26:02,277 --> 02:26:05,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think you're going to go back next year?

1810
02:26:17,544 --> 02:26:35,342
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully one of these years I'll go I always say I'm going to go to YaliCon but then it's just like it's always just at a bad time for me but one of these years I'll get there hopefully next year I liked it the one time I went I at least want to make a cameo alright well anyway we're going to let you go Ray so we can get some more calls but thank you very much and we'll talk to you again soon okay

1811
02:26:36,704 --> 02:26:38,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you later.

1812
02:26:38,566 --> 02:26:42,870
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1813
02:26:43,511 --> 02:26:46,694
[SPEAKER_04]: While we wait for some calls, although I saw the... Oh, here, it's ringing again.

1814
02:26:47,875 --> 02:26:47,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1815
02:26:50,353 --> 02:26:51,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate, can I just say this?

1816
02:26:52,394 --> 02:26:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the new Skype.

1817
02:26:55,035 --> 02:26:56,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot stand it.

1818
02:26:56,976 --> 02:27:00,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing.

1819
02:27:01,057 --> 02:27:04,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.

1820
02:27:04,158 --> 02:27:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't answer it.

1821
02:27:04,978 --> 02:27:07,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.

1822
02:27:08,299 --> 02:27:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay.

1823
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another one.

1824
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:12,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1825
02:27:14,561 --> 02:27:15,341
[SPEAKER_04]: This is X-Link.

1826
02:27:15,481 --> 02:27:16,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, X-Link.

1827
02:27:16,202 --> 02:27:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, buddy?

1828
02:27:16,862 --> 02:27:17,362
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1829
02:27:18,778 --> 02:27:20,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, doing good.

1830
02:27:20,439 --> 02:27:21,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Just celebrating my birthday yesterday.

1831
02:27:21,799 --> 02:27:23,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Had a lot of fun doing that.

1832
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:25,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, happy birthday.

1833
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:25,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you were on Halloween?

1834
02:27:25,881 --> 02:27:26,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I was calling in.

1835
02:27:26,561 --> 02:27:27,461
[SPEAKER_03]: You were on Halloween, baby?

1836
02:27:27,481 --> 02:27:29,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.

1837
02:27:29,302 --> 02:27:29,582
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1838
02:27:29,722 --> 02:27:30,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

1839
02:27:30,742 --> 02:27:31,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I was one of the few.

1840
02:27:32,383 --> 02:27:34,624
[SPEAKER_08]: You're probably sick of people commenting on that.

1841
02:27:34,664 --> 02:27:35,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I was calling in because...

1842
02:27:40,273 --> 02:27:57,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having a lot of fun with, was Precious Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon and it was released on Tuesday.

1843
02:27:58,185 --> 02:27:59,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even realize this.

1844
02:27:59,446 --> 02:28:00,267
[SPEAKER_08]: What system is this for?

1845
02:28:00,327 --> 02:28:00,707
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii?

1846
02:28:03,149 --> 02:28:03,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It was for the Wii.

1847
02:28:04,069 --> 02:28:05,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked up the PC version.

1848
02:28:05,748 --> 02:28:11,409
[SPEAKER_08]: because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.

1849
02:28:11,429 --> 02:28:12,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I loved it.

1850
02:28:12,169 --> 02:28:13,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It was exactly like it would play on the game show.

1851
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:16,991
[SPEAKER_04]: The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they will give out a question,

1852
02:28:33,117 --> 02:28:44,300
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally you would say on the damn show, they'll give you four choices.

1853
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It's based on the selection.

1854
02:28:46,721 --> 02:28:57,784
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have the answer for the question right, and you're the first one to buzz in, you would get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for having the right answer.

1855
02:28:58,844 --> 02:29:00,765
[SPEAKER_08]: They do four questions per round.

1856
02:29:01,653 --> 02:29:02,334
[SPEAKER_08]: No whammies, no whammies, stop

1857
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:19,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.

1858
02:29:20,194 --> 02:29:22,615
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.

1859
02:29:23,835 --> 02:29:28,957
[SPEAKER_08]: If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.

1860
02:29:30,638 --> 02:29:35,380
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it's more strategic, if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,

1861
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:39,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player and I have an extra spin.

1862
02:29:40,023 --> 02:29:47,128
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money to overpass you in the amount.

1863
02:29:47,368 --> 02:29:49,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the game have the cool whammy animations?

1864
02:29:49,149 --> 02:29:51,271
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love it.

1865
02:29:51,291 --> 02:29:52,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it does.

1866
02:29:52,712 --> 02:30:00,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, the loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.

1867
02:30:01,596 --> 02:30:03,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.

1868
02:30:03,537 --> 02:30:05,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck.

1869
02:30:05,817 --> 02:30:07,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

1870
02:30:09,778 --> 02:30:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, definitely.

1871
02:30:11,899 --> 02:30:19,581
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii Remote.

1872
02:30:19,721 --> 02:30:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better than it is on the PC.

1873
02:30:22,025 --> 02:30:25,829
[SPEAKER_04]: These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of fun.

1874
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:31,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games as shovelware.

1875
02:30:32,037 --> 02:30:36,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those that don't regularly play games.

1876
02:30:36,882 --> 02:30:38,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows Pressure Lock.

1877
02:30:39,986 --> 02:30:44,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun, and for $20, you can't really beat that price for something like this, too.

1878
02:30:44,413 --> 02:30:45,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a very cheap price.

1879
02:30:46,055 --> 02:30:46,916
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good price.

1880
02:30:47,357 --> 02:30:48,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much for the review, X-Link.

1881
02:30:48,959 --> 02:30:50,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I might just have to pick that up.

1882
02:30:50,662 --> 02:30:53,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?

1883
02:30:56,281 --> 02:30:59,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't believe that guy didn't get in trouble for the hospital bit.

1884
02:30:59,522 --> 02:31:01,303
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think for sure he would get in some kind of trouble.

1885
02:31:01,323 --> 02:31:11,948
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like me going out shooting somebody in cold blood and going, Oh, well, I've seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot somebody for real or GTA.

1886
02:31:11,988 --> 02:31:15,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.

1887
02:31:15,549 --> 02:31:19,371
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.

1888
02:31:21,626 --> 02:31:48,815
[SPEAKER_04]: still though it's a darn good thing no one died darn good thing no one died actually we're going to let you go but have a great week later definitely you too we're going to try to take some more calls here I just want to stress I really hate the new Skype in fact I want to find the old version and download that instead if I can we'll try to do at least one more call here tonight 1-877-GAME-OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

1889
02:31:50,436 --> 02:31:51,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Spazz here.

1890
02:31:52,377 --> 02:31:53,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Spazzinator, what's on your mind?

1891
02:31:54,918 --> 02:31:56,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, a couple things.

1892
02:31:58,939 --> 02:32:06,462
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I had some news about home.

1893
02:32:07,482 --> 02:32:08,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's up?

1894
02:32:08,443 --> 02:32:14,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought I would...

1895
02:32:15,943 --> 02:32:24,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex at home?

1896
02:32:24,408 --> 02:32:25,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the update?

1897
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:28,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not really.

1898
02:32:29,911 --> 02:32:45,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you check the mall weekly or not, but if you go to the furniture store on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there.

1899
02:32:46,677 --> 02:32:49,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, quite literally.

1900
02:32:49,639 --> 02:32:50,919
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got toilets in there now.

1901
02:32:51,479 --> 02:32:53,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, like, you can buy poop?

1902
02:32:55,941 --> 02:33:01,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think you have to supply the poop yourself, but they've got toilets in there now.

1903
02:33:01,904 --> 02:33:03,725
[SPEAKER_09]: We're with two of them.

1904
02:33:03,845 --> 02:33:07,746
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them.

1905
02:33:07,766 --> 02:33:14,049
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a golden toilet, and they're calling it the Golden Throne.

1906
02:33:14,841 --> 02:33:20,165
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're selling it for, oh, damn it, I got the error for price.

1907
02:33:22,446 --> 02:33:23,927
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of expensive.

1908
02:33:24,307 --> 02:33:27,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.

1909
02:33:27,489 --> 02:33:31,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can pay $3 to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.

1910
02:33:31,852 --> 02:33:32,493
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

1911
02:33:33,834 --> 02:33:35,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and they got a second one there.

1912
02:33:35,795 --> 02:33:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a porcelain toy and they're calling it, you know, take a load off the chair and they're charging $0.99 for it.

1913
02:33:44,884 --> 02:33:45,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should buy one of those.

1914
02:33:46,806 --> 02:33:50,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to buy one of those for the Oil Army Clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.

1915
02:33:53,452 --> 02:34:00,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in fact, that's a perfect transition for the second topic.

1916
02:34:00,639 --> 02:34:02,181
[SPEAKER_09]: They mentioned a tweet.

1917
02:34:02,699 --> 02:34:03,760
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1918
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:25,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1919
02:34:51,588 --> 02:35:07,377
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but to other listeners out there, is that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club.

1920
02:35:07,637 --> 02:35:15,861
[SPEAKER_09]: The least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation and use the club that you shell out the money for, you know?

1921
02:35:16,917 --> 02:35:23,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like John Doley one day ever shows up in there and every time I show up there, there's no one there.

1922
02:35:26,104 --> 02:35:30,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of these nights we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something.

1923
02:35:30,747 --> 02:35:35,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have like a Sony home night at 7 o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck dance party.

1924
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know what else you do at home but dance.

1925
02:35:37,972 --> 02:35:39,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully somebody will show up in a hamster outfit.

1926
02:35:39,933 --> 02:35:42,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a dance party in Sony home.

1927
02:35:44,502 --> 02:35:46,543
[SPEAKER_04]: What's great is that Jamie's... Hold on.

1928
02:35:46,723 --> 02:35:48,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.

1929
02:35:49,065 --> 02:35:50,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.

1930
02:35:51,306 --> 02:35:53,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.

1931
02:35:53,108 --> 02:35:53,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the hamster thing.

1932
02:35:53,968 --> 02:35:54,849
It was the whole Sony Home thing.

1933
02:35:55,249 --> 02:35:56,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the whole Sony Home thing.

1934
02:35:56,090 --> 02:35:56,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1935
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:57,731
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry I was passing you.

1936
02:35:57,771 --> 02:35:59,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?

1937
02:35:59,452 --> 02:36:10,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, I did have something... Oh, yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to... You know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.

1938
02:36:10,659 --> 02:36:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1939
02:36:11,059 --> 02:36:11,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

1940
02:36:12,236 --> 02:36:24,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, at least in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software,

1941
02:36:26,722 --> 02:36:34,286
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call I have a slight speech impediment.

1942
02:36:48,072 --> 02:36:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1943
02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:07,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't promise the semen thing is never going to happen.

1944
02:37:07,133 --> 02:37:07,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So just so you know.

1945
02:37:07,753 --> 02:37:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later.

1946
02:37:22,992 --> 02:37:24,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.

1947
02:37:24,693 --> 02:37:28,236
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with Skype tonight.

1948
02:37:28,296 --> 02:37:29,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the callers.

1949
02:37:29,437 --> 02:37:29,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.

1950
02:37:30,238 --> 02:37:30,978
[SPEAKER_04]: The callers are great.

1951
02:37:31,339 --> 02:37:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: The program itself, I'm a little mad at.

1952
02:37:34,081 --> 02:37:35,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.

1953
02:37:36,062 --> 02:37:36,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1954
02:37:36,483 --> 02:37:38,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... I don't know.

1955
02:37:38,504 --> 02:37:40,846
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have that extra... Yeah, we got that extra thing.

1956
02:37:40,866 --> 02:37:42,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's that computer?

1957
02:37:42,127 --> 02:37:44,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still in my room.

1958
02:37:44,909 --> 02:37:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this beast into that thing.

1959
02:37:48,973 --> 02:37:50,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's play Jigsaw Puzzle with the new computer.

1960
02:37:50,674 --> 02:37:51,334
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1961
02:38:23,087 --> 02:38:25,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.

1962
02:38:25,868 --> 02:38:27,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some final stories.

1963
02:38:27,329 --> 02:38:28,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

1964
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot we didn't do those yet.

1965
02:38:30,151 --> 02:38:31,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob did mine for the FU.

1966
02:38:32,012 --> 02:38:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1967
02:38:32,972 --> 02:38:34,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to talk about this movie.

1968
02:38:35,894 --> 02:38:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Silent Hill movie is going to start filming next year.

1969
02:38:40,876 --> 02:38:41,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

1970
02:38:41,857 --> 02:38:42,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't take your story.

1971
02:38:42,657 --> 02:38:48,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And a dude was pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

1972
02:38:49,081 --> 02:38:49,501
[SPEAKER_04]: What dude?

1973
02:38:50,481 --> 02:38:51,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the writer?

1974
02:38:51,582 --> 02:38:52,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I heard about that one.

1975
02:38:52,583 --> 02:38:53,023
[SPEAKER_04]: What a mess.

1976
02:38:53,944 --> 02:38:54,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drive drunk.

1977
02:38:56,846 --> 02:38:57,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, last minute stories.

1978
02:38:58,227 --> 02:39:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3G internet with its next-gen DS system might be something that they're working on.

1979
02:39:09,296 --> 02:39:19,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Iwata is quoted saying that, "...I'm interested because it's a new business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications cost."

1980
02:39:19,844 --> 02:39:21,225
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1981
02:39:44,422 --> 02:39:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty awesome if you could get unlimited 3G internet through a DS or something.

1982
02:39:49,345 --> 02:39:55,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.

1983
02:39:56,949 --> 02:40:07,715
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't embraced online yet, so all the free online thrown into your next-gen console doesn't mean shit to me since...

1984
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't really braced online.

1985
02:40:10,641 --> 02:40:18,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, yeah, WiiWare and DSiWare, but your infrastructure sucks, and your friend's code sucks even more.

1986
02:40:20,128 --> 02:40:20,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1987
02:40:20,888 --> 02:40:29,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment, and I know I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.

1988
02:40:30,275 --> 02:40:31,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Baby and Me.

1989
02:40:32,757 --> 02:40:35,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was completely unaware of this brand new...

1990
02:40:38,525 --> 02:40:39,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they have.

1991
02:40:39,145 --> 02:40:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special edition.

1992
02:40:42,146 --> 02:40:44,846
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.

1993
02:40:45,126 --> 02:40:49,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it has a remote holster for a baby doll.

1994
02:40:49,507 --> 02:40:49,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But!

1995
02:40:50,587 --> 02:40:50,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But!

1996
02:40:51,087 --> 02:40:51,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not all.

1997
02:40:52,168 --> 02:40:57,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition.

1998
02:40:58,309 --> 02:41:00,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does this special edition include?

1999
02:41:01,049 --> 02:41:04,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But a baby doll attachment for your Wii Remote.

2000
02:41:05,330 --> 02:41:05,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2001
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii Remote into that baby.

2002
02:41:15,863 --> 02:41:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2003
02:41:16,903 --> 02:41:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of crazy.

2004
02:41:21,485 --> 02:41:28,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.

2005
02:41:30,916 --> 02:41:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The Return of Alice.

2006
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the next game that he's doing.

2007
02:41:35,803 --> 02:41:38,087
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a nice little teaser trailer online.

2008
02:41:38,888 --> 02:41:40,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks creepy.

2009
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure that's going to come on the PC later on.

2010
02:41:45,646 --> 02:41:47,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Return of Alice, American McGee

2011
02:42:03,562 --> 02:42:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's true, and I think that's kind of it.

2012
02:42:06,045 --> 02:42:11,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the American McGee one, because you'll get your Dark Tim.

2013
02:42:11,231 --> 02:42:18,059
[SPEAKER_02]: But American McGee's gonna be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like, you know, bubblegum dark, you know?

2014
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,202
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, he's like Hot Topic dark, okay?

2015
02:42:20,622 --> 02:42:24,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend for Halloween.

2016
02:42:25,266 --> 02:42:27,048
[SPEAKER_04]: They're my friends that I play Warcraft with now.

2017
02:42:27,548 --> 02:42:29,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And we watched some movies.

2018
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: This was Halloween.

2019
02:42:30,551 --> 02:42:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We watched Showgirls because you have to watch something scary.

2020
02:42:33,133 --> 02:42:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we started... Darling.

2021
02:42:35,595 --> 02:42:37,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I love Showgirls.

2022
02:42:37,536 --> 02:42:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started.

2023
02:42:38,097 --> 02:42:39,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my favorite movies.

2024
02:42:39,458 --> 02:42:40,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad, it's good.

2025
02:42:40,839 --> 02:42:41,680
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to watch that again.

2026
02:42:41,860 --> 02:42:42,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3

2027
02:43:08,878 --> 02:43:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them are good as good as we knew that.

2028
02:43:11,944 --> 02:43:15,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was similar to the remake.

2029
02:43:16,031 --> 02:43:16,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way...

2030
02:43:17,765 --> 02:43:20,587
[SPEAKER_04]: to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie.

2031
02:43:21,647 --> 02:43:26,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.

2032
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.

2033
02:43:29,931 --> 02:43:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've never seen it, and you don't know anything about it, good.

2034
02:43:34,334 --> 02:43:40,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it that way until you watch the movie, because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever.

2035
02:43:41,578 --> 02:43:41,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

2036
02:43:43,348 --> 02:43:44,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?

2037
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:47,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very little quotable movie, too.

2038
02:43:47,273 --> 02:43:48,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad, it's funny.

2039
02:43:49,776 --> 02:43:50,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2040
02:43:50,157 --> 02:43:54,743
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.

2041
02:43:56,072 --> 02:43:56,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous.

2042
02:43:57,173 --> 02:43:59,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.

2043
02:43:59,996 --> 02:44:02,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.

2044
02:44:02,478 --> 02:44:05,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.

2045
02:44:05,541 --> 02:44:05,761
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

2046
02:44:06,142 --> 02:44:18,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's supposed to center around Hope, which was – do you remember there was kind of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?

2047
02:44:18,834 --> 02:44:20,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her.

2048
02:44:21,756 --> 02:44:23,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll one-up you with this.

2049
02:44:23,437 --> 02:44:32,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody because this movie was supposed to be huge was supposed to take place in L.A.

2050
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:33,740
[SPEAKER_04]: or Hollywood.

2051
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:39,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away – OMG, spoilers – they're going to L.A.

2052
02:44:39,162 --> 02:44:42,743
[SPEAKER_04]: because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have been –

2053
02:44:43,163 --> 02:44:44,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they do that?

2054
02:44:44,224 --> 02:44:45,745
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not doing anything.

2055
02:44:45,765 --> 02:44:47,786
[SPEAKER_02]: She hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?

2056
02:44:47,906 --> 02:44:50,148
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she doesn't do anything.

2057
02:44:51,308 --> 02:44:54,030
[SPEAKER_02]: She's unemployed right now.

2058
02:44:54,050 --> 02:44:55,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

2059
02:44:55,611 --> 02:44:56,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2060
02:44:56,151 --> 02:44:57,532
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already seen her breasts.

2061
02:44:57,572 --> 02:44:59,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even that big a deal anymore.

2062
02:44:59,814 --> 02:45:03,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop in chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote there.

2063
02:45:04,277 --> 02:45:05,337
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wants to fuck a penny.

2064
02:45:06,238 --> 02:45:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to fuck a heather or a hope.

2065
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

2066
02:45:11,243 --> 02:45:15,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And he estimates Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.

2067
02:45:15,785 --> 02:45:22,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR live event.

2068
02:45:23,249 --> 02:45:27,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.

2069
02:45:27,151 --> 02:45:29,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Go around and get everybody's... I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?

2070
02:45:29,632 --> 02:45:30,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

2071
02:45:31,053 --> 02:45:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2072
02:45:33,354 --> 02:45:34,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'll start with you.

2073
02:45:34,155 --> 02:45:34,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Your final thought.

2074
02:45:34,895 --> 02:45:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thought is I need to find a steering wheel for my main cabinet.

2075
02:45:39,304 --> 02:45:43,887
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, I really want a taco from Gym Boys, even if Jamie hates it.

2076
02:45:44,528 --> 02:45:45,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?

2077
02:45:49,472 --> 02:45:50,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch The Grudge for Halloween?

2078
02:45:51,833 --> 02:45:52,134
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2079
02:45:53,855 --> 02:46:01,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when you were really into The Ring and those books and all that, or Ringu and all that, this gal at my work dressed up as Samara, and she did a really good job.

2080
02:46:02,161 --> 02:46:03,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such a really good costume.

2081
02:46:03,649 --> 02:46:04,330
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

2082
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:04,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2083
02:46:04,970 --> 02:46:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Just made me think of you because I know you used to really be into that whole series.

2084
02:46:07,952 --> 02:46:09,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still into it.

2085
02:46:09,474 --> 02:46:17,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I need to find my copy of Loop again so I can read it because that was my favorite of those books.

2086
02:46:18,741 --> 02:46:19,001
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2087
02:46:19,281 --> 02:46:23,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next week.

2088
02:46:23,364 --> 02:46:24,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.

2089
02:46:24,785 --> 02:46:25,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, wait.

2090
02:46:25,466 --> 02:46:26,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been challenged.

2091
02:46:26,667 --> 02:46:26,987
[SPEAKER_04]: To what?

2092
02:46:27,908 --> 02:46:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Ionotropic says extended death rattle.

2093
02:46:31,431 --> 02:46:31,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2094
02:46:35,089 --> 02:46:35,630
[SPEAKER_04]: No, knock it off.

2095
02:46:36,171 --> 02:46:36,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, stop.

2096
02:46:37,093 --> 02:46:37,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to unplug.

2097
02:46:37,714 --> 02:46:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is she on the mixing board here?

2098
02:46:40,198 --> 02:46:40,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

2099
02:46:41,180 --> 02:46:42,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get my thing.

2100
02:46:42,382 --> 02:46:43,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you can death rattle us out.

2101
02:46:44,646 --> 02:46:45,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's annoying.

2102
02:46:45,888 --> 02:46:46,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

2103
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2104
02:46:49,144 --> 02:46:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2105
02:46:51,185 --> 02:47:01,329
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game company behind us.

2106
02:47:01,389 --> 02:47:04,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.

2107
02:47:05,091 --> 02:47:05,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2108
02:47:06,071 --> 02:47:07,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, X-Link said it again.

2109
02:47:07,592 --> 02:47:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the things that come out of that are filthy.

2110
02:47:09,673 --> 02:47:12,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So until then, have a great week.

2111
02:47:12,774 --> 02:47:14,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2112
02:47:16,769 --> 02:47:19,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, her noise made the dolls fall over.

2113
02:47:19,632 --> 02:47:20,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Halloween!

2114
02:47:21,133 --> 02:47:23,756
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2115
02:47:24,256 --> 02:47:27,479
