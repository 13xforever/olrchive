00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,820
Tonight, November 1, 2009, developers claim there is rampant piracy on the iPhone, a fourth

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,220
version of the DS is on the way, and could you really win free steak from playing a video

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,220
game?

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Radio.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,320
We are that video game show dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,520
and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me for the next few hours with my lovely co-host, Dark

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,640
Sakura Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Hi.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
How are you Jamie?

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm the voiceless wonder.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,680
Yes, for those not aware from last week, because the podcast is a little bit behind right now,

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,360
Dark Sakura is a little bit sickly with sinus infection, right?

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm getting over sinus infection and also, what the hell?

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,360
I know, I hear video gaming noises coming out of the front row.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,080
Oh, yeah, it's Dan's playing GTA, whatever, and I also sprained my ankle last night.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Dope.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
It has not been a lucky day.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
Well, I hope you had a good Halloween nonetheless.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Yeah, it was cookies.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
Yay, cookies.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
And now you're here.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,080
So hopefully, remember, the last time you were feeling like shit was the night the President

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,040
Cat thing happened, huge.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
So you never know.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,560
It might be a good night.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,320
Yeah, that was, oh, you were in a bad mood before that show started.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,840
No, I was, I was, I had a bad headache.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,160
Yeah, but see, President Cat made it all better.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Yeah.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
All right.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Hello.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
How you doing, Loki?

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Doing good.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Good to hear it.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
How was your Halloween?

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,280
Yeah, I was going home and passed out candy to children coming to our door, mostly older

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
kids that really shouldn't be trick or treating.

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,000
I mean, like, people that look like they were 16 to 19, you know, it's like, dude, seriously?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,120
And you tell them, take one, they take one handful.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,320
It's like, where's this country coming to?

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm making a sign to put up on the door next year, and I'll be happy to share it with everybody.

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:26,160
This is, if you're 12 and up, no costume, no candy, get the hell off my lawn.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Nice.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,640
Well, it sounds like, it sounds like you actually got people at your door.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,680
Like I know there's a lot of people, just based on what I was reading on Facebook and

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,440
live journals and so forth, didn't get a damn kid at their door.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
You know, it's like less and less that kids go out trick or treating anymore.

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,780
And I guess it's a safety thing, and I don't know, like, I even know when I was growing

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,200
up that, you know, we would have to dump out all the candy on the floor.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,880
And before we were allowed to eat it, we had to sift through it to make sure there were

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
no needles in it.

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,040
Of course, we just dumped all the candy on the floor, but nevermind.

56
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,800
I think that I want to make chocolate molds that look like razor blades.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You're sick.

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
But funny.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I know.

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I am very...

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Because, really, who puts razor blades in chocolate anyway?

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm very sad that I didn't get to go to the Silent Hill Haunted House, which I know we

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,000
were talking about at length on the show previously.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,560
You probably wouldn't be sad if you actually went to...

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,160
Well, I mean, I'm just saying that the Haunted House is probably crap.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,080
Well, I got a phone call from my good pal Melody, who, you know, Mel and Mel, we've

67
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,160
talked about before on the show, and Mel used to come on the show in the old days.

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,760
They went to the Haunted House, and I got a call from Melody that was like, okay, if

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
this thing is back...

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,800
I would play the voicemail on air if I could, if I could figure out how to wire up my iPhone,

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
but she wouldn't care.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,320
But she basically said, okay, Rob, if this thing comes back next year, I will pay for

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,120
you to go and go through this Haunted House just to see your reaction.

74
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Because if Mel almost crapped himself, I can't wait to see what your reaction is.

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,060
I'm kind of abridging what she said there, but that's essentially what she said.

76
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,640
So apparently, it was pretty scary.

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
So and...

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
YouTube.

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,280
I bet there are clips on YouTube.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,080
You should check that out, Dark Soccer, see if you can find some clips of the Haunted

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,560
House on YouTube.

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,760
And maybe if the YouTube makes me scream like a little girl, I can only imagine what the

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,320
real Haunted House would do.

84
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
So...

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,500
Anyhow, we also are always joined by our chat room, chat.orangelaundrator.com.

86
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,960
If you're listening live for the first time or what have you, please join our chat room.

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
And we have a comment from Tiger Claw.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
I was a kid.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,800
I used to be into Halloween, but as I got older, I started questioning the legitimacy

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
of the holiday.

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
And I try...

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,060
You know, personally, I try not to look into Halloween too much as to like, I realize it

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,880
has various meanings for various people and whatever you believe in, but I'm just like,

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
it's just kind of a...

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Well, A, it's a great day to people watch.

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Like, I can think of no better day to people watch than Halloween.

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,680
But you know, it's just a day to be silly and have fun.

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,720
You know, wear a costume, have fun.

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,840
What are they letting these like pre-teens dress up in is what I want to know.

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,480
It's like, whoa, hey, what, did you decide to go with slut?

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,280
I mean, it's just...

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
It's ridiculous.

103
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Well, also, I don't know.

104
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,720
I don't know how you'll feel about this comment, but I kind of think like it's a way that you

105
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,560
can actually do cosplay like legitimately out in the street and not get called a fag.

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
Like that's kind of what Halloween is, right?

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,000
My last year of living in Alabama when I worked in the mall, my outfit was Sailor Venus.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,960
Awesome.

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
Last night I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show because of course that is like the holy

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,480
holiday for Rocky Horror.

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,600
I wore a Snuggie as my costume and it was actually very well received.

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,560
So that's all I wore, was a Snuggie.

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,480
I wore a Snuggie and no pants and I got cheers from ladies in the front couple rows.

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
It was great.

115
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Awesome.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah, I had a good time.

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Anyhow.

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,140
Oh, did you find some YouTubes?

119
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,280
That's also probably one of the only times you can wear a Snuggie without being called

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,200
a fag as well.

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
This is true.

122
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,880
In fact, the day I bought the Snuggie, I actually like came home from Target and I actually

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
showed my roommate.

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,200
And by the way, of course, both my roommate and I are gay, but I happened to show the

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,120
Snuggie to my roommate and I'm like, look, look what I got, look what I got.

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
He's like, you fag.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,760
No, he didn't really say that, but that was like his reaction pretty much.

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,400
So anyhow, also we do have some of the clips of the haunted house on YouTube it looks like.

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,240
So you find the good stuff.

130
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,160
I can't, I can't sit here and watch the whole thing and try to do the radio show.

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
You should find the camera's too shaky.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,240
See if there's a motion sick, see if there's a scary pyramid head or something.

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
If you manage to make it that far in.

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
All right.

135
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,080
Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with How Was Your Gaming Week?

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,320
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

137
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,720
And Dark Sakura, I know you're trying to watch the movie there, but real quickly, did you

138
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,360
play anything this week you want to share?

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,080
I played Loom and then I remembered how long it was and I stopped playing and I downloaded

140
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,640
Team Fortress 2 for three bucks.

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,800
I guess a lot of people got in on that sale.

142
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,560
Too bad I was out of town.

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,120
I was mad.

144
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:12,720
And I actually didn't play any Sims and I watched Dan play some of the Palette of Gay

145
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Tony.

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,480
It was interesting.

147
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,360
I still have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto IV sitting at home.

148
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
How depressing is that?

149
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
You dork.

150
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,960
I know.

151
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Only one of the best games to come out in the past couple years and I just kind of like,

152
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
eh, I'm too busy playing WoW.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, oh, oh.

154
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Yes?

155
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,840
Um, I actually played some Rock Band last night.

156
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
Good times.

157
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
I miss Rock Band.

158
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,960
It's the one thing I miss from my 360 getting broken, which I will get fixed by the end

159
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
of the year.

160
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Promise.

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,440
Because I can't have a New Year's party and not have Rock Band.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
So.

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Uh, Loki.

164
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I can bring over my Rock Band.

165
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
No, don't encourage me because then I'll be like, oh, I don't need to pay, I don't need

166
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
to get mine fixed.

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Loki will bring Rock Band.

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
He's an enabler.

169
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
All right, yes, you're an enabler.

170
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Well, Loki, the enabler.

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
How was your gaming week?

172
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,520
Speaking of which, I was actually, um, well, it looks neat.

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,060
I mean, cause it's more than just like a little haunted house, it's actually like a haunted

174
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,800
set or something.

175
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, they're getting scared.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
I heard the guy say, oh shit, he must be scared.

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,720
That was like a giant dong on the screen right now.

178
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
What is that?

179
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Oh, it's, I think it's a fan.

180
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,960
This is terrible radio where we're commenting on a YouTube.

181
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
I think he fell.

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh, whatever.

183
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Yeah, this is crap.

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,320
If, if Jamie finds Pyramid Head, then get our attention.

185
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Otherwise, Loki, how was your gaming week?

186
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,040
All right, so I picked up Lego Rock Band for the intent to, of course, import it into Rock

187
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,000
Band 2.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,520
The track list is pretty cool on it.

189
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,160
I like a lot of stuff that's in there, so it's gonna be fun to actually be able to put

190
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,920
it all into Rock Band 2.

191
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,960
And then the game itself, of course, you know, is pretty much just Rock Band 2 with, you

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,760
know, Lego stuff running around and the story modes kind of need to have little cut scenes

193
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,280
and stuff that you expect from like another Lego Telltale game.

194
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,080
I don't know, it's just pretty much what you expect.

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,640
But the track list is awesome, so I'd say pick it up for that reason only.

196
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,840
Then, of course, you know, because this week we had the Ballad of the Gay Tony come out,

197
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,600
of course I picked up Episodes of Delivery City.

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,880
And the game's pretty sweet.

199
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,720
I like a lot of the stuff they added in there that's really over the top.

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,360
The new weapons are pretty nice.

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,480
But Rockstar has this thing that they like to do where they take something that was working

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,120
absolutely perfectly and then they go and fuck it up.

203
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,800
They did this with, you know, Lost and Dan where they took out the helicopters in free

204
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
mode.

205
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,280
Well, they decided, hey, you know what, multiplayer's kind of fun, let's go ahead and fuck with

206
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
that some more.

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
So what did they do?

208
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,320
They went ahead and they took all the multiplayer maps, which used to be pretty wide open.

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,480
I mean, you'd get to pick different parts of the island, you can drive around, I mean,

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
it's really overworld.

211
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,120
It's kind of what, you know, Grand Theft Auto's known for.

212
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,760
And then they decided, you know what, instead of being able to do all that and having it

213
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,120
where you can spawn, you know, say, in certain portions of the islands or just, you know,

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,040
big open areas, we're just going to find you down to really small little kind of sections

215
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,700
of the map that weapons will spawn now.

216
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,480
So they really shrunk down all the kind of arenas that you would normally have your death

217
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
matches in.

218
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Which, it's great if they wanted to add that in if you were looking for, you know, some

219
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
tighter places to play at.

220
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,980
But give the option to the buyer, to the consumer, instead of just replacing all the perfectly

221
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,720
good spots with these really small areas.

222
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,440
Now we've gotten, like, one area that we're kind of used to now that's at the bottom of

223
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,360
the map and, like, construction area, but it still pisses me off, though, because that

224
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,400
was one of the things we were really looking forward to is driving around, you know, in

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,760
the new APC, you know, possibly using new helicopters in Deathmatch, you know, parachutes,

226
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
all that fun stuff.

227
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,900
But you can't because you're stuck in these really small little confined areas instead.

228
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,280
And that's really the only downside I see to the whole Lost in Dam- or not Lost in Dam,

229
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,920
the Ballad of Gay Tony, is that they really fucked up, you know, Deathmatch for that stuff.

230
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,020
But hey, if you like more confined area and you don't really want to use vehicles because

231
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,000
you sure as hell can't in these sections of the map, it'd be really hard to get a vehicle

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,360
in there, then that's going to be something that you'll look forward to.

233
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,680
But you know, personally for me, I like more of the open world stuff, I like driving around,

234
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,320
shooting people from cars, and that kind of stuff, but you can't really do that with this

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,540
new expansion.

236
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,680
So if you are looking for better multiplayer experience, go Lost in Dam, they're the original

237
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
game.

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Other than that though, it's pretty sweet, all the new weapons are awesome, they even

239
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,460
add some new cheat codes in there that, you know, explosive sniper rounds and also a super

240
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,080
punch which kind of, you know, goes back to the older Grand Theft Auto game.

241
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Falcon Punch?

242
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,580
Something like that.

243
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,060
But it's great with the super punch that you can kick people in the nuts and they kind

244
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,380
of fly into the air, so that's pretty sweet.

245
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,020
And then yes, people have already started modding the game and stuff, and hopefully

246
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,760
if I know, or if I figure it out, I will fix multiplayer so that I can actually, you know,

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
spawn where I want to and whatnot.

248
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
But it's a lot of work, and right now we're just kind of making do.

249
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,520
But seriously, why do they have to go and fuck that shit over?

250
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
They always do this.

251
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,120
They don't fix the stuff that needs to be fixed, and then they fix stuff that doesn't

252
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
need to be fixed.

253
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,920
So that's it, that's, oh and DJ Hero, I played a little DJ Hero this week.

254
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,400
Now, Tigerclaw points out in chat, the Ballad of Gay Tony does have a sex scene though,

255
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
lol.

256
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Is that, and that's from chat.orangetonstrator.com if you're just joining us tonight.

257
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,260
Join us in our chat room.

258
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,720
Is there controversial something something going on in the new expansion, or are we just

259
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
all desensitized to it now?

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,880
No, I think, I don't think it's anything new.

261
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,920
I mean, it's a way I think he's talking about, there's, you can, if you dance well enough

262
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,360
I guess in the bar or whatever, if you pick up people, you can go and have sex with them

263
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
in the bathroom.

264
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,400
It doesn't show anything.

265
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,300
Just like real life, amazing.

266
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Just like real life, yes.

267
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Only if you're a politician.

268
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
It doesn't really show anything.

269
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,980
It's just as censored as, say, the original game.

270
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,960
It's not going to show any sort of nudity at all, but it's just something funny.

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,860
And the dance minigame is actually kind of fun.

272
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,500
You can do the bus stop or something like that in there, which is interesting.

273
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,740
That kind of sounds like the SingStar Club in PS3 Home, only without the sex, but I think

274
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,120
if they brought the sex to Sony Home, a lot more people would be playing it.

275
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,560
Just saying.

276
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

277
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,640
Just downloading lots of ROMs for my main cabinet.

278
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Yeah, I don't know if you should be happily proud of that here on the show.

279
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
No, I'm just kidding.

280
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,440
They're all like 30 years old.

281
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,360
How the hell am I supposed to get ROMs onto my main cabinet then?

282
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I don't know.

283
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
All right.

284
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm not going to go buy them.

285
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
I mean, come on.

286
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
Although you were trying to tell me to buy a cabinet earlier this week.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's burger time.

289
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I know.

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
It's a burger time cabinet, but I don't like it when there's no price on it.

291
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
It makes it very...

292
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I guess I could always go check it out.

293
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Well, you just ask them to see how much you want for it, or you offer them like, okay,

294
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,960
I'll give you two hundred for it, and they can just say...

295
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
And they laugh at my face.

296
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Well, then whatever.

297
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
It's the internet.

298
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,080
They're not really going to laugh at your face.

299
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
It's just the internet.

300
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,400
I'll use a fake email.

301
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,600
My gaming week, pretty much, I was out of town most of the weekend, so I didn't get

302
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,600
a lot of time to play a whole lot of new stuff, although my Paladin did hit level 60 in World

303
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
of Warcraft.

304
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Thank you very much.

305
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
This is the character I rolled the first week of September.

306
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,660
So I got to 60 in two months, so thank you to the Quest Helper add-on, which really made

307
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,640
me blaze through the quest very quickly, and so forth.

308
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,120
One new game I did play this week, though, outside of World of Warcraft, DJ Hero.

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
I finally got my hands on this game.

310
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Obviously, Loki's brought it to the show the past couple of times.

311
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
You've gotten to hear the game through his experience.

312
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,760
I did not put my hands on this game, really, until this week when I bought the game.

313
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,280
I chose to pick up the PlayStation 3 version of the game.

314
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,520
So I bought the game, and I love it.

315
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,120
The number one thing I can say about it is that it truly feels refreshing.

316
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,440
I think the problem I'm starting to have with a lot of these rock band and guitar hero and

317
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,800
the knock-offs, like Rock Revolution and so forth, is that the whole guitar drum thing

318
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,920
is starting to feel a little stale.

319
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,960
Granted, there are some bright lights within that whole genre.

320
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,520
For instance, the Beatles rock band was something truly special to that particular genre, I

321
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,200
guess if you want to just call the Beatles a genre, which they kind of are.

322
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
And some of these other little highlights.

323
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,320
But I think DJ Hero really feels refreshing.

324
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,280
And a big part of what makes DJ Hero feel refreshing is the song list.

325
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,520
I mean, really, to take the idea of mash-ups and making a game out of it is really cool.

326
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,800
Because every time I play a song, I feel like, wow, this really isn't something I've heard

327
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,040
before.

328
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,280
And that's a feeling I haven't had since the days I was really hardcore into the Japanese

329
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,020
music games, like Beatmania 2DX.

330
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,960
Speaking of Beatmania, this game has zero in common with Beatmania.

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,240
So if anyone is telling you that DJ Hero is a rip-off of Beatmania, you look them in the

332
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,720
eye and you tell them, you're a fucking fool, or a sheep or something.

333
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,420
Because really, if you actually play DJ Hero, the games play nothing like Beatmania.

334
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,440
The games both have falling notes.

335
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,520
But it's like comparing apples to oranges.

336
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Sure, they're both fruit.

337
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
But you know what?

338
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
They're completely different tastes.

339
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,800
And for that reason, there's going to be some people that don't care for DJ Hero who might

340
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,440
be really into Beatmania 2DX and vice versa.

341
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,800
And if you're into 2DX, then that's when you go and buy Scratch, or whenever the hell that

342
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
comes out.

343
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,040
Well, even then, though, that's a completely different genre of music.

344
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,600
And as we were kind of talking about a little bit with Bobby on the tease call tonight,

345
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,720
because Bobby is right before us here on the lovely All Games Radio, where we do our show

346
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,480
every week, he was kind of talking about, you know, I'm not so interested in DJ Hero

347
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,800
because I didn't really care for the song list.

348
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
There's not a lot of...

349
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,980
I'm not really feeling the mashup thing.

350
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
You know what?

351
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,680
The song list is a really important part of a music game.

352
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
If you're not going to...

353
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,640
Like, for instance, I don't think I would ever be interested in buying Karaoke Revolution

354
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,920
Country unless the song list was suddenly all Dolly Parton songs, okay?

355
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,960
It's just not a genre of music that I'm particularly interested in, you know, spending that kind

356
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
of money.

357
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,960
You know, obviously, the music taste is the number one thing.

358
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,800
So for that reason, although I think Scratch and Beatmania are going to play a lot more

359
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,400
closely similar than Beatmania and DJ Hero do, I don't think they're going to attract

360
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,900
the same audience at all.

361
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,080
The funny thing is, I think Scratch is going to benefit a lot from DJ Hero because there

362
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,720
is quite a bit of hip-hop influence in DJ Hero.

363
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
But you know what?

364
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm not a huge fan of a lot of artists in DJ Hero.

365
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
I don't really care for Jay-Z.

366
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
I can't stand Eminem.

367
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,240
I think he's the biggest, like, overexposed artist I can think of in the past, like, 50

368
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
years.

369
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Cool.

370
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
I just...

371
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I don't like him.

372
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't like his personality.

373
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I don't like his songs.

374
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
I hate him.

375
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,120
But I don't mind him so much in this game because the way they've kind of constructed

376
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
the songs together are actually kind of cool.

377
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah, some of them are not bad.

378
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,480
Like, that whole My Name Is and Loser thing together was actually kind of funny, like,

379
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,520
and I dug it.

380
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,880
And it didn't really feel like an Eminem song to me.

381
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,480
It felt like this whole new, different song I never really heard before.

382
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
And I'll tell you, some of those mashups are just genius.

383
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,360
Like, the whole, like, the Jacksons and Semi-Charm Life by Third Eye Blind, I frickin' love that

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
song.

385
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,040
And I gotta say, I know Jamie's gonna talk about the download packs later in the show,

386
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,960
but one of the download pack songs that involves a Queen song is, like, my favorite song in

387
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
the game right now.

388
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,920
And it gets stuck in my head during the day, like, the little back and forth.

389
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,600
So, you know, I haven't had songs from a music game really stuck in my head in a very long

390
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
time.

391
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,880
And I was really surprised at all the stuff you do in it.

392
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
You have the three buttons.

393
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
You have the scratching.

394
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
You have certain direction scratching.

395
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,800
You have cross-fading.

396
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,220
You have the euphoria button.

397
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,400
You have the sampling that you change with the little knob.

398
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,960
You use the knob to change the effects and increase your multiplier.

399
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,280
Like, it's kind of a lot to handle.

400
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,360
Of course, granted, I jumped right in and started playing in hard mode after, you know,

401
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
acing the tutorial, but dammit, I'm having fun.

402
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Now, is the game perfect?

403
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
No.

404
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,920
The core game itself is a heck of a lot of fun.

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,720
But the shell around that core game is, like, not even there.

406
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,180
Like the icing on the cake, not there.

407
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,640
This is like an angel food cake.

408
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
It's good.

409
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
It's yummy.

410
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,160
But it's not, it doesn't have, like, that frosting that makes it extra awesome.

411
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,200
And what I mean is, there's really no, like, you know, Rock Band's kind of cool and even

412
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,420
Guitar Hero is really cool because it talks about, like, hey, we're going to turn it up

413
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,840
to 11, or like in the later Guitar Hero games, there was kind of like a little story that

414
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
all the stages were set around.

415
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,440
And although it was a little doofy and silly, it still kind of gave, like, a point to the

416
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,640
game, something to tie everything together.

417
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,420
DJ Hero doesn't really have that.

418
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,720
It's just turn it on, play the tutorial, and play.

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,700
And the game never really walks you through the menus.

420
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,740
You don't really know, like, am I supposed to play these custom set lists, or can I just

421
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,200
do my own thing?

422
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,080
And I can't really do my own thing anyway.

423
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,480
I have to set it up as a set list if I want to play just one song.

424
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,520
It's a little weird.

425
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,240
It doesn't ruin the game by any means.

426
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,800
It's just a little odd.

427
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,760
The interface is strange.

428
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,800
I don't like that the leaderboards are in, like, the menu.

429
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,240
I have to be honest, I feel like the game was rushed in that regard.

430
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,280
Like, they probably took a long time building the shell of the game, you know, the main

431
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,140
game itself, and the song list, and making that all perfect, and they did a kickass job.

432
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,960
But the rest of it feels just kind of, like, tacked on, like everything that kind of streams

433
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
it all together.

434
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,120
So, for that reason, I can't say it's a perfect game.

435
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,380
Oh, and online is just kind of there.

436
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,100
You know, there's really nothing to it.

437
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,680
You and somebody else play the song at the same time, whichever one of you gets the high

438
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
score wins.

439
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Whoopee!

440
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,520
You know, there's no real, like, special modifiers, or you can't even use rewind in online mode,

441
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
which makes sense.

442
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,680
There's a lot of stuff that just kind of could be there that's not.

443
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,320
But is this a real kickass first entry in a future franchise?

444
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,040
Yes, yes, yes.

445
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
It's a great first game.

446
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,660
You know, the first Guitar Hero game was kind of like that, too, where there wasn't really

447
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,640
a lot of glue holding it together.

448
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,160
I think there was more there in that first Guitar Hero game than there is in DJ Hero.

449
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,080
But bottom line, it's really nice to play a game that's refreshing.

450
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,320
And that's how I feel about DJ Hero.

451
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,600
It's a really refreshing, new kind of music game.

452
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,880
Tigerclaw says, so there's no battle of the DJs mode?

453
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Not really.

454
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,120
I guess that's what you call online mode, but it's you and a friend, or an enemy I guess

455
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,760
you say, frenemy, play the song at the same time, and whoever gets the higher score wins.

456
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,120
I did go online and try a match and play the song and whoop some guy, thank you very much.

457
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,540
In fact, it's kind of funny.

458
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,880
I guess most people are picking this up on 360 or just not playing it online on PS3,

459
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,240
or I really am better than I give myself credit for, because I'm in like the top 100 on a

460
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,480
bunch of songs right now.

461
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,160
Of course the game just came out last week, I'm sure that won't last, but I got a kick

462
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,640
out of it, a couple chuckles for a little while.

463
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm trying to look at some more chat comments, chat.orangelaunchmedia.com.

464
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,560
Vanice Luxe, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct, says, I'll get DJ Hero when

465
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
they're clearancing it to make room for DJ Hero 2.

466
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:42,840
And he or she brings up a good point that DJ Hero is a big investment, it's a $120 investment.

467
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:50,360
So, you know, try this out at the store, try this out at a friend's house, don't drop $120

468
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,880
on a game just because I said to, check it out first, because the game's not for everyone.

469
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,480
You know, the scratching and all that stuff kind of puts some people off.

470
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,960
I have a lot of fun with it, I think Loki feels very similar to how I reviewed the game,

471
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know if Jamie's really played it or how she feels, I know she likes the songs

472
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,280
at least, from what she said on a previous show, but, you know, again, it's $120 is a

473
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,240
big investment, until, of course, it starts hitting the bargain basement bin, which it

474
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,080
will, but, not, yeah, I mean, as the chatter said there, not for about a year.

475
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
So.

476
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,320
Let's see, anything else I might have missed about DJ Hero, Loki?

477
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I know you reviewed a couple weeks ago.

478
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,680
No, I think that's about it.

479
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,520
Tigercolonchat says, I can totally see download content of a different genre of dance music

480
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,680
for DJ Hero, imagine if they released a trance pack.

481
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,120
You know what's funny, one of the stages is a very rave-y kind of stage, so I was kind

482
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,600
of surprised that the song list felt a little more hip-hop influenced, but it wouldn't,

483
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,160
there, there's a huge variety of types of songs in the song list.

484
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I like the, um, Yo-Yo Girl.

485
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,240
I mean, there's tons and tons of different types of songs, and the mashups is a whole

486
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,680
new genre altogether.

487
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:07,760
You know, you have everything from Queen, to Gwen Stefani, to Third Eye Blind, to Jay-Z,

488
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,800
to Paula Abdul, but the interesting thing about it is that they do use a lot of songs

489
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,280
a lot, and that is one place the song list could improve, is that did I really need four

490
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,120
different mixes of Hollaback Girl, but when you have like 93 songs to choose from, it's,

491
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,600
you know, it doesn't really bother me at all.

492
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,480
And the first two download songs, you do get them free if you have the Gamestop code, and

493
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
they're both great.

494
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,000
So, but we'll talk more about that later in the show.

495
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,360
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some housekeeping now that we're all done with our gaming week.

496
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,460
Real quickly, I'm actually going to start kind of with a gaming story.

497
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,320
This was passed along to me from one of our chatters, AlphaKananagram, and it's running

498
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,680
on a story called ConsoleWars.de, so this is even coming out of another country, but

499
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,160
I had to say this because the article is called, We's Worst Game Ever Sells 100 Copies.

500
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,800
The Wii's curious lack of quality software is being highlighted by the release of the

501
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,880
worst selling Wii title ever, Sukiban Satchourena Wii, a game centered on the managerial leadership

502
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,180
of a talking female cat, Rina.

503
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,300
It's been a week since its release, and it sold a total of 100 copies, then they linked

504
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,800
to a couple of YouTubes.

505
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,720
Sadly, with all this publicity, including a TV feature and a thread being featured on

506
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,240
Itai News, there is now a danger of people actually buying the game out of morbid curiosity,

507
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,880
creating a perverse incentive for developers of other spectacularly poor titles.

508
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
Fuck you.

509
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,220
Even Nintendo's CEO himself admits the console is having trouble securing a compelling lineup,

510
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:51,040
and with such dismal titles as this and certain previous debuggles, some might wonder if perhaps

511
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,280
some kind of quality seal system might be useful.

512
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,960
Now obviously this is coming from a, I can't believe I'm going to say this because I got

513
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,840
so mad about this before, but this news is coming from a no-name site that doesn't even

514
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
cite what source they're using.

515
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
You know what's funny?

516
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,880
I bet it's 100 copies imported to the US.

517
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,680
It's probably more like it.

518
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,040
Yeah, 1% of their sales.

519
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,600
I would hardly believe that the game has sold only 100 copies in Japan when their Twitter

520
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,920
has 200 some odd followers alone.

521
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,800
I mean, really?

522
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Like give me a source of some sort, please.

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,600
I think they also published something that says it has sold more.

524
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah, so I don't know how I feel about that, but that was linked by a chatter, and if in

525
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,140
case any of you other folks out there on the internet happen to read no-name sites from

526
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,040
foreign countries such as that one, you can address those cards and letters to mailbagorangeorangereader.com.

527
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,040
I just wanted to let you know, please source or GTFO.

528
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,120
So there you go.

529
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,520
And Loki, you're going on to VG charts right now to see if you can prove that wrong, right?

530
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Of course.

531
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Of course you are.

532
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,120
I don't know if they'll actually have, you know, it just came out.

533
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,400
I can't imagine they would have the sales figures already.

534
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Well, they're pretty quick.

535
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:13,200
Of course, this is loading very slowly, and I don't even know if this is on here.

536
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I don't know.

537
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,960
Part of me wants to tweet the developers and say there's a dirty rumor that the game only

538
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,260
sold 100 copies.

539
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Please deny.

540
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,880
Okay, well, let me put it this way.

541
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,440
It would definitely sell more than 100 copies here in the US.

542
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,760
Easy, easy, easy.

543
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
I know.

544
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I know.

545
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
It's just, I don't know.

546
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,520
There's part of me that's just kind of like, somebody just wants to, just wants to kick

547
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,320
President Cat while they're down.

548
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
This site is like the Glenn Best of gaming.

549
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
I'll ask them on Twitter.

550
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
What?

551
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
I'll ask them on Twitter.

552
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Yeah, ask them on Twitter.

553
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
All right.

554
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
I know.

555
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I agree with Gamer Girl in chat.

556
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,080
How can you not like Pres Cat?

557
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,160
Game Guru says, quality seal, dude, the Nintendo seal of quality only stated that the game

558
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,600
worked on the system.

559
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
True enough.

560
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,480
Game Guru says, if Superman 64 could get the Nintendo seal of quality, any game could.

561
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,160
And dude, just from looking at the YouTubes on the internet, granted, I haven't played

562
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,280
the game, but going on Loki's Word and the YouTubes I've seen on the internet of the

563
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,120
game, there are far worse games on the Nintendo Wii than this.

564
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,840
They don't have any sort of anything.

565
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,320
There's no sales figures yet.

566
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,200
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room, chat.orangeonstrader.com says, it was former

567
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,560
President Dog spreading the rumors.

568
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
I bet.

569
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,360
I'm President Dog.

570
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Prime Minister Dog.

571
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
All right.

572
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,520
Let's move on.

573
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,040
Let's move on, actually get to some real gaming stories.

574
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,920
I will say really quickly, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you're mean and

575
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
you're a douche.

576
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
No, I'm just kidding.

577
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I understand.

578
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,360
You can also follow us on Facebook.

579
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,560
We have a club there, the OL Army and all that fun stuff.

580
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Awesome.

581
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Yes, DarkSakura.

582
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,280
I just finished the most amazing French toast.

583
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Congratulations.

584
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,600
Where was your French toast from?

585
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,700
It was from Sam's Kosher Style Deli.

586
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,320
Will it give you a magic voice back?

587
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,600
Will it give you your voice back?

588
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,960
Well, the only reason I have some voice right now is I just drank some Diet Pepsi because

589
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,040
remember I officially condone Diet Pepsi and think Diet Coke tastes like poop.

590
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,880
Would you like one?

591
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,320
Actually, I would love that.

592
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm a little hot in here.

593
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,240
I know you're trying to keep the temperature hot because you're diseased, but...

594
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
My disease.

595
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Thank you.

596
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
No.

597
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Your affliction.

598
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
No.

599
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,680
As I was telling you earlier, the reason why I've been keeping it warm and actually I wear

600
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,040
a scarf to work is because whenever it gets cold, my voice goes even more and I start

601
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,840
coughing.

602
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,120
The warm is keeping the mucus flowing.

603
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,440
Well, certainly a lot of our listeners in chat are noticing the coughing and sending

604
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,840
well wishes your way tonight.

605
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,600
Also, for the record though, it makes it a lot easier for me to do this.

606
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,480
Oh, stop it.

607
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
All right.

608
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
Anyhow, let's move on with some gaming news.

609
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Loki, start us off if you would tonight.

610
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:14,240
Netflix has announced that they're going to be offering a solution to stream their service

611
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
to the PS3.

612
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,840
Of course, it's not going to be some sort of integrated solution like it is on the Xbox

613
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,720
360, but for the meantime, it's going to be via a disc that you can actually order from

614
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:31,920
Netflix and basically using this disc, it'll launch a program that'll allow you to stream

615
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,360
content much like you would through the Xbox Live Marketplace.

616
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,700
They said that they are working on a new integrated version of it, however, for whatever reason,

617
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,840
the solution's not expected to arrive until late 2010, whether that may be because they're

618
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,760
under contract with, say, the Xbox 360, Microsoft and whatnot, probably has something to do

619
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,600
with that.

620
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,120
That's kind of neat though that they're finally allowing people to do that.

621
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:12,680
I know it's something that they've been remembering for a while now with a lot of the surveys,

622
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
stuff like that.

623
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,960
It's possible to come into the Wii at some point.

624
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,800
It's neat.

625
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,240
Would you use this now since your 360's out of commission?

626
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Definitely.

627
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,760
I was kind of excited to hear this news.

628
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,520
My 360 will be replaced slash fixed by the time this thing comes out, but I'm going to

629
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
be honest.

630
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
I've just been super lazy in getting my 360 fixed.

631
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,640
My gaming need has been satiated by World of Warcraft and the stuff I've been playing

632
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,000
on my PS3, so I haven't felt that urgency to get my 360 fixed.

633
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,480
This certainly doesn't get me in any rush, but what I find fascinating about this is

634
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,040
that just last week on the show, I was talking about... In fact, I think this news broke

635
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,400
while we were live last week.

636
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,220
We just didn't catch it, but I was just talking about, like, hey, if Microsoft wants to compete

637
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,400
with Sony, because what's Sony's big thing right now?

638
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,480
It does everything.

639
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,560
To be fair, that is kind of what I always admired about the PSP, and to some extent,

640
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
the PS3.

641
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,080
It does a lot of stuff very well, but Microsoft's got a pretty awesome online system, which

642
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,120
includes streaming movies and streaming Netflix, and streaming Netflix could kind of compete

643
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,680
with Blu-ray in a way.

644
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Oops.

645
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
Now the PS3 has Netflix too.

646
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,280
Yeah, but you have to order it, and mainly they were saying, like I said before, one

647
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,440
of the reasons behind maybe being limited to only a Blu-ray disc is a way to get around

648
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,480
a clause that they had for their contract with Microsoft, saying that basically this

649
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,520
cannot appear on another system's dashboard for a certain amount of time or something

650
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
like that.

651
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
So it's not appearing on a dashboard.

652
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
It's actually a program now that someone else is running.

653
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,360
So it's kind of a loophole, if you will.

654
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
I don't know.

655
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
What do you think this means for the whole console wars?

656
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you think this is going to cause the PS3 to gain any ground, or is it just...

657
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,600
No, I don't think it means anything.

658
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,920
Just kind of incentive for folks who have a PS3 to not get a 360.

659
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,680
It's just it's good for Netflix.

660
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,920
That's basically it, because I think it's not going to sell any systems.

661
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,880
I don't really think it's a really big point.

662
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,560
It'd be hard for them to kind of advertise it, I guess, as a feature of the system, seeing

663
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,680
as you have to order it, that'd be like, this system plays Uncharted 2 or something like

664
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
that.

665
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,400
I can't really advertise that, but I don't know.

666
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,400
It's neat, but it'd be interesting to see how it works, if it works as well as it does

667
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,440
on the 360, being that it's not actually something that's integrated into the dashboard.

668
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
It's just a Blu-ray disc.

669
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
So it'll be interesting.

670
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, the Microsoft interface is very bare bones, so I'm wondering if it won't be a little

671
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,520
more... I can't imagine the look is going to be the same, because on Netflix 360, the

672
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,560
look of Netflix is very similar to the dashboard look.

673
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,160
So I can't imagine it's going to be a similar looking interface at all, so I'm kind of curious

674
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,920
if it's going to be maybe better.

675
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I don't know.

676
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Maybe.

677
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
It could be worse, too.

678
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
It could go either way.

679
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,400
It could be interesting if it uses a crossbar style interface, where all your genres maybe

680
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
are in the crossbar.

681
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,960
It'll probably be their video marketplace, or even just the normal marketplace where

682
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,680
you've got rows of stuff on there.

683
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
I don't know.

684
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,520
Good question from Derek H in chat, who hosts another show here on the network, Dead Pixel

685
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,800
Live, on weekdays.

686
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,620
If it uses BD Live, like they say it does, doesn't that mean it'll work on any Blu-ray

687
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,480
player that is BD Live capable?

688
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, Netflix just wants to be wherever the hell they can be.

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,560
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're trying to do this smart Blu-ray Live thing,

690
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
and the Wii sometime as well.

691
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,680
This isn't about the console getting stuff that they want.

692
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,360
This is about Netflix getting what they want.

693
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,880
So I don't know about this particular update.

694
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,000
I would imagine, though, if it is based on BD Live, though, that I would just have a

695
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,540
hard time believing that a normal Blu-ray player, because they don't really have strong

696
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,840
processors in them.

697
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm sure they have some sort of hardware for decoding the video and whatnot, but it would

698
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,560
be difficult, I would think, to stream...

699
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,900
Well, it's not going to be high-def stuff, but it's still streaming video and having

700
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,840
it look good, it does require some processing power.

701
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,120
I don't think your average Blu-ray player that's BD Live capable would be capable of

702
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
that.

703
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,000
I could be wrong, but I would think it takes a lot less to run a Java app than it does

704
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,360
streaming video.

705
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,720
Ionotropic in our chat room wants to remind us, too, the disk-based Netflix for PS3 is

706
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,680
supposed to be a temporary solution.

707
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,900
They said the disk won't always be required, and you were talking about the contractual

708
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,160
stuff maybe until 2010, so it makes sense.

709
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,560
But I mean, hey, added value to the PS3 is added value to the PS3.

710
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,600
Any way you slice it, Netflix on the PS3 is added value, and it's a win for Netflix, and

711
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,960
it's a small win for Sony.

712
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,320
But also, Bochikawa wants to comment in chat room, isn't it a little late to put this into

713
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,600
the console wars concept?

714
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,780
Most everyone that will ever get this gen's systems already have one.

715
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,480
I'm not so inclined to agree.

716
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,760
I don't think Blu-rays really penetrated the marketplace the way DVD players have.

717
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,180
I think for a lot of the tech heads, what you're saying might be right, but remember,

718
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,040
we still have the soccer moms of America to conquer, which Wii is kicking butt at right

719
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
now.

720
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:50,600
The problem is, the recent generations with moving from VHS to DVD, that was a huge step

721
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
now.

722
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:58,960
DVD to Blu-ray was relatively quick, and people are kind of hesitant like, well, if I convert

723
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,500
my entire catalog of titles I own to Blu-ray, how soon is the next thing going to be that

724
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
comes along?

725
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I don't want to do that.

726
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,840
I'm just going to wait for the next thing to come along and save some money that way

727
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,240
because it's not really that big a difference, or hey, they don't own an HDTV, in which case

728
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,340
there is no difference.

729
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
I don't know.

730
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:25,280
It's just not as necessary as moving from VHS to DVD.

731
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,120
Fifth Dream in the chat, I plan to get a PS3 someday, but I don't have any current gen

732
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
stuff.

733
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,660
Certainly there's a lot of gaming fans out there.

734
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,600
If Fifth Dream is listening to this show, obviously they're a fan of gaming.

735
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,240
They don't own a current gen system yet.

736
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,640
Let's not forget, current gen systems are still $200 at the cheapest.

737
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,400
Whereas that might not sound like a lot of money to some folks for a college kid trying

738
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,920
to pay for books and work at a part-time job, $200 is still an assload of money.

739
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,620
That's like ramen for a year.

740
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,820
Not everybody's jumped on board with this yet.

741
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,280
It's not until these systems will get down more like $99 where the PS2 was at.

742
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,160
The PS2 got down to $99 finally, right?

743
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Yeah, that was back in March.

744
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
There you go.

745
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,080
All right, we're going to get into the next story here, but first I'm actually going to

746
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,200
take a little detour from the show role we had.

747
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm taking Jamie and Matt by surprise here because we were talking about something in

748
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,740
the opening of the show, and thanks to the lovely magic of text messaging, I'm getting

749
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,000
someone on the show right now to talk about something we were talking about just a minute

750
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
ago.

751
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,080
So I'm firing up our Skype line right now.

752
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Hello.

753
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:50,560
Hey, is this Mel B?

754
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
The one and only.

755
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
How are you doing, Mel?

756
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,120
Long time, no talks since we've had you on the show.

757
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh gosh, yeah.

758
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,600
It's been quite a while since we've actually... I mean, I've been in the chat a few times

759
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,000
here and there, but yeah, actually being a caller in, it's... Oh yeah, it's been a good

760
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
while.

761
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know, it's up to you.

762
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Hey, it's Dr. Sakura and Loki.

763
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,240
Well, we're always happy to have you here on the show, and of course, just for folks

764
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,760
who are just now listening for the first time, Mel B goes kind of way back on this show because

765
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,560
he used to be very big in the freestyle scene with Dance Dance Revolution, so when our show

766
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,680
was kind of exclusively about that whole scene, obviously Mel was a friend of the show through

767
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,840
that, and we've kept touch over the years, and Mel's a good friend of mine, and Jamie

768
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,400
and Matt's as well, so we've kept in touch.

769
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Now, I got to tell you what's going on tonight, Mel.

770
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,080
We were talking earlier in the show about the Silent Hill Haunted House because I don't

771
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,840
even remember how it came up at this point, but I think I was talking about how... Well,

772
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,380
eventually I mentioned that I got a voicemail from Melody, your wife, a couple days ago,

773
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,800
and she had said something to the effect of, if this thing happens next year, you have

774
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
got to come down here.

775
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,040
I will even pay for your ticket to go.

776
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,200
It was that good, so I was like, okay... Because we were talking about the Silent Hill Haunted

777
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
House on the show.

778
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,400
I'm like, I got to call them and hear about what this was all about, so Mel, I know you're

779
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,880
a fan of Silent Hill.

780
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,680
Tell us about the Haunted House and what it was like.

781
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,760
Walk us through it a little bit.

782
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Oh, wow.

783
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I must say, yeah, Silent Hill, I remember when I first was just kind of looking around

784
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,960
at stuff, I think it was posted on a live journal community about how they were doing

785
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,400
a maze over in prayer, which is about 15 minutes north of Anaheim.

786
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,040
And they were doing essentially the equivalent to a human maze, or that was based on Silent

787
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Hill.

788
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,960
And I'm thinking, you know, that would be pretty cool because, you know, I've been into

789
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,160
the game of Warthog and stuff and all that.

790
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,400
Well, like, yeah, sure, you know, let's check it out, why not?

791
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,240
So we got to do it on a Halloween night, but that was just last night.

792
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,200
And so where it was, how they set it up, it looked like, essentially, the maze was created

793
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,840
inside what would have been a banded movie theater or something like that, because there's

794
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,280
actually a second maze that was next to it called Fear, which was, you know, also a human

795
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,400
maze, but different elements, obviously not, you know, geared towards Silent Hill and have

796
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
all those types of things.

797
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
You're more scared of scary stuff.

798
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Yeah.

799
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,320
And you get in for, you know, like, say, take a picture, just sort of like for those souvenir-type

800
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
things.

801
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,880
Like, right when you're about to say cheese, they blow, like, this huge dust of hair right

802
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
behind you, like, to get your shocked reaction, obviously.

803
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,840
So you can tell these people are about to get you pre-fertile pretty bad.

804
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,440
And once you're going in, once you're actually under the maze, it's like indoors, it's really

805
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,440
not dimly lit with, like, a lot of crimson lighting and, like, just real darkened stuff.

806
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,320
And you can tell when you're in the maze, it's probably about as wide as two people

807
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
top.

808
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
So you're pretty narrow.

809
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,560
You have a very claustrophobic feel.

810
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,440
So already, it's just, you know, kind of creeping yourself out that you can play the game.

811
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,640
You know, a lot of it's just, it's not so much, you see, it's creeping things everywhere.

812
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,920
You know, scary things everywhere, but it's just, you know, something's going to happen.

813
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,520
You don't know when it will.

814
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,720
And that's what, like, the first part of the maze, you can take, like, you know, one turn

815
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
to the second turn.

816
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,680
You didn't realize when you made that second turn, there was this little partition off

817
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
of the flight.

818
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,480
The first monster, you know, just jumped out at you and, you know, scared you, like, stopped

819
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,280
and like, ah!

820
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,960
And for me, because I get pretty jumpy just on about anything, it was like, well, you

821
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
know, you jump.

822
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,440
But you could tell the monster, you know, coming after you, but the good thing, the

823
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,640
way they said it about this, you don't, you know, like, you can't touch them, they can't

824
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
touch you.

825
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,160
It's not like you're getting manhandled or anything like that.

826
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,840
It's like a strip club.

827
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Strip club rules.

828
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
It's like what?

829
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
It's like strip club rules.

830
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Yeah, strip club.

831
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
For lack of a better term.

832
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,560
Um, and so, like, once, you know, you get the initial shock, then it's like they'll

833
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,560
sort of just sort of bang on the door, walls, and start kind of following you.

834
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,520
That's sort of like the way of kind of moseying you off into, you know, the next, you know,

835
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,200
corridor or whatever.

836
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,360
And when I first heard that, I was amazed, you know, like, one of the things they mentioned

837
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,200
on the back was, how fast does it get, can you get through it?

838
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,560
They said it takes about 15 minutes or 8 minutes if you're running at top speed, but, um, cool

839
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,360
thing is, like, it's not one of those mazes you can actually get lost in.

840
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,320
There is sort of, like, a message while they're bad.

841
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,520
If they're, like, side rooms you can kind of go into and look at things.

842
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,000
Um, when you're going through the first, like, few corridors, a lot of it was based on, like,

843
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,520
Silent Hill 4, actually, because it, a lot of the backgrounds that these other sites

844
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,160
were, like, the apartment doors, like, when you're walking by, you hear knocking, you

845
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
know, right on it, so you're kind of, you know, creeping out.

846
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,040
And then occasionally, when you're going through a wall, you'll feel, like, those faces, like,

847
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,400
when the evil spirits start coming out, they'll just come out through the wall and start chasing

848
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
you.

849
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Oh, weird.

850
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,880
You'll see, like, um, there's those, um, evil dogs that you normally see, I think they're,

851
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,240
like, in Part 4 and, um, Homecoming, like, the one where you fall on the porch, you see,

852
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,960
like, occasionally, a dog, you know, in a cage, trying to come after you.

853
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,200
Um, they do pretty cool things with Silent Hill 3, like, there's this one setup that

854
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,000
they have, like, on the slide room, it's, like, at the bottom, there's a television

855
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,040
screen, and you can see, sort of, like, the rollercoaster, kind of, like, going through,

856
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,120
sort of, like, the rollercoaster going on its path, and they decorate it, like, the

857
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,480
abandoned, um, yeah, amusement park and such, and it's gonna take, like, the Silent Hill

858
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
music throughout.

859
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,680
Like, yeah, just everything, like, every corner, you just don't know when things are going

860
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
to happen.

861
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,680
And, like, even sometimes, you'll just see things that are, like, you know, everything

862
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,080
is standing still, and you're thinking, hmm, because one room I remember going through

863
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,840
was, like, a hospital, and there were literally, like, six nurses that just, sort of, like,

864
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,760
you know, when you're going, like, to a Soul Train line or something, you have to go right

865
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
through them, and you know something's gonna happen.

866
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
That's like the scene in the movie.

867
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,160
Okay, I know something's gonna jump me, I don't know what, take, like, one cautious

868
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,720
step forward, okay, two, three, and then you realize four of them were, like, mannequins,

869
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,560
the two of them were live, so it's just, like, totally screwed with your head.

870
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Wow.

871
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,080
Yeah, it sounds like I would have had to wear the pens just to get through the photo shoot.

872
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,920
But our chat room is dying to know, how was their pyramid head, did they have a pyramid

873
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
head?

874
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Oh, please say they had pyramid head.

875
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,360
Oh, yeah, pyramid head was the payoff.

876
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,880
I mean, anyone who, you know, the pyramid head always knows pyramid head is what you

877
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,080
came here for.

878
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,520
So that was, that was actually the last thing that you see.

879
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,320
So when you're going through all these different places, you know, like, I think it was right

880
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,600
after the graveyard that you see in Homecoming, they have that part, and it's funny, as you

881
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,120
leave that graveyard, they have, like, signage for advertising Silent Hill, uh, Shattered

882
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Memories.

883
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,520
So it's, like, kind of, you know, interesting.

884
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,440
So when you're going through that, then you see at the end, there's, like, this, sort

885
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,160
of, kind of, like, shrine over there, at the top you see a, uh, figurine, like, a, uh,

886
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,120
big busted pyramid head, which is, like, really well done, it's, like, wow, that's kind of

887
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,120
cool.

888
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,800
And so you're still fixated on looking at that, just trying to internalize that, then

889
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,440
out of a gate popped out, Pyramid Head, huge, you know, Pyramid Head has, like, the big

890
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,120
sword, you know, that goes, supposed to be at least five feet long, so he starts coming

891
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,320
after you, he starts, like, you know, pretending to stab, he'll push you to get back a little

892
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
bit.

893
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
I would have broke down and cried.

894
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,040
I would have broke down and cried that you had to carry me out.

895
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,640
Yeah, luckily, Melody would have had to throw me over her shoulder and take me out of the

896
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
building.

897
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
I would have cried.

898
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,600
Yeah, but yeah, I mean, for me, it was just, like, I mean, it's funny, because, uh, Melody

899
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,040
would be, like, she'd go, I mean, after she'd gone through, she said, wow, that was, I wasn't

900
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,040
really scared.

901
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,720
And I was like, how could you not be, because then maybe she's not, you know, easily startled

902
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,760
or doesn't invest herself in the game, because when she's going through, like, all the bathrooms

903
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,560
and stuff, we see all the details of how they're busted, you see, like, the blood, blood, tears,

904
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,600
and all that, it's almost like, I guess, I put myself in that situation, thinking, damn,

905
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,800
you know, I don't have no access to spare, I ain't got no radio or nothing, like, I just

906
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
gotta deal with this.

907
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,760
So, okay, I gotta wrap up to move on with the show, but as a fan of the games, did they

908
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,760
do a good job?

909
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,880
I think, I thought they did a really, really good job.

910
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,480
I like that they, they really got you inside, you know, they, they created the things, usually

911
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,160
they did well, but just giving you the feeling of, like, Silent Hill, because anyone who

912
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,840
plays the game knows that it, you know, just psychologically messes with you, so, like,

913
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,840
you always are kind of scared to, like, turn that corner, or, you know, in some places

914
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,200
when you're going to the next room, you have to, like, open a curtain, and so, you know,

915
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,280
it's like the black curtain, you gotta, like, peek through it, you just don't know, so,

916
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,840
you know, fear is in there, but it's, overall, tying it to the game, tying it to, like, you

917
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,920
know, just experience, going to, like, you know, anything that's haunted, it was really

918
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
well done.

919
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,440
And just to clarify, some folks in the chat room wanted to know, does Pyramid Head rape

920
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,040
you?

921
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,760
No bodies were defiled, uh, during the, uh, haunt.

922
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Oh, that's right, they can't touch it.

923
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,280
But he had, like, his small little room, he had his, you know, gate on the side, and,

924
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,360
you know, I didn't get quite a good peek, you know, in there, but, for all we know,

925
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,440
you know, they, they might be adding something, you know, they made it with something I didn't

926
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,160
catch, maybe I didn't, you know, have 100% clear on the game to get that scene.

927
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,240
Maybe there will be a rape expansion in 2010.

928
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,920
All right, uh, Mel, thank you so much, I really appreciate you coming on the show, I know

929
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,400
you guys are, like, driving home right now, you're calling us literally from the road,

930
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,240
probably driving up I-5 or something, so, um, have a safe drive back, thank you guys

931
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,880
so much for, um, coming on the show, and, uh, we'll hope to see you in studio in the

932
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,880
near future, okay?

933
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,880
Okay, take care, I think we might have just lost him at that point.

934
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,960
I was, uh, the 10th draft jersey since Jefferson touched Bimani, which was October 30th, 99th

935
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,640
and 8th, so, you know, 10 years, what a crazy ride, where we are, you know?

936
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
Wow, I didn't even think of that.

937
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
People that used, part of that message got cut off because we lost the connection for

938
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
a little bit.

939
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,320
October 30th, 99 was what?

940
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
The first time you played Bimani?

941
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
First time I played DTR.

942
00:48:53,320 --> 00:49:01,160
10 years later, look, you know, how everything's gone, and still fans still doing it, and,

943
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,480
you know, look what's taking us.

944
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,000
Wow, yeah, it's pretty, pretty crazy looking back.

945
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Boy, do I feel old.

946
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Thanks for making me feel old, Mel, no, I'm kidding.

947
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,200
You know, it's, like, it's, I could go on for an hour or so, but it looks like I'm breaking

948
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,760
up here, so I'll let you get on with the show, and maybe, uh, maybe we'll talk about it more

949
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
next week.

950
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Sounds good.

951
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Take care, Mel.

952
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Have a safe drive back.

953
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
All right.

954
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Thanks, man.

955
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,760
Y'all be good.

956
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,760
Later.

957
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,760
All right.

958
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,820
Thank you, uh, very much to Mel for coming on the show with just only a text message

959
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,820
notice.

960
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,820
I appreciate that.

961
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,820
All right.

962
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,820
That was fun.

963
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
I don't know.

964
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
It sounded pretty good.

965
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,820
I mean, I know Mel's a big fan of Silent Hill, so, Jamie, if it comes back next year, I,

966
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,240
I think we're gonna road trip, but make sure I bring diapers.

967
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,120
All right, we'll be, we'll, um, bring you, uh, or make sure I at least void myself before

968
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,720
we go into the haunted house.

969
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Yeah.

970
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Okay.

971
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,680
We'll, we'll just get you a big pack, pack of, uh, oops, I crap my pants.

972
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Sounds good.

973
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
All right.

974
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,080
Hey, I'm moving on to news that certainly didn't make me crap my pants.

975
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,640
In fact, if the only thing that was going to make me do is pee my pants laughing, there's

976
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,680
another DSI coming out.

977
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
That's right.

978
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,460
This would be the fourth version of the DSI coming out.

979
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,720
It's coming out in Japan very soon.

980
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,760
The DSIL, but it's also been confirmed for Europe and yes, America as the DSIXL, uh,

981
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,360
the DSIs, uh, LL is going to launch in Japan before the year is out.

982
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,780
Uh, basically the biggest revision in this, it's going to come with four inch screens,

983
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,760
so it's going to get a size increase because size matters.

984
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
The DSI Leonardo Leonardo.

985
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,620
No, it's, it has to do with the Japanese translation of XL.

986
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,880
It's, it's, it's also the DSIXL over there.

987
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,960
It's just in their language.

988
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
It's LL.

989
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,800
So that's the ugliest bong I've ever seen.

990
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,880
Some of the colors that this thing is coming out in is kind of cool, I guess.

991
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,320
It will be coming out as well, just so you know, in Europe, in America, but not until

992
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,320
next year.

993
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,480
It has been confirmed for all the regions and I'm just kind of sitting here going, okay,

994
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,080
well to be fair, I never bought the DSI, but if I did buy the DSI, I might feel a little

995
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,240
bit irritated because like if I bought stuff on the DSI store, it's not like there's a

996
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,720
cable that's going to connect my two things.

997
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,200
It's kind of like if I bought a PSP Go after already owning a PSP, there'd be no slot for

998
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,280
me to put the discs in.

999
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,880
At least I could still play the games, but yeah, I'm thinking this is more for the people

1000
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,400
who didn't jump on board with the DSI the first time, like me.

1001
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
I don't know.

1002
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,200
Loki, how has the DSI been selling?

1003
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,460
Is there a need for this?

1004
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,600
What was your take on all this?

1005
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:34,780
Well, this is just for old people and basically they've said it's for so other people can

1006
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,480
watch you play the games.

1007
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,600
And so basically you're advertising for Nintendo now, sort of, and the screen, you know, it's

1008
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,160
a little bit bigger, but the system's also a little bit more expensive.

1009
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,440
So are they going to be putting this out with the DSI?

1010
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,680
I mean, it's kind of backwards as far as it becoming smaller and more compact.

1011
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,080
By the way, a lot of our chat room is making the joke that a four inches is actually a

1012
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,200
big improvement, but I'm bummed.

1013
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Get it?

1014
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,520
And you know, if they're making the system so much bigger, why couldn't they throw the

1015
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Game Boy Advance slot back in there, since, you know, now size isn't a matter and...

1016
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,440
Well, to be fair, when was the last time they put out a Game Boy Advance game?

1017
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,520
I understand that, but you know, to be fair, Guitar Hero uses that Game Boy Advance slot

1018
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,000
and, you know, other games have...

1019
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,520
Well, to be really fair, Guitar Hero on the DS sucks anyway, so...

1020
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,720
Yes, that's true, but...

1021
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
Ha, I win.

1022
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,720
I'm just saying that, you know, before they took it out because they wanted to slim down

1023
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,360
the system to make it smaller and, you know, it couldn't fit... they couldn't fit that

1024
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,360
in there.

1025
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,200
Well, now they made the system bigger, so obviously size isn't a matter anymore, then...

1026
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,200
So in other words, it's going to have a harder time fitting in my pocket.

1027
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Yup.

1028
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
Hmm.

1029
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,320
I don't know how I feel about this.

1030
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,560
Well, and also too, I mean, you're keeping the screens the same resolution, yet you're

1031
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,760
making them bigger, so the picture quality is going to go down slightly.

1032
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
I mean, I don't know.

1033
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,120
Do I really need a four-inch screen, or at least two four-inch screens?

1034
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,560
I can see it just fine.

1035
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,920
I don't need, you know...

1036
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,780
I don't need glasses to, you know, read the text on that screen.

1037
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,760
If you want me to show my friends when I'm playing, just give me a cord that lets me

1038
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,760
put it on my television.

1039
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,020
Yes, I realize this is a DS with two screens, but I'm sure there's a magical little device

1040
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,760
that can make both screens appear on my TV at the same time.

1041
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,120
Oh, like the Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.

1042
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
TV Tuner.

1043
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Something...

1044
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Yeah, something along those lines.

1045
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
Or like the dev kits.

1046
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,120
Yeah, bingo.

1047
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
Bingo.

1048
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
Thank you.

1049
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
So...

1050
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
Um...

1051
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,440
And then actdeftinchat says, Nintendo, virtual handheld, now, thanks.

1052
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Yeah, that's right.

1053
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,080
We still don't have our classic 8 and 16-bit games on the DS, even though we know damn

1054
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,200
well it could play them if it wanted to.

1055
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Yeah.

1056
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,320
Because you could play the classic 8-bit games on the Game Boy Advance slot when they were

1057
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,520
all released on the Game Boy Advance before the Virtual Console came out.

1058
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,320
Remember when you got to pay $19.99 for Metroid, the original 8-bit Metroid, when it was a

1059
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,200
free unlock in Metroid Zero Mission?

1060
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Remember that?

1061
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Good times.

1062
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,600
And also remember how you could get, you know, free Nintendo games streamed to your Game

1063
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,200
Boy Advance using Animal Crossing?

1064
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,200
And there was like, you know, 30-some games in there?

1065
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Oh, but you don't get that anymore.

1066
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,920
In fact, we're just gonna keep Animal Crossing the same.

1067
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,200
I'm not buying the next Animal Crossing.

1068
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,400
I just want you to know that.

1069
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,440
I don't care what they do.

1070
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,560
I don't care if, you know, it's the greatest thing on Earth.

1071
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,400
I'm not buying it.

1072
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
I don't know.

1073
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,440
This just seems to be the raging theme of 2009 as unnecessary handhelds.

1074
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,440
I don't know.

1075
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,400
I guess a bigger screen is cool, but it's not enough to make me go, whoopee, I need

1076
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
it.

1077
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
You know?

1078
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
How's the PSP Go selling?

1079
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,440
That's what I want to know.

1080
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
That's a good question.

1081
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,080
I'd be curious about that.

1082
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,240
Well anyhow, there you go.

1083
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,480
There's the information on the new DS.

1084
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,480
Take it or leave it.

1085
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,860
I'm sure there's some folks that are gonna be excited about it.

1086
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:56,240
I think, you know, the folks who didn't get the DSi, I think will be more into this.

1087
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,440
Of course, there's also Nintendo fanboys that'll be all over this no matter what.

1088
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,920
It's also more expensive, remember.

1089
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,640
Once again, an unnecessary update that's more expensive.

1090
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,160
I might get one if DSiWare becomes very compelling in the future.

1091
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,120
Like they get releases on DSiWare that I need because of the fact that I only have the DS

1092
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,120
Lite.

1093
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,160
I never got on board with the DSi, but right now I'm not feeling it.

1094
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,160
That's where I'm at.

1095
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,720
If something on DSiWare comes out that I need, I'll get it.

1096
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,040
But for now, I'll pass.

1097
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,240
Just like I'm passing on PSP Go.

1098
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,760
For very similar reasons, oddly enough.

1099
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
There you go.

1100
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,120
PSP Go is just ridiculous.

1101
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,200
It's redonkulous, if you will.

1102
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
There you go.

1103
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,200
Fine.

1104
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,600
Something else that's redonkulous is apparently a PlayStation Network, or I should say ex-PlayStation

1105
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:57,640
Network member, who of course tried to sue Sony for $55,000 for banning him from the

1106
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,640
PlayStation Network.

1107
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:05,680
Apparently he was throwing a fit in the PlayStation forums, and I believe since your account is

1108
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,720
linked through that, if you get banned from the forums, you get banned off the network.

1109
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,280
Which most people might say, who cares, I can create another membership.

1110
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,760
Can I make a quick O-L-R-N joke that only like five people will get?

1111
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,760
Sure.

1112
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,120
Thank god this guy never played Ragnarok Online.

1113
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,520
We ban you!

1114
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
Yes.

1115
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:35,760
So, anyways, the guy looks like Eric Estavillo has decided, you know what?

1116
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,280
God forbid that I should lose one lawsuit.

1117
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,880
I'm going to sue you again.

1118
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,840
So he's appealed the court's decision and has sued Sony again, but this time for $180,000.

1119
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:59,400
And on top of all that, this is just awesome, he is also not going to have a lawyer.

1120
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,560
Once again, he's going to be representing himself.

1121
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,000
Because only a fool represents himself.

1122
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,520
Yes.

1123
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,440
He will once again opt out of using a lawyer.

1124
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,840
And the best part about it was, he said before that his first amendment rights were basically

1125
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,560
being trampled on, and that's why he should get $55,000.

1126
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,280
The judge says no and dismisses the case, and so now he's trying it again.

1127
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,520
But the thing is, you can just create a new membership for free.

1128
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,680
It doesn't cost anything.

1129
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,420
Free.

1130
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,960
It's not like you're paying for Xbox Live.

1131
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
It's free.

1132
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,560
Okay, devil's advocate, what about all the purchases you made on your old account that

1133
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,280
are tied to that account that you can't transfer to a new account?

1134
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Well then he shouldn't have been a douche and should have read the terms of service.

1135
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,680
That's true, I think Sony's covered in their terms of service, hence why the constitution

1136
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,060
does not apply.

1137
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,520
You agree to be signing up for a club and exclusive network where the first amendment

1138
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,040
rules don't apply.

1139
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,480
If they want to censor out the word fuck so that you can't say it on their network, you

1140
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,080
can't complain and say, wham wham wham, Sony won't let me say fuck on their service.

1141
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,160
They have every right to do that.

1142
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
It's private.

1143
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
It's private.

1144
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,760
Same goes with any kind of web forum.

1145
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,520
So this guy's just kind of a douche.

1146
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,280
I like how we all said a different word in tandem there, that was great.

1147
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
No Ron.

1148
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,440
There's always somebody, but this is the kind of dummy that really makes the legal system

1149
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,840
just look stupid.

1150
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:39,400
I mean, I understand, in this case, cause they're going to have to throw it out again.

1151
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,600
I mean the fact that one judge threw it out already is totally at least setting a precedent

1152
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,600
is that this is stupid.

1153
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:54,440
Well and at least he's not wasting money on, well I guess he's being smart and not wasting

1154
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,320
money on a lawyer, but he's still wasting time.

1155
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,560
The only bone I will throw this guy is that if he made purchases on the old account, I

1156
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,600
could see where he's irritated and wanting to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.

1157
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,360
However, you knew the rules when you bought the stuff, you knew what, you know, and if

1158
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,000
you're going to act like a douchebag and get yourself banned, well, it's hard for me to

1159
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,460
feel a lot of pity for you.

1160
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,640
Cause what you said probably would have offended me.

1161
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
Just guessing.

1162
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Probably would have.

1163
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,640
And I don't get offended very easily by the way.

1164
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,940
But there are some things that are pretty fucked up.

1165
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,960
One thing that Sony is probably thinking is pretty fucked up right now is that the Playstation

1166
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,800
3 has lost them quite a bit of money, 4.7 billion dollars to be exact.

1167
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,800
That's coming from...

1168
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Billion dollars.

1169
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,200
Billion dollars.

1170
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,720
Apparently this is coming out of the fiscal year quarter to 2009 financial report that

1171
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,760
Sony came out with this week.

1172
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,980
The PS3 has lost Sony 4.695 billion dollars.

1173
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,640
Keep in mind, game companies really lose money, like every time they sell a system, you know,

1174
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,960
they're losing money on parts and so forth.

1175
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,880
So you know, game companies have to take a loss that they're going to get back later

1176
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,840
with things like, let's not forget, Sony owns Blu-rays, so they get money back with every

1177
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,120
Blu-rays that are sold.

1178
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,680
They get money back with their proprietary technology that the games use.

1179
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,360
You know, they make the money back in other ways.

1180
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,420
If your system is successful, you make this kind of money back.

1181
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,000
So hold on a minute, before you want to sit here and go doom and gloom and point your finger

1182
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,080
and say, Sony's losing money because they're stupid.

1183
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,080
Well hold on.

1184
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Keep in mind, because guess what?

1185
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,820
When Microsoft released the original Xbox, they lost 4.2 billion over a four year period.

1186
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:44,160
That is a little less than 4.7, but also that was, you know, 10 years ago ish, you know,

1187
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,040
eight, seven years ago, whatever.

1188
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:53,140
But you know, these game companies tend to lose money on these investments initially.

1189
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,280
So I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the PlayStation 3 just yet, or anytime soon really.

1190
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,880
I think if anything, this year the PlayStation has been gaining more steam.

1191
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:09,040
I think this money could possibly turn around by, you know, next year or the year after.

1192
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,620
And there is some good news out of that as well, and that came from the chief financial

1193
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:18,620
officer of Sony, Nobuyuki Oneda, who says that the PS3 is getting cheaper to produce,

1194
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,920
saying the difference between sales and materials cost has been reduced between 10 and 20%.

1195
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,000
Within the year, it could be in the single digits.

1196
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,320
We'll be able to reach profitability at some point in the next term.

1197
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,440
It should also be noted that the PlayStation 3 has jumped 800,000 in sales from the year

1198
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,320
to year figures ever since the slim launched.

1199
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,980
So definitely the price point was the sticking point for a heck of a lot of people.

1200
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:48,480
And now that Sony's been able to conquer that and even admit that now the systems are getting

1201
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,760
cheaper to produce, I guess the news is going to look pretty good for them a little later

1202
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,760
on.

1203
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,360
As we've been trying to tell them since the launch, $600, you crazy?

1204
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,800
Well, you know, and again, a big part of that was Blu-ray.

1205
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,800
They took a gamble with Blu-ray and, you know, whether you want to admit it or not, they

1206
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
won.

1207
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,960
HD DVDs don't exist anymore, really.

1208
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,960
So they won that gamble.

1209
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,440
So maybe this really truly was, you know, when they were talking about this 10 year

1210
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,380
plan and all that, that's when this is probably going to end up really, really paying off

1211
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,040
for them 10 years after the launch of the system when everybody wants Blu-rays and so

1212
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,040
forth.

1213
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,040
So we shall see.

1214
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,320
Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1215
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,400
We're already an hour into the show.

1216
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,760
We haven't even gotten to release dates.

1217
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:38,480
Well, this is something that I think is actually pretty cool and I would like to see more of

1218
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:46,200
this going on is David Cage, who was behind Heavy Rain.

1219
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:54,120
He was actually defending the mature content, saying that it's a mature rated game.

1220
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,840
He shouldn't have to take, take out any of the, you know, sex and anything that goes

1221
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,840
on in it for the sake of any kind of, you know, quote decency because it's intended

1222
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,840
for a mature audience.

1223
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:14,400
You know, it's not his fault if, if it, you know, ends up in a kid's hand.

1224
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,480
It's who's ever, you know, in charge of that kid's fault.

1225
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,200
In fact, he's quoted as saying, as a game creator, I have one very simple rule.

1226
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,280
Everything is allowed, no limits, as long as it makes sense in the story and is not

1227
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,920
gratuitous.

1228
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,040
Why is he having to defend himself?

1229
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,040
Why?

1230
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,120
Well, this is even more.

1231
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:42,360
He's saying that because it's an 18 plus title, it should exclude him from, and I quote, ridiculous

1232
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,360
situation.

1233
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,120
So, I'm like, good, thank you for saying something.

1234
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,360
Why is this so loud?

1235
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:56,760
It just seems loud because you're, anyway, I don't, I don't understand why the guy is

1236
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:02,640
being criticized here because of, you know, the game or whatever decisions he makes.

1237
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,120
Like it's, it's ridiculous.

1238
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,240
Would you question a Hollywood director about some of the things they do?

1239
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:12,560
Granted, I realize some directors have been questioned over some extremely extreme things,

1240
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:19,540
but like, you know, nobody sat James Cameron down and said, now, why did you decide to

1241
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,360
show Kate Winslet's tits in Titanic?

1242
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,360
Did you really have to show her boobs?

1243
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,140
No, in fact, I think most people were thanking James Cameron for that.

1244
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,720
Why is this guy having to defend his game or any creator having to defend their games

1245
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,480
and the artistic choices they make?

1246
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,240
Oh, I see, because games aren't really art according to some people.

1247
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,280
Well, get over it.

1248
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:47,880
I hate this, and I'm sure you all do as gaming enthusiasts and so forth, the double standard

1249
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,320
with video games versus movies.

1250
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,440
It's all the same kind of thing.

1251
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,240
You know, well, a lot of us, you know, who were anime fans back in the day, you know,

1252
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,120
got into the same thing.

1253
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,160
I'm going, oh, these cartoons, it doesn't matter to me.

1254
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:09,880
Well, like, no, it's just another way of, uh, of, uh, communication.

1255
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,640
It's another, just another medium, and video games are the same thing.

1256
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, LOL, this is like the court scene in Clerks the Animated Series.

1257
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,400
I want my eight bucks back.

1258
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
I'm the plaintiff.

1259
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
I'm a plaintiff.

1260
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,400
I'm a plaintiff.

1261
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Damn, that was a great show.

1262
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
That was.

1263
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,400
Oh, man.

1264
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,600
He's just making new Clerks the Animated Series.

1265
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,880
He was supposed to be doing an animated movie.

1266
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,880
Oh, really?

1267
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Sweet.

1268
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,880
That might be fun.

1269
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,880
It might actually be a good movie from him for, for once in the past, like, 10 years.

1270
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,600
Big American Party.

1271
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,880
I would like to dogma.

1272
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,240
All right, um, moving on, a few more stories in release dates, and of course, the classic

1273
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,080
game of the week before too long.

1274
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:01,680
Yes, apparently, piracy on, um, handheld systems is not limited to the, uh, say, on the PSP.

1275
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:08,600
Apparently, also very, quite rampant on, uh, the iPhone, or at least the App Store.

1276
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:15,680
Um, some developers are claiming rates as high as 80 to even, like, 95 percent.

1277
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:22,960
Uh, one, I love their developer's name too, one iPhone developer smells like donkey, says

1278
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,960
about 80 percent of all downloads of Tap Fu were illegally downloaded, and they have a

1279
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:37,880
way, I guess, of, um, telling that, and apparently, um, you know, the game, uh, was marked down

1280
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:45,540
to 199 and still didn't, you know, affect the piracy rate, which is interesting.

1281
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:49,260
You know what this story, do you know, honestly, what my gut reaction was to this story when

1282
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,040
I read it?

1283
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,080
I was, you can pirate games on the iPhone?

1284
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
How?

1285
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:59,460
Um, actually, I have a lot of them open, uh, cause I have a few friends who have jailbroken

1286
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,460
iPhones.

1287
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,760
Oh, you have to have a jailbroken iPhone to do it?

1288
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,400
Um, well, he says that he did, but there's other places that, um, I think they do have

1289
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,560
to be jailbroken to-

1290
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,640
Apparently, it's pretty easy from what I hear, huh?

1291
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,080
Oh yeah, especially if you've got an old one like mine.

1292
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,320
I mean, I haven't, I've, and I'm saying this in all honesty, I've never jailbroken my iPhone.

1293
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,800
I was never going to.

1294
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
Me neither.

1295
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:27,560
I have a first-gen iPhone, and, um, they're supposed to be, like, super easy on that one.

1296
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,560
Hmm.

1297
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,560
That'd be something to do with, like, an iPod touch, I would think.

1298
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,440
Is there maybe a little kind of distortion going on with the figures, though?

1299
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,980
Because like, if the game didn't sell that much in the first place, and, you know, this

1300
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,120
handful of people pirated your game, well, then you say a certain percentage has pirated

1301
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,760
your game when not that many people bought it to begin with?

1302
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,240
Because maybe the App Store is just too flooded with crap right now, and yours isn't sticking

1303
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,240
out?

1304
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,960
Well, they claim, like, for example, this other, um, iPhone developer, Fish Labs, they

1305
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:03,400
said their, uh, game Rally Master Pro 3D, um, received a 95% piracy rate on its first

1306
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:09,960
day of release, and they said that that equates to about many, a few thousand copies.

1307
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,280
So.

1308
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,440
Hmm.

1309
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,120
Um.

1310
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,440
I could see that.

1311
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,280
You know, if we're only talking a couple thousand, I could see that there's a couple thousand

1312
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,440
people in the world who regularly pirate iPhone games, and a lot of pirates, especially with

1313
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,080
something as little as an iPhone game, because it's not like any of those games are that

1314
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,040
big, probably just download them to download them.

1315
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,320
Play them once and throw them away.

1316
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,480
I would bet you that's what most of those people do.

1317
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Yeah, probably.

1318
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,720
That's, well, remember when the, um, uh, Dreamcast piracy was a big thing, that's really, a lot

1319
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,280
of them was like, oh, I've never played this game, but here it works.

1320
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,080
Or, or here's a great example, um, something that came up earlier in the show.

1321
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,520
Maim ROMs.

1322
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,040
How many people pirate Maim ROMs?

1323
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,560
Like, I think that's one of those things, kind of like, everybody does, but no one really

1324
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,560
talks about it.

1325
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,560
I do it!

1326
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,840
Tons of people download the Maim stuff in the 80s.

1327
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
There's a lot of stuff.

1328
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Those games aren't making money anymore!

1329
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,840
Who cares?

1330
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,160
And there's a lot of stuff too, I mean, it's like.

1331
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,120
I still buy those classic arcade collections when they're decent, it doesn't matter, I

1332
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,120
feel justified.

1333
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,400
There's some games in there, I don't even know what the hell they are, and I'm probably

1334
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,400
gonna try them.

1335
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,840
And you play them once, and you delete them.

1336
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,000
That's still piracy!

1337
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,360
You're still pirating a game!

1338
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,880
Well if you tell me where I can find a legit copy of Ms. Nude World 96.

1339
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,120
Exactly!

1340
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,600
A lot of these games you get.

1341
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,980
And that game's not even legitimate anyways, I mean, come on, that's just a hacked piece

1342
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,980
of crap.

1343
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,200
God damn, I missed Ms. Nude World 96.

1344
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,200
I downloaded that just for you!

1345
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Did you really do have her in the cabinet?

1346
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,600
I'm putting it in the cabinet.

1347
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,160
Oh man.

1348
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,360
Seriously?

1349
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,780
If you've never played this on Maim, it's the one Maim ROM everybody has to play.

1350
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:45,800
Is Ms. Nude World 96.

1351
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,140
It's so bad.

1352
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,140
It's awful.

1353
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,620
I know we've talked about this on the show before, but it was like years and years ago.

1354
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:58,280
Basically it's the game, like, kicks, but it's with naked ladies and then random pictures

1355
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,060
of demon spawn in there.

1356
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:07,660
The front end I'm using is called Hyper Spin, and it has little flash and video previews

1357
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,780
of each game.

1358
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,680
So I'm going to get that, you know, song to play over everything when you're selecting

1359
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,800
the game, which will be pretty funny.

1360
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,960
Everybody, move your body!

1361
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,960
It's awesome.

1362
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,860
But yeah, there's a lot of hacked stuff out there, and it's not practical for people to

1363
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:30,260
buy arcade cabinets and stuff, and even still, I mean, a lot of the stuff you're buying second

1364
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,280
hand anyways, the developers already made their money off that stuff.

1365
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,380
I don't know.

1366
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:41,060
It's not like they're making new Ms. Nude World 96 boards out there.

1367
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,660
I don't know.

1368
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:48,980
Vanus Lux in our chatroom says, my philosophy is that if there's nowhere I can buy it new,

1369
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,780
there's nothing wrong with downloading it.

1370
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:57,060
Of course, there's so much stuff that is available, I never have time to pirate everything.

1371
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,340
To be honest, that's somewhat how I feel about import games.

1372
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,060
I think if the company is never going to release the game over here, then maybe we ought to

1373
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,020
just pirate it, which yes, I realize ties into something we've been talking about quite

1374
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,380
extensively on the show recently, but I can't help how I feel.

1375
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,620
I don't want to pay like $100 to import a game just because the company doesn't feel

1376
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,860
like releasing it here.

1377
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,580
You know what I mean?

1378
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:23,980
But that's not to say I really rarely pirate games, like if ever.

1379
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,180
I actually buy it.

1380
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,180
Even music anymore.

1381
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,140
I pretty much buy everything on iTunes.

1382
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,380
I'm pretty boring.

1383
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,220
I will say this, it's better to buy them on Amazon, because number one, they're usually

1384
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:39,820
cheaper, and number two, they are DRM-free MP3s.

1385
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:45,780
Yeah, I don't think there are MP3s on iTunes, but I don't know, it's just what I use.

1386
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,780
Convenient.

1387
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:53,020
Well, yeah, but you can do more with them off of Amazon.

1388
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:58,620
You can actually burn a real MP3 disc if you have an MP3 CD player.

1389
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:04,060
Anyhow, let's move on to another story here, and then we'll get to release dates.

1390
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,100
Was that all to say about the piracy story?

1391
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,100
Yeah.

1392
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,100
It's just crazy.

1393
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,000
That's really what it is.

1394
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:19,900
Going into an article here about Rock Band, apparently there's kind of talk going around

1395
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:25,300
that possibly there might be a Rock Band The Who edition, very similar to what they had

1396
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,460
with Rock Band The Beatles.

1397
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,820
Roger Daltrey, who of course is lead singer of The Who, was speaking to the Republican

1398
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:36,400
recently saying, quote, the game, yeah, yeah, they're going to be doing a Who one next year.

1399
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
There's one planned.

1400
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,860
The idea is fabulous.

1401
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,180
Anything that gets non-musical people interested in music is wonderful.

1402
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:48,300
Now, of course, sometimes these old rockers don't really understand the way gaming works.

1403
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,920
He might have been talking about a download pack, kind of like Green Day, I think, made

1404
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,460
a similar mistake earlier this year.

1405
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,460
They were talking about their own game, but it was just a download pack.

1406
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,060
I would kind of think so, too, but then you also go, well, The Who already had a huge

1407
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,940
download pack before.

1408
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:06,900
And also, though, I would think, though, because they had a huge download pack that there's

1409
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:11,860
so many songs in the game already, it'd be kind of weird to do their own.

1410
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,860
I don't know.

1411
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,380
Do you think The Who would warrant a whole new game?

1412
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:21,660
I got to admit, and I'm going to get hate mail over this, but hear me out.

1413
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,020
I don't think The Who justifies their own game release.

1414
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:30,980
I don't think the band is that big in the year 2009 to warrant their own game release.

1415
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,980
I know.

1416
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,980
Hate me if you want.

1417
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,980
But let's face it.

1418
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,900
When was the last time they had a big song?

1419
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,340
Okay, I know what you're going to say, but what about The Beatles' rock band, Rob?

1420
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,340
Hold on.

1421
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,340
Beatles?

1422
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,340
Whole other stratosphere.

1423
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,100
There is nothing like The Beatles, okay?

1424
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,260
Back down to Earth.

1425
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,260
The Who.

1426
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,860
When was the last time they had a big hit?

1427
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,860
Oh, yeah.

1428
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,100
Before, most of our listeners and the people buying games today were born.

1429
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,700
Now, will there be an audience for this?

1430
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:59,860
Yes, but it's going to be very, very niche.

1431
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,940
Don't agree with me?

1432
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,100
Then release the damn game.

1433
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,540
Prove me wrong.

1434
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,220
It's niche.

1435
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:10,380
There could be a Who track pack release, not necessarily a full-fledged game, but you know

1436
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:14,500
how they do those disc releases of, say, 20-some songs or whatever.

1437
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:20,740
I could see that happening, maybe, instead of the metal country track pack.

1438
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:26,700
I could see something like the ACDC game that came out a while ago, maybe a live thing that

1439
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,780
comes out.

1440
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:33,320
I could see something like that, but not something like The Beatles' game.

1441
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:40,900
The work that was put into that game and everything that went into that, only The Beatles, and

1442
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,740
only The Beatles, I think, can justify.

1443
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,020
I honestly can't think, and I realize there's a lot of listeners saying all these different

1444
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:52,420
bands in chat right now and all this, but I really don't think there's any band I can

1445
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,840
think of that justifies that.

1446
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,420
Some of the Guitar Hero games, like Metallica, yeah, I can see where they're getting a game.

1447
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,340
Aerosmith, I can see where they're getting a game.

1448
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,500
Van Halen, I actually don't understand why they got a game when they couldn't license

1449
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:13,860
anything after 1984, because I think Van Halen needed more than just the Roth stuff, but

1450
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,180
hey, that's just me.

1451
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,620
Again, you're talking about songs that were all released by the time.

1452
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:24,420
Let's face it, if you're talking about songs that were released 1984 and before, that means

1453
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:28,660
the last song in there was 25 years ago, when most of the people buying these games are

1454
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:32,620
probably in their young 20s and teens.

1455
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:36,620
A lot of those people don't really remember Van Halen.

1456
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,140
Congratulations, you just made your game a niche game.

1457
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,980
He's going to sell 100 copies like President Cat.

1458
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,940
So there you go.

1459
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,860
But again, it's so interesting because every argument I'm saying here against this game,

1460
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,980
you could say, well, what about the Beatles?

1461
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,980
What about the Beatles?

1462
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,180
But the Beatles are the Beatles.

1463
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,180
There is no comparison.

1464
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,060
Seriously, try it.

1465
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,060
There's no comparison.

1466
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,060
No, I agree with you.

1467
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,980
So anyhow, that was my little rant.

1468
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,980
So I'm cool.

1469
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,700
Hey, you know, I realized, and there's people probably sitting there on the keyboard right

1470
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,080
now, Rob, how dare you?

1471
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,740
You know, there are probably huge fans of The Who out there.

1472
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,740
And you know, especially like, you know, if you're in the older group or even the younger

1473
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:23,100
group who just has an appreciation for classic rock, you go, Pinball Wizard is an awesome

1474
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,100
song.

1475
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,700
There's a lot of great Who songs, but is it going to justify a whole new 50, $60 game?

1476
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:34,900
Oh, no, only for, you know, fans that I don't think are enough in numbers to justify it.

1477
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:42,140
But a track pack or a budget game or, you know, something like a re-skinning of, you

1478
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,140
know, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,140
The Who justifies that.

1480
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:52,220
There is certainly a huge classic rock band, but just not relevant enough in 2009.

1481
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,220
Hate me all you want.

1482
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,660
Just tell me how it is.

1483
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,660
How about some release dates?

1484
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,660
Haters going to hate.

1485
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,060
Haters going to hate, exactly.

1486
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,460
And I'm hating.

1487
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,380
All right.

1488
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,860
This guy in chat says, Lady Gaga rock band will be incredible, putting the Beatles to

1489
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,860
shame.

1490
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,260
I didn't see it, but I heard about this week's episode of South Park, where apparently they're

1491
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,820
doing Poker Face and rock band.

1492
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:17,820
Hilarious.

1493
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:21,460
Did you see Christopher Walken?

1494
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,460
Yes.

1495
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,460
Doing Poker Face.

1496
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,460
Good stuff.

1497
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,100
I actually think Lady Gaga should get some type of game.

1498
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,140
Like maybe not now, but maybe after her next album.

1499
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,820
But and again, you're probably going to, Rob, what the fuck?

1500
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,660
You just say the Who shouldn't get a game, but Lady Gaga should.

1501
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,260
But the Lady Gaga game would be like on the Wii.

1502
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:41,160
Does that make sense where I'm going with that?

1503
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,520
It would be on the Wii and in a pink box.

1504
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,520
You know?

1505
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
It would be a different kind of game.

1506
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,520
P.S., Rob.

1507
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
What?

1508
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
You're a dork.

1509
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,520
I know.

1510
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,420
But I would buy the Lady Gaga game.

1511
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,940
People bought Britney's dance beat, damn it.

1512
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,700
Lady Gaga can have a game.

1513
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,700
All right.

1514
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,700
Anyhow, sorry.

1515
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,700
Release dates.

1516
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,700
Is the Lady Gaga game coming out?

1517
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,700
No.

1518
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,700
Not this week, I'm afraid.

1519
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,700
All right.

1520
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,180
This week actually started- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1521
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,620
Tiger Claw chat.

1522
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,820
Just made me lol.

1523
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:10,320
It would be called Lady Gaga game.

1524
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,820
That's so stupid, yet so funny.

1525
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:14,820
Lady Gaga game.

1526
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,980
Or would that be Lady Gaga me?

1527
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,160
Anyhow, sorry.

1528
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,160
I promise.

1529
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,660
I'm putting the mic down, so I won't interrupt.

1530
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,660
All right.

1531
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:29,060
Starting today, Rabbids Go Home is available on DS and the Wii.

1532
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:34,420
Also later this week, Need for Speed Nitro will be out on the DS and the Wii.

1533
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,860
Coming from Nintendo, Style Savvy.

1534
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:45,180
It's a style sim for the DS, which I'm sure is gonna sell millions of copies, except not.

1535
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,020
Sushi Academy out on the DS.

1536
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,420
My Baby, First Steps on the DS and the Wii.

1537
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:59,380
This week, Lego Rock Band out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1538
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:04,460
Of course, the DS version is very similar to the PSP version of Rock Band.

1539
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:12,040
Band Hero also out this week on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, as well as

1540
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,940
the full band bundle as well.

1541
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:18,560
If you feel like dropping $200 for that one, you can just get a world tour bundle for about

1542
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,620
half the price.

1543
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,580
Imagine Baby's fashion.

1544
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,860
Imagine me not carrying him at this game.

1545
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,060
That's available on the DS.

1546
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:34,020
Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squad out on PSP and DS this week.

1547
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:38,420
The re-release of Star Wars The Force Unleashed in the Ultimate Sith Edition, coming out on

1548
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,980
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1549
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:53,700
The Jack and Dexter The Lost Frontier out on PSP and PlayStation 2 this week.

1550
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:58,940
Dragon Age Origins out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week.

1551
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,580
Wii Cheer 2 on the Wii.

1552
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,500
Dream Salon also on the DS.

1553
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
Really?

1554
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
Wii Cheer got a sequel?

1555
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Yes.

1556
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,460
I just want to point out, that site earlier said that the cat game, President Cat, is

1557
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,980
the worst Wii game ever made, yet Wii Cheer gets a sequel.

1558
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,780
I'm just saying.

1559
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:22,420
Trust me, anything made by Destineer is the worst Wii game ever.

1560
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:23,740
Not President Cat.

1561
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,740
President Cat's awesome.

1562
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:31,680
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves is making its way out, game only, on the Wii.

1563
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,100
Of course it's been released before, but now they're kind of re-releasing it, because that's

1564
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,940
what Konami does.

1565
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,900
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1566
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:44,740
The rest of the versions will have to come later.

1567
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,980
Christmas Carol tying in with the new Disney movie out on the DS.

1568
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,940
Cop the Recruit out on the DS.

1569
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:57,500
This one's kind of like what the Grand Theft Auto on the DS should have been.

1570
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,980
It's like the PSP Grand Theft Autos.

1571
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:06,460
And seriously, Konami, what are you doing?

1572
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:11,700
Ultimate Party Challenge Bundle with, uh...

1573
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,220
All right.

1574
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:33,380
Sorry, I was looking up preview information on Band Hero.

1575
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:37,140
Let's see here, a couple more.

1576
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:43,220
Academy of Champions Soccer out on the Wii this week, also featuring the Rabbids.

1577
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:47,820
And Hooked Again with the fishing rod, it's your fishing sim.

1578
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:55,940
And then also becoming not a Walmart exclusive anymore, Rock Band ACDC Track Pack available

1579
01:21:55,940 --> 01:22:01,380
on all four systems for now the new low price of $20.

1580
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:09,220
And let me tell you this, Munchy probably could get it way cheaper than that.

1581
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,500
And let's see here, oh, some more random stuff.

1582
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,700
Team Elimination Games from the Wii, yet another generic party game.

1583
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,100
Once again, you know, all these companies putting out generic party games that are dime

1584
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,100
a dozen.

1585
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,260
Or hey, how about this another deer hunting game?

1586
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:30,340
Buck Fever coming out on the Wii from, oh, the best company ever, Destineer, Buck Futter.

1587
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:36,620
Oh, and then, how should we forget, but guess what?

1588
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:41,460
We Wish You a Merry Christmas, yes, once again, another quality game from Destineer coming

1589
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:49,260
out on the Wii, because hey, what Christmas, what would Christmas be without a Christmas

1590
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,780
themed party game that you'll probably throw away after, you know.

1591
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:57,340
We Wish You a Merry Buck Futter.

1592
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,820
That's the game I'd like to see, Buck Futter.

1593
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,620
Did you ever see that Celebrity Jeopardy sketch?

1594
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,140
Oh, forget it.

1595
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,980
And then lastly, a week from today, Shaun White, Snowboarding World stage of the week coming

1596
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:07,980
out on the Wii.

1597
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,940
And that's it.

1598
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,140
Moving over to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.

1599
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:17,220
Now I want a game called Buck Futter, just to say I have it.

1600
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,420
Can we get that on like the indie games marketplace?

1601
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,580
Xbox 360 in Japan, we get Fallout 3, gets a price reduction over there, Dirt 2 gets

1602
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:28,420
its release in Japan, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade comes out, I'm assuming that's very

1603
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:33,780
similar to collection what we got over here before, NBA Live 10 comes out, and Taiyutama

1604
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:37,340
Kiss on My DT comes out in a regular and limited edition.

1605
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:38,540
That sounds dirty.

1606
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,660
It does sound a little bit like Kiss My DD, like it's something that, you know, like kiss

1607
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,660
my grits.

1608
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:48,140
But no, I believe this is actually based on an anime, it's another adventure game based

1609
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,620
on an anime.

1610
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:53,580
Taiyutama I think is an anime, so there you go.

1611
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:57,420
Also coming out, World Soccer winning 11 2010, of course soccer games are always huge releases

1612
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:01,860
in every country but the US, and they sell decent here I'm sure too.

1613
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:06,740
And there's also an Xbox 360 Elite Bundle, if you are doubting how big this game is,

1614
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,260
it's getting bundled over there in Japan, if you are curious about that.

1615
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,160
That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

1616
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,900
On the Playstation 3, a game we're going to talk about a little bit later on, 3D Dot Game

1617
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,900
Heroes comes out.

1618
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,780
I just want to point out, region free, if you want to import it, but we'll talk a little

1619
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,740
more later about why you might not want to.

1620
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,900
Dirt 2 comes out as well on Playstation 3, Infamous gets its release in Japan this week

1621
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,940
as well as NBA Live 10.

1622
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:35,180
And of course World Soccer winning 11 2010, also a Playstation 3 Bundle.

1623
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,580
Have you ever seen that before where the same game gets bundled with two different consoles?

1624
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,580
That's kind of interesting.

1625
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:46,520
I don't know if I think of any other game that's gotten, warranted the two different

1626
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,020
systems being bundled with it.

1627
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,020
Interesting.

1628
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,020
Lego Batman.

1629
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,020
Oh, good call.

1630
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,020
That's Playstation 2 on the Xbox 360.

1631
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,900
Nintendo Wii gets a few releases in Japan as well.

1632
01:24:55,900 --> 01:25:00,100
Dragon Ball Z, Sparking Neo, I believe that's a price reduction, not a new release.

1633
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,180
But a new game coming out in Japan, Mario and Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics.

1634
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,180
Of course, the 2010 Winter Olympics are going to be in Vancouver.

1635
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,780
And Mario and Sonic at the Olympics actually sold pretty well.

1636
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:13,140
Like I know a lot of gamer enthusiasts kind of poo-poo those games, but they actually

1637
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,620
sold pretty well, right?

1638
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:19,660
So the sequel now, I guess you could say, the Vancouver Olympics is coming out just

1639
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:24,100
in time for the Olympics over in Japan as well.

1640
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,860
Playstation 2 is really slowing down with their releases in Japan as well.

1641
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:30,940
They only have a price reduction to look forward to in Metal Gear Solid 3 this week on the

1642
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,940
Playstation 2.

1643
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:35,340
Nintendo DS has a handful of releases, it's getting pretty busy over there in Japan.

1644
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:40,020
Wire Way comes out as well as Tamagotchi, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

1645
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:45,100
No Nari-kiri Shaniru, I'm sure that's another side story Tamagotchi game.

1646
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:50,980
Lemon Knight X Tears Crown comes out as well on the Nintendo DS, and Sakura Note, Imanitsu

1647
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:55,580
Nagaru Mirai comes out from Marvelous Entertainment on the Nintendo DS.

1648
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,500
Lastly, onto the PSP and the releases they have there.

1649
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:05,260
Dirt 2 gets a release on the PSP as well, as well as Suikoden 1 and 2 gets a price reduction.

1650
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:08,980
They released that in Japan, bundled and redone for the PSP, it's getting a price reduction

1651
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:09,980
this week.

1652
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:15,620
Nintendo NBA Live 10, Naruto, another one of those games, moves into the price reduction.

1653
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:21,500
Also getting a price reduction, Valhalla Knights 2 gets a price reduction this week.

1654
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,580
Let's move over to Europe.

1655
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,860
We have a number of releases.

1656
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:34,260
We have on the 4th, Tony Hawk Ride, and then on the 6th, Band Hero, Dragon Age Origins,

1657
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:43,700
Ghostbusters, also Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues, Need for Speed Nitro

1658
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:51,420
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, Rapala Wii Fish, and Star Wars Battlefront League Squadron.

1659
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,620
Very cool.

1660
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,620
Yep.

1661
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:56,620
Pretty interesting stuff I think.

1662
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,620
Yep.

1663
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:08,540
Alright, well many, I guess, I don't know, shadier people on Xbox Live woke up on Halloween

1664
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:12,660
morning to find out that they were banned from Xbox Live.

1665
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:18,700
Yes, Microsoft actually went through and did another round of console banning, mainly targeting

1666
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:22,660
people that were downloading certain games.

1667
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:27,300
If you may remember, I think we talked about it last week, they were cracking down on people

1668
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:34,500
downloading Forza 3 and Borderlands early, of course it makes it a lot easier for them

1669
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,860
to track that kind of stuff when the game's not out yet, and so because of that they've

1670
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:46,340
taken action against some people, and of course with each update that the console gets with

1671
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:52,300
each new firmware they add more consoles to the list of banned consoles, so it's kind

1672
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,860
of interesting though.

1673
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:59,020
You know, myself, I have about five modded consoles and not one of them is banned on

1674
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,020
Live, so.

1675
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,660
Yeah, but you're not dumb enough to play the stuff online, right?

1676
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:06,060
We played modded Grand Theft Auto's online all the time.

1677
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,060
Really?

1678
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,060
Yeah, no problem.

1679
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:14,380
But see, here's my theory on that though, is that they have ways of individually checking

1680
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:20,140
consoles to see if the game is modded, like the console's modded, but it doesn't, for

1681
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:25,300
them to actually spot check every single console out there, I guess would be impossible for

1682
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:29,060
them to do, or at least not practical for them to do.

1683
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:35,180
So what they are doing is waiting for these high profile games like Call of Duty, Modern

1684
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:40,620
Warfare 2, Borderlands, Forza 3, and seeing, oh hey look, here's a group of people that

1685
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:45,940
are playing it online, okay now we have a list of a hundred people to check on, versus

1686
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:49,500
a list of two million.

1687
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,780
I was wondering how they could tell the difference between somebody who just happened to get

1688
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,260
the game early at a store, and somebody who pirated it.

1689
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,580
So I get it now, so that's how customers are called.

1690
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:02,620
They probably have a way to check while you're playing online, because there's no way, I

1691
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:07,580
don't think there's a way for them to check if you're playing offline, but it's harder,

1692
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:11,340
that's why a lot of the, you know, if you're downloading stuff, they'll recommend that

1693
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:15,900
you play it offline until the game streets, and you know, I'm sure that there's going

1694
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:21,060
to be a way that they're going to eventually figure out that hey, you know, if you've burned

1695
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:26,400
something or you're playing a backup disc that they're going to find you, but once again

1696
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,100
also they keep updating the firmwares that are on those drives, they just release the

1697
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:34,660
new firmware to support what they call the wave 4 discs, because basically each disc

1698
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:39,220
that comes out they have the current update in there, there's also a video track that

1699
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,260
if you're a dumb idiot that puts your 360 in a DVD player that says hey stupid, this

1700
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:55,620
is a 360 game, not a video, so you know, and they check the sizes of those to make sure

1701
01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:01,940
that it's consistent with a good burn of the disc, and also there's a security sector that's

1702
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:09,140
on each disc that they verify based on a retail copy and whatnot, so that's how they have

1703
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:16,940
all these backup plans to make sure that you have a legit burned copy or a copy that is

1704
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:23,580
pretty much undetectable as far as the differences and whatnot, but yeah, basically each side,

1705
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:31,620
you know, both Microsoft and the pirates, they keep updating their tactics, so it'll

1706
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,620
never end.

1707
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:39,300
Well, you know, and Microsoft has a right to protect what's theirs, and honestly if

1708
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,900
you're dumb enough to be playing these things online before it's released, you know what,

1709
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:47,620
you kind of deserve it, so there it is.

1710
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:53,700
By the way, speaking of the PSP Go and some of these release things talking about, IkumaJP,

1711
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,860
one of our listeners in Japan who has really been just a great listener for us because

1712
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:01,580
he can kind of help make us understand some of the things going on in Japan sometimes

1713
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:05,620
because we're so far away, he actually linked us to a news article talking about how only

1714
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:09,940
30 people were queuing up for the PSP Go, and you know how sometimes like in Japan,

1715
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:15,120
line, line, line, line, only 30 people queuing up for the PSP Go, you never found those sales

1716
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,120
figures, huh?

1717
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,020
Oh, I didn't even look, it probably gives you a good idea.

1718
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,300
Well, I'm waiting and getting a response from the Twitter.

1719
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,300
That's alright.

1720
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,020
Anyhow, let's move on to another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, it's

1721
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,720
where DarkSakura digs through her archives and picks out one game that she thinks you

1722
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:34,380
guys should really check out, it's called the Classic Game of the Week.

1723
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:40,420
Oh DarkSakura, what have you chosen in your sickly state for our folks to be playing tonight?

1724
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:43,260
Apparently an incomplete link.

1725
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,260
There we go.

1726
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:56,340
Um, the game that I picked was, um, Seaman, not to be confused with sperm, so, um, hello?

1727
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:03,580
So what month is your- Because, as I neglected to put on the little

1728
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:09,580
thing, there's no background music in this game, so what I put up is an actual example

1729
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:14,580
of conversation in the game that I found in Tesly Hilarious from some guy's YouTube.

1730
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,260
Okay, so wait, shall I play this again then?

1731
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:18,260
In a minute.

1732
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,260
Okay, go ahead.

1733
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:22,700
Well then you get the cutesy music this week.

1734
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:32,540
Um, anyway, um, the game Seaman is actually for the US version, it was narrated by Leonard

1735
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:39,020
Nimoy, which is pretty freaking cool, and it uses a microphone, it came out on the Dreamcast,

1736
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:48,140
and you basically get these little eggs and you raise them, and they turn into these fish

1737
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:53,260
with people faces and these long flagellum on their head or something.

1738
01:32:53,260 --> 01:33:01,700
And they talk to you, and, um, you can have conversations with them, and as they go you

1739
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:06,940
have to maintain the temperature and feed them and do all this other stuff, as well

1740
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:15,460
as prepare a terrarium, because, um, you're going to, um, eventually, uh, let them evolve

1741
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,460
into a fog and then they're going to run away.

1742
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,460
So...

1743
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,460
Jesus Christ!

1744
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,540
They're so needy and then they just dump ya?

1745
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,540
Kinda.

1746
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,900
Kick those seamen to the curb.

1747
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:31,140
But you, but you can, um, uh, they breed, and the way that they breed as fish is just

1748
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,780
kinda weird.

1749
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:41,580
Um, but your first stage is a mushroomer, which is, um, what they, uh, originally look

1750
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:47,740
like, and then you have Gillman, and there's the ones that go mar mar mar, that's all I

1751
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,740
remember them saying.

1752
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:57,180
Um, and you get Podfish, and then after they mate the male Podfish dies, and then you get

1753
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:10,060
Tadman, and Frogman, and, um, it's a very weird little game, but very fun, um, I remember

1754
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:17,300
watching Dan talk to his fish for, uh, a long time, and it also had, uh, Crispus Seaman

1755
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:23,380
that came out in Japan, it also had a Red Translucent Greek Dreamcast with it, and then

1756
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:31,860
there was a PS2, um, uh, version that got released later on, and, um, then there was

1757
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:38,140
a sequel that came out, which is a lot more, uh, evolution involved, you know, so, it is

1758
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,740
a fun little game.

1759
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,740
Now even though you were making, like, fish and frogs, you never, like, ate them, so you

1760
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:51,140
weren't, like, swallowing the Seaman, right?

1761
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,140
Just checking.

1762
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:57,580
Hey, let's listen to some of the game's dialogue, so you can hear some dude interact with his

1763
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,580
...

1764
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,580
This is intensely hilarious.

1765
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:00,580
Yes, let's listen to a guy play with his Seaman.

1766
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,580
Your birthday in...

1767
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:04,460
October.

1768
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,340
You were born in October?

1769
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,340
Ye-yes.

1770
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,740
Let's try that again.

1771
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:15,300
In what month were you born?

1772
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,620
October.

1773
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:20,060
You were born in October?

1774
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,340
Yes.

1775
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:27,100
I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?

1776
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,500
Treat.

1777
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,300
Like the spice?

1778
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,900
Yes.

1779
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:37,540
Well, you can look, but don't touch.

1780
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,660
This makes no fucking sense.

1781
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,660
I know, it's great.

1782
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,140
Just keep going, because I like the part where you're so much the fuck off.

1783
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:46,860
I don't want to touch you.

1784
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,580
What do you want?

1785
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:50,780
To touch you.

1786
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,580
I don't know that word.

1787
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,860
You just said it.

1788
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:58,660
So, what day is your birthday on?

1789
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,020
Second.

1790
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,140
The second?

1791
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,660
Yes, bitch.

1792
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:08,900
Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.

1793
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,900
I hope you are as peaceful as he.

1794
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:18,460
I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.

1795
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:19,460
By the way, this is from...

1796
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:20,460
Fuck you.

1797
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:28,780
Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.

1798
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:32,100
Besides, what would the neighbors think?

1799
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,100
Fuck them.

1800
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:37,460
I need to give credit to the YouTube user that did this.

1801
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:42,700
Ebola World is the name of the E-B-O-L-A World, okay, just before I play the rest of this.

1802
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:43,700
Fuck them.

1803
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:48,420
Hey, why all the noise?

1804
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:49,420
Your mama.

1805
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:50,420
What?

1806
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,420
Your mama.

1807
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:52,420
Mama.

1808
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,420
Nope.

1809
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:54,420
I'm just fine.

1810
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,420
Wait.

1811
01:36:55,420 --> 01:37:04,940
Sorry, I'm busy.

1812
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,780
You don't look busy.

1813
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:13,980
I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

1814
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:17,900
I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

1815
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:20,740
Just don't get any ideas about me.

1816
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:26,740
Let's just be friends, for now.

1817
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,700
I'll friend your butt.

1818
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,620
Are you coming on to me?

1819
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,620
Yes.

1820
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,620
Yes.

1821
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:43,740
Put this tongue in that mouth, dream on.

1822
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,740
No food for you.

1823
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:58,180
Now, go think about what I've said, and we'll talk again later.

1824
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:03,020
Rob is red in the case, this is fantastic.

1825
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:04,660
We need to get this game immediately.

1826
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,660
I haven't.

1827
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,660
Do you really?

1828
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,660
Hold on.

1829
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:11,340
Okay, whenever we do our marathon, our big gaming marathon, this needs to be one of the

1830
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,540
games we play for an hour.

1831
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:17,220
That was awesome.

1832
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:23,220
Oh, there you go.

1833
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:27,820
That's why this is a classic game.

1834
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:32,500
Oh, she just brought out the game.

1835
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,500
See, man?

1836
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,500
There it is on the Dreamcast.

1837
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:38,960
They just put that on a little sticker on the back of the box.

1838
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,140
I'll friend your butt, Ebola World.

1839
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:45,060
Big thanks to the YouTube user Ebola World for the lulls there.

1840
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:50,580
That was insanely funny, and our chat is exploding.

1841
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:55,460
Pictures going up on the site.

1842
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:58,100
Gameguru in chat says, C-Man 3 for the Wii.

1843
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,100
I agree.

1844
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,340
Then they could call it Butt Friends.

1845
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,660
I don't know what they're going to call it.

1846
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:09,660
All right, anyhow, clearly, we need to take a break here in studio.

1847
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:12,540
We'll be right back, though, with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and some more news

1848
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:17,940
stories tonight, including some rapid-fire news, your Twitter topics, and an update on

1849
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:22,100
the N-Gage, probably the final update we will ever give you on the N-Gage.

1850
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:27,860
All right, we'll be back in just a few minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1851
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:29,860
Stay tuned.

1852
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:38,340
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, November the

1853
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,740
1st of 2009.

1854
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:42,540
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it's November already.

1855
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:50,780
For the 343rd episode of our little program, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

1856
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:53,780
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1857
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:58,860
I hope nobody missed it tonight because of the whole Daylight Savings thing, but if you

1858
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:04,780
don't live in an area that celebrates or recognizes Daylight Savings Time, just know this is the

1859
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,780
good month for Daylight Savings Time.

1860
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:12,380
This is what they call fall back, when we get to gain an hour of sleep at night.

1861
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:16,220
The other one that happens in the spring when you spring forward, that one sucks because

1862
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:22,700
you lose an hour of sleep, but everybody hopefully is well rested after a hopefully happy Halloween.

1863
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,740
So I hope all of our listeners and everybody listening out there had a great, happy, and

1864
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:26,740
safe Halloween.

1865
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:30,860
Anyhow, we had a pretty exciting first half there, and I think we've all recovered from

1866
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,620
the classic game of the week.

1867
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:35,940
We're going to go ahead and, I think, move into rapid-fire news first, and then we'll

1868
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,740
get into Twitter topics after that.

1869
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,940
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some rapid-fire news.

1870
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:47,220
Yes, Doom is coming to the iPhone, and this would be the classic Doom.

1871
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:53,900
The original, well, not the original first person shooter, but second or third.

1872
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,900
Pretty close.

1873
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:59,540
Anyways, that'll be coming out quite soon, and actually, it's kind of funny, I read that

1874
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:05,780
the guy that designed the logo and, I guess, title screen for Doom died.

1875
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:12,780
So I guess that sort of ties in there.

1876
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:18,660
Majesco is publishing a new DSi game, I guess it's a DSiWare game, actually.

1877
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:24,560
It's going to be called Ghostwire, and it's what you would call an augmented reality game.

1878
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:33,020
You use the DSi's camera to pan around rooms or your environment and search for ghosts,

1879
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:41,460
in which case, then you capture them, I guess, sort of like, I don't know, Fatal Frame, sort

1880
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,460
of.

1881
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:46,140
You kill ghosts with your camera in Fatal Frame, I don't really know if that's capturing.

1882
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:49,780
Anyway, but yeah, it looks kind of neat.

1883
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:52,380
Hopefully it's not too expensive.

1884
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:58,220
And then, finally, Frogger is returning, because, God forbid, Frogger should leave.

1885
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:05,180
Frogger Returns is now coming to WiiWare and the Playstation Network, and it's a brand

1886
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:11,220
new game with the classic Frogger gameplay, and rats that are absolutely huge.

1887
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:16,540
In fact, judging by the scale of this picture here, that rat is the size of half a subway

1888
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,340
car, so we should be concerned.

1889
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:23,340
Must be in New York.

1890
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:27,320
Interesting that Frogger is being done yet again, but I guess those games are popular,

1891
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,820
that they aren't popular enough.

1892
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:32,540
I remember when it came out on the Playstation a little while ago, well, I guess more than

1893
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:36,220
a little while ago, when it came out on the very first Playstation, it was kind of cool,

1894
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:41,780
the reimagining of it, but then it got really repetitive.

1895
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,740
The last time Frogger was cool was when I was playing it on roller skates when I was

1896
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:46,740
12.

1897
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:51,000
Alright, anyhow, I've got a bunch of music game-based news for you guys tonight, starting

1898
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,580
off with ACDC Rock Band, as Loki kind of mentioned a little bit before, it is now not only available

1899
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:00,700
at Walmart, it is actually available everywhere now, including places like Gamestop and so

1900
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:01,700
forth.

1901
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,860
It is available right now.

1902
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:10,260
It's not at its original price of $29.99, or I believe $39.99 was where it started at.

1903
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,540
It's now down to $19.99, so the game does have 18 songs.

1904
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:15,100
And that's just when the game stops charging for it.

1905
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:19,300
Not necessarily what the price will have to be.

1906
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:23,980
So maybe other retailers might be charging like $15 for it if you know where to look.

1907
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,340
Probably go as low as $9.

1908
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,340
Wow.

1909
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,340
That might be exciting.

1910
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:31,140
Well, if ACDC doesn't interest you, maybe some of the other bands coming to Rock Band

1911
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,140
will.

1912
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,820
Of course, these are download songs that are coming out, and this is what's coming out

1913
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:35,820
next week.

1914
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:37,020
It's a Foo Fighters pack.

1915
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:40,580
It's the third pack of Foo Fighters songs coming out with Best of You, The Pretender,

1916
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,140
Wheels, and Word Forward.

1917
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:46,580
Nirvana has some songs from their album Bleach coming out, including About a Girl, Blue,

1918
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,340
and School, and a Joan Jett song coming out.

1919
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:53,660
Fake Friends is the Joan Jett and the Blackheart song that is available on Rock Band this week.

1920
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:57,340
Of course, if you're playing on PSP, there's some songs from Bullet for My Valentine and

1921
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:02,580
System of a Down coming out on the PSP version of Rock Band, Rock Band Unplugged.

1922
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:07,680
And lastly from me tonight, Guitar Hero is also getting some download content.

1923
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:12,140
They are getting a variety of things throughout November.

1924
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:16,540
Starting off, there's a Lenny Kravitz pack with Let Love Rule, Lady, and Fly Away.

1925
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:21,220
Of course, Lenny Kravitz is an awesome guitar player, and those are all great songs, so

1926
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,140
this should be fun to jam to.

1927
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,260
Those are going to be out on November 12th.

1928
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:30,140
November 19th, we'll see the release of three tracks from KISS, Modern Day Delilah, Lick

1929
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:32,580
It Up, and I Was Made for Lovin' You.

1930
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:36,020
Also, there's going to be a free six-song pack.

1931
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:41,940
It's free, but it's bands that feature Neversoft employees, so definitely indie bands, and

1932
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:45,140
these are songs that you probably have never heard of.

1933
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:48,740
But hey, sometimes playing songs by bands you've never heard of is how you find your

1934
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,800
new favorite song, so that'll be free.

1935
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,220
You certainly don't have any excuse not to check that out.

1936
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,680
DarkSakura?

1937
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:02,980
For anyone who's looking for DJ Hero download content, there actually will be some stuff

1938
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:12,580
out for 480 Microsoft points on Xbox Live, or at least if you're in Europe, it'll be

1939
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:16,380
497 pounds on PSN.

1940
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:26,380
There is a 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige mashup with Queen's Radio Gaga, which is pretty funny.

1941
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:36,300
There will be Gorillaz and Public Enemy mashup, which is pretty cool, and then on the 24th

1942
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:49,300
we get the David Guetta mix pack, which is one called When Love Takes Over, and Sexy

1943
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:54,140
Chick, and On the Dance Floor, and a few other things.

1944
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:57,220
Just so you know, I know you may not know this, but When the Love Takes Over is a huge

1945
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,620
club song.

1946
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,140
It's a big, big dance song.

1947
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,500
Like Energy 927, Before They Win Under, that was their number one song on the station,

1948
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:09,700
so that's a pretty big score for DJ Hero.

1949
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:13,300
And those songs that came out this last week, both very good.

1950
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:18,180
The Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige mashup is amazing.

1951
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,060
I like the other one better.

1952
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,060
It's good too.

1953
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,060
That's the Gorillaz and Dare.

1954
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:29,340
That was with Public Enemy.

1955
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:33,160
I'm surprised you're not playing DJ Hero right now, DarkSakura, because there's so much Gorillaz

1956
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:38,180
in it, there's like four or five Gorillaz mashup things in it.

1957
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:50,780
Keep in mind, their sound producer when Demon Days came out was DJ Danger Mouse, who his

1958
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:56,180
big claim to fame was mixing Beatles and Jay-Z for the Grey Album, which got him in a lot

1959
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,180
of trouble.

1960
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,180
Oh, I remember that.

1961
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,180
Okay.

1962
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:04,340
So it makes me completely natural that any of their stuff would end up in DJ Hero.

1963
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,340
Never thought of it that way.

1964
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,340
All right.

1965
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,340
Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.

1966
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:12,900
We don't have a whole lot making the cut tonight, but I do want to acknowledge a couple of tweets

1967
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,900
that we got here.

1968
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:17,740
And of course, part of that's my fault because I didn't put up the request for Twitter topics

1969
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:18,740
until like an hour ago.

1970
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,100
But anyhow, Spazinator PSN on Twitter.

1971
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:26,060
Again, you can always follow us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Spazinator PSN

1972
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:32,060
wants to know, not so much a topic, but a debate, the pros and cons of both Sony's and

1973
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:37,700
Microsoft's video marketplaces, i.e. compare and contrast, et cetera.

1974
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:38,700
Hmm.

1975
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:40,100
Well, I've used both.

1976
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,740
I've downloaded stuff on both of them.

1977
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:49,740
I find the Sony store slightly easier to navigate than Microsoft's, but that's just me.

1978
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:53,700
Of course, Sony also has the backing of the fact that they are a major motion picture

1979
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:59,140
studio, so, you know, they get movies there, but I find that there's a better selection

1980
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,140
on Microsoft.

1981
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,700
I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like there's more stuff available on Microsoft,

1982
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:05,100
but honestly, neither one really has the stuff I really want.

1983
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,540
I have to go to Netflix for all the good stuff.

1984
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:09,180
And I wish both of them had more HD.

1985
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,180
I don't know.

1986
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:12,180
Loki, you ever played around with this stuff?

1987
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:13,180
Nope.

1988
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:14,180
You don't ever really use a video marketplace?

1989
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:15,180
Actually, I take that back.

1990
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:22,700
One time we rented Dark City on the Xbox 360 video marketplace.

1991
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,700
And got what you paid for?

1992
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,700
All that good stuff?

1993
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,700
Yep.

1994
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:26,700
It was Dark City.

1995
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,980
I like that movie.

1996
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:31,260
I do like that on the PlayStation you can transfer a lot of it to the PSP.

1997
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,860
I mean, that's something that the 360 doesn't have.

1998
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:39,340
So I would give PlayStation the slight edge in that war, but the Xbox 360, I mean, it's

1999
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,740
not like it's a bad setup at all and you're going to get good stuff.

2000
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:45,620
Well now, though, with the new, what is it, when they're going to be converting it to

2001
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:49,300
the Zune marketplace, the video marketplace, maybe you're going to be able to transfer

2002
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,740
it to your Zune HD or something like that.

2003
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,740
That's true.

2004
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:55,500
So Spassinator, you might want to ask that question again in like two weeks when that

2005
01:48:55,500 --> 01:49:00,100
new little patch comes out, which obviously my 360 is broken, so I'm not in the preview

2006
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,100
program.

2007
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:02,780
I'm really excited about the Last.fm support.

2008
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,780
I think that's kind of cool.

2009
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:05,620
I still haven't played with it.

2010
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:09,660
I prefer Last.fm Pandora, personally, because it makes a lot of recommendations based off

2011
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,940
your own plays.

2012
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:13,620
Don't use either one, but whatever.

2013
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:21,580
Anyhow, ActDept sent us a link that's called The 10 Biggest WTF Games of All Time.

2014
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:26,220
This is from a site, bravenewgamer.com, so let me run down this list that ActDept sent

2015
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:29,240
us from bravenewgamer.com.

2016
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,020
Number 10, Jet Set Radio Future.

2017
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,340
Isn't that weird?

2018
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:36,160
For a game, it was really different.

2019
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:40,180
Number 9, Space Giraffe, also known as Tempest on Acid.

2020
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:41,780
That game was just a huge disappointment.

2021
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:45,760
I didn't like Space Giraffe one bit, and I loved Tempest 2000.

2022
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,500
Number 8 on their little list here, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wild Horse Rescue.

2023
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,500
It's not a WTF game.

2024
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,500
I don't think it's a WTF game, either.

2025
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,860
I think the writers put that there for shock value.

2026
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:57,860
Number 7, Shaq-Fu.

2027
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,740
Now, there's a good WTF game.

2028
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,740
That's a good one.

2029
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,740
But wasn't that kind of decent?

2030
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:05,180
No, Shaq-Fu is ridiculous.

2031
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:07,540
But it's Shaq doing Kung Fu.

2032
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,620
They had a fan sequel, too, that's even better.

2033
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:10,620
Are you feeling okay?

2034
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,620
Yeah.

2035
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,500
Number 6, Big Rigs Over the Road Racing.

2036
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,980
It's just a horribly bad...

2037
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:20,300
It's not even really deserving of attention.

2038
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:23,700
I have it on my laptop, and it's kind of boring.

2039
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,660
Actually, it's quite boring.

2040
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:28,620
Number 5 is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, which...

2041
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,620
I don't know if...

2042
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,620
That's like some tie-in.

2043
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:31,620
I don't think that's really strange.

2044
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:34,820
That's one of the better tie-in games there's been, actually.

2045
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:40,420
I mean, yeah, it might be weird that they made a game out of Michael Jackson, but...

2046
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,700
It's Sega, and Sega loves Michael Jackson.

2047
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:44,580
And the game actually was pretty awesome.

2048
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:47,620
I don't know if I can really consider that a WTF game.

2049
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:54,660
It's a weird concept, but when it's done really well, I don't know if you can call that WTF.

2050
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:55,980
Number 4, Monster Party.

2051
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:57,860
I don't even remember this game.

2052
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:58,860
I don't even know what that is.

2053
01:50:58,860 --> 01:50:59,860
It was on the NES.

2054
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:02,320
I don't even know what the hell that game was.

2055
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,860
Number 3 is a game called Alien Disco Safari.

2056
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:06,660
Okay, I give credit.

2057
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,260
That's a WTF game.

2058
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,580
Number 2, Custer's Revenge.

2059
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:15,260
You can't have any sort of controversial list without the game Custer's Revenge.

2060
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:21,380
This isn't so much WTF as it just is STFU.

2061
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:25,740
Number 1, of course, Katamari Damacy, which I would agree is a bit of a WTF game, but

2062
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:26,740
again, a lot of effing fun.

2063
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,740
You know what game is missing from that list?

2064
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,740
That list sucked.

2065
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:29,740
What's that?

2066
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:30,740
You know what game is missing from that list?

2067
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:31,740
What game is missing from that list?

2068
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:32,740
WTF.

2069
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,740
That's right.

2070
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:35,420
There was a game called WTF.

2071
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:41,620
Honorable mentions on this went to Takeshi's Challenge, Bible Adventures, Choaniki, which

2072
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:43,260
is definitely a WTF game.

2073
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,260
Choaniki is...

2074
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,260
Yeah.

2075
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,260
And Noby Noby Boy.

2076
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:49,260
I think the honorable mentions were better than most of the list.

2077
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:53,580
But thank you anyway to ACT-F for sharing and allowing us to give our filthy opinion

2078
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,580
on that list.

2079
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,580
That was a horrible list.

2080
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:56,580
Yeah, it wasn't that great.

2081
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,580
No, seriously.

2082
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:01,580
I mean, I can think of a couple already, I mean, Oonga Boonga.

2083
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:04,660
Yeah, Oonga Boonga is definitely a WTF game.

2084
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,380
There's the table flipping game that's in Japan right now.

2085
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,540
It's another arcade game that's really weird.

2086
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,220
XLink in chat says no Spice Girls for the PlayStation.

2087
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,660
There was the Spice Girls game.

2088
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:15,980
That was kind of strange.

2089
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,880
It was hilarious, though.

2090
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,020
There was another game where you played a UFO, or not a UFO, an alien or something.

2091
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:24,140
It was a Sega game where you scared people.

2092
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,540
I don't remember what that was called.

2093
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:26,540
Incredible Crisis.

2094
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:31,060
I'm not, that's the game, I mean, that would be a good...

2095
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:33,380
That is a good WTF game.

2096
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:36,140
Irritating Stick.

2097
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,780
Somebody in chat, I think it's Bochikawa, is asking, did anyone actually play the Bible

2098
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:40,780
game?

2099
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:44,900
I didn't play that Bible game, but I've played some Bible games.

2100
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:49,220
Or how about let's look at the simple series in D3.

2101
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:53,860
Zombies versus, or was it, Ambulance versus Zombies.

2102
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:58,380
Yes, it's a game where you drive around in an ambulance killing zombies.

2103
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:02,260
Or they had, I'm trying to think if there's some other weird ones.

2104
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:06,380
There is one with girls dressed up like maids killing things as well.

2105
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:09,220
Ionotropic in chat, Sneak King.

2106
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:12,740
That was a great entry too, good job.

2107
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:15,280
So there you go.

2108
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:18,580
We just already came up with 10 games, I think there were more WTF than the ones on the list.

2109
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:21,860
Here's another weird one, Goo Goo Soundy.

2110
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:23,660
Which I think I have this somewhere.

2111
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:26,540
And who could forget, President Cat is a little bit WTF.

2112
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:34,820
No, no, apart from that, also, Vibribin, C-Man.

2113
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,420
C-Man's a little bit WTF.

2114
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:41,020
That guy right there, he probably like, his editor or whatever said, listen, you gotta

2115
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,380
write an article for this guy.

2116
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:46,760
Gotta get something that's gonna get on Dig, and Dig loves top 10 lists.

2117
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:50,980
So think of a top 10 list that you haven't seen on Dig yet, and just throw some games

2118
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,460
out there that'll get people talking.

2119
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:57,580
Go even weirder, MojiBribin, which was even more bizarre than Vibribin.

2120
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:03,860
Anyhow, Act F wants to say, and he's in chat right now too, since RenoE is kind of like

2121
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:07,880
a WTF game, he wanted us to talk about those games because all those games are out, yet

2122
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,820
President Cat, nowhere to be seen?

2123
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:10,820
Hmm.

2124
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:12,340
Who wants to be President Kitty?

2125
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:16,060
Perhaps, uh, they need to bring it over to my house.

2126
01:54:16,060 --> 01:54:20,740
They need to give out copies of that game, you know, with like, purchases at say, PetSmart

2127
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:24,700
or something like that, you know, go the whole sneak king route.

2128
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:25,700
That's a good idea.

2129
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:28,100
Alright, let's move on with some more long form news.

2130
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:32,460
Skype coming up later this hour, and so forth, Loki.

2131
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:40,020
Um, well, here's some platform that you're not going to see President Cat on, that would

2132
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:41,340
be the Nokia N-Gage.

2133
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:49,740
Yes, Nokia has officially announced the death of the N-Gage, um, honestly, to me this seems

2134
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:55,720
like one of those situations where like you're, you know, the N-Gage is your like, grandparent

2135
01:54:55,720 --> 01:55:01,260
or something that was, had died in their apartment months ago and they just now went to visit

2136
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,300
them and found them lying there rotting.

2137
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,940
I mean, this is pretty much, you know, the N-Gage.

2138
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:11,360
I think it was dead a long time ago, and we just now are kind of acknowledging the fact

2139
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:14,380
that we haven't heard from the N-Gage in a while, maybe better check and see if they're

2140
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:17,660
still alive.

2141
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:20,140
God bless them for trying.

2142
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:21,140
They were dedicated.

2143
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:23,500
God bless them for not trying that hard, though.

2144
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:28,380
That's like the reclusive old lady who died and they didn't find her until they smelled

2145
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:31,460
the sounds of decaying in her cats.

2146
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,460
Which is a true story.

2147
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:33,460
Ew!

2148
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,460
That's what I think of.

2149
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,460
Gross.

2150
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:40,420
It's not a show if I don't gross out Rob at least once.

2151
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,700
Which goes to show you that cats are popular.

2152
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:48,500
Ray Iannami in chat says, I remember some spokesperson saying Game Boy is for kids,

2153
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:52,740
and that's the spokesperson for the N-Gage, and I'm like, now go die in two fires, please.

2154
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:56,940
So um, Game Boy isn't necessarily just for kids.

2155
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:02,340
They probably thought that the mobile gaming platform on phones would never take off because

2156
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,860
the N-Gage didn't work.

2157
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:07,580
And this little thing called the iPhone came out, whoops!

2158
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:11,220
Just didn't know how to do it right, you just don't make your system look like a taco.

2159
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,220
No side taco.

2160
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,220
Ooh, I want a taco.

2161
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:14,220
You know what sounds good right now?

2162
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:15,220
Jim Boys.

2163
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:16,220
Mmm, taco.

2164
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:17,860
Don't make that face start talking.

2165
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:20,980
No, Jim Boys makes me violently ill every time I eat it.

2166
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:21,980
Really?

2167
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:22,980
Yes.

2168
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:25,980
That's like, that's like me and Chipotle.

2169
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,300
Does it make you bleed out of your head?

2170
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:29,300
Don't be disgusting.

2171
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:35,820
All right, moving into uh, if the show could distance itself from South Park.

2172
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:41,460
Hey, talking about, on a related note, Explosion Man, or Explosion Man of course is a game

2173
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,160
on the Xbox 360, it got an update this week.

2174
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:49,500
Now there are some Avatar awards, you know, you can actually get clothes for your Avatar

2175
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:53,500
now, and they are unlockable with certain achievements in the game, which is pretty

2176
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:54,500
cool.

2177
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:59,580
Also, what's very interesting about this is that the um, developers Twisted Pixel has

2178
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:07,620
teamed up with Omaha Steaks to give away, yes that's steaks as in, it wants mood, hundreds

2179
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,600
of top quality steak fillets.

2180
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:16,160
You just have to download and equip a special Splosion Man gamer pic, and then if you play

2181
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:23,380
some multiplayer before November 22nd, you might win steak for playing Splosion Man.

2182
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:27,540
Yeah, they keep trying to get me to buy their steaks because I bought steaks for like some

2183
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:33,980
of our game publishers a while back, and they will not stop hounding me to buy more steaks,

2184
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:40,100
and I'm like, listen, that was a one time thing man, I don't want to buy more steak

2185
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:47,540
from you, it's expensive and your steak, well, it is steak, and you know, I'd rather go to

2186
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:50,340
the grocery store and buy my steak than have it mailed to me.

2187
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:55,060
I own a Tropic in chat, I knew somebody was going to say it, it says, I'm a vegetarian.

2188
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:57,020
So yeah, what do the vegetarians get?

2189
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:58,020
Tofu.

2190
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,020
Nothing.

2191
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:00,580
I guess, can you substitute that for a brick of tofu or something?

2192
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:01,580
They have cake.

2193
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,580
They sell cake.

2194
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,580
Do they?

2195
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:04,580
Oh, the steak people sell cake?

2196
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:05,580
Yeah.

2197
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:09,420
And depending on how vegetarian you are, they also sell fish.

2198
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:13,900
I guess that might work, if the place is giving you a gift certificate I guess you could do

2199
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:14,900
that.

2200
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:15,900
Or baked potatoes.

2201
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,900
They have baked potatoes.

2202
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:17,900
You know a lot about this company.

2203
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:18,900
They've obviously given you a sales pitch.

2204
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,580
I bought me steaks from there.

2205
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:21,860
What did you buy steak for?

2206
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:26,700
I was buttering up some of my publishers.

2207
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:27,700
And I also bought it for my...

2208
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,140
Wait, so you bought the game publisher's steak?

2209
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,140
Yeah, they're reps.

2210
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:32,620
Did you buy Twisted Pixel steak?

2211
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,260
Maybe that's where they got the idea from.

2212
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:35,260
No.

2213
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:36,260
Maybe they were like...

2214
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,260
They're a developer, not a publisher.

2215
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:39,500
Oh yeah, duh, my bad.

2216
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:43,660
I was hoping maybe you indirectly inspired the steak giveaway, but no such thing.

2217
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:49,060
No, I actually bought steaks for my grandparents and my dad.

2218
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:52,020
I don't remember if it was last year or the year before last.

2219
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,620
That just seems weird though, because they would have to FedEx them to you or something?

2220
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,620
Yeah, they FedEx them.

2221
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,620
It comes in a...

2222
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,420
Actually, I had my dad send it to me.

2223
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:06,300
It comes in a big old styrofoam cooler with dry ice in it, and they put steaks and burgers

2224
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:08,140
and whatnot.

2225
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:15,260
You can get crab, lobster, it's just it's not worth it buying.

2226
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:16,660
There's plenty of other places.

2227
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:21,860
And plus, if I really wanted top quality steaks, we have a butcher down the street from me

2228
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:22,860
that's...

2229
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,460
I'll just go buy from there.

2230
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:28,900
All right, well, we're going to get into our mailbag segment.

2231
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:32,620
And every week you guys send in emails, and Dark Soccer likes to pick a few of her favorites

2232
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:35,020
and read them live on air for all of you to hear.

2233
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:37,480
I'm going to ask Dark Soccer though, are you okay to do this tonight, or do you want me

2234
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,480
to do it?

2235
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:39,480
With your voice and everything?

2236
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,480
I can try.

2237
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,020
All right, Dark Soccer is going to go ahead and open up the mailbag.

2238
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:45,900
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com and read some emails for you guys right now.

2239
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:49,220
I don't think we got a lot though, at least when I checked we hardly had any to do.

2240
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,220
There's just two.

2241
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:51,220
All right, then let's read them.

2242
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:55,220
So I got President Cat imported after listening to your show last week with speedy delivery

2243
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:56,940
because I'm an impatient bastard.

2244
01:59:56,940 --> 02:00:00,060
Anyway, the game is weird, but fun kind of.

2245
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:03,420
I can't figure out half of the mini games because my Japanese isn't that good, and some

2246
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,180
of the games may just be broken.

2247
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:09,980
But I came across this video on YouTube of this crazy guy in full spandex biker gear

2248
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,900
playing one of the exercise mini games from the game.

2249
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:17,060
It's a 40 second clip and it's weird to say the least.

2250
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:20,460
If you play it on the show, you can give a running commentary for the folks listening.

2251
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:24,660
Cheers AZHP.

2252
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,020
I can open that up right now.

2253
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:27,700
I'll go dig it in the mailbag.

2254
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,700
It's only 40 seconds?

2255
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:29,700
Yeah.

2256
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:30,700
Oh, that's not that bad.

2257
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:33,180
Last time we opened up YouTube here on air was hilarious.

2258
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:34,740
I'll fringe your butt.

2259
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:37,220
I'll go ahead and read the next one because it's short.

2260
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:38,220
Go for it.

2261
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:39,220
Hey guys.

2262
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:40,220
Happy hallows end.

2263
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:44,280
I was wondering if you were going to have a show next year on Halloween, maybe with

2264
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:48,060
a live webcast of children's reactions to a grown man in a tingle costume handing out

2265
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,140
candy.

2266
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:50,140
Just a thought.

2267
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:51,140
And that's from cheeseburger.

2268
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:52,980
Rob, you're going to hand out candy next year?

2269
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,980
Just a tingle.

2270
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:57,020
Shut up.

2271
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:58,020
I don't know.

2272
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:01,580
It didn't even occur to me that Halloween's on a Sunday next year.

2273
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:04,660
Have we ever had a Halloween episode of Orange Lawn's radio?

2274
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:05,660
This will be a first.

2275
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,660
I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.

2276
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:07,660
What's that?

2277
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:09,660
I don't know if we'd do anything on Sunday.

2278
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:10,660
Let me double check.

2279
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:14,060
Wouldn't you think that would be one of those ones we'd take a day off or something?

2280
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:15,060
I would think.

2281
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:16,060
I guess it kind of depends on what's going on.

2282
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:17,060
It is indeed on a Sunday.

2283
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,060
I guess it depends.

2284
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:19,060
Well, it's a year away.

2285
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:20,060
We'll see.

2286
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:22,980
Who knows if we're going to be doing a show in a year, huh?

2287
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,540
Remind us in a year.

2288
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:30,340
Maybe I'm going to have a diva storm off the set come Christmas, so.

2289
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:33,660
Then we'll just replace you with Ellen DeGeneres.

2290
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,660
Or with one of the C-Man.

2291
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,060
You can just sit here and do the show.

2292
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,060
I'll be your friend.

2293
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:39,060
Anyhow.

2294
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:41,060
I'll friend your butt.

2295
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:45,460
I wonder if you could hook up the microphone to Skype and have a Skype caller talk to the

2296
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,460
C-Man.

2297
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:49,980
Oh, so like when one of our serial callers calls in, like the people they get on every

2298
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:50,980
week.

2299
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:51,980
Like the spasinator calls in.

2300
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:52,980
I could wire that up.

2301
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,380
Have it be a segment talk to C-Man.

2302
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,100
You could wire that up.

2303
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,100
The word.

2304
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:02,860
Yeah, but keep in mind you have to check them every day because it runs on the Dreamcast

2305
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:03,860
timer.

2306
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:11,620
I would love to see the phone call between Legend of Zaku and the C-Man fish.

2307
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,780
But one night we just have to set that up and not tell the callers.

2308
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:14,780
That's what we've done.

2309
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:16,580
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

2310
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,580
Are you a Libra?

2311
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:25,020
Alright, here's the video that AZ- Besides, what would the neighbors think?

2312
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:28,660
Here's that video that AZHP sent along that we're supposed to watch and give commentary

2313
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,660
on.

2314
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:34,700
Well, that's definitely spandex.

2315
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,100
This is the official channel.

2316
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,340
That's the cat-punch exercise.

2317
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,340
Is it?

2318
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,780
And his corgi's like, what the fuck.

2319
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:43,740
I think it's a dance that the cat does or whatever because they have a bunch of people

2320
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,740
doing that.

2321
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:51,940
It is.

2322
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,620
He just looks like he's kind of dancing.

2323
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:56,260
It looks like he could be holding the wiimote doing that.

2324
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,740
This dog seems entirely amused.

2325
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:02,900
I thought this game was supposed to be about a cat, not a dog.

2326
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:05,300
No, this isn't from the game.

2327
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:07,900
This is a contest they have there on their website.

2328
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:11,020
It's some dance or something that the cat does.

2329
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,020
Gotcha.

2330
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:17,260
But seriously, if they have contests like this on their website, I don't believe that

2331
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:19,420
it hasn't sold 100 copies.

2332
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:26,220
On top of that, they actually, yesterday they had an event in a cabaret to promote the game.

2333
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:32,940
I actually posted on Twitter if any of our Japanese listeners attended that I'd like

2334
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:37,580
to know how it went, but seriously, I think that they had to have sold more than 100.

2335
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:41,020
Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.

2336
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:45,380
But it's funny though, that little, when I was watching, because I've seen that one before,

2337
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:54,020
I was watching a bunch of those just when I was really high on NyQuil and I think it

2338
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:58,420
translates to cat punch mode or something or cat punch dance or something.

2339
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:03,740
Akuma JP, of course, one of our listeners in Japan who listens to our show on Monday

2340
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:10,100
afternoon live in Japan, says it's the morning exercise, like company exercises in the morning.

2341
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:11,260
That's what the dude's doing.

2342
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:16,980
It's just that I've seen the morning exercise routine, but I don't remember them batting

2343
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,580
the air like little kittens.

2344
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:21,700
That's what the cat does.

2345
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:23,020
That's what they really need to do here.

2346
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,380
They need to implement that kind of thing here.

2347
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:27,100
I could really use like a 10 a.m. stretch at work sometimes.

2348
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,100
I know.

2349
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,100
You know what I mean?

2350
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:31,100
All right.

2351
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:32,100
Anyhow.

2352
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:34,900
Dear Congress, make it so.

2353
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:38,140
I just want to point out, because some of our chat room is still hung up on the whole

2354
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:43,380
I'll fringe your butt comment, and in fact, we have some folks saying, let's see, togak

2355
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:46,380
in chat says, going to use that tomorrow at school.

2356
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:50,540
Okay, look, have fun, freedom of speech, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2357
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:54,460
You didn't hear it here, especially when your parents or your principal asks you where you

2358
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:55,460
heard a comment like that.

2359
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:56,460
Okay, just saying.

2360
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:57,460
You didn't hear it here.

2361
02:04:57,460 --> 02:05:01,100
But remember, when Rob does have his diva fit, we are replacing him with Ellen.

2362
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:03,340
Just say you heard it on the Glenn Beck show, okay?

2363
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,340
That's all you have to do.

2364
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,340
All right.

2365
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,340
Moving on.

2366
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,420
No one would believe you, because no one watches that garbage.

2367
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:13,740
Hey, Loki, let's hear what you have to say.

2368
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:14,740
Yes.

2369
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:20,700
So, I don't know, I didn't really play too much of the original game, a little bit on,

2370
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,100
actually I think I played some of it during the show one time.

2371
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:26,500
What, sorry, togak says, got it, I learned it from Oprah.

2372
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:32,780
Okay, there you go, excellent, that wins.

2373
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:40,220
I guess the Flash version of Line Rider has been tweaked a little bit.

2374
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:43,700
They've added some new support to the game.

2375
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:50,220
Now you can actually play as two different riders, or torture two different riders.

2376
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:55,540
It's a brand new dual rider mode, and they've added a new, you can select the starting point

2377
02:05:55,540 --> 02:06:01,820
for the second rider, as well as they've added some new types of lines that will actually

2378
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:04,580
decelerate the rider as well.

2379
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:09,740
I guess you could use this to do races, or some sort of synchronized run, or something

2380
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:10,860
like that.

2381
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:17,460
And the new Line Rider variant is also going to be available for, I guess the iPhone, they're

2382
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:22,260
also going to do like a Line Racer game or something, so that's kind of neat.

2383
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:25,900
I don't know, a free update.

2384
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:26,900
I like free.

2385
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:32,940
And the game is popular, and they have some pretty sweet videos out there on YouTube for

2386
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:33,940
it.

2387
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:38,400
Well, this next game isn't free, but it's certainly a popular game, in fact one that

2388
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:43,460
seemed to disappear for quite some time, and then suddenly is now coming back.

2389
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:46,740
Excite Bike is getting a new version.

2390
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:52,540
That's right, this is not Excite Truck, this is not Excite Bots, this is Excite Bike, the

2391
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:54,360
original 8-bit game.

2392
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:59,140
It was announced this week on the show Nintendo Week, let me come back to that in a minute,

2393
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:03,640
that Excite Bike World Rally is coming out on November 9th.

2394
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:07,500
It's like a new souped up version of the 8-bit Excite Bike, like they have now, it's like

2395
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:14,260
3D, I don't want to say 3D, but like that 2.5D, like Street Fighter 4 has 3D elements,

2396
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:17,500
but it's still like a 2D game, but that's what they're doing with this Excite Bike.

2397
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,380
It's a 3D game on a 2D plane.

2398
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:25,240
And an online multiplayer, and, and, and, do you remember what the original 8-bit game

2399
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:28,100
had that made it so awesome for an 8-bit game?

2400
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,100
Track Editor?

2401
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:33,420
Track Editor, with save and load buttons that didn't freaking work when we got it here in

2402
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:38,260
America because that's how lazy the translation was, because it was originally a Famicom disc

2403
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:39,260
game overseas.

2404
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:43,180
You know what's awesome too that no one seemed to notice in any of the previews and stuff?

2405
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:48,500
It also has the icons like in Excite Truck, where you hit them and then the landscape

2406
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:53,340
changes so ramps appear out of thin air.

2407
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,340
That sounds awesome.

2408
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:57,220
Yeah, you can kind of see that in the little video too that was there.

2409
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:02,460
So Track Editor, online multiplayer, Excite Bike World Rally is coming out November 9th,

2410
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,740
and I'm pretty excited.

2411
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:07,700
Like I wish Nintendo would do this with more of their old school franchises, but I do want

2412
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:11,140
to say the show they chose to debut it on, Nintendo Week, I guess this is a little thing

2413
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:13,380
they do on the Nintendo channel.

2414
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:17,960
I watched it, and wow, have you ever watched that show?

2415
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:23,560
Like I think it must be written for a 7-year-old or something like that because it was really

2416
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:24,900
difficult to watch.

2417
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:29,580
Like it was like watching a really, really bad episode of Scooby-Doo, and when I say

2418
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:35,180
really bad, I mean like really, really, really bad.

2419
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:38,580
In fact, I posted a tweet about it earlier this week.

2420
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:42,260
I think I said something like, I just watched Nintendo Week to see the new Excite Bike trailer.

2421
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:47,060
I would have rather watched my grandma get a pap smear.

2422
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:49,860
It's that bad.

2423
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:55,700
Anyhow, speaking of things that might make us a little bit angsty or irritated, it's

2424
02:08:55,700 --> 02:09:01,340
time for us to get into the FUs of the Week, but we have a little bit of a story to inspire

2425
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:04,020
the FUs of the Week.

2426
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:09,380
Of course, I'm having a little bit of a problem loading it here, but we'll get there to it.

2427
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:10,380
There we go.

2428
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:29,740
Here's a story to inspire the FUs of the Week tonight.

2429
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:37,220
A man caused a blackout at a local hospital and blamed Silent Hill for it.

2430
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:43,500
Silent Hill is not often always seen as like the thing that the games made me do it.

2431
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:50,140
Somehow this game tends to escape that, but apparently there was a 35-year-old man that

2432
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:56,260
said that this game inspired him to break into a hospital, shut off the electricity.

2433
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:00,220
His name was Jan H. At least that's all they're calling him right now.

2434
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:03,940
Apparently he was in some type of psychosis and thought he was actually playing the game.

2435
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:04,940
So what did he do?

2436
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:09,500
He broke into Sophia Hospital in the Netherlands in April, I guess maybe now it's just going

2437
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:10,500
to trial.

2438
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:13,420
He shut off the power and forced a blackout for 45 minutes.

2439
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:18,260
People were trapped in elevators, doctors had to manually keep the ICU patients breathing.

2440
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:20,100
Thank God nobody died.

2441
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:23,780
By the way, he was found not guilty in a trial last week.

2442
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:24,780
Why?

2443
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:30,740
The court ruled he had no idea of the true consequences of his deed.

2444
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:36,700
I guess he thought that shutting off the power would allow him to avoid Pyramid Head.

2445
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:41,080
I don't know, but that story is just all kinds of strange.

2446
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:42,700
So F you to strange things.

2447
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:43,700
That's ridiculous.

2448
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:47,380
You're always trying to restore power and never shut it off in Silent Hill.

2449
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:51,540
Dark Sakura, are you angsty about anything tonight?

2450
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:56,260
I want my voice back and I want my foot to stop hurting.

2451
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:58,260
That's about it.

2452
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,260
Loki?

2453
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:05,380
F you to older trick-or-treaters that don't understand the concept of take one candy.

2454
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:10,500
Not one handful, one candy that we ran out because there wasn't that many people.

2455
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:15,540
But seriously, dude, you're too old to be doing this and you're too greedy.

2456
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:17,620
F you to the Bay Bridge.

2457
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:22,080
Oh my gosh, that really sucked to have to go to San Francisco this weekend because you

2458
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,080
know what?

2459
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:24,340
Let me put it this way.

2460
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:30,180
I did so much driving this weekend that I actually bought an audio book because my friend

2461
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:33,540
Victoria usually goes with me on these long road trips, didn't come with me this time.

2462
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:35,300
So I bought an audio book to keep me company.

2463
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:37,420
I bought Kathy Griffin's new book, which actually was very good.

2464
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:38,420
I highly recommend it.

2465
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:39,420
It wasn't funny.

2466
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:40,940
It was just good.

2467
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:43,020
It's six and a half hours.

2468
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:46,320
I listened to the entire thing this weekend in the car.

2469
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:53,100
That's how much driving I did because I had to go around the Bay Bridge and terrible.

2470
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:56,860
So F you to the Bay Bridge and them rushing the job the first time causes the damn thing

2471
02:11:56,860 --> 02:11:58,540
to break.

2472
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:01,420
And then F you to the fact that they would say, oh, it's going to be open Thursday.

2473
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:02,780
Oh, it's going to be open Friday.

2474
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:03,780
Oh, you know what?

2475
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:04,780
Fuck it.

2476
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:05,780
It'll be open Monday.

2477
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,940
And now they don't even know if it's going to make that.

2478
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:11,660
And while I am all for taking the time to do it right, which they didn't do the first

2479
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:15,180
time, stop teasing me.

2480
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:19,820
And F you to the fact that we have a completely inadequate public transit system in place

2481
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:24,020
for when this thing is broken and Bart's like, well, maybe we'll go 24 hours.

2482
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:25,020
I don't know.

2483
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:28,220
You don't really pay us enough to do it.

2484
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:29,220
Fucking Bart.

2485
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:30,220
Fucking Bay Bridge.

2486
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:31,220
Lame.

2487
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:32,220
Fucking all.

2488
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:33,220
Exactly.

2489
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:37,500
Who decided to build a major city over there anyway?

2490
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:38,500
Seriously.

2491
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:42,100
Like you have to go around a Bay to get there.

2492
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:46,460
I guess it made sense back in the days of more ship and all that stuff.

2493
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:47,460
Forget it.

2494
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:49,500
I'm done at being angsty.

2495
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,500
More news.

2496
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,500
Then Skype.

2497
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:54,220
Then the end of the show.

2498
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:56,980
Alright.

2499
02:12:56,980 --> 02:13:02,120
So unfortunately this has nothing to do with the Bay Bridge.

2500
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:10,220
But a game we were talking about for a while now, 3D Dot Game Heroes, which is kind of

2501
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:17,260
an homage to a lot of the old classic 8-bit games, but just kind of in a 3D blocky way.

2502
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:19,700
Pretty much an homage to The Legend of Zelda.

2503
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:26,140
Well thankfully though, the game will be coming out over here in North America.

2504
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:33,020
It's not seeing who's bringing it over, but apparently, I guess, it might even be from

2505
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:39,860
software because how they bring games over here sometimes, but at some point it is going

2506
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:44,580
to come over here because according to the PlayStation Twitter, no need to import 3D

2507
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:51,820
Game Heroes for PS3, it's definitely coming to an A. Spread the word, more to come.

2508
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:53,500
So awesome.

2509
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:56,260
And have you seen the loading screens for this game?

2510
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:58,620
I have to be honest, I don't know a lot about this game.

2511
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:01,980
I just know the little bits I've seen, I'm like, oh that looks kind of neat, but I just

2512
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:05,300
don't really know, I haven't really done my research on that game I guess.

2513
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:10,900
The loading screens for this game have a lot of influence from a bunch of different games

2514
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:18,720
like Mega Man Tetris, Final Fantasy V, they have a Castlevania one, a bunch of different

2515
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:22,860
things in there, Chrono Trigger, Street Fighter.

2516
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:24,060
But they're just inspired, right?

2517
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:26,380
Because you couldn't rip those things off, or they didn't get busted.

2518
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:30,580
Well, they look very similar, they're just done in this art style or whatever.

2519
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:31,580
Interesting.

2520
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:39,340
It's similar enough, so you kind of get the homage, but the game looks awesome.

2521
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:44,420
Well, it's very interesting how that whole lack of region encoding on the PlayStation,

2522
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:48,900
or the PS3 I guess you could say, the open regions or whatever, has kind of changed things

2523
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:49,900
up like that.

2524
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:50,900
Like, I love it.

2525
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:55,260
I wish all the consoles had been region-free, but whatever.

2526
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,260
Stupid laws.

2527
02:14:56,260 --> 02:15:03,900
Anyhow, here's something that folks might want to import, are Blu-rays region protected?

2528
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:10,580
Yes, but in Japan, the Blu-rays, we're the same region as Japan.

2529
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:11,580
Interesting.

2530
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:16,220
Well, maybe Japan might want to import this, or who knows, but there's a Blu-ray release

2531
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:20,700
of District 9 coming out, that was obviously a big movie over here in the US, and it's

2532
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,460
coming out on Blu-ray very soon.

2533
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:23,460
Guess what it's coming with?

2534
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:25,420
It's coming with a video game demo.

2535
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:27,660
That game, God of War 3.

2536
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:31,460
Now, District 9 isn't coming out on Blu-ray until December 29th, I guess it's going to

2537
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:35,900
cash in on the gift cards after the holidays, and that's, by the way, after the God of War

2538
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:40,460
collection, which will also have the God of War 3 demo, but some folks that already had

2539
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:44,100
the first two games may not want to re-buy them, I don't know.

2540
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:45,560
So this will be another option.

2541
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:50,700
If you get District 9, you'll actually get the God of War 3 demo with District 9.

2542
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:55,900
Also, what's kind of interesting, if you play through the demo, a making of featurette will

2543
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:58,540
be unlocked for the game.

2544
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:02,660
Strange, because that really has nothing to do with District 9, except the fact that maybe

2545
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:06,380
it's the same target audience, and they're both from Sony.

2546
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:11,580
It's very similar that, I mean, very interesting that we haven't really seen anything like

2547
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:15,340
that that I can think of before, especially with the unlocks.

2548
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:20,500
Maybe a game demo coming with a movie is incredibly unheard of, especially with a lot of the games

2549
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,500
based on movies.

2550
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:26,280
They had one, and you're going to have to think way back here.

2551
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:31,900
There was the UMD release for Stealth that had a special version of Wipeout with it where

2552
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,820
you can play as a stealth plane.

2553
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:35,200
Oh wow.

2554
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,460
I wouldn't have even thought of that.

2555
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:41,500
Also, just recently, the Watchmen, one of the animated movies came out with a game,

2556
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:45,320
like they did a combo thing there, but this is different, because really, what do God

2557
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:46,940
of War and District 9 have in common?

2558
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:49,440
Not a damn thing, you know?

2559
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:53,380
Except maybe it's the same target audience.

2560
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:56,900
I never did see District 9, though.

2561
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:01,060
I am curious about the God of War 3 demo, though, even though I was never really into

2562
02:17:01,060 --> 02:17:02,060
the first two games.

2563
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:04,420
I think I'm going to pick up that collection, because everybody tells me, you gotta play

2564
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:05,420
God of War.

2565
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:06,420
You gotta play God of War.

2566
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:10,060
So, I'm kind of glad I waited, now I can play him in high def.

2567
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:13,740
Anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype

2568
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:19,520
line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, as always, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one

2569
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:24,040
more story for you guys first.

2570
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:25,660
This is kind of interesting.

2571
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:32,100
Apparently, they do things differently over in Moscow.

2572
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:39,220
They had a Counter-Strike tournament over there, and I guess the promoter for the tournament

2573
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:45,700
decided to throw in a little bit of a different angle into the competition.

2574
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:53,660
They were going to attempt to distract the players using strippers, yes, using women

2575
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:58,340
that are topless and rubbing themselves all over the players.

2576
02:17:58,340 --> 02:18:05,580
Thankfully, though, and this is, I guess, a testament of their dedication to the game,

2577
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:11,980
they were unable to drag those gamers away from Counter-Strike.

2578
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:20,180
A quote here from English Russia reported, it was impossible to put an intention of those

2579
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:23,740
hopeless men off the game.

2580
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:30,100
It was drawing too close, and the ladies were sweating as much as they could, but the eyes

2581
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,300
of the tough players were nailed on the screen tight.

2582
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:38,100
And they have a wonderful gallery to go along with it, and man, they tried everything.

2583
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:46,340
Huh, it's just two things that you think would go together naturally, or what I like to call

2584
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:48,860
the coolest gaming tournament ever.

2585
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:54,660
Maybe they should do a gaming, do you think they could do a gaming tournament like that

2586
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:55,660
here in the US?

2587
02:18:55,660 --> 02:19:00,380
Oh, everyone would complain, but it would be the coolest gaming tournament ever.

2588
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,940
What if a strip club did it?

2589
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:04,820
What if a place of sin did it anyway?

2590
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:10,420
Can you imagine if Centerfolds did, you know what we need to do?

2591
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:13,180
I have a great idea.

2592
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:19,700
We need to approach Centerfolds about having an orange lounge radio gaming tournament at

2593
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:20,700
Centerfolds.

2594
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,820
Wouldn't that be amazing?

2595
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:28,860
Or I shouldn't give this one particular strip club free promotion, but this is the one I

2596
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:30,500
drive by all the time.

2597
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,460
There's Showgirls and City Limits and a lot of these other clubs too.

2598
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:38,540
We should try to have a gaming tournament at a strip club.

2599
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:40,180
Wouldn't that be fun?

2600
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,900
That would be funny.

2601
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:43,300
The wife would go?

2602
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:46,260
That would be funny.

2603
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:57,940
I don't know if that would work, or be feasible, or even make money, but it's a funny idea.

2604
02:19:57,940 --> 02:20:00,720
I think it's funnier though because they had no idea it was coming.

2605
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:06,980
If you're in a strip club, you kind of know what to prepare yourself for.

2606
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:12,940
But I'm just saying, I'm surprised this has never been marketed before, that just games

2607
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:14,780
and strippers together in one roof.

2608
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:15,780
It would have to be something that-

2609
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:17,580
As long as you don't serve liquor, it's legal.

2610
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:22,140
Something that really requires a lot of concentration, like irritating stick or something like that.

2611
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:25,180
It's like, holy shit, nah.

2612
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:28,940
Or a perfect attack tournament in DDR as topless women run by or something.

2613
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,940
I don't know.

2614
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,940
That would be tough.

2615
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:31,940
I don't know.

2616
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:38,820
If you want to comment on that or any other story we've talked about tonight, why don't

2617
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:39,820
you give us a call?

2618
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:43,980
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

2619
02:20:43,980 --> 02:20:46,340
The Skype line is now open for business.

2620
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,700
We've already got a call coming in.

2621
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:48,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2622
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:49,700
Who's this?

2623
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:50,700
Hello.

2624
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:51,700
It's Ray Iyanami.

2625
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:53,580
Well, hello, Ray Iyanami.

2626
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:54,580
How are you?

2627
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:55,580
What's on your mind tonight?

2628
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:56,580
Okay.

2629
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,580
I just came back from YaoiCon.

2630
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,580
YaoiCon?

2631
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:00,580
Yeah.

2632
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,580
Wasn't that going on in San Francisco?

2633
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:03,580
San Mateo specifically.

2634
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:09,340
Oh, so I was a little ways away because I was thinking as I was driving through Japantown

2635
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:13,300
because the theater I do Rocky Horror at is right near Japantown in San Francisco, and

2636
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:16,420
I was thinking like, I wonder if this is where YaoiCon is going on right now.

2637
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:19,900
I should like swing by and say hello even though I had no ticket.

2638
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:23,420
I was like, try to use my media poll or lack thereof.

2639
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:29,900
Well, I believe this is the third year during holding it in San Mateo.

2640
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:30,900
Apparently I missed the boat.

2641
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:31,900
Well, okay.

2642
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:34,400
So you went to YaoiCon.

2643
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,520
That must have been interesting.

2644
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,520
How was that?

2645
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,520
It's all right.

2646
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:44,980
Like, the other thing is you couldn't tell it was a ton specifically for living in Yaoi.

2647
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:50,220
If you're like looking inside the hotel lobby, you have to go like the tiles or all the interesting

2648
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:56,340
activities to see all the Yaoi-ness.

2649
02:21:56,340 --> 02:22:00,460
Now I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything, but I have to ask this question

2650
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:05,820
and feel free to pass on this if you want, but you identify as a straight male, right?

2651
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:06,820
Mostly straight.

2652
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:07,820
So, okay.

2653
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,820
So what were you doing going to YaoiCon?

2654
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:11,820
Just because that's where all the horny women are?

2655
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:12,820
On the television.

2656
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,820
Oh, okay.

2657
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,820
For fun.

2658
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:15,820
There you go.

2659
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:22,940
But I feel mostly straight, I feel like real life guys make me go, man.

2660
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:29,900
It's mostly like anime and video game guys that make me say I'm only mostly straight.

2661
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:30,900
Interesting.

2662
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:31,900
Okay.

2663
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:33,820
Well, then Yaoi kind of taps into that whole thing, I guess.

2664
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:35,060
So hey, cool.

2665
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:38,220
I'm just kind of curious because I actually know, like, it's interesting because like

2666
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:41,420
I know a lot of straight guys that like to go to these types of things like YaoiCon.

2667
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:44,580
Like it seems like a lot of the reports I read are from straight guys and I'm kind of

2668
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:48,340
like, okay, well, that kind of reminds me of like when all the straight people started

2669
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:49,380
coming into the gay bar.

2670
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:54,780
Like obviously, you know, there's, be who you want to be, just, you know, don't infringe

2671
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:55,780
on other people's rights.

2672
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:56,980
It doesn't really matter.

2673
02:22:56,980 --> 02:23:01,700
But at the same time, when all the straight people started showing up at the gay bar,

2674
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:05,620
wasn't really a gay bar anymore and everybody went somewhere else.

2675
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:06,620
But whatever.

2676
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,620
Love who you want to love.

2677
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:16,740
I went to a few panels and stuff like the Bishon auction, where things start to really

2678
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:17,740
get interesting.

2679
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:24,260
Like their bids are doing as high as like $500 and guys sitting at their clothes, like

2680
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:30,540
the guys on auction doing sitting at their clothes left and right among other things.

2681
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:34,300
I just realized some of our chatters don't know what Yaoi is and sometimes we take that

2682
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:37,380
kind of stuff for granted that we just assume everybody knows what it is, but of course

2683
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:38,700
not everybody knows what it is.

2684
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:39,700
Yeah.

2685
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:41,980
What do you, would you like to explain it?

2686
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:42,980
Okay.

2687
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:43,980
Go for it.

2688
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:44,980
Okay.

2689
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:51,460
Basically Yaoi is like male on male erotic anime or manga.

2690
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:54,140
But it's not, but, but this is important to also state.

2691
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:55,140
It's not porn.

2692
02:23:55,140 --> 02:24:00,900
Like, it's just like, yeah, I have some, the focus.

2693
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:01,900
Anyways.

2694
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:02,900
Yeah.

2695
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:07,980
What I've noticed from what you guys have seen is mostly focused on the romance, like

2696
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:15,300
if I walk into a random room showing Yaoi, there's a very low chance I'll walk into a

2697
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:16,300
sex scene.

2698
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:17,300
Interesting.

2699
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:23,900
Like I'll just walk into them having a converse, a pretty deep conversation or whatever.

2700
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:24,900
All right.

2701
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:27,340
Now I started a whole little argument on whether it's porn or not.

2702
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:33,180
I think that it gets though to the, the disturbing point though, when it's Shota, which is little

2703
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:35,620
boys, that's disgusting.

2704
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:36,620
That's not okay.

2705
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:39,260
That's not okay.

2706
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:42,140
Do what you want to do as long as they're 18 or over.

2707
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:43,140
Okay.

2708
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:44,140
That's the key thing.

2709
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:45,140
All right.

2710
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:46,140
Anyway, we are digressing completely.

2711
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:48,780
Did they have gaming or anything going on at Yaoi Con?

2712
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:52,460
They have a gaming room, but it was mostly fighting games.

2713
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:58,340
Perfect product on an PS2 on an HDTV, which translates to, yay lag.

2714
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:05,060
And there's a lot of Rockland and DDR, but I didn't really play either of those.

2715
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:06,060
This is a great description.

2716
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:07,060
I'm sorry.

2717
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:10,860
This is a great description from SSJ100 Matt in chat room saying it's Brokeback Mountain

2718
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:15,700
romantic type manga, but even Brokeback Mountain, and I'm adding to this, even Brokeback Mountain

2719
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:16,700
had a sex scene.

2720
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:23,740
There was a scene where Heath Ledger friended James Villanelle's butt.

2721
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:27,540
What else about the gaming did you want to say?

2722
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:33,900
But yeah, I tried playing Para Para Paradise on their set up there, and it was on HDTV,

2723
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:42,100
and it was played on San Diego Girlfriend's 3DS machine between 2004 and no, 2003, 2007,

2724
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:47,820
and knows how bad rhythm games are on an HDTV with no upscaling.

2725
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:53,900
Yeah, it's nice that the newer games at least will kind of allow you to set the lag where

2726
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:58,420
you want, but yeah, a lot of those older music games, it was, if your TV lags, then it sucks

2727
02:25:58,420 --> 02:25:59,420
to be you.

2728
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:04,620
Yeah, I normally don't feel it's also a Para Para Paradise, but I was feeling songs that

2729
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:10,540
in the arcade, I could clearly pass with no problem, just mainly rage quit.

2730
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:11,540
Alright.

2731
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:13,620
Well, I'm glad to hear you had fun at the convention.

2732
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:16,380
Do you think you're going to go back next year?

2733
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:18,660
Hopefully.

2734
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:19,900
One of these years I'll go.

2735
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:23,020
I always say I'm going to go to YALIcon, but then it's just like, it's always just at a

2736
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:26,100
bad time for me, but one of these years I'll get there, hopefully next year.

2737
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:27,980
I liked it the one time I went.

2738
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:29,900
Yeah, I at least want to make a cameo.

2739
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:33,460
Alright, well anyway, we're going to let you go, Ray, so we can get some more calls, but

2740
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:36,220
thank you very much, and we'll talk to you again soon, okay?

2741
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:38,140
Okay, I'll see you later.

2742
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:43,220
1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype, orange lounger radio, if you want to give us a call.

2743
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:50,140
While we wait for some calls, although I saw the, oh, here, it's ringing again.

2744
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:52,140
I hate, can I just say this?

2745
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:54,900
I hate the new Skype.

2746
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:57,060
I cannot stand it.

2747
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:01,580
Ever since they changed the skin and everything, this new little blue thing, it's like, if

2748
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:04,140
I miss the little pop-up for a call, I'm screwed.

2749
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:05,140
I can't answer it.

2750
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:08,220
It's just, I wish there was a way to go back to the old interface.

2751
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:11,100
I'm missing calls now because of it, but that's okay, we got another one.

2752
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:13,100
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2753
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,100
Hey, this is X-Link.

2754
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:16,940
Hi, X-Link, how are you, buddy?

2755
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:17,940
What's on your mind?

2756
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:18,940
Hey, doing good.

2757
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:23,620
Just celebrated my birthday yesterday, had a lot of fun doing that, but...

2758
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:24,620
Well, happy birthday.

2759
02:27:24,620 --> 02:27:25,620
Wait, you were at Halloween?

2760
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:26,620
No, I was calling in.

2761
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:27,620
You were at Halloween, baby?

2762
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:28,620
Yeah, my birthday was on Halloween.

2763
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,620
Alright.

2764
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:32,460
Yes, yes, unfortunately I was one of the two.

2765
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:34,820
You're probably sick of people commenting on that, so...

2766
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:38,660
I was calling in because...

2767
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:39,660
Go ahead, you're calling in because...

2768
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:40,660
I'm sorry.

2769
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:46,780
I was calling in because the game I recently picked up not too long ago, which I'm having

2770
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:52,460
a lot of fun with, was Press Your Luck 2010, which I know you guys talked about that before

2771
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:58,060
and how excited we were because of it coming out pretty soon, and it was released on Tuesday.

2772
02:27:58,060 --> 02:27:59,520
I didn't even realize this.

2773
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:03,140
What system is this for, the Wii?

2774
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:04,140
It was for the Wii.

2775
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:10,860
I picked up the PC version because I also picked up the Price is Right 2010 and then

2776
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:14,460
they also released Family Feud for 2010 also.

2777
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:17,180
Well, this is like game show heaven going on right now.

2778
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:21,300
Well, briefly describe for our listeners Press Your Luck and your impressions on it, if you

2779
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,300
would.

2780
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:25,260
Oh, I loved it.

2781
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,740
It was exactly like it would play on the game show.

2782
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:33,180
The only difference is they will start out with the first round, they'll give out a question,

2783
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:39,740
you have the buzz in, and instead of typing in an answer or saying the answer like normally

2784
02:28:39,740 --> 02:28:46,740
you would say on the game show, they'll give you four choices based on the selection.

2785
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:51,100
If you have the answer for the question right and you're the first one to buzz in, you would

2786
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:56,720
get three spins because you get two spins for getting it right and a bonus spin for

2787
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,220
having the right answer.

2788
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:01,020
They do four questions per round.

2789
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:05,540
Once you do the four questions, then they turn around and you face the board and then

2790
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:09,420
you would do the spinning for the money and prizes.

2791
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:13,900
Of course, the infamous no whammies, no whammies, stop.

2792
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:19,780
Yeah, and if you get four, you get a chance, basically they'll give you like four chances.

2793
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,900
If you get whammy, it's okay, you can still spin again.

2794
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:30,740
If you feel like you got high enough money, you can pass off the spins to another player.

2795
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:35,700
That's how it's more strategic if it comes down near the end of the game and you're like,

2796
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:40,100
oh, well, I have 4,000 more than the other player to have an extra spin.

2797
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:44,740
You can pass that off and hopefully that person would get the whammy or not get enough money

2798
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:47,460
to overpass you in the amount.

2799
02:29:47,460 --> 02:29:49,020
Does the game have the cool whammy animations?

2800
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:51,020
I love it.

2801
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,020
Yes, it does.

2802
02:29:53,020 --> 02:29:57,380
In the fact of loading, when it loads in between the screens, it will do some kind of whammy

2803
02:29:57,380 --> 02:30:01,620
thing where it will show the whammies doing different stuff, which is kind of cool.

2804
02:30:01,620 --> 02:30:03,620
It sounds like it would be a really fun party game.

2805
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:06,460
You just get a bunch of friends together and play some Press Your Luck and that sounds

2806
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:08,460
like it could be a lot of fun.

2807
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:11,940
Yes, definitely.

2808
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:17,620
If anybody likes the Price is Right, I definitely recommend the Wii version because the wheel

2809
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:22,100
spinning is a lot of fun with the Wii remote, so it's a lot better than it is on the PC.

2810
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:24,900
These sound like these could be dumb little party games that would actually be a lot of

2811
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,380
fun.

2812
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:31,820
Even though I think a lot of us hardcore gamers would pass off these games, it's like shovelware.

2813
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:35,620
I bet these games are a lot of fun when you have a big group of people, especially those

2814
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:36,900
that don't regularly play games.

2815
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:37,900
It is.

2816
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:38,900
Everybody knows Press Your Luck.

2817
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:44,020
Yes, it's a lot of fun and for 20 bucks, you can't really beat that price for some lenses

2818
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:45,020
too.

2819
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:46,020
It's very cheap.

2820
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:47,020
That's a really good price.

2821
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:48,940
Well, thank you very much for the ReviewX link.

2822
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,700
I might just have to pick that up.

2823
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,860
Do you have any other comments or thoughts on tonight's show for the listeners?

2824
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:59,580
No, I just can't believe that guy didn't get into trouble for the hospital bed.

2825
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:01,380
You would think for sure he would get into some kind of trouble.

2826
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:05,620
That would be like me going out, shooting somebody in cold blood and going, oh, well,

2827
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:10,100
I seen it happen on Left 4 Dead, so I didn't know that was going to happen when I shot

2828
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:12,100
somebody for real or GTA.

2829
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:14,860
Yeah, it's basically the equivalent of an insanity plea.

2830
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:20,140
No, no, he did get an insanity plea because he was actually hallucinating.

2831
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:24,780
Still, though, it's a darn good thing no one died.

2832
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:29,020
All right, X-Link, we're going to let you go, but have a great week, okay?

2833
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:30,020
Yeah.

2834
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:31,020
Later.

2835
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:32,020
Definitely, you too.

2836
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:33,020
Thanks.

2837
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:35,260
All right, we're going to try to take some more calls here.

2838
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:38,180
I just want to stress, I really hate the new Skype.

2839
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:42,780
In fact, I want to find the old version and download that instead, if I can.

2840
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:44,780
We'll try to do at least one more call here tonight.

2841
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:47,260
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeOnsRadio.

2842
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:48,580
Hi, you're on OrangeOnsRadio.

2843
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:49,580
Who's this?

2844
02:31:49,580 --> 02:31:51,580
Hi, this is Spaz here.

2845
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:52,580
Hi, Spaznator.

2846
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:54,860
What's on your mind?

2847
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:56,860
Yeah, a couple things.

2848
02:31:56,860 --> 02:32:06,820
First off, I don't know if you saw my one tweet, but I get news about home.

2849
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:08,700
Yeah, what's that?

2850
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:09,700
What's...

2851
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:16,900
Yeah, it's not like major, major news, but I just thought it would be a match because

2852
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:22,660
of the little turn the show took earlier on.

2853
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:24,420
Yeah, am I going to be able to have sex in home?

2854
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,420
Is that the update?

2855
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:26,420
Well, not really.

2856
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:37,400
I don't know if we checked the mall lately or not, but if you go to the furniture store

2857
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:49,940
on the first floor, there's some really shitty items in there, quite literally, they got

2858
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:51,460
toilets in there now.

2859
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:54,300
Wait, like, you can buy poop?

2860
02:32:54,300 --> 02:33:02,020
Well, I think you have to fly the poop yourself, but they got toilets in there now, and we're

2861
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:03,020
with two of them.

2862
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:12,540
In fact, in the store right now, and I'm highlighting them, there's a golden toilet, and they're

2863
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:19,660
calling it the golden throne, and they're selling it for, damn it, I got the error for

2864
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:20,660
price.

2865
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:27,560
It's kind of expensive, last time I checked it was like $3.99 or something like that.

2866
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:32,060
So I can pay three bucks to have a virtual loo in Sony Home.

2867
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:33,060
That's amazing.

2868
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:38,180
Yeah, and they got a second one there, it looks like a porcelain toilet, and they're

2869
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:43,740
calling it take a load off the chair, and they're charging $0.99 for it.

2870
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:46,740
Maybe I should buy one of those.

2871
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:51,100
I need to buy one of those for the oil army clubhouse and just put it in the center stage.

2872
02:33:51,100 --> 02:34:01,780
Yeah, and in fact, it's a perfect transition for the second topic, you know, they mentioned

2873
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:02,780
a tweet.

2874
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:06,900
Yeah, since you guys were plugging Twitter and Facebook and all that earlier, you guys

2875
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:14,020
just kind of forgot to mention the oil, the army club within Home.

2876
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:16,900
That's true, we do have the oil army club with Home, but the reason why we don't mention

2877
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:20,140
it is because we actually do things with the Twitter and stuff, but it's really hard to

2878
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:22,340
do things with the clubhouse.

2879
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:28,700
One reason we bought that is so that when Sony starts letting us use the TV for a purpose,

2880
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:34,040
or maybe we can stream clips of our show somehow, or just kind of let us put our own custom

2881
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:39,980
touch somehow and make it an Orange Lawns Radio experience, then we'll be right on it

2882
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:44,260
and ready to go and already have people in there to go see it, but right now, the way

2883
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:51,620
Home is, there's not a lot I can do with it, which is unfortunate.

2884
02:34:51,620 --> 02:34:58,860
The one thing I want to say, not so much to you guys, but other listeners out there, is

2885
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:06,660
that you, Rob, were nice enough to shell out the four or five bucks for the club, you know,

2886
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:14,220
the least the rest of us listeners can do is show our appreciation, you use club that

2887
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:16,940
you shell out the money for, you know?

2888
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:22,540
It seems like John Dole one day ever shows up in there, and every time I show up there,

2889
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:26,300
there's no one there, so I'm conveniently missing.

2890
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:30,780
Maybe one of these nights, we'll have to plan like on a Tuesday night randomly or something,

2891
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:34,620
we'll have like a Sony Home night at seven o'clock and just like have a big clusterfuck

2892
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:38,160
dance party in the, because I don't know what else you do in Home, but dance, hopefully

2893
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:44,620
somebody will show up in a hamster outfit, we'll do a dance party in Sony Home.

2894
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:49,220
What's great is that Jamie's, hold on, Jamie's husband, Dan, walked by, right, as I was saying.

2895
02:35:49,220 --> 02:35:51,220
Maybe somebody will dress up as a hamster or something.

2896
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:53,020
I could only be talking about Sony Home, of course.

2897
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:55,020
Well, it wasn't the hamster thing, it was the whole Sony Home.

2898
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:57,020
Oh, the whole Sony Home thing, oh, I'm sorry.

2899
02:35:57,020 --> 02:35:58,020
All right, sorry, Spaz in the air.

2900
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,020
Anything else on your mind real quick before we let you go?

2901
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:07,060
You know, I did have something, oh yeah, I was going to mention the whole talking to,

2902
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:10,540
you know, having the callers talk to the Seaman game.

2903
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:11,540
Yes.

2904
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:18,340
Yeah, and one thing in regards to having me do it, it probably would make for bad radio

2905
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:24,780
simply because, you know, me and anything that has to do with speech recognition software

2906
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:31,100
doesn't really mesh all that well simply because obviously you can tell from this phone call

2907
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:34,340
I have, you know, slight speech impediment.

2908
02:36:34,340 --> 02:36:36,940
You know what, dude, it wouldn't just be you.

2909
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:44,100
Those programs always stink at recognizing speech, whether it be an accent or just impediment

2910
02:36:44,100 --> 02:36:49,540
or just the way you talk, just depending on how you were raised, those games never accurately

2911
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,540
can gauge you.

2912
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:52,220
Like, look at a game like brain training.

2913
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:56,620
Like if you want brain training to recognize that you're saying blue, you have to literally

2914
02:36:56,620 --> 02:37:02,100
sit there and say, brew, brew, and that's the only way you can get it to recognize it.

2915
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:07,340
And I'm not trying to sound, you know, rude or anything, but that's just the way the game

2916
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:08,340
works.

2917
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:09,340
It doesn't work otherwise.

2918
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:10,340
I can't even get right on his by that game.

2919
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:12,860
Anyways, Spaznator, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show, but

2920
02:37:12,860 --> 02:37:17,740
thanks so much as always for your call and I can't promise the Seaman things never going

2921
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:18,740
to happen.

2922
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:19,740
So just so you know.

2923
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:20,740
All right.

2924
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:21,740
Later.

2925
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:22,740
All right.

2926
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:24,720
Anyhow, thanks so much to all our callers tonight.

2927
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:27,620
We are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line just because I'm that annoyed with

2928
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:29,560
Skype tonight and it's not the callers.

2929
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:30,560
Not at all.

2930
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,560
Callers are great.

2931
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:32,560
The program itself.

2932
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:36,020
I'm a little mad at, I think we might need to upgrade the show computer.

2933
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:37,020
I don't know.

2934
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:38,020
It's just, I don't know.

2935
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:39,020
We do have that extra.

2936
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:40,020
I didn't they send us.

2937
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:41,020
Yeah, we got that extra thing.

2938
02:37:41,020 --> 02:37:42,180
What's, where's, where's that computer?

2939
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:43,180
We got it.

2940
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:45,060
It's still in my room.

2941
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:48,260
Bring it over next week and let's see if we can't just get the sound card out of this

2942
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:49,260
beast into that thing.

2943
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:50,900
Let's play jigsaw puzzle with the new computer.

2944
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:53,900
Because if not, then the new computer can be used for video because I know we were going

2945
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:56,100
to, we were saving that to use for a video and then it didn't happen.

2946
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:59,660
So listen, we got to get use out of that, but Skype is annoying the shit out of me on

2947
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:00,660
this thing.

2948
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:02,660
But this, this computer is getting old.

2949
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:08,580
So we definitely have to invest in extra box of oops, I crapped my pants because like,

2950
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:09,940
you know, they bought that months ago.

2951
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:10,940
We'd never used it.

2952
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:12,840
And it's, you know, not trying to be disrespectful.

2953
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:16,020
We had, we were going to use it for something they didn't take off.

2954
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:23,100
So we'll, we'll, we'll find another way to use it anyhow.

2955
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:25,780
I think it's time for us to go and wrap up the show.

2956
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:27,340
I have some final story.

2957
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:28,340
Oh my gosh.

2958
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:29,340
I'm so sorry.

2959
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:30,340
I forgot we didn't do those yet.

2960
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:31,940
I did mine for the FU.

2961
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:32,940
I'm sorry.

2962
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:35,140
I thought you were going to talk about this movie.

2963
02:38:35,140 --> 02:38:36,140
Yeah.

2964
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:40,620
Um, the silent Hill movie is, uh, going to start filming next year.

2965
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:41,620
Silent Hill 2.

2966
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:42,620
I didn't take your story.

2967
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:49,180
And a dude, uh, was in a, uh, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

2968
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:50,180
What did?

2969
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,180
Oh, the rider?

2970
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:52,180
Yeah.

2971
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:53,180
Oh yeah.

2972
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:54,180
I heard about that one.

2973
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:55,180
What a mess.

2974
02:38:55,180 --> 02:38:56,180
Don't drive drunk.

2975
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:57,180
Loki.

2976
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:58,180
Last minute stories.

2977
02:38:58,180 --> 02:38:59,180
Yes.

2978
02:38:59,180 --> 02:39:06,700
So Nintendo is apparently hinting that a free 3g internet, um, with its next gen DS system

2979
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:08,660
might be something that they're working on.

2980
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:15,100
Um, apparently a water is, um, quoted saying that, uh, I'm interested because it's a new

2981
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:19,960
business model in which the user doesn't bear the communications costs.

2982
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:25,620
Only the people who can pay thousands of yen a month can be iPhone customers.

2983
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:30,940
That doesn't fit Nintendo's customers because we make amusement products.

2984
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:36,180
In reality, if we did this, it would, um, increase the cost of hardware and the consumers

2985
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:42,420
would complain about Nintendo putting prices up, but it's, uh, it is one option for the

2986
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:43,420
future.

2987
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:48,220
Um, that would be pretty awesome if you can get unlimited 3g internet through like a DS

2988
02:39:48,220 --> 02:39:49,380
or something.

2989
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:56,980
But the problem is one little small, easy little problem with their statement there.

2990
02:39:56,980 --> 02:40:03,740
They haven't embraced online yet, so, um, all the free online, you know, thrown into

2991
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:10,620
your next gen console doesn't mean shit to me since you haven't really embraced online.

2992
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:11,620
I mean, okay.

2993
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:16,300
Yeah, we wear in, you know, DSI wear, but your infrastructure infrastructure sucks and

2994
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:19,620
your friend's code sucks even more, so.

2995
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:20,620
Yeah.

2996
02:40:20,620 --> 02:40:26,420
Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there is a brand new Wiimote attachment and I know

2997
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:30,300
I have talked about this on the show, but not a lot of people remember it.

2998
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:38,180
It's a game called Baby and Me, but I was completely unaware of this brand new, um,

2999
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:39,180
bundle I guess they have.

3000
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:41,420
It's a special edition.

3001
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:45,060
Um, this is the game I told you where you can holster your baby.

3002
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:52,620
Basically it has a remote holster for a baby doll, but, but that's not all.

3003
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:58,580
Apparently, um, not over here, but in Australia, they're getting a special edition and what

3004
02:40:58,580 --> 02:41:01,140
does this special edition include?

3005
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:05,700
But a baby doll attachment for your Wii remote.

3006
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:07,160
Yes.

3007
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:12,780
Sickly enough, you will be inserting the Wii remote into that baby.

3008
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:21,520
But that's, wow, that's kind of crazy.

3009
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:30,900
And then, um, last but not least, American McGee's Alice is coming back for a sequel.

3010
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:35,780
The Return of Alice, um, it's going to be the next, um, game that he's doing.

3011
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:41,380
He's got a nice little teaser trailer online and it looks creepy, so I'm sure that it's

3012
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:48,020
going to be coming to the PC later on, but, uh, Return of Alice coming from American McGee.

3013
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:51,220
Wasn't there supposed to be like a movie tie-in to this a long time ago?

3014
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:54,740
There was supposed to be an American McGee Alice movie, uh, it was like with Wino or

3015
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:59,140
Ryder at one time, so I don't know if that's still, I don't think that's happening anymore.

3016
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:02,860
Well, now there's the, um, Tim Burton one.

3017
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:06,100
Oh yeah, that's true and I think that's kind of it.

3018
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:09,700
Like I think when this Tim Burton one comes out, there really won't be a need for the

3019
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:11,500
American McGee one because you'll get your dark.

3020
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:15,980
American McGee's going to be even darker than, I mean, Tim Burton, he's dark, but he's like,

3021
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:20,980
you know, bubblegum dark, you know, he's like, he's like hot topic dark, okay.

3022
02:42:20,980 --> 02:42:24,300
I went to hang out with some friends over the weekend, um, for Halloween.

3023
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:28,500
We, um, they're, they're my friends that I play Warcraft with now and, um, we watched

3024
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:29,500
some, uh, movies.

3025
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:30,500
This was Halloween.

3026
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:33,300
We watched Showgirls because, you know, we have to watch something scary, but then we

3027
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:37,580
started, um, Starling, except I love Showgirls.

3028
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:38,580
Don't get me started.

3029
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:39,580
That's one of my favorite movies.

3030
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,580
It's so bad.

3031
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:41,580
It's good.

3032
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:44,500
We need to watch that again, but the other thing about this, it's not coming back until

3033
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:45,500
2011.

3034
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:46,500
Oh, well yeah.

3035
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:47,500
Games take time to develop.

3036
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:51,620
But anyway, what I wanted to say also, we watched Sleepy Hollow, which is a Tim Burton

3037
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:52,620
movie.

3038
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:53,620
That movie's pretty dark.

3039
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:54,620
That's not bubblegum dark.

3040
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:56,180
That's, that's legitimately dark.

3041
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:57,580
Just saying.

3042
02:42:57,580 --> 02:43:02,020
We watched on fast forward the original Wicker Man.

3043
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:04,020
Wow.

3044
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:08,980
We almost watched Sleepaway Camp two and three.

3045
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:09,980
None of them are good.

3046
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:10,980
I know.

3047
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:11,980
We knew that.

3048
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,980
The original Sleepaway Camp.

3049
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:16,140
We were just curious with the Wicker Man if it was, you know, similar to the remake.

3050
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:21,860
Which by the way, to all of our listeners, 17 and over, because it's an R-rated movie,

3051
02:43:21,860 --> 02:43:26,900
next Halloween, or if you'll be 17 by next Halloween, you need to rent Sleepaway Camp.

3052
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:29,980
It is the ultimate awesome Halloween movie.

3053
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:34,500
And if you've never seen it and you don't know anything about it, good.

3054
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,580
Keep it that way until you watch the movie.

3055
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:43,420
Because I'll tell you what, best twist ending ever, ever.

3056
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:45,060
That movie was made, what, in like the 80s?

3057
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:47,360
And it's very, it's a very like little quotable movie too.

3058
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:49,820
It's so bad it's funny.

3059
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:50,820
So there you go.

3060
02:43:50,820 --> 02:43:55,780
They have a new one that came out that has apparently some of the original cast in it.

3061
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:56,780
Ridiculous.

3062
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:59,980
Tigerclaw had sent me a link as well, wanting me to mention this.

3063
02:43:59,980 --> 02:44:02,780
And I remember hearing about this earlier in the week.

3064
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:05,220
Apparently a sequel to Showgirls is being made.

3065
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:06,220
What?

3066
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:10,380
That's supposed to center around hope, which was, do you remember like there was like kind

3067
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:14,420
of the bimbo girl that was following in Nomi's footsteps at the strip club and all that and

3068
02:44:14,420 --> 02:44:18,580
was screwing the dancer guy that Nomi was screwing?

3069
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:22,500
Well, apparently the movie is supposed to center around her, but I got, I'll one up

3070
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,500
you with this.

3071
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:27,840
The original Showgirls sequel that would have actually starred Elizabeth Berkley and everybody

3072
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:34,220
because this movie was supposed to be huge, was supposed to take place in LA or Hollywood.

3073
02:44:34,220 --> 02:44:38,220
That's why at the very end of the movie when they're driving away, OMG spoilers, they're

3074
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:42,500
going to LA because the second movie was supposed to be Nomi Takes Hollywood, which would have

3075
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,500
been awesome.

3076
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:44,500
Why would they do that?

3077
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:45,500
She's not doing anything.

3078
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:48,540
I mean, she hosts like a dance show, doesn't she?

3079
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:50,380
She doesn't do anything.

3080
02:44:50,380 --> 02:44:54,140
She's just, she's unemployed right now.

3081
02:44:54,140 --> 02:44:55,540
I mean, come on.

3082
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:56,540
I love it.

3083
02:44:56,540 --> 02:44:57,680
We've already seen her breasts.

3084
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,900
It's not even that big a deal anymore.

3085
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:03,860
Salacious pop and chat, of course, knows exactly what I'm talking about and gives us the quote

3086
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:04,860
there.

3087
02:45:04,860 --> 02:45:05,860
No one wants to fuck a penny.

3088
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:09,260
They want to fuck a heather or a hope.

3089
02:45:09,260 --> 02:45:10,260
Forget it.

3090
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:15,260
And the estimated Satsuma follows that with Showgirls 2 should have a video game tourney.

3091
02:45:15,260 --> 02:45:22,500
It's like, just throw everything tonight into a big blender and you have the ultimate OLR

3092
02:45:22,500 --> 02:45:23,500
live event.

3093
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:27,180
Anyhow, it's time for us to start wrapping up the show.

3094
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:29,580
Go around and give everybody, I'm sorry, did we get all the last minute stories tonight?

3095
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:30,580
That was it.

3096
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:31,580
Okay.

3097
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:33,060
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3098
02:45:33,060 --> 02:45:34,220
Um, Loki, I'll start with you.

3099
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:35,220
Your final thought.

3100
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:39,360
Final thought is I need the fine steering wheel for my main cabinet.

3101
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:44,260
My final thought is I really want a taco from gym boys, even if Jamie hates it.

3102
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:49,540
Uh, Jamie, what's your final thought tonight?

3103
02:45:49,540 --> 02:45:51,340
Did you watch the grudge for Halloween?

3104
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:52,340
No.

3105
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:53,340
Oh.

3106
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:57,100
Um, I remember when you were like really into the ring and those books and all that.

3107
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:58,740
I don't know if you, or ringoo and all that.

3108
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:01,860
This gal at my work dressed up as Samara and she did a really good job.

3109
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:03,860
This is such a really good costume.

3110
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:04,860
That's cool.

3111
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:05,860
Yeah.

3112
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:06,860
Just made me think of you.

3113
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:07,860
Cause I know you like used to really be into that whole series.

3114
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:08,860
It's still into it.

3115
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:09,860
Actually.

3116
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:17,340
I need to find my copy of a, um, uh, loop again so I can read it cause that was my favorite

3117
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,340
of those books.

3118
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:19,340
All right.

3119
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,860
Well, until she reads that book and we have something to talk about, we'll be back next

3120
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:23,860
week.

3121
02:46:23,860 --> 02:46:24,860
Hey, if you guys enjoy the show.

3122
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:25,860
Oh, wait, wait.

3123
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:26,860
I've been challenged.

3124
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:27,860
To what?

3125
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:30,460
Um, ionotropic says extended death rattle.

3126
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:31,860
What?

3127
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:35,260
Knock it off.

3128
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:36,980
No, stop.

3129
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:37,980
I'm gonna unplug.

3130
02:46:37,980 --> 02:46:38,980
Where's she on the mixing board here.

3131
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:39,980
Stop it.

3132
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:40,980
I need to get my thing.

3133
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:41,980
Then you can death rattle us out.

3134
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:42,980
Oh my God.

3135
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:43,980
That's annoying.

3136
02:46:43,980 --> 02:46:44,980
Shut up.

3137
02:46:44,980 --> 02:46:45,980
All right.

3138
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:51,820
Um, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio after that.

3139
02:46:51,820 --> 02:46:55,380
I'm so sure you're going to run and tell two friends about our show, but please tell others

3140
02:46:55,380 --> 02:47:00,440
about our show and help spread the word because we don't have any corporate magazine or game

3141
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:01,440
company behind us.

3142
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:05,060
We rely on word of mouth to spread the word, but just not Jamie's mouth.

3143
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:06,060
All right.

3144
02:47:06,060 --> 02:47:07,060
Okay.

3145
02:47:07,060 --> 02:47:08,060
Excellent.

3146
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:09,060
Set again again.

3147
02:47:09,060 --> 02:47:10,060
Cause the things that come out of that are filthy.

3148
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:11,060
So until then.

3149
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:12,060
And full of phlegm.

3150
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:13,060
Have a great week.

3151
02:47:13,060 --> 02:47:14,060
We'll see you next time.

3152
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:15,060
Here on orange launch radio.

3153
02:47:15,060 --> 02:47:16,060
Oh my God.

3154
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:17,060
Her noise made the dolls fall over.

3155
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:18,060
Happy Halloween.

3156
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:19,060
