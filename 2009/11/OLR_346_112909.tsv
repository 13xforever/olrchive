14232	14812	Thank you for watching!
31394	31754	DarkSakura
56075	56155	Rawr.
56175	56415	Rawr.
86235	89918	Techmaster Loki, also joining us every week here on the program.
89938	90058	No.
90078	90639	No, would not be fun.
116544	141766	Hey, also our chat room is always here chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you'd like to join it and say hello to us and of course we always like to interact with our chat room who right now is razzing me for a technical difficulty we had before tonight's show started but those of you on the podcast, it'll all be fixed by the time you hear it so yeah, if you want to hear all the good technical difficulties not that we usually edit a lot of things but most of this is very uncensored radio we don't really filter anything out but
141966	143507	I'm sorry, should I call it a blog cast?
165615	166635	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
188064	193707	I've, whoa, I played World of Warcraft today and Sims yesterday.
194888	201512	And I downloaded another game that I'm going to try out that I've heard lots of good things about.
201732	205534	And, you know, I have to pull it up on, actually I have to pull up iTunes so that I can find it.
206214	211257	But it's a little shooting game, like a, like a Gradius type of shooter.
212138	215259	And, you know, I just, I just downloaded it.
215820	216200	I'll find it.
216946	218888	All right, meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?
220130	224074	I honestly didn't play a lot, which is sad, because we had four days off.
225455	228819	No, I decided to go ahead and I played a little bit.
229640	236648	I brought out the Wii when I went over to my sister's house, and we played a little bit of Excitebots and...
237697	241240	Then also, of course, more Grand Theft Auto this week.
242962	246184	But mainly, I've been busy doing other things.
246645	258835	And that would be, for some reason, and I don't know why, during the day on Tuesday this week, I just said, hey, you know what?
258935	261517	I'm going to turn a PSP into a MAME cabinet.
262638	263759	So that's what I've been doing.
264199	265521	I've been taking a PSP...
267277	270660	You get the most random ass little inspirations.
272061	280430	My favorite will always be when you walked in here, episode 300 last year, and you walked in here in your Sackboy costume like, Hey guys, I made a Sackboy costume!
280550	282091	We're like, why?
282932	283453	It's funny.
285394	290699	Well, it's just like, and it's weird, because I had specific requirements I wanted to do.
291079	296344	It had to be everything that I had in the house already, like just random crap.
296384	304831	So it's basically, you know, it's going to be small, like a bar top, but it'll be out of spare parts I had and cardboard boxes.
305891	307773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
329631	333114	I actually burned my finger on the soldering iron, which kind of sucks.
334555	355132	Yeah, I mean, assuming that my soldering isn't absolute crap, which it is, but it looked pretty good, then it will actually be done soon, because I actually finished soldering today, and what I'm actually going to be running on it is not MAME, because they do have MAME for it, but
356294	362499	The way I soldered everything, I can't really solder the directional buttons because it's really hard to do that.
363040	370086	So I instead soldered the analog because it's really easy and you can actually use the analog stick in some of the games.
370446	375271	So I can't select between which emulator I run, I just have to have it auto boot into that emulator.
375331	382337	So the one I found that runs pretty well is actually the CPS2 emulator so I can play some Puzzle Fighter on there and Street Fighter and stuff like that.
383786	389009	But yeah, it's coming along, and hopefully it'll be done this week.
389189	392210	Now there's some haters in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
392250	394211	Hitstun says, PSP MAME sucks.
394531	394812	Sorry.
394852	397493	Yes, PSP MAME does kind of suck.
398133	400374	CPS2, not that bad, actually.
400414	401315	It runs pretty well.
402055	407658	And it's just, you know, this PSP, I haven't used it in like years, okay?
408243	413505	Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, Loki's real name isn't Matt, it's Richard Dean Anderson.
413705	416146	Making a MacGyver reference there, which is somewhat true.
416566	418327	And which Actdeft says, Loki Guyver.
418767	420068	I don't know if that has the same ring to it.
420728	424809	Alpha Cananogram asks a question though, what version of the PSP is it?
424869	425710	Is it a 1000, 2000, 3000?
426910	428291	It's my old 1000 because I bought a 2000.
428911	433893	I thought about breaking the 2000 because the emulators run better on there, but I can't do that.
434872	435393	They're the LCD stuff.
452310	459599	Yeah, they weren't the actual game, but they were kind of like a step above Game & Watch where the lights would actually be in color.
459879	464785	But they actually put them in a cabinet-looking thing, and I think these things were pretty expensive.
465165	467508	They were probably $50, $60, which back in 1980 was a lot of money.
467548	468369	Yeah, they were like $30 now.
468389	468469	Yeah.
474643	475844	I'll just... I have pictures.
475864	476764	Oh, you have pictures.
476944	477445	Some pictures.
477505	479065	You should upload some of these to our picture feed.
479105	480586	It doesn't really show much, anything.
480646	484788	I mean, right now, other than there's a spider of wires, but here's what I finished before I left.
485188	487189	Real quick, you can see... Sadly, this is horrible radio.
487229	487949	I know, I know, but...
488291	492094	You can see where it's going to be the actual control panel.
492134	501181	Okay, I'm looking at a picture of Loki's cable modem, of which it almost looks like he has wired six buttons into the cable modem.
501361	502982	The cable modem box.
503083	503883	It's just the box.
503923	505164	Yes, remember, it's all out of boxes.
505264	507286	Okay, are you going to paint over the box?
507466	508467	No, it's going to be a box.
509447	511629	It's going to be the most ghetto-looking thing in the world.
511869	513391	Exactly, that's the point.
513411	513911	Okay.
514645	515205	And you know what?
515746	517546	You need to send this to our picture blog.
517626	518167	And you know what?
518227	521028	Because I didn't... I told you it's everything I had in the house.
521328	524549	I don't have packaging tape to put this together, so I'm using duct tape.
525810	527490	There's going to be duct tape all over this.
527531	529051	You need to use chicken wire, too.
529091	530812	I don't have any chicken wire, so it's just...
531809	537292	You are making a PSP MAME cabinet out of a PSP, cardboard boxes, and duct tape.
537712	540513	And, like, arcade spare parts I have laying in my house.
540673	541013	Wow.
541474	541854	Amazing.
542194	546596	But, yeah, it's... HitStunts come around a little bit and says, this might be cool.
546736	550598	See, now when you finish it, since it's mini, you're going to have to bring it in here.
550778	551398	Oh, yeah.
551418	552519	It's going to have a handle on it.
552539	557041	And the thing, I also... And this is assuming that this all works after it's done, you know, because...
558467	559008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
580889	582830	Hopefully it works once I power it back up again.
582870	585331	But if it does, then it should be good to go.
586052	589133	Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Hey, guess what I got Loki for Christmas?
589534	589974	A box.
590734	593636	Well, at least it wasn't your you-know-what-in-a-box like Justin Timberlake.
594656	595076	Let's see.
595437	597938	Pywish, big fan of duct tape as a lot of our chatrooms are.
598198	599739	Chatroom is duct tape fixes everything.
600580	601781	I can't wait to see this.
601861	603283	It's like the Force.
603643	603883	I know.
603943	606305	It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together.
606406	608207	This thing is going to be awesomely bad.
608367	609048	I can't wait to see it.
609328	611630	Please, please post that picture to our picture blog or something.
611650	612231	I have a few, yeah.
612271	613052	Or your Twitter at least.
613072	613712	I don't know, somewhere.
614093	614713	I'll post them too.
614733	616095	Do you know how to log into the ULR Twitter?
616115	616835	You should post it there.
616855	617936	Maybe.
617956	619017	I'll give you that info off air.
619698	621400	Because obviously I'm not going to give out the password on air.
621420	621500	It's...
624676	624956	Fire.
625296	625596	All right.
626757	630099	DarkSakura, did you find that Gradius game type game you were talking about earlier?
630159	630599	I did.
630679	632840	It's called AX Raven Elite.
634221	635541	And I'm going to post a link to the chat room.
635561	639183	You can go to RocketeerGames.com and give it a try.
639643	641404	It's actually made by a local.
642168	644069	Oh wow, very cool.
644289	649613	Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, Step 1, put the PSP in a box.
650053	655037	You should do like a parody video building your PSP MAME cabinet.
655617	657278	Like called PSP in a box or something.
657298	658499	There's something here.
659239	665844	When I originally was going to do actually running MAME on there, I actually made a skin for the background that looked like
666324	667965	MAME but built out of cardboard.
668265	669526	So that was kind of funny.
669886	672428	But now this CPS2 emulator doesn't really have that.
672848	674469	I may also do a Neo Geo emulator.
674489	675610	I haven't decided yet.
676671	680193	It really depends on which buttons that I've wired work and which don't.
680893	682934	Because that's really what it's going to come down to.
683215	687497	Because if I'm missing any of the buttons that I needed to work, it's just trash.
688078	689499	The whole thing is ruined.
690059	693241	In which case, I do believe you should just set fire to it.
693661	694221	Live on air.
694361	695481	Oh, fine.
695521	696762	We'll make a little bonfire somewhere.
696782	697442	I'll make it work.
697842	699122	Maybe in DarkSakura's backyard.
699162	702403	We'll move all the equipment out in the backyard and burn the cabinet live on air.
702423	703123	Doesn't that sound like fun?
703803	704503	Sure.
704523	708544	I would rather take a crowbar to an office space with some loud gangster rap.
709504	713144	Maybe if it was a PSP Go inside, but PSP 1000 is still kind of valuable.
714045	715365	Well, I guess you bricked it.
715385	715965	Not really.
716065	717265	No, it's not bricked.
717325	721946	I mean, it's just... Well, it could be fixed.
722066	722346	I mean...
723530	727256	I just don't care because I have another PSP already and I wasn't using this.
727316	728799	I mean, the battery was dead.
728819	729861	So, yes to fire?
730963	731864	I'm not going to burn it.
732065	733527	Yes to grow bar?
734709	735150	No.
735530	735791	It'll work.
736833	737233	It'll work.
738217	741079	Alright, moving on so we can get to gaming news before, you know, midnight.
741919	742900	Moving on, My Gaming Week.
743680	750664	Not a whole lot of new stuff, but I will say that, you know, I've been very enticed by Steam's various deals that they've had this week.
751224	751825	You might have seen it.
751865	753966	I know Deekman's been posting them to our Twitter every day.
754526	758447	The Steam deals, and they're all over the game blogs, because there's just been some really cool deals there on Steam.
758787	771290	And one of them that I jumped on was Dragon Age Origins was on sale for 25% off, so I think I paid like $37 for it, which, you know, considering it's like $59.99 on 360 or whatever, getting that price on the PC wasn't that bad.
771890	774451	So I, you know, kind of got into the game and started playing it.
775771	787777	But I couldn't really get very far into it before I got highly irritated because my video card apparently kind of sucks and is behind the time and cannot run the game very well even on its lowest settings.
788377	793240	Things I should have thought about before I plopped the money down for the game, although maybe it's just a sign I need a new video card.
793560	802484	I thought, since I just bought my computer new last year, that my video card would not suck that bad, but it was one of those, you know, gateway, everything's there.
802885	803665	Gateway, yeah.
804105	807107	But I thought when I bought it, there was something about the video card.
807127	808907	It was supposed to be better than normal, but whatever.
809888	813930	So, sadly, I can't give you a fair review of Dragon Age Origins just yet.
813970	815951	That wouldn't be a very fair thing of me to review it.
816331	817371	I will say this, though.
817612	820773	I was quickly immersed into the game.
820933	822674	I did think they did a very good job.
822714	824195	And Bioware is kind of well-known for this.
824835	825776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
842705	847629	But I did feel very immersed in the game and I thought the storytelling was done very well.
848010	853314	And I did like the fact, you know, just like in Mass Effect that you can kind of direct the conversations and so forth.
853654	856037	Again, something that Bioware has done very well for.
858078	858879	They do very well.
859680	861041	I was immersed in it.
861081	864003	But I'll give you a longer review after I get a better video card, which is...
864944	865304	One versus one.
887037	895403	I went to Macy's yesterday and I bought something that was half off and I went to the outlets today and I bought clothes because they were all cheap.
895823	899425	I was going to go to Old Navy for their whole 3 a.m.
899465	900126	rock band thing.
900146	901807	Did you do any Black Friday at all, Loki?
902967	904188	I went to Radio Shack.
905229	906930	That's because I couldn't find a screwdriver.
908111	909572	So I went and bought another screwdriver.
910172	913694	Well, I wouldn't think Radio Shack was doing a huge Black Friday discount.
913714	914635	No, there was no one in there.
914995	915535	I had a feeling.
915555	916156	Okay.
917992	920194	Anyhow, so I went out and bought a bunch of clothes.
920214	923617	But I noticed with all these deals, I keep thinking maybe it's just selfish or whatever.
923637	924958	I keep thinking it's stuff for myself.
926159	929122	But I'm also the type of person, I always do my Christmas shopping on Christmas Eve.
929462	931184	I'm just a huge procrastinator like that.
931564	933326	And I never know what to buy, like tons of people's.
934947	935428	Let's see.
936228	938690	Looking in the chat room and seeing the comments there.
939591	941213	Ricky GoMac says, Get a Mac, Rob!
942839	944579	I wonder why he might be suggesting a Mac.
944619	945520	Ricky, go Mac.
945720	946040	I don't know.
946820	949300	I would love to get a Mac, but they're a little pricey.
949400	952041	They're kind of the Mercedes-Benz of computers.
952081	952621	You know what I mean?
953321	954341	I don't hate on Macs.
954582	955482	I have an iPhone.
955662	956862	That's great for Apple.
956902	960423	But my one Mac laptop I did have, unfortunately, didn't last.
960563	962123	And I was a little bit disappointed in that.
962163	963523	So I don't know how I feel about the desktop.
964264	967324	TigerClaw says, also be sure your graphics card is an NVIDIA card.
967504	967724	Oops.
968504	970205	My one I have right now is an ATI Radeon.
970425	970905	It doesn't matter.
970925	971065	Uh-oh.
972942	973742	It doesn't matter at all.
974603	976863	And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this incorrectly.
977203	979604	Vanis Lux in chat says, Screw Macy's.
979664	980944	They made my children cry.
981324	982805	See, now I kind of want to know that story.
982945	985005	I know that might be traumatic, but I kind of want to know.
985205	987186	Was it Santa Claus that made your children cry?
987286	989166	Or did they not want to take something back?
989787	990027	I got to...
991479	992520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1016331	1017712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1039070	1039510	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1063647	1064968	I don't know if there's really anything after 100.
1065309	1068291	I think maybe if you get to 1,000, you get more statistics stuff.
1068311	1069652	You don't get to evolve anymore?
1070113	1070413	I don't know.
1070453	1071714	I don't know if there's any more evolving.
1071854	1072675	I haven't really looked into it.
1073395	1078360	I'll have to ask Seg, my buddy Seg that was on the show a couple weeks ago promoting Umlaut, which is coming up, by the way.
1080081	1081322	He knows more about that stuff than I do.
1081963	1085246	I wouldn't have even known about the short URL if I didn't see him talk about it earlier.
1085826	1087948	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1088008	1088929	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1089517	1101140	Well, Daytel is kind of pissed because, you know, you may remember Microsoft blocked their memory cards, their max memory, from working with the last dashboard update.
1101920	1107262	And, of course, you know, dashboard update came, and the max memory cards went.
1108002	1112363	And, unfortunately, they had a workaround, they said at one time, but...
1114022	1114122	LUL
1139373	1148698	They have accomplished their recent update by making a system change that will not recognize or allow the operation of a memory card with greater capacity than their own.
1149059	1155923	We believe that with the power Microsoft enjoys in the market for Xbox accessories, this conduct is unlawful.
1156664	1158805	So they're kind of going with the whole Monopoly thing.
1160071	1162373	I don't really know if they have grounds to stand there.
1162413	1170341	I mean, since it is Microsoft's hardware and I think that they pretty much can say who can make what for it.
1171082	1180551	Although I do agree, I wish they did have some other memory card options because the Microsoft memory cards and Microsoft hard drives are way too fucking overpriced.
1181601	1182842	and what we're talking like 120 gigabyte hard drive for $200, $150.
1182902	1185584	I mean, shit, you can get way bigger drives for a lot cheaper, so.
1191184	1214489	I gotta admit, this is tricky for me and chat, I'm really curious what you guys think about this one because I'm really on the fence with this because I understand the whole Microsoft is evil and they always have monopolies on everything and they violated antitrust before and you know, all of this I totally understand that side of the argument and yeah, they do charge way too much for like, you know, considering that 120 gig hard drive is dirt cheap
1214989	1219933	Or even like a 512 megabyte memory unit for 50 bucks.
1219993	1224717	I mean, when you can buy like 4 gig thumb drives for like $10.
1225797	1229160	Here's the part of it, though, where I'm kind of with Microsoft.
1229380	1235005	And that is that these companies take huge losses when they put out these consoles.
1235385	1242771	When you buy a console from Microsoft, Sony, not Nintendo this time, because we know the Wii was not quite...
1243451	1264991	The same technological level, but in the past they've taken a loss on their systems too Maybe it was a small loss this time, I don't have the data on that, I don't think it was though But Microsoft and Sony take a loss on every console that they sell to you They've got to make that money back other places And that is usually through software, through licensed products, through the licenses and so forth That's how they make their money back
1266572	1280539	So I can sort of see where they have the right to lock out the unauthorized products because my fear is, my ultimate fear is that let's say Datel wins this suit and it just opens the floodgates to all these unauthorized devices that are going to be out there.
1280999	1285061	The next round of consoles are going to cost through the roof because companies are not going to want to take a loss on it.
1285976	1287057	No, I don't think that's going to happen.
1287457	1293960	I mean, they had a ton of unlicensed products for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 1 and, you know, hell, older consoles and stuff.
1294840	1295860	Never really affected their sales.
1295880	1298962	And Sony also tried to charge out the ass for the PS3 when it first came out.
1299682	1304064	And they were still claiming a loss, but we all laughed them off because we said, too damn much money.
1304104	1304624	Yeah, right.
1304704	1306645	Yeah, but that's for other reasons entirely.
1306745	1307966	Except the hardcore fans, of course.
1308046	1311827	That's because, hey, let's throw in this really awesome cutting-edge cell processor.
1311867	1313628	Hey, let's throw in some Blu-ray technology.
1313988	1315389	Hey, let's throw in some other crap.
1315689	1323431	That's why it's so expensive, and to their benefit, they also have allowed their end user to upgrade the hard drive.
1324372	1326032	Because it's just a normal hard drive.
1326672	1332414	But Microsoft says, fuck you guys, we're just going to put that normal hard drive inside of a case and then charge you twice as much for it.
1333530	1334170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1353961	1365230	What about the fact, though, that a lot of people, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but there was certainly a significant amount of people that were using these devices for the cheat functionalities that, you know, the SD cards, importing the saves, inflating gamer scores, cheating.
1365571	1373377	And, you know, Microsoft is trying to protect Xbox Live because, you know, they market it as, hey, you're paying $50 a year because we lock out this kind of shit.
1373937	1377518	Well, you can't really lock it out permanently.
1377538	1384799	I mean, they have all those game saves and everything are now... I mean, because originally they weren't all signed to the profile.
1384819	1393481	So yeah, you could download game saves and throw them onto your console and kind of save it at a point right before an achievement or something like that and boost your achievement scores.
1393981	1397742	But now everything's signed to your user ID, so...
1398522	1408324	Unless you're the actual user that made that save, you can't really use that save unless you re-sign it on your computer, which you can do that, and you don't really need this memory card to do that.
1408724	1410244	So it's really not an excuse.
1410344	1411705	It's just them being dicks.
1412025	1420446	Let me ask this follow-up question very plainly because SalaciousPop asks this in chat, and I kind of want to know this too because I kind of agree with his thought here.
1420767	1423247	He says, can't you put save games on like a thumb drive?
1423667	1424887	It reads USB fine.
1424987	1425828	I think I'm missing something.
1426028	1426488	No, you can't.
1427208	1427588	Oh, really?
1428499	1431640	I always assumed you could, because you could do MP3s and videos and all that other stuff.
1431680	1435681	No, if you could put it on a thumb drive, then it wouldn't fucking matter that they have their stupid little memory cards.
1436021	1439302	But you can't, because obviously that'd be the easiest route.
1439322	1440623	You wouldn't even buy the stupid little memory card.
1440643	1441283	Yeah, I guess so.
1441323	1444184	I mean, it makes sense now that you're saying it, but I just kind of always thought.
1444604	1445885	But then again, I've never tried to use it.
1446145	1450646	I'm not the type that wants to cheat in games and all this and so forth.
1451406	1452807	I never really thought to use this.
1453787	1457168	I never even owned a Game Genie back in the day, although I thought they were interesting.
1457208	1457928	They were awesome.
1458469	1460089	It's too bad we don't have anything like that anymore.
1460109	1460609	You know what I mean?
1460749	1462410	Everything got too... Not anymore.
1462670	1463870	It's all game saves now.
1464070	1468332	Remember, I always wondered how they found those codes for Game Genie.
1468652	1470372	Like, did somebody have to sit there and actually go 00001?
1472933	1478515	or was it because of the fact it was hexadecimal based, they could go into the programming and figure it out?
1478635	1482496	They had cheat programs similar to that on the PC for cheating and stuff.
1482516	1483896	Basically, it's memory searches.
1485477	1488938	If I have five lives right now, do a memory search for five.
1489598	1491279	I die once, do a memory search for four.
1491639	1493579	I die again, do a memory search for three.
1493599	1498701	What it does is it narrows down those memory addresses until you get the one that actually controls
1499261	1501221	Curiosity, I don't even know if you know this, would a PS3 let you do it?
1524585	1527588	PS3, yes, will let you put game saves on a thumb drive.
1527828	1528368	Interesting.
1528468	1529669	Because they don't sell memory cards.
1530150	1531111	It's all open.
1531191	1531771	Oh, that's right.
1532312	1534173	It's all thumb drives.
1534193	1535274	You can use whatever you want.
1535795	1539538	Sony fanboys, if you haven't thought to add that to your arsenal of web forum...
1541172	1541913	They're harassing.
1542393	1543294	There's something for you.
1543394	1546317	Their memory cards are just USB drives, basically.
1546377	1550280	I mean, it's just signed different and they're shaped different.
1550300	1553043	They've got, you know, but it's basically a UMD drive.
1553383	1555245	Or not UMD, USB drive.
1556066	1562031	SSJ100Matt in chat asks, or says, basically, I was really hoping they were going to drop the price of the HDs this holiday season.
1562331	1563332	Yeah, kind of surprising they didn't.
1564153	1564553	Thanks for watching!
1584208	1587071	TigerClaw in chat says, do you mean a trainer?
1587111	1589213	When you were talking about that memory scan software.
1589253	1591795	For PC games, you used a program called a trainer.
1591875	1597019	You load the PC game first, then load the trainer program, and it will modify what's in the memory so you can run some cheats.
1597039	1597940	That's from TigerClaw.
1598220	1601463	No, not a trainer, but this is like predating all the trainers and stuff.
1602404	1605687	Because a trainer usually is all the hard work's done for you.
1605747	1610291	It's basically, okay, hit button one to have infinite ammo or something like that.
1610611	1611432	And those are nice, but
1611833	1615072	I'm talking about something, it was actually just a program I mean this is back
1615863	1643890	Floppies and Shareware Days It was just a program that you'd run that basically would work with any PC titles because it's just a memory search function and you can do searches and stuff on different values and I think the registered version of it or whatever had an ability to figure something out with life bars because life bars are hard to determine since you don't know what the actual number is it's just kind of a percentage so
1645350	1645690	I don't know.
1645711	1647312	I mean, this was like years ago.
1647653	1651677	But yeah, obviously now they have trainers for everything that come out.
1652638	1653639	Very interesting.
1653739	1657743	Quickly to kind of wrap this up and move on with the show, and Jamie, I don't know if you have a thought on this either.
1659005	1660246	How do you think this lawsuit's going to go?
1660446	1667374	Do you think Daytale's going to be shit out of luck, or do you think maybe they have something with this whole Monopoly thing?
1667901	1677468	No, they're going to be shit out of luck because they're going to be like... It's going to be... Well, you can make peripherals for us, but you just have to pay us a licensing fee and we have to approve it.
1678269	1678569	I don't know.
1678629	1679390	I don't think they're going to win.
1680170	1680831	Jamie, agree?
1680931	1681271	Disagree?
1682392	1684113	I think it could go either way.
1685034	1685735	To be honest...
1688092	1692613	It's not like we haven't had other peripherals be locked out before on certain systems.
1692693	1699735	Like, for example, I know that I couldn't use certain third-party controllers for certain games back in the day.
1699775	1701876	I kind of look at it as being along the same lines.
1702616	1706617	However, it would really have to be a situation of...
1712682	1713303	and DarkSakura.com
1726638	1728861	I gotta say, for me, either way, this story sucks.
1729241	1734988	Because if Datel wins, then I truly believe that's going to drive the price of the consoles up, and they're going to use that as justification.
1735688	1739653	And if they lose, then all those people that spent money on that device lose.
1740754	1741856	Ultimately, the consumer loses.
1741996	1742677	Let the buyer beware.
1743217	1744018	Womp, womp, womp, womp
1773117	1774097	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1795865	1796846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1819142	1838357	and they actually had a version of it in Super Nintendo that was pretty badass and it's one of the games that's going to be featured on my box cabinet because it's a Capcom system of course but for those of you that don't have the skill to build a cabinet out of boxes and duct tape you can also put it on any homebrew enabled PSP too so they work pretty well
1838897	1840078	OMG Spoilers
1866916	1869337	I'm more excited about Magic Sword than I am Final Fight.
1869437	1871038	Although I did love that game too, I gotta say.
1871318	1879462	But I will say this about Final Fight, is that apparently some of the fighters and very familiar faces are making their way into Super Street Fighter 4.
1879822	1884324	And I have to admit, from what I do remember and love about Final Fight, I think this is awesome.
1884604	1889866	Cody and Guy are making their way to Super Street Fighter 4 according to the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.
1890246	1904358	Also making an appearance, Adon from Street Fighter Alpha So those were three new characters that were announced this week I believe Cody's been in a game before Yeah, Alpha 3, also he's going to be one of the characters coming up in Street Fighter 4
1905307	1906547	Right, right.
1907467	1909328	That's very cool, I think.
1909388	1911788	Well, I thought you were still talking about Final Fight.
1911968	1912208	No, no.
1912728	1915369	And this whole new crossover is kind of interesting.
1915429	1918669	I kind of miss the whole Alpha series of Street Fighter.
1918689	1921590	That all happened during that period of my life where I wasn't as into video games.
1921890	1922990	So I never really played those games.
1923010	1924590	So I never realized that they had the crossover.
1925030	1933332	Although I do remember Hagar, the mayor, in Saturday Night Slammasters, which was also completely underrated Capcom classic.
1934353	1943767	we had that at my arcade that I worked at that was the ultimate pizzeria arcade game I loved that game also on there shut up
1946141	1946481	Let's see.
1946921	1949742	Ranma asked in chat real quick before we get to another story here.
1950122	1952143	Anyone remember Mighty Final Fight?
1952463	1952903	I do.
1952983	1956424	Wasn't that the version that was on the NES as opposed to the Super Nintendo?
1956464	1958445	Yeah, it wasn't like all kind of super deformed.
1958545	1959645	It was all the chibi characters.
1959685	1961146	What was an 8-bit port, you know?
1961466	1962366	Yeah, I remember that game.
1963106	1965567	Obviously, it wasn't as great because it was an 8-bit port.
1965887	1968188	But DarkSakura, why don't you do one more story for us?
1968208	1970468	Then we're going to get to our interview tonight.
1971229	1971709	That's right.
1971789	1972749	We do have it coming up.
1972929	1975690	But how about some PC news?
1978300	1986146	Well, Valve is basically sticking their tongue out and waggling it at all the people that are boycotting Steamworks.
1988008	1989269	Which I'm actually laughing.
1989289	2002540	They're saying basically that any digital distributors who are boycotting PC games because they come with Steamworks services are missing out on an opportunity.
2003941	2005262	They're actually saying that...
2008266	2022356	and let's see different companies like Direct2Drive, Impulse and GamersGate that didn't want to sell Modern Warfare 2 because it had the Steamworks tools acting as a storefront for Steam.
2023137	2028281	But they're saying that if you make a good game it should be out through as many channels as possible.
2029568	2030569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2051485	2052025	on my system.
2052706	2053526	That's not what I asked for.
2054566	2057827	Whenever you download iTunes, it tries to install Safari on your system.
2058107	2059428	I didn't ask for fucking Safari.
2059448	2060128	I wanted iTunes.
2060708	2062049	I do find that kind of shit annoying.
2062189	2070012	I realize maybe it's a little different because Steamworks directly does relate to the games, but I can kind of see their point.
2070072	2078295	When you get these things you didn't ask for that even eat up 1K of memory, it's a bit of an annoyance.
2079383	2095254	Well, what the word is is that they've actually based the inclusion of it on what customers have asked for and that they've actually sold the games as well through Steam as they have in the stores, especially Modern Warfare 2.
2097436	2102920	Redertainment in our chat room at chat.orangeleisure.com says, Sorry, I call for a boycott of the boycott.
2104485	2106390	Perhaps that's something he needs to start.
2106430	2106791	I don't know.
2107232	2107733	You know what?
2108234	2109858	I say if people don't want it, don't get it.
2110079	2111462	If people want it, get it.
2112365	2112846	Who cares?
2112926	2113968	You can uninstall the shit.
2114894	2122196	Vannis Lux in our chat says those distributors that didn't carry Modern Warfare 2 cut themselves out of a crap load of money and that's about all the effect it had.
2122616	2126597	And Gold Anthro wants to point out not only Safari but also QuickTime.
2127077	2136260	I give them a buy on that because the movies that play in iTunes when you download movies and TV shows which is an integral part of the system are in a QuickTime proprietary format.
2136460	2138080	I however refuse to install Safari.
2139100	2140721	Safari is ass on a PC.
2141181	2142142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2157578	2158159	I hate Chrome.
2158859	2159279	I hate Chrome.
2175951	2181234	I'm glad there's choices now, whereas it's not Internet Explorer seeming to dominate as much as they used to.
2181274	2184656	I know they still are the number one, but not nearly the hold they used to have.
2184696	2192841	Firefox actually is a lot more secure now in general than Internet Explorer is and has a lot more functionality.
2193141	2200025	A lot of places are really starting to embrace it over Internet Explorer.
2200665	2201946	You saw what happened to Netscape.
2202747	2203347	Netscape's gone.
2203755	2204136	DarkSakura
2226284	2226745	I could see that.
2227305	2231171	Anyhow, we got to move on because we actually have a rare live interview tonight.
2231191	2234575	A lot of times our interviews are pre-taped, but we actually have a live interview tonight.
2234836	2239602	But I have to ask you guys, especially here in studio, how many of you guys have seen this video that's floating around YouTube right now?
2240023	2240944	It's this little...
2242148	2243850	Thanks to you and Megzi, I've seen both.
2257901	2261684	So at the end, obviously, it's this little video that kind of parries using these Sackboy characters.
2261985	2263546	And it's kind of gone viral this week.
2264047	2265027	It's very interesting.
2265848	2269151	The whole thing was created by this gentleman, Brian Moreno.
2269672	2275877	And, you know, his little big plan has been continuing to grow via the online co-op mode that you've heard about this week.
2275937	2279140	And after one year of release, the online community is still going.
2279380	2281162	And I think a lot of us kind of, you know...
2282605	2284085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2300510	2301511	continue to make good on that.
2301591	2306093	And I think this video going viral is just kind of an example of that.
2306133	2312476	So this video, which you can find Little Bad Romance, YouTube user Brian RDM, it was on YouTube.
2312936	2316458	Then it got posted to NeoGAF, which is, you know, this huge, huge gaming forum.
2316478	2317158	I'm sure you've heard of it.
2317498	2319419	Then it spread through Twitters, through Facebooks.
2319459	2320199	That's where I found it.
2320219	2322340	An OLR member posted it on their Twitter.
2322440	2323021	That's where I found it.
2323381	2326602	And then it got coverage on Kotaku, other blogs, so forth.
2328203	2331204	Ironically, Lady Gaga, she's also big right now.
2331784	2334245	She just started a big tour of hers last week.
2335146	2336606	50,000 views on YouTube tonight.
2336686	2337107	Just about 50,000.
2337707	2338207	Just shy of it.
2338227	2342869	So we want to get Brian Moreno here on the show to talk a little bit about this and about the LittleBigPlanet community.
2343209	2345150	So we're actually going to give him a call right now.
2345270	2346551	Hopefully he is standing by.
2348049	2348169	Hello?
2348189	2348609	Hi, is this Brian?
2348629	2349170	This is Brian.
2349210	2349930	Hey Brian, how you doing?
2349950	2351531	It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.
2372593	2373713	We are doing great.
2373733	2378894	We were just kind of checking out your video here in studio, looking at it, the little bad romance.
2378954	2380335	Congratulations on the success.
2380675	2382115	About 50,000 views now, huh?
2383375	2384955	I know, it's pretty mind-blowing.
2386156	2389676	Did you ever think that this was going to catch on as big as it did?
2391377	2393857	Me and my friend were actually talking about this yesterday.
2394617	2399658	We thought maybe 1,000, 2,000 modest views, a laugh between ourselves, and then
2400146	2408074	all of a sudden the second day it was posted it was number three most viewed in its category in Russia and 95th most viewed on YouTube that day
2408755	2410516	It was pretty amazing.
2410536	2412638	I had no idea it was going to go that far.
2412658	2413639	I got some questions for you.
2413659	2414299	First off, I got to know, Brian...
2438818	2439858	Lady Gaga is huge.
2440199	2442300	People love this new album.
2442660	2444701	She has these super fans.
2445062	2451526	People get on YouTube and they do karaoke, they dance, do whatever interpretive thing to bad romance.
2451866	2455928	What made you decide, I'm going to do a tribute, but I'm going to do it in LittleBigPlanet?
2457149	2459911	It was actually a mixture of many things.
2460891	2464834	I work, one of my steady gigs is a club photographer here in Orange County.
2465576	2470817	and October last year, I actually had an opportunity to photograph and meet Lady Gaga.
2471137	2473658	This was right before her career exploded.
2474398	2477418	And she was the nicest person I've ever met.
2477598	2478519	It was 2 a.m.
2478579	2479439	The show was over.
2479519	2482219	Fans were outside of her trailer and security was leaving.
2482639	2483940	And she said it herself.
2483980	2489961	She's like, I'm going to be here until I take a picture and take an autograph for everyone.
2490501	2490961	Everyone.
2491195	2492836	You know, she did something like that recently, too.
2492876	2494497	I heard it, like a Best Buy in L.A.
2494597	2495918	that all these people came out.
2496038	2497919	She said, I'm not leaving until I sign all your stuff.
2499060	2501982	She's great about her and her fans.
2502682	2506285	And, you know, I've thought she's the greatest person since I met her.
2507926	2512929	And then with the release of The Fame Monster, I mean, I've been hooked on that album.
2512969	2515210	I think it's so much better than her original release.
2515270	2515731	Yeah.
2516897	2544373	and then when it came to LittleBigPlanet I had been a fan of it since it had been announced E3 how many years ago and just the ability to be able to create whatever you want and how accessible it was to everyone it just, me being a fan of those two it just seems like the perfect recipe for something that would go far that would have long legs So it just kind of worked out in your mind I like this, I like this, what happens when we throw them together?
2546274	2548796	Well, some could say that's the same way this show started.
2548856	2552418	You know, Jamie, remember it was about, hey, I like video games and we do amateur radio.
2552498	2554040	Let's do a radio show about video games.
2554080	2557502	Well, to paraphrase the quote is, two great tastes that go great together.
2558183	2558683	Exactly.
2560951	2561852	I got a question for you, Brian.
2561912	2563633	How long did this whole thing take?
2563713	2568356	Because I got to say, one thing that impressed me when I saw this video is I was thinking, wait a minute.
2568456	2572659	Because I'll admit, anyone that's been listening to the show a long time, I'm a big old fan of Lady Gaga.
2572739	2573519	I think she's great.
2573860	2577442	And in fact, I'm not going to be here at the show on December 13th because I'm going to Monster Ball.
2577762	2578483	Couldn't be more excited.
2579203	2583826	But I was going to say, that video came out like Tuesday.
2584447	2588469	And this video seemed like it was on the internet not even 10 days later.
2588790	2590611	How long did this whole thing take you to put together?
2592192	2594294	Hours and hours and hours and hours.
2594655	2598878	I was in fear of my 60 gigabyte PlayStation hitting the dirt.
2598919	2601141	I was afraid of it dying how much I was on it.
2601501	2606205	Honestly, maybe a good 48, 64 hours total.
2606305	2616575	It was just trial and error on making those costumes and matching it with the video and making the set pieces and doing what I could with the tools that I had provided.
2617625	2618846	Was anyone helping you out with it?
2618886	2622529	Because I noticed in a lot of the scenes, it seems like there were always three Sack Boys.
2622589	2625311	So was that just you kind of coordinating three controllers?
2625652	2627153	Or did you have a couple friends helping you?
2643888	2653720	But I mean, in set pieces and costume design, it was just me and the PlayStation and me tweeting it to friends or Facebooking it to friends to see how well they thought it matched up.
2654608	2663831	Now, you know, this is kind of a subjective question here, but would you say that the tools that Media Molecule gives you in LittleBigPlanet made this process easy?
2663871	2669453	I mean, I know you talked about it takes hours and hours, but it takes hours and hours to build a really good level in LittleBigPlanet, too.
2670033	2678055	Do you think you have the tools you needed to produce this video good, or do you think there was something that Media Molecule could have given you that would have made this whole thing easier?
2679796	2683577	I think the process, it went well.
2684894	2689798	I did discover limitations that I did not know existed in the game.
2690659	2698605	A lot of the issues was hair with me, because hair for me, I wanted to get the right colors and really differentiate from the Gaga Sat Girl.
2699086	2703989	And one of the problems is, for a lot of the hairstyles, you can't actually change the hair color.
2704470	2710855	So the way I had to go around that was using stickers and carefully putting colored stickers on the hair.
2711311	2723680	but another limitation in that is it seems that items only have a maximum of three stickers that you can place on an object before it'll erase the first one put in and put in the new one.
2725542	2736330	On top of that, it's a 2.5D perspective game and you couldn't get the camera in some ways that you could, especially in close-ups.
2736450	2738592	And the way I found a way around that is
2738956	2746321	When you go open the pop-it menu and go to the customize Sackboy option, it zooms in the camera to maximize the screen on your Sackboy.
2746581	2751205	When you press circle and get out of that, the camera stays on that perspective.
2751545	2757409	So that's how I was able to get a lot of the close-ups because the camera tools that they give you don't get that close.
2757708	2760430	Well, there's a tip for other aspiring video makers out there.
2760811	2765715	Speaking of which, was this really like the first thing you really did in LittleBigPlanet?
2765755	2767336	Or have you made levels before?
2767356	2768617	Have you done other projects?
2768657	2771220	And this is just the first one everybody seems to notice.
2772401	2782570	I had fooled around with LittleBigPlanet back in the beta, and I had made a kind of inside joke level for one of the websites that I'm a forum member for, thenextlevel.com.
2783951	2785392	But after that, it's just
2786282	2793626	I really didn't have the time and so many other great games were coming out, but it was always in the back of my head that I always wanted to do something with LittleBigPlanet.
2794307	2799310	And that was just with the Gaga and the LittleBigPlanet and me wondering what would happen with those two.
2799350	2802892	I went out and bought a capture device and I was like, I'm going to do this.
2802912	2805573	I'm going to take my time and I'm going to make sure I make something great.
2805673	2806093	Wait, wait, wait.
2806133	2808915	Are you saying you bought the video capture device just for this project?
2809963	2811084	Just for this project.
2811164	2812204	That is dedication.
2812304	2818008	Well, you know, since Lady Gaga is so generous to her fans and so forth, do you think there might be a chance she's seen it?
2819549	2822270	I actually have no idea if she's seen it.
2822390	2823251	I hope she does.
2823391	2829074	And I spammed her Twitter every time I posted the link to that video.
2829414	2837019	I do know for sure that some people in Media Molecule have seen it because if you go on their official YouTube page, it is one of their favorites.
2837689	2842450	I hope Media Molecule gets me on that, because I'll help anyone I need to to get those costumes done right.
2859796	2860096	Awesome.
2860456	2865159	Well, hey, you're kind of the perfect guy to ask about this because you said you were in the beta and all this too.
2865179	2878485	And we were just talking before you came on the air about how LittleBigPlanet, a lot of us didn't really believe Media Molecule a couple years ago, or I should say a year ago when this game first came out, that they weren't going to just jump right in and do LittleBigPlanet 2.
2879025	2881686	They came out and said, no, we're going to continue to support LittleBigPlanet.
2882086	2886669	and they've really made good on that promise to a lot of our surprise, a very pleasant surprise.
2887310	2892753	What do you think it is about the game that keeps this community going strong a year after the game is out?
2892853	2894354	Is it all these constant updates?
2894574	2897856	Is it the fact that people keep building these pop culture references?
2898157	2898577	What is it?
2900198	2905301	I think like overall it's very charming to look at and it's very peculiar to look at.
2905341	2907362	There's nothing else really out there like that.
2907723	2909664	But most of all I really feel that it's
2910345	2910605	and so on.
2936170	2938332	I'm going to just enjoy this and move on to other projects.
2964071	2970518	What this video was, was a part of a whole of a project that I was doing actually for one of my college classes.
2970578	2972120	I'm about to graduate finally.
2972861	2979728	And it was kind of about context and what would happen if I took something and put it in somewhere, something else.
2979848	2980549	What would happen...
2982382	2985984	The next part of the series, I guess I'll give you a little exclusive right now.
2986384	2993947	My next video, using LittleBigPlanet and kind of going along with these puff references, is going to be remaking the New Moon trailer.
2994707	2995407	Oh, dear Lord.
2997548	3001169	Which, you know, if there's anything bigger than Gaga, it's a new moon.
3002610	3003390	Fair enough.
3003750	3004271	All right.
3005071	3005491	Wow, that's...
3008702	3012564	I'd love to continue doing stuff with LittleBigPlanet.
3012624	3022070	With NeoGAF, I promised them that if this made it on any gaming blogs that I would go along and do some of their music video requests.
3022570	3025952	So some of them that they've requested are Thriller and White Wedding.
3027373	3037178	So really going to have to see if those are possible because I did stretch the limits and really got really creative with what I was given to be able to get the costumes as close as they could look.
3038035	3041638	You know, I gotta say, it's getting a lot of mixed feedback in our chat room.
3041658	3048103	You're getting some LOLs and XDs, and then of course the Do Not Wants and so forth for the new Moon trailer.
3048864	3050926	But I like this from Tigerclaw.
3051206	3053288	How are they going to make a Sackboy turn into a wolf?
3053408	3057031	And Bochikawa says, roll full, sparkly, and wolf Sackboys.
3057371	3058532	So I guess we'll see, huh?
3062319	3063720	I'll figure it out.
3063821	3068925	If this whole thing was for school, I hope to hell you get an A. I hope so.
3068965	3070006	You got robbed.
3070426	3071908	You play this for your professor.
3071988	3073769	Give Brian an A. He earned it.
3075371	3078213	This will actually be part of the package that I turn into him.
3078233	3078754	This will be.
3079054	3080155	Awesome, awesome.
3080175	3080815	Well, there you go.
3081295	3089280	Hey, you know, Brian, one thing we like to ask everybody we have on the show, you know, just a standard question for all the guests because we always ask it to ourselves at the top of every show.
3089720	3091922	What video games have you been playing this week?
3092002	3093803	Now, besides LittleBigPlanet, of course.
3095003	3098605	The matter is, is what haven't I been playing this week?
3099066	3102448	I've been playing Dizzidia, Final Fantasy on the PSP.
3103028	3104549	I'm not too sure about that one.
3104949	3108051	When I played it at E3 earlier this year, I was kind of
3108975	3111376	I had no idea what was going on, but I'm getting used to it.
3111637	3112617	I'm really enjoying it.
3113097	3114858	It's a really big fan service.
3115499	3122062	On top of that, playing the original Left 4 Dead because I already bought Left 4 Dead 2 on Black Friday and haven't even finished the first one.
3124103	3126344	Me and a friend also went to the 3 a.m.
3126424	3131447	Old Navy Black Friday opening and we got ourselves a copy of Lego Rock Band.
3131827	3135369	We've been rocking out with that with Elton John and Vampire Weekend.
3136314	3137134	Very cool.
3137174	3144076	I was debating doing that, but I was like, I don't want to fight all those people at 3 in the morning, so props to you for doing that.
3144176	3148977	Very interesting, too, because LEGO Rock Band is another game with very cute-looking avatars.
3149597	3154119	You think you might have something there with LEGO Rock Band and making fan videos?
3154139	3155559	The thing with LEGO Rock Band is...
3156218	3159839	I mean, for me, I really need those tools.
3160019	3165701	And as far as I've seen, Lego Rock Band doesn't give me anywhere close to what LittleBigPlanet does.
3165941	3166421	Very true.
3166461	3169882	In terms of being able to create and being able to have some control.
3171183	3181646	Besides LittleBigPlanet, I am going to start looking into Uncharted 2 because I remember hearing there's a movie-making mode where you can do all kinds of camera tricks and lip-syncing, I believe, is in there.
3181666	3183427	I want to see what I can do with that.
3183467	3183887	I'm really...
3184457	3196161	I'm really trying to get into these electronic format and electronic creative ways to continue this project beyond just the school project and the assignment requirements.
3196862	3204224	Well, Brian, it sounds like you're going to be able to use this as kind of a launch for future Mashima and types of movies based around video games, so props to you.
3204825	3207366	Where can the listeners keep tabs on you and your future projects?
3208686	3212988	The easiest way is going onto my website, www.brianmoreno.com
3214372	3216033	You can find me on YouTube.
3216173	3218754	It's youtube.com slash BrianRDM.
3219174	3222475	Those will be the quickest and easy ways to keep up on any of the work I do.
3223136	3228698	All right, and stay tuned there for the soon-to-come LittleBigPlanet New Moon trailer, which you heard about here on OLR First.
3229058	3230079	Thank you so much, Brian.
3230099	3231819	Appreciate that exclusive and everything else.
3231899	3233400	And best of luck to you in your future endeavors.
3234831	3250175	Thank you guys, I want to thank you guys, Kotaku, NeoGaf, The Next Level, all the listeners on Orange Lounge Radio, everyone on YouTube, Lady Gaga, everything because without all of you guys this wouldn't be anywhere close to what it was.
3250575	3261578	Well, I'm glad we can kind of make your day with all of this and you know what, I really smiled and got a good laugh in a really positive way out of the video when I first saw it so I'm glad we can kind of turn it around back to you.
3262709	3263793	Excellent, thank you guys.
3263833	3265278	Alright, take care Brian, have a good one.
3266322	3267085	Take care guys, bye.
3267126	3267447	Later.
3267467	3267949	Bye.
3269158	3269758	Well, that was fun.
3271039	3274080	He definitely sounds like he's going to kind of use this to kind of start something else.
3274140	3279722	And although, you know, this may be the one that's really big and maybe the other ones, but I don't know.
3279762	3281583	I mean, that one was so good and he's right.
3281603	3282483	It was very well done.
3282523	3283564	No, I was quite impressed.
3283844	3290166	Whether I like it or not, you know, I like Gaga, but I don't like Twilight nearly as much.
3290806	3293247	I'm actually looking forward to seeing how that pans out.
3293267	3293547	I love...
3295849	3296349	He's right.
3296409	3299692	The only thing bigger than Gaga is Twilight, so why the hell not?
3299792	3302395	So, yeah, you're totally right.
3302835	3305498	Who doesn't love a good Weird Al song no matter what it is he's parodying, right?
3305898	3307279	Ooh, he should do a Weird Al video.
3307980	3309141	Hopefully he's listening.
3309481	3311824	Seriously, a Weird Al one, that would be good.
3312572	3313153	There you go.
3313993	3314334	All right.
3314774	3316075	Well, that was fun.
3316115	3316776	All right, let's move on.
3316796	3320059	We got some more news here before we get to our classic game of the week.
3320079	3323522	And then, of course, Part B tonight, 7 o'clock here in California.
3324042	3326445	10 o'clock for those folks on the East Coast, but plenty more show to come.
3326705	3327786	So, Loki, what's up next?
3328166	3339752	As we alluded to in our intro, although the podcast won't be privy to that, New York State apparently now has teamed up with Microsoft to issue emergency alerts via Xbox Live.
3340613	3347196	Kind of similar to, I guess, the Amber Alerts that we have and other emergency broadcast system stuff.
3347876	3352599	They're going to let you know if there's a natural disaster, terrorist attack, disaster.
3353311	3353791	You name it.
3354031	3355472	Whatever requires them to do it.
3355813	3361916	I just hope they don't do the tests with that, and I also hope they don't have that annoying beep that goes with it.
3362557	3372143	You know, a message to me might be fine, but man, I hate watching TV and all of a sudden there's like an Amber Alert thing going on and all the audio cuts out, and it's like, dude, I'm inside my house.
3372283	3376606	I'm not gonna see some guy driving around with his stolen child in my house, okay?
3377284	3378164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3393490	3395692	So you really have to use a device like this.
3395732	3396372	And I don't know.
3396392	3397873	We're using Amber Alert.
3397933	3399174	Is that the type of thing they're talking about here?
3399214	3399554	Kidnap kids?
3399714	3401996	It's mainly emergency broadcast system stuff.
3402236	3406759	Mainly, I think it's because New York and the whole 9-11 thing.
3407379	3410201	Well, I'm sure other states are probably looking into something like this too.
3410581	3410982	I'm sorry.
3411162	3416805	I don't know if the gaming consoles are exactly a good platform for that because most people would be like, God damn it.
3416825	3417826	Who's messaging me now?
3417846	3419487	I'm going to go finish this game first.
3419947	3420028	Yeah.
3420868	3423949	Terror, Terror Alert, you know, Death Inimitator.
3424029	3426169	It's like, ah!
3426329	3428210	The Vs have arrived, get out of town.
3430410	3431610	The bomb has gone off already.
3431730	3432291	That bothers me.
3432391	3432811	Why?
3434231	3441673	I, no, I don't like using, okay, that was, that's like seriously my big pet peeve with that show is I'm calling them the Vs that, no.
3442053	3447414	The whole point of the V in the original series was the reference to World War II.
3448482	3449083	Okay, okay.
3449123	3451267	But you know in the new one they got the whole... I know.
3451367	3451628	I know.
3451668	3452269	It's retarded.
3452289	3452610	Alright.
3454201	3461704	But, I mean, regardless, all joking aside, I gotta say, though, you know, when they originally incorporated the emergency broadcast system, wasn't it kind of a similar deal?
3461764	3471968	You know, people use their free time playing TV, or playing TV, watching TV, and so the emergency broadcast system would alert those people who aren't glued to the radio or going outside.
3472268	3474088	I mean, this kind of makes sense in a way.
3474669	3480151	I think that they use this tastefully, like, hey, there's a fucking fire right by you right now.
3480451	3483572	You know, it might be a good idea to get the fuck out and stop playing your game.
3484152	3488674	I actually don't think it's a bad idea, but again, it's just about how much they use it.
3488955	3492396	Because if it's an Amber Alert every other hour, people are going to get pissed off.
3492436	3497399	But if it's for big stuff, like you need to leave your home, you need to evacuate or something.
3497479	3506683	If it's an absolute emergency like that, they have a way to call all the phones and have an automated message play so you can pick up your phone.
3506743	3509884	Because most people might not be playing a game console.
3510565	3512626	Hey, what's that crackling, rumbling sound?
3513226	3514247	Oh hey, it's fire!
3515447	3516108	Awesome!
3516828	3519530	I'm going to play it over level, it's far enough away.
3521071	3523792	I don't know, it's just a neat idea.
3523812	3525794	It's just interesting to see how it's implemented.
3525954	3528695	I think it's going to be just about as effective as it is on TV.
3528995	3532237	Which is, if you're like me, that's the time that I go get a snack.
3532297	3535679	Because that noise is... Oh god, I hate it.
3536320	3539402	SSJ100 Matt in our chat took the words right out of my mouth.
3539682	3541503	The next step would be announcements in WoW.
3543544	3545586	But then again, those people won't leave their homes anyway.
3545626	3546907	Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3546947	3548108	I resemble that remark, thank you very much.
3550671	3552953	Janayan Chat, yes, it just goes in the next time.
3553193	3555796	We interrupt this WoW raid for this important Amber Alert.
3555856	3557918	And again, guys, I'm not trying to belittle Amber Alerts.
3558098	3567527	Obviously, it's an important thing, but I think that type of thing works best, you know, on the highway, where the cars are, you know, on the signs on the highway, you know...
3567987	3571228	DarkSakura, how would you feel if you were playing a game and then suddenly...
3594892	3595292	Fire, Get Out
3615659	3621541	Fire in Bakersfield Do not give a crap.
3621781	3625523	I mean, sucks to be people in Bakersfield, but don't know.
3625543	3627243	I would want to have it be my specific zip code, maybe.
3627263	3628064	That might be more appropriate.
3640244	3647550	The chatroom collectively, I'm just kind of attributing this to several people in the chatroom, seem to think that the iPhone is a good idea for these types of alerts.
3647850	3650893	And I've heard that talk before too, is alerts through text message.
3651953	3653274	which I think could be very effective.
3653294	3653935	That'd be awesome.
3653995	3655816	And then I get charged text messaging.
3656456	3658198	Not if you have an iPhone.
3658938	3660699	Well, and your carrier doesn't charge.
3660759	3665583	I know even when I had Sprint and I got charged for every message on my plan, they didn't charge for messages they sent.
3666083	3666523	Oh, yeah.
3666683	3668645	Yeah, and I wouldn't think those you'd get charged for.
3668665	3672988	But a lot of times, though, it's built into your iPhone plan to have a certain number.
3673408	3680133	Or even if a little app you could download that's like an alert app or something.
3680153	3680233	Yeah.
3681421	3681781	Eh.
3681841	3684583	It might not have the same impact, though, that just sending everybody text messages.
3684603	3685764	Just send it to your email.
3685784	3685884	Yeah.
3685904	3687265	Just have stuff that goes to your email.
3687925	3692388	And then, of course, SJ100Matt makes the joke, Nintendo will send their Amber Alerts through friend codes.
3694793	3695873	So an Amber Alert will look like 012463.
3698234	3698555	Anyhow.
3699175	3705978	Alright, hey, speaking of WoW came up in that last story and WoW is the attention this week of a lawsuit.
3706058	3706558	That's right.
3707498	3712880	One million dollars in a complaint against Activision Blizzard over the design of World of Warcraft.
3713241	3723205	This complaint says the publisher maintains a quote harmful virtual environment to many of its customers by forcing them to follow the game's sneaky and deceitful practices.
3723905	3728267	Well now, what would you think about this lawsuit if I told you it was filed by Eric Estavio?
3728708	3732029	That's right, the guy who filed the lawsuit against Sony.
3732850	3734671	And the judge basically laughed it out of court.
3734991	3738233	So he went and sued Microsoft and Nintendo, which we reported on last week.
3738713	3742595	And this week, now he sued Activision Blizzard over this one.
3744056	3750860	Oh, by the way, as part of this case, Estavio has subpoenaed actress Winona Ryder...
3752358	3756681	and Depeche Mode's Martin Lee Gore to testify on his behalf.
3757842	3761444	Because apparently, I don't even want to get into it.
3761544	3763185	It's just as ridiculous as it sounds.
3763225	3764746	Does that mean they have to actually show up?
3766112	3766512	I don't know.
3766532	3767753	I think he just wanted to meet them.
3768333	3776457	I'm reminded of that scene from Clerks the Animated Series where they subpoenaed George Lucas into the courtroom, which didn't this whole topic... I want my money back.
3776477	3778678	Didn't this topic come up on the show like just two weeks ago?
3778698	3779399	Last week.
3780639	3782901	Well, here it is again, probably for the same fucking guy.
3783041	3783781	Yes, it was.
3783881	3785762	And that's just exactly what it sounds like.
3785802	3786943	I want my $8 back.
3787863	3789484	That's exactly what it sounds like.
3789504	3790504	Someone sue him.
3790584	3793226	Hey, let's have a class action lawsuit against that guy.
3795270	3805953	for ruining all of the news sites for having such an impact on the gaming culture and the game blogs for mental anguish that someone could be that stupid
3808086	3809527	Watch out or we might get sued next.
3809567	3811229	Of course, you can't get blood out of a turnip.
3811349	3812310	We don't have any money.
3812730	3813231	Good luck.
3813571	3814291	I'd take him to court.
3814352	3815252	I'd fight it all the way.
3815993	3816393	Check this out.
3816413	3816814	Check this out.
3816854	3826682	If he sued us, then we could actually petition for damages for cost if this would win.
3826742	3827063	I'd counter-sue.
3828168	3829629	And then we'd have money to advertise the show.
3829649	3830169	That would be awesome.
3830189	3830870	We would.
3831290	3832091	Here's my thought.
3832111	3833372	We'd buy a studio.
3833992	3838796	In all seriousness, though, like, okay, this is the point where you relate.
3838816	3842779	I mean, last week we were asking this, but now you really have to ask.
3843459	3843639	Money.
3843659	3843779	Money.
3843799	3843899	Money.
3868129	3869691	Thanks for watching!
3885891	3887232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3911229	3913490	That we call him Lord Voldemort here on the show.
3913510	3915211	A few folks invoking that name.
3915231	3917572	Dude, this guy is starting to make Lord Voldemort look good.
3918213	3918713	Like, really.
3919153	3923816	Like, at least you kind of knew what Lord Voldemort was thinking.
3923876	3925196	Well, it's not like you could hire him.
3925717	3925977	Right?
3927284	3928324	It's just so weird.
3930105	3934646	I really would like to find this guy and shoot him with a water gun.
3935086	3937787	I have to admit, I kind of want him on the show.
3937827	3939607	Has this guy made a comment publicly?
3939887	3942448	I don't think he's made any type of comment publicly.
3942528	3945489	All these blogs are reporting on it when really he should just be banned.
3945589	3950150	If you pay the town fool no mind, he will just go away and entertain himself in his house.
3950210	3953731	Everybody likes the town fool that jumps around and makes an ass of himself.
3953971	3954732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3973328	3974108	I love that movie.
3974448	3974788	Me too.
3975769	3977849	By the way, totally off topic and I don't care.
3978029	3984791	Did you hear that there's going to be a stage play soon with Nathan Lane as Gomez and Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia?
3985311	3985852	I'm just saying.
3986452	3987192	Epic epicness.
3987432	3988232	Nathan Lane?
3988372	3989272	I can't see that.
3989312	3989873	I'm sorry.
3990273	3993654	It's a little weird, but let's face it, Raul Julia ain't here no more.
3994414	3997655	So if they're going to go with this comic Broadway angle, why not?
3998015	3998535	I don't know.
3998555	4001856	He's a little chubby for a... You know.
4002452	4003352	Well, maybe he's worked out.
4003393	4003653	Who knows?
4003693	4004093	Anyway, look.
4004753	4009676	Ricky GoMac says about this guy, he just wants to get on Oprah before she's gone.
4011517	4012437	This might be the way to do it.
4012477	4012817	I don't know.
4013558	4015999	And then who was it that said that we should go settle this?
4016059	4016479	Oh, here it is.
4016519	4017080	Maysatsuma.
4017440	4019641	Sky, sue him so you can be on the people's court.
4019961	4028906	Yeah, if this guy does, for whatever reason, sue us, even though we're totally under our rights to comment on what is a public news story, for whatever wacky reason...
4029246	4030828	I remember the People's Court back in the day when it was Judge Wapner
4047878	4048878	Oh yeah, I remember that too.
4048939	4049839	Back in the day.
4050459	4051020	I remember that too.
4051040	4054221	You always waited for the day he was going to send somebody to the electorate chair, but it never happened.
4055001	4056002	I don't think they can.
4057042	4057783	No, you can't.
4057803	4058643	They make an exception.
4058663	4064666	That's not the way TV court works, but you know, sometimes there were just those people on the show that you wish would get the death penalty.
4064686	4066407	No, sir, you can't do that.
4067307	4068048	But you know what?
4068108	4070229	I'm going to make this exception this one time.
4072203	4073564	I vote for hanging.
4074224	4074605	You know what?
4074685	4077126	Part of me just wants to ban this guy from the show.
4077146	4077626	What do you think?
4077686	4079207	Are we going to report on this guy ever again?
4079267	4080508	Actually, you know what I want to do?
4080768	4080968	What?
4081248	4082729	I want to publicly humiliate him.
4083570	4085611	Well, isn't he kind of doing that for himself?
4085671	4087111	No, I didn't mean it like that.
4087212	4090453	I meant mock, apart from just what we're doing on the show.
4091354	4095016	Again, is there anything additional we could lend to the rest of the internet?
4095820	4098444	We'll get Brian to help us make a little big planet level.
4098484	4098844	Yes!
4110804	4114347	We've got $10 with your name on it because we have no money.
4115729	4120673	It could be a level in LittleBigPlanet where OLR goes to the people's court with Eric.
4121093	4124036	And it's about our adventures of traveling to Judge Leon.
4124056	4129080	We will provide a voice talent with Judge Mr. Spanky.
4131344	4132525	Seriously, that would be fun.
4133746	4136227	I'm in the mood to do something silly.
4136327	4137768	I'm tired of making lol sims.
4138629	4141370	So I want to do something funny.
4142811	4143992	We'll have to brainstorm off air.
4144012	4150776	Maybe if the chatters have an idea, you can email us at mailbagorangelinger.com, especially if you have LittleBigPlanet skills, because I'm loving this idea.
4152317	4153878	Yes, ActDeft has the perfect name for it.
4153918	4154739	LittleBigLawSuit.
4157540	4158121	How perfect.
4158161	4159842	What a perfect name for this whole story.
4160723	4161886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4168766	4170387	Castlevania, Lords of Shadow
4197638	4200301	and saying that it's a big departure.
4200722	4206649	So they're a little nervous about how it's going to be received.
4207911	4208912	It's going to be...
4212163	4216887	A free sort of game as in you have a free roaming world.
4216927	4219028	You can move through different areas.
4219048	4226674	There's also supposed to be a pretty A-list voice credits added in there too.
4227014	4229216	But they're a little nervous because it's going to be a different kind of Castlevania.
4229276	4231017	Wasn't this the one that had Patrick Stewart in it?
4231458	4232158	Ian McClellan.
4232178	4232338	Oh, okay.
4234801	4235142	Sorry.
4235843	4236063	What?
4236403	4237906	The mic's not on.
4238006	4238506	Turn the mic on.
4238967	4239448	Mic is on.
4239488	4239748	Oh, okay.
4239768	4240610	That was weird.
4240630	4241711	You weren't picking up for some reason.
4242432	4242572	No.
4242833	4243173	Oh, weird.
4243374	4244155	It was the ghost.
4244635	4245036	Apparently.
4245637	4247740	You read, I'm sorry, go back to the last story.
4247840	4249843	You read what the lawsuit was about, right?
4251022	4253925	about the whole fact that it takes over people's lives.
4254305	4255467	No, it doesn't take over people's lives.
4255687	4270982	He's complaining that because the speed of which you walk or run in the game is too slow, and therefore it takes you longer to finish quests, therefore causing you to have to pay longer and longer subscriptions in order to finish the quests in the game.
4271463	4272303	That was his complaint.
4272323	4274666	That's even dumber than, you know, it being addicting.
4276417	4277018	You know what?
4277358	4290010	I would almost not be, like, so pointing and laughing at this guy again if it weren't for the Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode subpoenas because that's where you went from just petty to batshit crazy, in my opinion.
4291636	4292597	and Ivorite state my opinion.
4292718	4293419	Alright, sorry.
4293639	4294099	No, that's okay.
4294500	4307037	But I want to go back to Castlevania because I'm nervous about this new Castlevania game too because let's face it, there hasn't been, in my opinion, a really, really, really memorable, keyword memorable, Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.
4308151	4309452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4329700	4329980	DarkSakura
4359927	4360967	You don't belong in this world.
4381235	4382535	Big hurrah before the end of the year.
4383456	4393919	So first thing first, we've got Avatar coming out on pretty much everything on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.
4395119	4396119	And this PC as well.
4396279	4397480	Can I be honest with you for a minute?
4397620	4397800	Yeah.
4398789	4417077	is it just me or I am so not interested in Avatar it just doesn't look good to me I'll be fair and say I realize that I'm not always into the same type of movies everybody else is but I like Terminator I like Titanic
4417816	4420017	I like, you know, all these movies that James Cameron's done.
4420397	4421117	Of course I cried.
4422237	4424138	But I'm looking at... I cheered.
4424278	4425518	I'm looking for... Shut up.
4425898	4429620	I'm looking at Avatar, and I'm just kind of like, oh boy.
4430260	4436001	This just... It just looks bloated, long, pompous, and it doesn't look like it's going to be good to me.
4436462	4438522	I'm going to go see it just because it's going to be in 3D.
4438562	4442984	It's supposed to be really awesome, but then if, you know, it sucks, I'll be sure to shout it to the world that it sucks.
4444164	4446305	The game itself is supposed to be good.
4448862	4453364	They have been working on it for a few years at least.
4453664	4455364	It's supposed to be good and not sucky.
4455684	4457125	We'll see though.
4457765	4462706	If my friends all come back and say it was freaking awesome, then I will go see it and maybe I'm wrong.
4463027	4464467	I'll just blame the marketing.
4464807	4470929	I'm kind of with you on that because it does look kind of like it could be lame.
4472962	4478306	DarkSakura just exclaimed, I love salacious pop, referring to one of our chatters.
4478346	4478846	Why is that?
4479066	4483509	Avatar looks like Starship Troopers plus Warcraft plus The Spirits Within plus corny diarrhea.
4485170	4486451	That's a pretty good way to sum up.
4486731	4488813	Now, this is my take on Avatar.
4490274	4493276	Now, I am a big fan of Fantech.
4494725	4504419	and looking into how they make it, the behind the scenes stuff, the technology going into it, the innovations that are actually being made
4505456	4508819	in the CG process, in the motion capture.
4509580	4512002	That's really, really interesting to me.
4513023	4513523	I'll give you that.
4514244	4525794	A lot of times I'll go see a movie, even if it's supposed to be the corn and crap, I will see it to see how the final product looks.
4527715	4530878	Okay, I do like a lot of movies that people hate.
4530958	4531779	I love bad movies.
4531899	4533060	I loved Hypercube.
4534139	4561189	I loved Xanadu I love Showgirls I love Showgirls too and you got me into that movie you don't know shit but no in the end but you also know that I don't really go for the stuff that's overhyped I really avoid stuff that's overhyped but I think I'll see this one I won't see it opening week because honestly I don't want to see it that bad
4562089	4564170	But I will see it after it's been in the theater for a little bit.
4564410	4565950	I didn't mean to turn this into Avatar hate.
4565970	4566530	I'm so sorry.
4566570	4571111	But I had to get that out there because there was just something about it that just wasn't sitting well with me.
4571291	4573472	And again, maybe it's going to be an awesome movie and I'm totally wrong.
4573512	4576193	But I love some of the comments from chat.
4576553	4579634	Legend of Zaku says, Avatar equals dances with Smurfs.
4580574	4581174	Dances with Smurfs.
4582130	4583471	That's from South Park.
4583932	4584513	Oh, was it?
4584773	4585554	Yeah.
4585574	4586875	Oh, I didn't see this week's episode.
4586895	4587596	That must be what it is.
4588417	4593182	And then SSJ100Matt saying, I heard it's getting terrible pre-screening reviews.
4593582	4597346	Well, you know, this is the time for them to fine-tune it and tailor it and what have you.
4597446	4600349	So I hope for their sake they can pull it off.
4600409	4602251	Now, I will say this, though, at the same time.
4603300	4612684	I still want to go see The Princess and the Frog because I am all about Disney going back to the way they did movies back in the 90s with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and all this.
4613625	4616086	Just because a movie is overhyped doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be bad.
4616246	4618667	There's been zero hype for that movie.
4620352	4645968	maybe it's just because I'm a Disney fan and I'll fully admit obviously I'm biased in that regard it looks good but I'm just saying there's been no hype whereas Avatar they were just like fucking your eyeballs in 2009 I don't think so you don't have kids though and I think they've been aiming this at the kids I think it'll do decent I don't think it's going to be like their huge movie but I think it'll do decent enough that they'll get back into doing 2D movies we'll see I think it'll make more than Avatar does
4647486	4649347	No, it won't.
4650307	4650967	Care to make a wager?
4651587	4654348	No, I don't, but I can tell you right now it's not gonna.
4654568	4654948	I tried.
4655448	4656329	Alright, let's move on.
4656369	4657249	Sorry, release dates.
4657869	4658949	Derailed the show, my bad.
4659269	4659790	Totally.
4660910	4662490	Okay, so other things coming out this week.
4662650	4666431	Rogue Warrior coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
4667372	4674774	MX vs. ATV Reflex on the DS, PSP, Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
4677344	4680647	And God, I forgot that this movie was coming out, and I really don't want to see this.
4680867	4684530	Alvin and the Chipmunks' Squeakquel on the Wii and DS this week.
4685051	4686011	Why, God?
4686532	4687253	Why?
4687273	4689274	It's got the Chipettes this time.
4691516	4696460	I'd rather... I would rather watch, like, Avatar...
4697863	4701445	for 24 hours straight, or any... Oh, I know what I was going to say.
4701725	4702225	Here's the thing.
4702905	4706667	When I saw the trailer for Avatar, it looked like an M. Night Shyamalan movie to me.
4707127	4708668	That was what didn't sit well with me.
4708748	4716512	So I would rather than watch the new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I would rather watch, what was it called, The Happening, or whatever that latest... It was so horrible.
4716592	4721194	You sure you weren't watching The Last Airbender, which is an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
4721214	4721714	Um...
4722547	4728070	I would rather watch The Happening five times in a row than watch the new Alvin Chipmunks movie.
4728530	4732792	For the record, this is actually going back to what you're saying about The Princess and the Frog.
4732812	4733673	This is from Becky.
4736534	4741477	Tell Rob that I do have a kid and I actually haven't seen much about Princess and the Frog on Disney Channel yet.
4741957	4742258	Really?
4742538	4745501	She's got a two-year-old who watches Phineas and Ferb, Rob.
4745782	4747023	Remember, I showed you some of that.
4747043	4747323	I know, I know.
4747343	4748144	And it's great.
4748304	4749266	Fair enough, fair enough.
4749566	4751188	I guess, I guess, fair enough.
4751488	4752329	But, you know what?
4752489	4756133	Once it does come out, and it hasn't come out yet, or it did come out last Friday.
4757295	4757495	What?
4757615	4758676	The Princess and Frog.
4758756	4760178	It's in only New York and L.A.
4760338	4761199	I think it's everywhere the 11th.
4762319	4766343	Dirt 2 on PC, the very first DirectX 11 game making its way out Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on the DS this week
4777675	4797523	Wreck Room, a generic party game for the Wii Storybook Workshop, the latest schlock from Konami coming out on the Wii Seven Wonders 2 on the DS for your casual game fans Safecracker, also casual game fans
4799484	4803247	World Party Games, yet another generic party game out on the Wii.
4803628	4809713	Of course, next week we're going to have some really awesome stuff with Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks and Saboteur.
4810998	4811758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4834304	4853671	for the most part it's going to be pretty quiet the rest of the year but I will say on the PlayStation 3 they also get Assassin's Creed 2 over there and Fallout 3 again they're also getting some discounts on folklore moving into the PlayStation 3 the best or as they call it their folks soul and Ratchet and Clank's future as well as Resistance Fall of Man those are all going into the best series over in Japan
4854071	4854231	Hey, hey!
4878127	4879847	They're getting it this week, though, on December 3rd.
4880528	4883888	Sengoku Musou 3 comes out on the Wii as well.
4883908	4885229	That's from Koei Entertainment.
4885949	4888950	That is, I believe, another one of their strategy-type games.
4888990	4893211	That's one of the... I think Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
4894271	4898312	Well, Koei did all of those games, and I'm pretty sure this is right in that same vein.
4898352	4898892	Those games are...
4899492	4902615	Way more popular over there than they are here.
4902795	4906477	Although, I will say, the game certainly is not without its fans over here.
4907298	4909900	On the Nintendo DS, Cross Treasures.
4910760	4912742	You can get that out there from Squeenix.
4913202	4915404	Also coming out, Kaiju Busters.
4917369	4918510	DarkSakura.com
4936644	4940967	And then lastly, going over to the PSP, seeing if there's anything to look forward to there.
4941427	4948471	Oh, LittleBigPlanet Portable gets its release in Japan this week, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.
4949311	4950432	Ooh, that sounds fun.
4950572	4955535	And also, this one might be worth importing to some people, Phantasy Star Portable 2 comes out this week.
4956435	4956735	Ooh.
4956915	4957476	Oh, and Jamie?
4957776	4958096	What?
4958396	4960998	Tokimeki Memorial 4 on the PSP this week.
4961318	4963139	No Tokimemo for me, please.
4965061	4967243	Someone in Japan send me President Cat.
4968324	4969145	How about the UK?
4970366	4971067	Not really a whole lot.
4971667	4975091	On the fourth we have Colin McRae, Dirt 2, like anyone cares.
4975972	4978615	We have Easy Piano for DS.
4980196	4984300	And then we have Avatar The Game and The Saboteur.
4984641	4986803	Oh, and Tony Hawk Ride, but who plays Tony Hawk anymore?
4989048	4993610	I don't care how unrealistic it is, I want to grind on the moon or something like that.
4993750	4995351	I mean, that would be awesome.
5019156	5022718	There was a comment from chat, did we miss Final Fantasy XIII in the release dates?
5022759	5026401	You know what, it's very possible because I believe that's releasing on a day all its own, right?
5026441	5028242	And I was only looking at the December 3rd dates.
5028302	5029843	When is Final Fantasy XIII out in Japan?
5029863	5030203	I don't remember.
5030223	5031324	I know it's out in December.
5032105	5032525	Let me look up.
5032545	5035827	I'm looking up its release date real quick to see if I did miss it for this week.
5036768	5037728	Why don't we get into the next story?
5037748	5038329	I'll come back to that.
5039910	5040130	Okay.
5041551	5043672	Okay, so... December 17th.
5043832	5044193	There you go.
5044733	5045714	So we still have a couple weeks.
5045954	5046134	Yep.
5046174	5046234	Um...
5048467	5052810	I don't know why you'd play this game other than for charity, and that's what's been done.
5053390	5059855	The Desert Bus for Charity, an annual event where they play the horrible, horrible game that's part of the Penn & Teller game.
5060675	5061956	And they have raised over $100,000.
5062056	5064558	In fact, they have raised $132,568.94, which is 88% over last year's total.
5078787	5081670	I guess a comedy troupe load-ready run.
5082251	5085454	And of course, this benefits the Child's Play charity.
5087275	5087876	That's kind of cool.
5088236	5090979	And apparently... 88 hours...
5095197	5095998	Oh my god.
5096298	5099560	Of driving, booked by the pre-event donations.
5099760	5103101	But now it's not just one guy that has to do the whole thing, right?
5103342	5106063	It's like a comedy, people do the whole thing.
5106403	5115869	I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to tune into the whole thing, although I read about it and I thought it was cool, but there's lots and lots of child play events going on, including Umlaut's coming up.
5115909	5118290	We had Seg on the show a couple weeks ago, and that's coming up.
5118570	5119010	God, it's...
5120239	5120680	Charity Marathon
5138028	5141611	When we have a day off that isn't... I'm not playing that game, though, that's for sure.
5141651	5145013	No, no, we won't play that game, but we've got to do our own spin on Charity Marathon.
5145053	5145854	Find a good charity.
5146034	5148516	We still need to do the classic game stuff.
5149036	5150877	Dan and I were talking about busting out the Master System today.
5150897	5151558	That's what I'm saying.
5151578	5156301	We need to do our classic game marathon for charity, where we let donators pick the games or something.
5156421	5160424	Well, here's what I think we should do for that, is I pick...
5162785	5186737	6 or 7 of my systems it'll be easy to shift out or whatever and then put up a list of like 12 games each so someone can say spin a wheel you get like a twister wheel okay you get this system and then spin a wheel again for the number on the list and then oh you get this game make it all completely random and go
5187117	5189278	New game, move, next seat, move down.
5189298	5191259	Yeah, so you're kind of like musical chairs, but with games.
5191279	5193601	Well, like, you know, the Mad Hatter.
5193781	5194781	New cup, move down.
5195321	5196142	New game, move down.
5197122	5201365	Sadly, you know, usually what would be a great weekend for me is Martin Luther King weekend, because I have a holiday there.
5201385	5202245	I don't know if you guys do.
5202445	5204786	I mean, Jamie works for a bank, so she has everything off.
5205287	5207548	But sadly, I'm going to Seattle that weekend.
5207808	5208689	I have Arbor Day off.
5209549	5209769	Arbor Day?
5209809	5210149	No, I don't.
5210509	5211070	I'm kidding.
5212000	5214801	So you can go out and plant a tree like John Denver told us to?
5214921	5216442	I mean, is that what you're doing?
5216462	5219043	Well, John Denver also, you know, flew a plane.
5219083	5220764	Said he was leaving on a jet plane, and he did.
5221965	5223185	That was so awful.
5224166	5226087	I mean, I love it, but it was really awful.
5226267	5230589	It was definitely, like when they say tragic irony, I think that's exactly what they meant.
5230829	5231870	It wasn't really a jet plane.
5232070	5234471	It was a little prop plane, wasn't it?
5235611	5236012	Whatever.
5236652	5238793	If he had been leaving on a jet plane, he probably wouldn't have crashed.
5239724	5240665	All right, let's move on.
5240685	5242446	Now we're making John Denver jokes.
5243107	5243547	I don't know.
5243607	5244288	You started it.
5245349	5245929	Uh-uh.
5246409	5246710	Whatever.
5246890	5247110	All right.
5247330	5250673	Hey, every week here on the show, we like to do a little segment here pretty regularly.
5250693	5252394	We've done it for, gosh, over a year now.
5252474	5254096	It used to be like the website of the week.
5254156	5256337	Then it turned into like the DarkSakura's advice column.
5256858	5258279	And now it's the classic game of the week.
5258399	5260060	I kind of miss doing the website of the week, though.
5260421	5261221	I do kind of miss it, too.
5261241	5262923	But this is really fun.
5262943	5266325	If I was going to do another one, though, I'd do Weebles again and make that a third time.
5267246	5267526	I'm sorry.
5267586	5268187	I love Weebles.
5269980	5278706	Well, moving on, it's now the classic video game of the week where DarkSakura digs through the classic game archive she was previously speaking of and picks out the game that she says, you know what?
5279687	5281068	The kids need to play this game.
5281088	5286392	They need to respect their elders and they need to dust off their NESs or whatever it happens to be and go play this game.
5286712	5289635	So, DarkSakura, what is the game that is the classic game of the week?
5290035	5291816	A game that pisses me off sometimes.
5292597	5293858	Little Nemo Dream Master.
5295754	5297535	Play a little bit of the music.
5297775	5298655	Play a little bit of the music.
5325751	5326452	Isn't that good music?
5326472	5328614	It's a little bit quiet, but it's very Capcom.
5328774	5339123	One thing about Junko Tamiya is that she also did the music in Bionic Commando and in Strider, actually.
5340304	5345369	So those are two notable games that had fantastic music.
5346090	5346950	Oh, and Gunsmoke.
5348672	5348852	But...
5351313	5352556	Back to Little Nemo.
5353097	5356084	In Japan, it was called Pajama Hero Nemo.
5357429	5358730	Which is pretty cute.
5359250	5363371	But it's actually based off of the Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland.
5364312	5374956	The animated movie, actually, that came out based off of the comic strip from the early... I believe the original comic strip came out in, I want to say, the 1920s?
5375756	5379658	I've seen, actually, an original compilation of the Little Nemo books.
5380178	5381199	Okay, no, sorry, I take that back.
5381219	5381759	1905 was when the...
5385120	5389384	The comic series first started in 1905 and then went on through 1914.
5390665	5395909	The books that I saw were published in the 1920s.
5396089	5396829	Anyway, that's another thing.
5397070	5399572	Because you know me and book publishing, I'm all into that.
5400632	5410440	So going back to this, it's about a little boy who goes into his magical dream world called Slumberland.
5411081	5411681	And he can...
5413266	5414687	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5433164	5434124	I have to be honest, Jamie.
5434645	5437665	I remember hearing about this game when I was a kid.
5437685	5439746	Like, I think I saw the commercials, but I never played it.
5440166	5444328	So now that I'm kind of watching the video here that the music's coming off of, you know, it's kind of interesting.
5444368	5448469	Like, it definitely has that whole, like, the different suits of Mario, but it's...
5449329	5450649	I can't explain it.
5450689	5453330	You just kind of have to play it yourself, I guess, or check out one of the videos of it.
5453570	5457471	Like, you know, right now he's kind of riding a dinosaur, which kind of reminds me of something in Adventure Island.
5457551	5477217	I love the dinosaur, but see, now you, for certain abilities that you get with some suits or some animals, you lose other, like, for example, you see he could, like, for example, the frog or, I think it's either a frog or a dragon or something, but he can do like a belly slap, like a belly splash move and land on them.
5478117	5487804	And, um, and he, if his belly lands on the creatures, then he can actually knock them out of the sky, you know, to damage, um, I think that's the creature on the thing.
5488084	5490245	Yeah, it looks like a little, like, kind of gecko-looking thing.
5490265	5492307	Yeah, but he can, he can pop them.
5493047	5499772	Um, but, like, you can get a mole, and you can dig, or you can get a gorilla and punch them, or climb up the walls.
5499832	5507137	The purple little lizard thing, I think it's like a salamander or something, but it can walk up walls, you know, like a lizard can.
5508277	5509377	Oh, good lord.
5533664	5562891	and as you were watching some of this they actually are hidden like you had to actually in the first level if you get the mole you actually have to go all the way over as far as you can through the dirt to the left and then go down through the floor to where two little blocks of of area that you can dig through to get underneath to another place where you get the key and a one up and some other crap um so uh
5565180	5585884	You have to have the right animals to get to some places, but if you don't really have everything, and on top of that, your animals have different lifeforms than Nemo does, so sometimes you have to really be judicious with what you have to make it through.
5585904	5592905	So actually, I'd have to say it's one of the harder NES games there are, and it's a cute game.
5593482	5594343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5615825	5618166	Yeah, I would go that.
5618807	5622649	But, again, like you said, it was released by Capcom.
5622669	5627911	The year that it came out was in 1990, so I was actually just starting high school.
5629052	5629452	Yeah, I know.
5629832	5632254	Actually, no, I was in 8th grade.
5632534	5633955	Yeah, no, you were in 8th grade.
5634815	5635936	And I remember...
5637432	5639533	Having a fit over this game.
5639653	5642055	I had it when it came out.
5643336	5647398	And I would just... I don't think... I think this is actually one game to this day I haven't beaten.
5648739	5650460	So, that's an indication.
5650941	5652762	And I've beaten a lot of games.
5653462	5659066	Once again, Jamie, a very popular pick in our chatroom, at least those that have played it, but a lot of folks agreeing with you on the difficulty that it was a bitch.
5659662	5667325	I agree with Ricky GoMac that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES, that game was freaking difficult too.
5667945	5674847	That game pissed me off to the point that I wanted to throw it down the stairs and I did and actually it lived through it and I can still play it.
5676147	5677948	That was actually one game I had that was duct taped.
5679033	5679373	Nice.
5680634	5681655	She'll have to do that another week.
5682055	5683136	That's a different game altogether.
5683836	5685417	No, that game is not going to make it on my list.
5686078	5691461	That game is not going to make it on my list because to this day, I'm still angry.
5692502	5693763	Angry, Rob, angry.
5694463	5697485	I'm thinking one day we need to do the anti-classic game of the week.
5697605	5699967	The game that DarkSakura says, do not play this game.
5700307	5700747	It's terrible.
5700827	5702308	I could tell you what that is right now.
5702328	5704470	In fact, I'll go ahead and mention it right now.
5705171	5706412	I guess we're done with Little Nemo then?
5706452	5706652	Yeah.
5706732	5709594	Okay, Little Nemo, the Dream Master, your classic game of the week on the NES.
5709614	5710155	There you go.
5710195	5717059	There's a game that is so bad that Dan and I rented it from Blockbuster because we were really into renting games every week.
5717079	5718701	This was about right before the Dreamcast came out.
5719641	5720682	So, around 98, 99.
5722163	5729728	We rented... We were also into wrestling games at the time because the WrestleMania 2000 came out on the Nintendo 64, which was rad.
5729748	5729808	We...
5734031	5762863	got NWO Thunder and we got it home we played it for about 10 minutes and called Blockbuster and said we just rented this game about 30 minutes ago because we had to drive back we want our money back or can we change it out for something else and we went in there and the guy was like oh yeah I remember you if it's that bad then yeah we'll change it out it was so bad that Blockbuster let us change out our rental
5764259	5765759	Well, that's just good customer service, you know.
5765799	5768680	But it was... It probably wasn't the first time they got out.
5768700	5770941	I kept Spice World longer than that game, Rob.
5771821	5772341	I loved Spice World.
5772361	5773741	And yes, I rented Spice World.
5773761	5775442	There were some lulzy moments in Spice World.
5775862	5777762	You just make Baby Spice do backflips over and over.
5777782	5778322	It's really funny.
5778442	5788864	I've bought games that are arguably bad games, and I liked them better than that game.
5788904	5791025	That's probably the worst game I've ever rented.
5791417	5795579	I would say the worst video game experience I ever had was when I got Tetris Plus on the PlayStation 1.
5795619	5796639	What a colossal letdown that game was.
5808283	5814808	Tetris was so huge at the time, you know, especially on the NES, and I think everybody very fondly remembers that game, and it's been done very well on many platforms.
5814848	5817130	The DS has an awesome version of Tetris.
5817411	5828900	Even Tengen Tetris is pretty good and kind of reminiscent of the arcade version, but I'll tell you what, Tetris Plus, which was by, and I remember to this day, Jellico, did it on the PlayStation 1, and it is horrific.
5829200	5837126	It is bad, it is terrible, because they changed the game mechanic of Tetris, and it was one of those things where I spent, like, I bought it, because I was like, oh, it's Tetris, how can it be bad?
5837907	5838347	I hated it.
5838668	5842231	I played it once and I said, how can you fuck with the main game mechanic of Tetris?
5842251	5848876	Because what they did is they changed it so it was like a little professor that would walk along the top and you didn't want him to hit the- I remember that!
5849037	5850478	Oh my god, that was awful!
5850598	5850858	Yes.
5851098	5852600	It was a terrible, terrible game.
5853340	5854521	That was hideous!
5854661	5854902	Yes.
5855662	5856063	Thank you.
5856683	5857304	I'm not alone.
5857704	5858104	You know what?
5858224	5860506	That deserves- Wah, wah, wah, wah.
5860546	5862508	Yeah, I need to fire up the Price is Right losing horn.
5862528	5863289	Alright.
5864049	5864530	We're idyllic.
5866638	5868579	Yeah, that game is an enemy of the Daleks.
5868839	5870919	Loki, traumatically bad video game experience?
5870959	5871640	Anything you can remember?
5872300	5873700	Not really.
5875601	5878162	No, there's not really anything horribly bad that I played.
5878222	5882923	I always used to find some sort of good out of it, I guess.
5883325	5885827	Well, aren't you just like the Mother Teresa of video games?
5899528	5902509	Dragon Ball GT Final Battle, actually.
5902849	5903789	What was so terrible about that?
5904029	5904429	Everything.
5905229	5917192	Okay, keep in mind, it was like the first Dragon Ball game that came out in the U.S., unless you want to count the Dragon Ball RPG that they made into something else over here, which doesn't count.
5919313	5924094	It had the awful, awful American voice acting, and it was just...
5925114	5927876	I still don't regret the trade I loved Blue Stinger
5954249	5956089	Isn't that Twinbee or something?
5956810	5958210	No, Stinger was Twinbee.
5958670	5961111	Blue Stinger was the game that came out.
5961571	5970693	The Japanese version of that one was sort of lauded because it had a movie director directing the cameras and cinematics in the movie.
5971613	5972813	Not in the movie, in the game.
5973053	5975314	But when it came out over here, they butchered the camera.
5975614	5976994	Because people were like, oh, we can't control it.
5977054	5979495	I was like, I did just fine.
5979615	5981876	It was a little kind of survival horror type of game.
5982476	5983136	But it was a lot of fun.
5983196	5983596	I loved it.
5984201	5984501	All right.
5985202	5986323	Well, we're going to take a break, guys.
5986603	5991388	We're going to rest our voices here a minute and refill our waters and run to the restroom and all that good stuff.
5991648	6000296	But when we come back on Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to get into Part B. We've got plenty more news for you guys tonight, a lot of rapid-fire news, including some updates on Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2, and so forth.
6000816	6002157	And then we're going to get into some other stories.
6002177	6003719	We're going to talk Tron in Part B.
6004680	6006881	I know, so definitely stay tuned for that.
6007082	6010344	I mean, when we start Part B, I can just go greetings programs.
6010404	6011325	Yeah, if you really want to.
6011365	6012606	And at the end, you can say end of line.
6013066	6014408	In fact, end of line.
6014528	6016810	At the very end of tonight's show, I want you to say end of line.
6017250	6018271	Okay, can we do that?
6018611	6018751	Yeah.
6018831	6019892	Like after the credits and everything?
6020052	6020192	Yeah.
6020353	6020713	End of line.
6021468	6022570	We should do it before the credits.
6022850	6023191	Alright, fine.
6023211	6024493	We'll do it that way.
6024954	6027338	And a proper sequel to Puzzle Quest.
6028079	6029241	Not Galactrix, but something else.
6029261	6031385	We're going to talk all that in Part B. So stay tuned, guys.
6031405	6034329	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6040538	6040978	Orange Lounge Radio
6063436	6085551	by the way we do tape live of course every Sunday night at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where there's lots of great programming all throughout the week check out the buffet of great game programming they have here and you know what and I always say if OLR you're finding this show just isn't your taste hey no harm done but there might be a show that is more your taste throughout the various independent podcasters that broadcast over there at All Games Radio so check it out
6086291	6090154	We're going to move on and get into some of the rapid-fire news tonight.
6090214	6093636	And then we'll move into Twitter topics right after that for those of you guys who asked us questions on Twitter.
6094216	6095877	And then we got some more gaming news.
6096117	6099279	So, Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid-fire news?
6100186	6104851	Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption
6124249	6125089	Uncharted 2 The Fort
6150462	6157064	And it's a Fortress multiplayer map from Chapter of Drake's Fortune.
6157744	6158284	That's kind of neat.
6159425	6160445	Well, may the fort be with you.
6160665	6163386	Yes, and it's free, so you can't beat free.
6164786	6172089	And then finally, Valve is selling some Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead themed greeting cards.
6172949	6173069	And...
6174642	6175762	Those look kind of cool.
6176163	6179804	I wonder if those are actual greeting cards or if they're like e-cards or something like that.
6181464	6181684	Hmm.
6182525	6186146	Actually, they are real cards.
6186466	6193848	So you can actually pick those up at the Valve Software Store at store.valvesoftware.com and check them out.
6193948	6195689	They are a little pricey.
6197289	6197609	Looks like $16.
6197990	6202231	And I'm not sure how many you get in that, but...
6204274	6208519	How many portal jokes in the Christmas cards?
6208799	6209019	None.
6209780	6210101	Really?
6210601	6211782	Zero portal jokes.
6212143	6212403	Okay.
6213922	6216884	Alright, well, moving on to some other rapid fire news I have for you guys.
6216904	6224950	There's a whole lot of Rock Band news going on, as there usually is, because every week they try to add something new, and this week there's more Nirvana coming to the 360 Wii and PS3.
6225550	6232995	Come As You Are, the MTV Unplugged version, which I think is kind of interesting, is coming out for Rock Band, as well as Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit, finally!
6233676	6234576	All in Nirvana Pack 2.
6235757	6237018	Also the band Night Ranger.
6237558	6238759	You can still rock in America.
6239159	6240940	Don't tell me you love me, and you're going to hear it from me.
6240981	6241661	Night Ranger!
6242713	6243414	I know I'm laughing.
6243635	6248043	Hey, a member of Night Ranger was in Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent.
6248524	6248785	Wow.
6251223	6255565	The Rock Band platform, by the way, now has over 1,000 songs.
6256425	6257585	390 different musical artists.
6257945	6263487	Apparently, we have collectively downloaded over 60 million songs from the Rock Band store.
6263847	6266628	Somebody's making a shitload of money.
6266948	6269409	105 consecutive weeks of new additions to the store.
6269449	6270609	Hey, that's pretty impressive.
6271149	6276471	And they actually did some math and figured out that if you wanted to play through the entire catalog, that would take two days...
6277392	6281179	18 hours and 40 minutes to play through the entire catalog, which I think I wanted to read some.
6281500	6283624	I thought I read somewhere some guy was doing for charity.
6283725	6284125	Yeah, I saw that.
6284145	6284506	Good luck to you.
6288137	6288917	Thanks for watching!
6311567	6312127	Thank you for watching!
6334437	6335738	You know, back when they were really good.
6336559	6345648	Oh, by the way, the games you can play there on Atari, you can play Asteroids, Adventure, Battlezone, Crystal Castles, Lunar Lander, and yes, Yars' Revenge.
6345948	6346368	There you go.
6347750	6349291	By the way, I used to love Crystal Castles.
6349732	6351513	That was the best game ever.
6351653	6352094	Good stuff.
6352254	6354956	I didn't like the Atari 2600 version, though, nearly as much as the arcade.
6355437	6356938	I think you'll like it, for one thing.
6357739	6358540	We've got a trackball.
6359946	6361166	That's the way it's meant to be played.
6361987	6363687	We've got a 2600 trackball.
6364588	6376711	Lastly, some game controller Christmas tree ornaments are available and I guess they're making their way around the different game blogs and you can get them, it looks like, at ponoko.com P-O-N-O-K-O dot com.
6377092	6380633	It's $25 plus $10 for shipping or more if it's somewhere else.
6381213	6384094	You can get some various game controller themed.
6384174	6386955	It looks like there's an old school NES controller and a Wiimote
6387475	6391880	Dreamcast Controller, Gettin' the Love, and of course, Where Would You Be Without a DualShock Controller.
6391920	6397227	So all of that is there in the Game Controller Christmas tree for those of you that are going to be decorating.
6398889	6400271	DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?
6400811	6401272	Stuff.
6402473	6403374	Actually, I've got good stuff.
6403835	6405317	Well, kind of good stuff, because...
6406835	6426642	There actually is a statement by Harada Katsuhiro, who is the producer behind Tekken 6, say that there's going to have more content on its way via download content, but that they're not going to charge for it or they don't intend to charge for it.
6427282	6432466	There could be, there's a, and this is a quote, strong possibility of additional download content.
6434828	6440012	But, you know, then again, they've said that before and have kind of lied.
6440412	6440873	That's true.
6440913	6444936	Didn't they say like, oh no, we didn't put Darth Vader in the Xbox Soul Calibur.
6445016	6446577	Oh no, we didn't do that.
6446637	6446998	Guess what?
6447058	6449520	And then like, psych.
6449620	6449940	Right.
6450781	6451041	Okay.
6451481	6455024	Well, also, about the Games Convention Online, you remember that?
6455564	6456405	They're doing another one.
6457496	6463683	and it will be from July 8th through 11th, 2010 at the Leipziger Messe in Germany.
6463783	6464604	I hope I pronounced that right.
6465185	6467167	I took German for two weeks, sorry.
6469657	6476564	But they got 43,000 attendees last year, so they're hoping that with another day they can get more.
6476945	6478807	So hey, good for them.
6480268	6484733	And lastly, and this is something I'm pretty happy about, Bayonetta demo.
6485313	6488597	We should be getting it in Europe and North America on December 3rd.
6489898	6492821	And that will be freaking fantastic.
6493857	6496059	LittleBirdie told me you can get it early if you know where to look.
6497080	6497360	Really?
6498120	6501203	I think it was through GameSpot.com.
6501223	6505446	If you're like a member over there, you can get a code generated, something like that, for the demo.
6505486	6509569	I haven't had a chance to check it out myself because, again, I got a Bork 360 that I've been too lazy to replace.
6509609	6520117	See, this, folks, is why you need to create a Japanese region account so that you can download these region-free demos to your 360 or PlayStation 3 way early.
6522014	6526575	I have one for every region on the PlayStation 3 and I have one for Japanese and US and my 360.
6527356	6528116	Just putting it out there.
6528756	6533057	Anyhow, let's move on to some Twitter topics and some things that you guys are asking us on the Twitter.
6533077	6535978	Of course, if you don't already have us on Twitter, you should really consider adding us.
6536178	6538699	www.twitter.com slash OLR.
6538779	6540459	We always take messages before every show.
6540959	6542720	Starting off with Spazinator tonight.
6543440	6547001	How about a discussion of some of the better PC exclusives out there?
6547681	6548321	Must-owns.
6548401	6550161	For example, recommendations.
6550541	6554482	With me getting a PC not too long from now, I'd like to know what to get above and beyond WoW.
6555262	6557723	Bummer, because WoW would have been the first thing I suggested it would be.
6557763	6559543	But, you know, a lot of MMOs.
6559603	6561583	We haven't really seen console MMOs.
6562044	6563604	Granted, Final Fantasy XI.
6563644	6565524	I know the PS3 has some in development.
6565544	6567145	Seriously, there's going to be a lot of stuff in the spring.
6567325	6568005	Supposedly.
6568045	6569125	Unless it, you know, gets...
6570506	6579655	But right now, you know, the Guild Wars, the City of Heroes, the Aion, the Champions, the Star Trek Online, none of those are on the console, nor are they going to be on the console.
6580216	6581797	So, you know, all those types of MMOs.
6581877	6584460	Just a lot of stuff in the pipes, just not quite out yet.
6585181	6587283	Loki, anything you can think of as far as PC games go?
6587823	6589285	As far as PC MMOs?
6589745	6593229	No, just PC games in general that are exclusive that you can't get on the console.
6594022	6599352	Command & Conquer 4 is going to be exclusively on PC at first at least.
6600193	6605363	I'm not positive on that, but I know that's coming out in the fall and I haven't heard about a console version yet.
6607118	6610200	X-Link suggests Civilization 4 and I give that a hell yes.
6610740	6621844	The Civilization series is outstanding and they did do like kind of a dumbed down version of Civilization called Civ Revolution for the Xbox 360 and PS3 although I will say Civ Revolution I liked.
6622004	6627367	It kind of reminded me of the very first Civilization game so when I say dumbed down I don't mean that in a negative way.
6627867	6630328	If you like that game definitely Civ 4.
6630708	6633349	That's a great suggestion from X-Link in our chat room.
6634270	6634390	So...
6635867	6637650	Let's move on to some other questions.
6637990	6641897	I like this one from Fernando on Twitter and this is a good one for Loki.
6642337	6648427	Will there ever be an installment of Grand Theft Auto where you play a female and would it sell?
6650102	6651804	I think it would, and I hope there is.
6652964	6661991	Because, hell, they've done it with Saints Row, where you can play as a female character throughout that game, and it works pretty well.
6664292	6672438	You may remember before when people were putting out fake screenshots for Grand Theft Auto 4, it had a female wheeling a mace, and that looked pretty awesome.
6672458	6673639	I don't see why it couldn't happen.
6674229	6675290	Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption
6695689	6698812	If you want to see that, dude, I would say email them.
6698832	6699733	But you know what I got to say?
6700794	6705898	I think Rockstar has been pretty decent about, you know, kind of an equal opportunity, if you will.
6705998	6710022	You know, I'm sure they're about the story and the art they're trying to go for first.
6710062	6713225	And if they can work it in for a female protagonist, they will.
6714366	6715907	Moving on, let's see...
6719965	6722069	Looking at this one from Tigerclaw.
6722149	6726196	Nathan Drake gets supersized for Thanksgiving weekend and sends us this over.
6726937	6728660	Apparently the Uncharted developers...
6730706	6733468	made Nathan Drake look fat during Thanksgiving.
6733508	6734448	That's kind of funny.
6734589	6736710	They made him gain a few pounds there.
6737270	6739732	Was that something that was actually in the game, or is that just screenshots?
6740632	6743094	No, I guess that's just something they rendered, those screenshots.
6743114	6744455	That wasn't actually in the game.
6744475	6746436	That would be funny if you played it on Thanksgiving.
6747377	6748778	That would be kind of funny, actually.
6749218	6750639	That's pretty cool.
6752532	6753552	Thank you for watching!
6774187	6780971	So Obama and apparently the LittleBigPlanet team are teaming up for kids.
6781792	6799684	And the White House, they basically announced that they're going to have a program to improve science and math education with a variety of different entertainment software association-backed initiatives, including a program to put LittleBigPlanet in libraries, as well as $300,000 in game design challenges.
6800264	6801405	So that's kind of cool.
6801625	6802986	And I mean, hell, LittleBigPlanet,
6804207	6808050	Very flexible with what you can do with it, and it's supposedly pretty easy to learn.
6808411	6812274	I still haven't actually sat down to try and make a level, even though I really wanted to.
6812314	6813355	It's fucking hard!
6813976	6815737	It takes a lot of dedication.
6815757	6817499	It's just because we're older, that's why.
6817539	6825526	Maybe, maybe, but that's why I invited the gentleman on the show earlier tonight, because I know it's not easy to have that kind of dedication.
6825586	6829690	I thought it was kind of awesome, and then to have it all take off, and so forth.
6829950	6850838	Basically, they said, you know, the Sony LittleBigPlanet initiative, Game Changers, is part of a $2 million 2010 digital media and learning competition funded by the MacArthur Foundation and involves Sony donating 1,000 PlayStation 3s and copies of the LittleBigPlanet to libraries and committee organizations.
6851258	6856260	Participants will strive to create levels that involve science, technology, engineering, and math.
6856760	6858761	Well, engineering, health, physics, and...
6860782	6866264	The second program is called the STEM Nation Video Game Competition.
6866684	6879309	It's a three-pronged $300,000 contest encouraging entrants to create the best browser video games that teach the STEM disciplines for a trio of ages 4-8, 8-12, and 12-16.
6879849	6888353	The competitions intend to reach historically underserved populations including girls and minority students according to the ESA press release.
6890012	6890555	That's kind of neat
6892230	6898251	Kind of interesting, especially the whole fact that video games usually get a bad rap.
6898291	6907193	In fact, ironically, and I swear I didn't plan this, I'm wearing my ECA shirt today with the controllers on it that says, contrary to popular opinion, these do not make me a killer.
6907533	6916295	You know, video games get such a bad rap usually out there that games like Manhunt 2 are going to turn us all into murderers and all this garbage.
6916555	6920036	And if I remember correctly, the unedited, unrated...
6920396	6922237	PC version came out and the world did not end.
6922617	6923558	Yeah, it really didn't.
6924098	6928581	And so it's kind of neat to see video games being embraced in this regard.
6928701	6934624	Do you think this is something that people will actually really get into and it will be a successful program?
6934844	6935765	I don't see why it can't be.
6935805	6942228	I mean, hell, we grew up on Oregon Trail and number munchers and shit like that.
6942508	6945050	It's just kind of an evolved version of that.
6945310	6946231	I remember we had...
6947819	6949381	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6964938	6980253	They wouldn't do something like this where, you know, challenge people to kind of learn how to use computers and learn how to, you know, build stuff in video games and whatnot to kind of help promote education and, you know, their agendas with the science and math programs.
6980793	6983116	So it sounds like a good idea to me.
6983276	6988401	It's a way to reach children at a level that they're, you know, going to be interested in.
6990290	6991211	Carameldansen
7016011	7018594	Logo, the programming language, right?
7018774	7025380	Forward 30, right 90, forward 30, right 90, to draw a square and all that stuff.
7025400	7026541	Fun stuff.
7028154	7029794	Hey Jamie, Tron.
7030355	7030735	Tron!
7030915	7034836	That's right, if you want to see more information about Tron, you're going to have to watch the VGAs.
7035256	7041658	That's right, the Spike Video Game Awards apparently is going to have some new Tron information here.
7042458	7045039	I guess this is not about the movie, this is about the game.
7045059	7046559	The game based on the movie?
7046679	7048760	Apparently, yeah, the game that's based on the new movie.
7049360	7053321	There's actually a little teaser that went up, and it looks like the game might actually just be called Tron.
7053662	7054462	You might remember...
7055242	7057763	They tried relaunching Tron a couple years ago.
7057803	7060584	There was a Tron 2.0 video game I remember that came out.
7060924	7061784	It was pretty awesome.
7062184	7066926	It was pretty cool, but it didn't do very well at all, which is kind of unfortunate.
7067826	7075769	But yeah, there's movie sequels coming out called Tron Legacy, and apparently more information is going to come out at the Spike Video Game Awards.
7075989	7077590	So that'll be on Saturday, December 12th.
7078490	7081854	So, very, very brief teaser that's hit the internet recently.
7082214	7083235	I don't know if Jamie's seen it.
7083315	7086258	I'm trying to pull it up here in studio so she can kind of get a peek here at what it looks like.
7087620	7089222	I don't know if it's going to play very well here.
7090623	7093847	But you just see somebody... Virus detected.
7093867	7094087	Motorbikes.
7094107	7094467	And remember...
7096329	7096970	Light Cycles, Rob.
7096990	7097770	Sorry, Light Cycles.
7098391	7098731	That's it.
7099111	7101473	I remember the Spike TV Video Game Awards.
7101533	7108759	That's also your chance to vote for the most anticipated game where you get to write in your own choice and perhaps President Cat.
7108973	7114395	That's right, we did try to start something on the Facebook and Twitter to get everybody to write in President Cat.
7115916	7117577	And we do hope it makes a clip package.
7117617	7124820	That's what we're hoping for, is that when they introduce who wins this award, they do some type of clip package for all the anticipated things.
7125180	7127601	We don't think it'll win, realistically.
7127881	7128582	It's not on the ballot.
7128642	7131463	But maybe it'll make the clip package, and that's really all we ask.
7132143	7135425	We want it's 15 frames of fame on Spike TV.
7138240	7143964	Don't you want to be the one to send that tweet over to Rina Wee and let them know, hey, did you know your video game was on TV in America?
7143984	7145865	I've still been spamming it.
7147566	7147806	Alright.
7148466	7149007	Let's move on.
7149047	7149927	Jamie, what do you got for us?
7151188	7153549	Well, how about some stuff about another game?
7154189	7154890	Puzzle Quest.
7155610	7156271	There's a sequel.
7157491	7162034	I never played Puzzle Quest, so I couldn't really tell you anything about the sequel.
7164155	7165236	But there is...
7168619	7170460	I actually don't really know much about Puzzle Quest Rob.
7170480	7173341	I thought you had played this before, the Puzzle Quest game.
7173541	7173961	Not at all.
7174081	7175302	Huh, okay.
7175322	7176422	I played Peggle.
7176883	7184746	There was Galactrix that came out that was supposed to be some type of sequel to Puzzle Quest, but it wasn't really because it had this whole, it was based around hexagons.
7185126	7187609	See, I was looking at the screen capture going, what am I looking at?
7187689	7189191	It's Bejeweled, basically.
7189231	7192255	It's Ye Olde Bejeweled, basically.
7192315	7199064	But then, that also isn't 100% fair, because especially Puzzle Quest had all these different other elements in it.
7199184	7203890	I mean, when you first play it, you're kind of like, oh, it's Bejeweled with attacks, but then you have to get into...
7204270	7205131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7223444	7224425	My wife did too.
7224485	7225265	That's right, yeah.
7225305	7227626	Your wife was into this too, huh?
7227746	7230088	I think I was also busy playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
7230448	7230908	Possibly.
7231228	7234570	Well, Puzzle Quest 2, I guess, is now going to be a proper sequel to the game.
7234610	7244555	So I don't know exactly what type of stuff is going to be in it, but there's an early screenshot that's leaked out there, and apparently the game is in development for the 360, it looks like?
7244795	7250298	Yeah, it looks like colors and some ogres and some guy with a sword.
7251300	7253983	Now it's interesting though because there's some new icons here I haven't seen before.
7254003	7258487	Like there's these different colored skulls, although one of them says plus three, so maybe they just changed the color.
7258768	7262231	But then there's these fists, and I don't know what that's all about.
7262532	7264213	And there's no more gold icons either.
7264333	7267537	Maybe it means a hand comes out of the screen and punches a player in the face.
7268017	7268878	That would be unfortunate.
7269679	7270840	Puzzle Quest is a fun game.
7270880	7271961	Galactrix couldn't get into it.
7272261	7273383	It was just a whole different way of thinking.
7273703	7274664	So, there you go.
7275660	7278701	I saw there was a Neopets one, and I just wanted to laugh.
7279802	7280862	People still play Neopets?
7281042	7281663	I know, right?
7284084	7284684	Let me rephrase.
7284764	7286585	People over 13 still play Neopets?
7287265	7287785	I know, right?
7288886	7289226	Loki.
7290006	7291227	No one plays Neopets.
7291867	7295169	It's all... It's all Gaia.
7295249	7295809	All a hoax.
7296929	7298130	Everyone's using Gaia now.
7299153	7300114	Thanks for watching!
7316307	7324270	Now, it has been confirmed that the trailer for Mercs Inc., the brand new game, is actually legit.
7324851	7329473	It's being developed now, not by Pandemic, since, well, they kind of closed.
7330213	7339397	And EA Los Angeles is actually going to be working on that game, and it will be a multiplayer, or at least have multiplayer in it, release.
7340217	7340778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7359906	7361668	because it was so buggy.
7361688	7363129	You'd like to exploit those buggy games, though.
7363169	7368213	I would say as much shit as you give a game like Driver 3 here on the show, you'd love to play that game because it was so bad.
7368253	7369474	And same with Mercenaries 2.
7369554	7377822	It's just so buggy, but it's hilarious because you'll just be watching and feel like, what just happened there, you know?
7379003	7379303	I don't know.
7380331	7382773	SSJ100 Matt says, I've gotten more non-gamers hooked on Peggle than Puzzle Quest.
7382793	7383433	Peggle for the win.
7383493	7384274	I like Peggle.
7384294	7385334	I liked Puzzle Quest too.
7385374	7387476	Peggle is my number one I'm stuck somewhere board game.
7387496	7389477	I like Peggle because it reminds me of Plinko.
7389497	7390358	That's why I like Peggle.
7406943	7409727	You know, that's actually the same thought that I had about it, too.
7410007	7412490	Who didn't want to play Plinko whenever you watched that on The Price is Right?
7412510	7414052	But Peggle is so fun.
7414433	7416475	Like, I'm actually working on the challenge modes.
7416876	7417597	I've beaten one of them.
7417897	7418097	Yeah?
7418518	7419679	Yeah, the extra orange.
7420400	7421301	You gotta beat more than one.
7421702	7421942	I know.
7422002	7422403	Keep trying.
7422423	7423084	But I've been doing them.
7424333	7425734	After Burner Climax
7446707	7448628	Both systems, 360 and PSN.
7448968	7451569	So, don't know if this game will hit both platforms.
7451689	7452789	I would assume it would.
7453289	7455570	Exclusives are very few and far between these days.
7456010	7464073	If they're going to bring After Burner Climax, which, by the way, they had it at John's Incredibly Sucky Pizza.
7464993	7465493	I remember that game.
7465533	7466333	That was so fun.
7466873	7471315	But I would wish that they would bring out Planet Harrier.
7472236	7478318	And by the way, for those that don't know, After Burner Climax is an arcade cabinet that's like old school After Burner.
7478518	7479258	Except better!
7479618	7482078	Yeah, but, you know, now it was modernized, basically.
7482098	7486960	Well, yeah, it has like a full hydraulic seat in it that moves and turns and everything.
7487160	7488980	Which, sadly, you won't be able to install in your chair.
7489160	7492081	Although, if you're Loki, he'll make one out of duct tape and cardboard boxes somehow.
7492201	7493201	I will not make any chairs.
7493261	7493981	And ballpoint pens.
7494482	7496022	Because you have to use the little springs of the ballpoint pen.
7496122	7496282	Anyway.
7497102	7499423	But, like, if they can bring this out, why can't they bring out Planet Harrier?
7500123	7500343	Why?
7500363	7500423	Why?
7501383	7501924	They hate you.
7503065	7504226	Planet Harry or Sega?
7506328	7506948	So check for that.
7506988	7511813	That might be coming soon if the ratings boards are to believed, which they usually are.
7512613	7513194	Just so you know.
7513434	7514695	Are those things ever wrong?
7514715	7517057	Red Entertainment's funny.
7517318	7517518	Why?
7517558	7517758	What?
7519019	7522903	To quote, After Burner Climax, is that what happens when Maverick ejaculates?
7523891	7525752	DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?
7549963	7554687	Well, speaking of Redertainment, dear OLR, first of all, thank you for updating the podcast feed.
7555127	7561472	Between these episodes, the other podcasts I listen to, the music I've recently pirated, I have enough entertainment to last me for the rest of the year at work.
7562213	7562873	What, a whole month?
7564034	7569639	Second, can you send me the link for the article from last week about the guy marrying the DS character?
7569979	7570960	Because I call bullshit.
7571909	7574470	A guy marrying a character from a DS game in Guam.
7575151	7578792	The part about Guam alone screams bullshit to me.
7579413	7580833	Now, on to the reason I'm emailing.
7581314	7586136	Recently, many of us have been sick, including SkyDarkSakura and myself.
7586536	7588817	When you are sick at home, you need things to entertain you.
7589177	7590518	These things can include video games.
7591018	7593359	What video games do you suggest for someone who is sick at home?
7593840	7598742	This game should preferably need little input, doesn't agitate you much, and can be frequently paused...
7599182	7605731	to enable you to visit the bathroom slash sickness... sick room on a frequent basis.
7606171	7608555	My suggestion is to get to ride on the Xbox Live Arcade.
7608895	7609896	Little input is required.
7609956	7612740	It's entertaining without being agitating and can be paused at any time.
7613521	7615404	I say peggle on the iPhone because you can take it with you.
7617540	7624562	I gotta be honest, when I was home for a week with swine flu and all that, I wasn't really playing video games at all.
7625783	7627423	You know, because I didn't want to think.
7628244	7629104	I watched movies.
7629404	7631925	That was more my time to catch up on movies and TV shows.
7632265	7634506	When I'm sick, really, I watch The Muppet Show.
7635706	7637327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7659131	7659772	Diapers!
7659812	7660132	Diapers!
7682895	7683916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7703553	7707576	By the present... Eating, shitting, crying, and that's it.
7708717	7711919	And trying to figure out what this big blur in front of its face is.
7713080	7713680	Do a favor.
7715141	7715682	Buy diapers.
7716682	7717703	Buy diapers.
7718544	7719004	For mommy.
7720085	7720545	For baby.
7721186	7723147	Because diapers are expensive and you need a lot of them.
7724208	7725989	And I only know this because I know mommies.
7727070	7727530	Buy diapers.
7729091	7730572	And butt paste, just because it's funny.
7730612	7731173	Ha ha ha!
7732651	7740995	No, seriously, whenever I go to a baby shower, I make sure that I do like a care basket and put butt paste in it because I just want an excuse to buy something called butt paste.
7742776	7744957	It makes it sound like it's going to glue it shut.
7745057	7745598	It's for diaper rash.
7745638	7747358	I know what it's for, but it's just funny.
7747498	7749279	The name is hilarious, butt paste.
7749339	7751020	I mean, just the way it rolls off the tongue.
7751040	7752101	Can you say it anymore on the show tonight?
7752121	7753421	Rob, give it a try.
7754122	7754642	Butt paste.
7755402	7756583	See, isn't that great?
7756963	7757423	Knock, knock.
7757824	7758284	Who's there?
7758717	7760859	But Paste.
7762440	7762920	See, that's funny.
7762940	7763461	No, it's not funny.
7763541	7764141	It's just not.
7764622	7764762	Sorry.
7764782	7765182	But Paste.
7765242	7766083	It's just hilarious.
7766183	7766683	Moving on.
7766863	7767144	Okay.
7768004	7772588	This was brought to you by Stay Care Redertainment.
7773729	7778052	This message has been brought to you by Prayer, the preferred birth control method of the state of Utah.
7779333	7779934	That's funny.
7780154	7781475	Now that is hilarious.
7783637	7785258	Ooh, a long one from Spazinator.
7786345	7787326	Hi folks!
7787826	7789207	Hi Spazinator!
7790187	7798091	I just thought I'd send you three this email just in case I accidentally fall asleep like I did last week, dammit, and end up not calling as a result.
7798252	7804915	I initially intended to pass the following information along to other listeners out there who have been following my situation for the past two weeks.
7805355	7807537	I just thought I'd give a little detailed information.
7808337	7816402	Well, the Monday afternoon after OLR's episode 244 aired live two weeks ago, I placed two phone calls to Sony's customer service number.
7816942	7819563	The initial call, as you may have suspected, didn't go well.
7820024	7823686	I had explained my situation as clearly and calmly as I could after put...
7824506	7831989	After being put on hold for an insanely long time, I was told that they couldn't do anything for me.
7832309	7836750	It goes without saying that this tidbit of info did not sit well with me, and I was not about to let it just drop.
7837210	7841192	If need be, I was prepared to be a major thorn in their sides until something was done.
7841932	7845896	Short while later, I had placed a second call to Sony and had asked to speak with a supervisor.
7846336	7855084	The customer service rep that initially answered the call took down some basic info and connected me with a supervisor who, if I remember correctly, was named Gerald.
7856533	7861957	Can I just interview real quick and say, usually when you get put on hold for a long length of time, and you would know this too, Jamie.
7861977	7864919	I know you worked in a call center for a while, and I trained for one and have for many years.
7865619	7869502	Usually it's not because they just want to sit there and not do anything while they have you on hold.
7869602	7870923	Usually they don't know the answer.
7870943	7871784	They're trying to find out.
7872124	7873765	That's usually why you're on hold for so long.
7874185	7875687	Not all the time, but usually.
7875767	7876707	No, well, I'll tell you.
7877648	7884573	Where I worked, we actually would have, and reps would be marked down for this, that they'd have a two-minute hold time maximum.
7885574	7885734	And...
7886414	7887297	www.DarkSakura.com
7892984	7893944	to our reps on the phone.
7894745	7898066	Or we would also take the escalated calls, you know, the pissed off people, which I loved.
7899406	7899947	I was good at it.
7900387	7907909	But anyway, we... But we'd always go back and say, hey, you've had this person on hold for this long.
7908550	7910390	Go let them know that you're still talking to somebody.
7910470	7914252	Yeah, and any call center I've been in contact with has a very similar policy.
7914352	7917193	Sony probably doesn't need one because customer service probably isn't their top priority.
7917213	7919353	I hate to say it, but, you know, they don't need it.
7919614	7919934	Yeah.
7920934	7922555	Sadly, they're the only people to make the PS3.
7922875	7926036	You know, customer service is not probably their forte.
7926256	7938580	Although... But in some cases, too, like when I was actually on the floor doing calls, I would actually run and go to the source of something, which we weren't technically supposed to do, but I knew everybody in the other department.
7938620	7942821	So sometimes you may have just someone who's in the know and knows where to go to find out what you need.
7943121	7944662	So, give them the benefit of the doubt.
7944982	7945142	Right.
7946050	7958898	However, moving forward, again, for what seemed like the trillionth time, I explained as clearly as I could in detail what the situation was and conveyed how upset I was that I no longer was able to use the content that I had paid tons of money for.
7959399	7963742	I also mentioned how aggravated I was due to how previous calls went.
7964202	7968805	Ultimately, the supervisor agreed to allow me to re-download my paid content again as a one-time deal.
7969205	7974749	He also made a point to mention that it would take a few days for everything to fully show up on my download queue due to two factors-
7975349	7977630	1.
7975489	7977630	I bought a lot of stuff and 2.
7977670	7981791	They had to go through it all and reauthorize it manually so needless to say it was going to take some time.
7982711	7986772	Considering all that I had profusely thanked the supervisor and told him that I was thankful for this.
7987312	7992613	Ultimately everything started showing up on my list late Tuesday night which I started downloading.
7992813	7995254	The first wave basically took all day to fully download.
7995314	8001275	The second wave occurred roughly at the same time the following night and again took a considerable amount of time even with high speed cable.
8001335	8004276	Needless to say two weeks later I now have all my content back.
8005555	8010196	I looked out this time, but if, God forbid, next time I may not necessarily be so lucky.
8033360	8035242	So this email is just a little on the long side.
8035362	8040226	Considering that as of late the mailbag has been a little light, I figured you three wouldn't necessarily mind too much.
8040767	8043269	Thanks again for your input and help in the whole situation.
8043589	8045471	Believe me, it's greatly appreciated.
8045851	8046812	And that's from Spazinator.
8046932	8050715	Also, he typed this whole thing, I think, on the PlayStation browser.
8050855	8051136	Wow.
8051556	8052837	Or the PSP.
8052937	8053578	That's impressive.
8053978	8056060	So yeah, very good, very few errors.
8056080	8056941	I'm quite proud of you.
8057341	8058182	DarkSakura.com
8087704	8088485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8107117	8121831	My graphics card from my computer is coming soon and I'm sure everyone will want to see the room you guys broadcast from.
8122111	8122612	No, you don't.
8123232	8123633	No, you don't.
8123693	8127697	You do not want to see the disaster this room is right now.
8127817	8131260	I will say I did take a picture of the mixing board and I took a picture of
8132681	8141327	I also uploaded my photos of the cardboard slash cabinet Oh really, you got those up there?
8141347	8160841	Oh sweet It doesn't look like much yet because I just took a few quick pictures and they're probably not even I don't know, I just took a few in case I ever wanted to explain how I made it Oh god, there it is, your cardboard box with buttons Amazing Sorry Jamie No it's fine Better in person
8161277	8163239	Well, you should color it with magic marker.
8163880	8164361	I know, really.
8164821	8165802	Or a paint pen or something.
8165903	8166443	That'd be funny.
8166724	8169587	I originally wanted to just do it just in plain cardboard.
8170628	8171249	No, seriously.
8171349	8171930	Electrical tape.
8171950	8173231	Get that cool vinyl look to it.
8174753	8175734	Well, I have duct tape.
8175854	8177717	I was thinking of wrapping some of it in duct tape.
8177737	8177997	I don't know.
8178901	8179823	Use colored duct tape.
8179943	8181825	It's going to look very ghetto when it's done.
8181885	8182966	That's going to be great.
8183868	8195642	Anyway, actually this room is ready for a complete cleanup because I have these storage bins that have been sitting here on the floor forever and I'm ready to start using them.
8197344	8212541	Also, to let anyone know too, this is sort of related, I'm getting rid of a whole bunch of manga and different books, including a few, I think I'm going to get rid of my Gothic and Lolita magazines, so if anyone wants them, let me know, we'll work something out.
8213563	8214424	But back to the email.
8216085	8221589	Um, also when Loki's arcade cabinet works, maybe we could see Loki drunk playing Daytona USA.
8221649	8222390	Haha, just kidding.
8222950	8226453	Well, I'm writing this from my Blackberry at Christmas party, so I better go.
8226773	8228934	But before I go, and this is by the way halfway through the email.
8229215	8232697	Before I go, I hope you guys check out Fallout 3 or even Fallout 1.
8233257	8238601	I recommend that you guys play Fallout 1 first since the third one is in first person and I know how DarkSakura gets motion sick.
8238881	8239922	Aw, thank you, that's so sweet.
8240683	8242724	Also, I think it's free to play on GameTap.
8242844	8242904	Um,
8244245	8253451	The third one has a game of the year edition now with all five downloaded content packs that I highly recommend anyone who hasn't played a Fallout game.
8253591	8260055	Actually, Becky's husband has Fallout 3 and I saw him play some of it and it looked really cool.
8260075	8261796	Like I said, I wouldn't be able to do too much of it.
8263649	8267031	Not to mention how much of a deal it is.
8267091	8269433	Well, I hope you guys check those out now.
8269453	8271214	If you'll excuse me, I've got gifts to open.
8271814	8274616	Sent from my Verizon Wireless Blackberry.
8275136	8275497	Wow.
8275637	8279679	We got regular email, a Crackberry, and a PSP all tonight.
8279719	8280480	That's pretty amazing.
8281468	8285412	Well, I'm going to double check and see if we've got any more just because I'm nice.
8285733	8285953	Nope.
8287094	8287655	Clank.
8288095	8292320	You want to send in an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send them.
8292720	8297566	But for now, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here on the program because, you know, sometimes things piss us off.
8298166	8300429	And so a special holiday edition of the FUs of the Week.
8315782	8318464	DarkSakura, what's on your mind tonight that you want to get off your chest?
8319145	8323009	The fact that I still need to, um, F you to me.
8323449	8327072	Because I still need to do the faceplate that we were going to autograph.
8328374	8328714	F you!
8329154	8329555	Yeah!
8329895	8331516	And you know, I had it set out.
8332057	8332477	That's alright.
8333178	8333578	We'll get it.
8333859	8336761	You know, but still, I feel bad about myself because I just remembered it.
8337262	8340445	And also, um, a secondary F you to me for not actually cleaning my room today.
8341346	8341746	Or yesterday.
8341766	8341846	Okay.
8343234	8345575	I came home very intoxicated last night.
8346335	8346615	Awesome.
8346755	8348196	My car is over at Becky's house.
8349596	8351677	She will be bringing it to me and I will be taking her home.
8352257	8354638	So F you to me and Boddington's Ale.
8355258	8357819	But bless you for doing the right thing and not driving home drunk.
8358139	8358899	That was the right thing to do.
8358919	8360240	Because I'm amazing.
8360800	8360880	Loki.
8360900	8364181	F you to burning myself on my finger with a soldering iron.
8365120	8369265	I decided for some reason to grab the tip of the soldering iron to move it to the side.
8369845	8370266	Not smart.
8370346	8374270	Why I did that and was like, ow, as it sizzled.
8375952	8376393	So that's it.
8377165	8381726	Well, maybe I'm the only one not giving an FU to myself tonight, although it does have to kind of do with me.
8382306	8384826	FU to my back, because I don't know what I did.
8384866	8389447	I think I might have slept on it wrong or something, but it's been hurting me for like a week, and it sucks.
8390267	8391508	Back pain's never any fun.
8391568	8394288	It just makes me remember that I'm getting old.
8394868	8395588	FU to getting old.
8396909	8400609	I know a lot of you people listening to this show are like, I'm 21 now, I'm old.
8401469	8401849	FU!
8403770	8405150	Wait about 10 years, then I'll tell you.
8406271	8428334	of course then again a lot of my friends that are in their 40s would say I'm being just as big of a whiner so what can you do age is just a number Loki, why don't you give us another story and then just a couple more stories here we're going to make our way to the Skype line where you guys can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so we'll have that open very soon just after a couple more stories
8428954	8450109	Well, apparently not to delay themselves from jumping on the bandwagon too late, Microsoft has decided to go ahead and patent their own Xbox 360 hint system, very similar to what we saw with the Super Guide on the Nintendo.
8450169	8453371	You may remember that the first game that had that was New Super Mario Bros.,
8455232	8474256	This new patent, though, it doesn't really say what they're going to do exactly, but it's going to have some more guides and digital brief audio commentaries or stuff that adds portions of the screen that give you hints and stuff like that.
8474716	8481418	So it's just kind of a generic system that maybe they're going to include in some games going forward to make them more approachable for casual gamers.
8483547	8483807	I don't know.
8484108	8485269	Have I heard this before?
8486370	8488091	I guess it's a neat idea.
8488652	8495098	We kind of gave the whole hint system crap for the Wii and stuff like that.
8496860	8499582	It was going to be the staple CC button.
8499702	8507407	It was so behind the scenes stuff, it really shouldn't have been even brought up.
8507427	8512750	In other words, people were reading way too much into the trademark and the patent documents.
8513291	8516873	But, to be fair, we've also only seen it implemented in one game.
8517413	8522496	We don't know what it's going to look like in the next Zelda game or some other games that Nintendo might have in the future, just saying.
8523017	8526299	But yeah, maybe a lot of us jumped the gun and that's what happens.
8529217	8535325	So, I don't know, do you think Xbox 360 is just like, hey, Nintendo's got a good idea, let's copy it, or do you think they're really going in a different direction with this?
8535385	8536887	I think they're just trying to kind of...
8537967	8543868	Take the same approach, not necessarily just because Nintendo did it, but maybe had the same ideas.
8544248	8550450	I mean, to be fair, Microsoft kind of does this sort of thing very well where somebody's got an idea, they sort of take it and make it better.
8551450	8554150	Also, they're trying to kind of broaden themselves out.
8554410	8557431	They kind of have the opposite problem as Nintendo.
8557451	8566073	Well, Nintendo, they're really trying to broaden the audience so much so that they don't really have any core games for the core gamer, I guess.
8566693	8566853	But
8597509	8599151	Alienware computers are coming now pre-loaded with Steam
8614625	8616246	Alienware is now actually bundling with their all-powerful systems.
8632833	8635934	These actually, I gotta admit, they're kind of cool looking, the whole black and red thing.
8635974	8639635	I mean, if you're gonna pay that much money for a system, it might as well look kind of awesome.
8640135	8645636	And so if you buy one of these all-powerful systems, they're actually shipping with Steam.
8646037	8647697	Steam comes on these systems.
8648817	8655319	Part of the reason why is because Portal is a free game that's included, which of course was a Valve game that they did release through Steam.
8655359	8658360	I actually bought, that was the very first game I ever bought through Steam was Portal.
8658780	8661442	So, no, second game because I bought AudioSurf too.
8661842	8665144	But regardless, Steam is now coming in bundled with these systems.
8665764	8669006	Which for these box systems is not really new news.
8669426	8679852	I know I talked about earlier, and it's funny kind of to bring this full circle because Jamie had a story earlier about Steamworks and I was saying like, aren't those like Google Toolbars and all that other crap that tries to install with the program kind of annoying?
8680132	8687897	But this, you sort of grow to expect that when you buy these computers in a box, they come preloaded with tons of crap.
8688157	8688857	Bloatware.
8689298	8690458	Yeah, it's... What do they call that?
8690618	8691239	Bloatware.
8691359	8692159	I've never heard of that.
8692239	8692779	Bloatware.
8693140	8694080	That's a good term for it.
8694740	8701424	But yeah, you know, the antivirus demo is installed and the trial of Microsoft Office is already on the computer.
8701524	8704466	So this honestly just seems like another logical step to me.
8704846	8708508	It is kind of a kick in the groin to the competitors like, you know, direct-to-drive and so forth.
8708588	8710809	But what are you going to do?
8711169	8711349	Yeah.
8711469	8713970	I guess you could say the Microsoft Office has its competitors too.
8714051	8716332	And, you know, they get to jump up on some of these...
8717778	8719218	and so forth.
8719278	8730241	Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangelongerator.com Salacious Pop says Alienware has a build your own shopping cart a la the Apple site where you can build a system for $7,000 without really trying.
8731141	8735723	Legend of Zaku says Skyid is hella cheaper to build your own PC than to buy from Alienware.
8736183	8737183	Can they be as pretty though?
8737203	8739043	Because I gotta say those systems are very nice looking.
8739063	8741304	You'd be surprised what you can find in cases nowadays.
8741784	8745185	Although I've got to say, the new computer we've got for the show is pretty sleek looking.
8745645	8746625	It's a nice looking little box.
8746685	8748145	And that wasn't even trying.
8748605	8753026	It doesn't light up pretty, but it looks nicer than the one I've got for myself.
8753186	8756227	Nowadays, it's almost hard to find a case that doesn't light up.
8757687	8761308	Seriously, my computer at the time, I think, cost me $1,700.
8761348	8761748	And I put in...
8765785	8766986	Thanks for watching!
8787881	8788261	I really don't.
8788361	8788721	I don't know.
8808511	8810111	I'm looking at some of the other comments here.
8810652	8814894	Actdeft says, the general consumer doesn't know how to build a computer and will go for something that's already built.
8815554	8816995	That's clearly where they're making their money.
8817615	8818896	Tigerclaw says, here's the thing.
8818956	8821837	What is more important, the way the case looks or the performance of the system?
8821917	8822597	I choose the latter.
8822978	8829901	And no, in all seriousness, and for myself and not playing devil's advocate here, obviously, you're not staring at the box the whole time.
8829921	8831222	You're staring at what's on the monitor.
8831682	8834783	The box is just for impressing people at LAN parties.
8835224	8835404	Yeah.
8836044	8836885	My computer lights up.
8837105	8838206	My power supply lights up.
8838266	8840789	Mine lights up like a bluish color, but it's nothing special.
8841209	8848236	My favorite, I think, computer that anyone ever built was one built into a tall tackle box.
8849017	8850579	No, a tall metal toolbox.
8851761	8861308	And I gotta say, maybe lesson learned here, I didn't build my own computer the last time I bought a computer because, you know, I'm not quite as talented as Loki or whatever.
8861348	8867612	And I thought maybe I was getting a really good deal because I bought my computer for, you know, a certain price that was kind of low to me.
8867652	8874096	But now I'm learning, should have got a better video card and, you know, some of these other things I should have considered better at the time.
8874156	8874837	But lesson learned.
8875578	8883604	One thing I would change if I were to go back and actually make my computer again is I would not buy another graphics card to run SLI.
8883624	8885346	Because I have two graphics cards in mine.
8885526	8893793	And they're both EVGA, GTS, 8800 graphics cards with half gig RAM in each one.
8894353	8898156	I mean, in the games that run SLI, it's awesome.
8898296	8902300	But most stuff out there does not support SLI.
8902400	8902660	So...
8906115	8910909	I did it for Crysis, but Crysis got boring really fast.
8911531	8911792	Bummer.
8912672	8916555	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line now.
8916575	8919556	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.
8919596	8923599	We're going to take your calls live here for a little bit, and then we'll start to wrap up the show.
8924019	8933745	Meanwhile, while we wait for the calls to come in, because there's a little bit of a delay from studio to encoding to the all-game server to you guys hearing it, let's see if there's any last-minute stories.
8934045	8938228	There's a rumor that there's going to be some exclusive characters for Sonic Sega Online.
8938508	8943932	Sonic and Sega All-Star Racing, including for the Xbox 360 that Banjo-Kazooie might be interesting.
8945233	8952119	And that's from some work-in-progress box shots that are appearing, I guess, on their UK site.
8952479	8953480	So that's kind of interesting.
8955882	8960045	Also, there's a fun little website I was looking at earlier that you can...
8961633	8981030	Create your own Zelda scenes with the Zelda 2 text generator And if you go check it out, it's at ZeldaPower.com And it's under their features The Adventures of Link text box toy You can make all sorts of weird scenes But you can't actually put them in the game, right?
8981331	8987036	No, it's just to make little webpages or stuff for forums and stuff like that So it's kind of neat
8989983	8992124	Great, more forum macros, just what we needed.
8994505	9002609	Also, there is a rumor that apparently you're going to be able to attend some of these gaming conferences through your Xbox 360.
9003409	9019137	One of the new things they're talking about is imagine an interactive online version of E3, BlizzCon, Gamescom, Comic-Con, and every other major video game convention were made available through Xbox Live.
9020413	9024095	So it's something that is being put out there.
9024135	9029679	I guess it's coming from some guy who works in the game industry, VG Market, I guess.
9030179	9035182	They have a, looks like it's another survey, a market research survey.
9036543	9038344	And we know about those market research surveys.
9038404	9041086	Sometimes they end up coming true.
9042517	9045119	There's a lot of comments there in chat about the SLI.
9045239	9047922	DangerSkew in our chat says, I agree with the SLI argument.
9047982	9054027	You should never build a computer with SLI from the beginning, only if you need more power later.
9055128	9057970	And TigerClaw says, you only need SLI if you have a huge-ass monitor.
9058010	9059872	It's meant to handle graphics to higher resolutions.
9060212	9063374	If you have a 19-inch widescreen monitor and only one NVIDIA card, you're good to go.
9063595	9066217	Again, those comments coming from chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
9066357	9067178	Is Skype all fucked up today?
9067198	9067939	Is that what's going on?
9082511	9084291	I had something awful linked to me, Rob.
9084472	9086912	Skype was acting weird earlier, but yeah, what's that?
9087212	9089352	A trailer for Nuking a Fighter's movie.
9090253	9091073	Like a real movie?
9091453	9093113	Yeah, and it has Ray Park in it.
9093333	9097314	And I watched some of it and I wanted to cry because I'm like, where's Kyo?
9098594	9100995	Is it an American movie or is it something that's been made overseas?
9101015	9101515	Yeah, it's American.
9101635	9101915	Really?
9101975	9103835	I didn't know they were making that.
9104236	9106336	You would have thought I would have heard about this sooner.
9106864	9108325	Why don't I send you the link?
9108845	9109165	Okay.
9109486	9111727	So we can play how awful it is on the air.
9111747	9112507	Hold on, we're getting a call.
9113968	9114869	Hi, you're on Orange Islands Radio.
9114889	9115229	Who's this?
9116530	9117230	It's Legend of Zaku.
9117410	9118311	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
9118331	9118971	What's on your mind, buddy?
9119932	9120492	Nothing much.
9120612	9125495	Just trying to get over this whole Thanksgiving ordeal.
9126155	9126496	I know.
9127456	9131899	It's a bummer we all have to go back to work tomorrow, but such is life.
9133206	9138893	Well, yeah, basically, I know we barely covered the DDR and Belmonte scene, but...
9139955	9144638	I figured you already know by now that DDRX2 has an arcade release.
9144819	9146880	Well, it's going to be released in Japan.
9147100	9148521	We'll mention it once in a while.
9148601	9154746	We don't mention every little story like we used to, but any of the big things will come up.
9154786	9164733	I know we mentioned the location test last week, and I did read something on the internet this week that somebody out there in Japan was bringing back reports of what was in the location test, which was a lot of...
9165313	9193520	your Beatmania 2DX style artists and a lot of the Konami House originals which I think is DDR's biggest problem right now in cracking the mainstream is that I realize people love their Konami originals I do too, there's a lot of talented artists it's never going to break into the mainstream unless they start Well, I mean, that all depends on what licenses they end up including in the final version but right now, apparently a lot of the community from the consensus I'm hearing right now is that they actually
9194811	9197273	I'm actually hearing good consensus from them.
9197413	9201116	I'm actually hearing a lot of good things in terms of the song selections.
9201876	9202957	But that's pretty much it.
9202977	9214446	They may be skeptical as to whether or not they can execute the same Japanese version to America, which we already know how much of a disaster DRX was.
9216553	9217013	Was it?
9217153	9220676	I didn't really, I have to admit, you know, I haven't been following DDRs closely.
9221257	9226961	Yeah, the fucked up pads and the countless number of, you know, fixes afterwards.
9227021	9232565	Even my pads, even my David Busters managed to get a DDRX CAD that couldn't even last a month.
9233205	9234606	It was not even playable.
9235747	9238289	The fact that there's, yeah, there's not that many machines around.
9238869	9242032	Yeah, and the fact that they killed off upgrade kits made it even worse.
9242832	9244894	So I pretty much consider that a failure.
9247608	9254915	The way I see it is that I use Supernova as a baseline because that manages to have good coverage all around.
9255455	9261381	Just about most of the places I can think of off the top of my head that had Supernova at one point.
9262021	9265725	But then when I try to do the same thing for DDRX, I can't.
9265885	9267707	I can only think of one place.
9268604	9272506	and another place that wasn't Coney Island that no longer has the machine.
9272666	9273126	But that's it.
9273827	9276408	Honestly, Zaku, I just want to play 4th Mix Plus.
9278229	9280610	I already had that chance.
9280830	9281710	I've already played that.
9282091	9282931	Let me see.
9283771	9286933	Last summer, back on 8 on the break, we basically...
9287879	9297005	Well, I mean, I've played it before, but I'm just saying, like, with all these fancy new mixes and all that stuff going on, I miss 4th Plus.
9297206	9298406	4th Plus was the bomb.
9298426	9300308	That was the best mix they ever did.
9300908	9303390	Apparently they're doing, they have, like,
9303951	9306874	They've been throwing fourth and fifth mix around pretty recently.
9306894	9311177	I don't know if they're still doing it now, but that's what they were doing a couple of months ago.
9330894	9331294	My bad.
9331314	9333035	5th Mix was pretty badass, too.
9333055	9334295	Where else can you play Moonlight Shadow?
9334355	9334915	I'll give you that.
9335415	9336235	5th Mix was awesome.
9337536	9337796	Alright.
9338356	9339216	Look, please.
9340416	9343717	Is there anything else on your mind this week besides just the DDRX2?
9344757	9350399	Basically, going on what you said about Alienware, you can build yourself a PC for less than $1,000.
9350579	9352699	A really good gaming rate for less than $1,000.
9353599	9355860	You just have to look hard and deep and you just gotta...
9356724	9359166	You gotta really consider what you prioritize.
9359206	9360687	Graphics, sound, or both.
9362909	9364070	I mean, that's pretty much it.
9364150	9368654	I mean, I've managed to get mine for $1,700 and change when I bought them, you know, when I built it.
9369555	9372237	But it still runs pretty good as of today.
9372357	9380004	I mean, obviously it can't do 60 frames of a crisis, but it can play stuff like Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 pretty well.
9381297	9385779	So it's just a matter of how much you're willing to spend on something like that.
9386260	9388621	I think that's important, too, is prioritizing.
9388661	9390202	What do you really want out of your machine?
9390482	9396185	Because if you buy a cheapo graphics card but buy a big monitor, it's not going to do a lot of good.
9396445	9398386	Right, you've got to get at least something.
9398947	9402248	At least GeForce 9 or better right now.
9403129	9406871	That should do you good for another year or two before you have to refresh it.
9409048	9413310	Alright, well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, see if anybody else is trying to call tonight.
9413510	9414411	But have a good one, okay, buddy?
9414991	9415251	Alright.
9415451	9415972	Alright, later, buddy.
9416812	9423215	Alright, 1877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9423295	9424036	Either way will do it.
9424896	9428538	We'll keep the phone lines open a little bit longer to see if anyone wants to get through.
9428558	9430479	I know some people told me earlier they wanted to call in.
9430499	9432400	I'm not sure if they're going to try to get through or what.
9432420	9433621	Do we have any other last-minute stories?
9433901	9434621	I sent you the link.
9434941	9435241	Oh, yes.
9435361	9435802	Oh, thank you.
9436602	9438384	I forgot about... Oh, and of course we're getting another call.
9438404	9439745	I'll bring up the link for after this though.
9440606	9441547	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9441567	9441887	Who's this?
9443649	9444550	Hey, this is X-Link.
9444850	9445450	Hi, X-Link.
9445470	9445971	How are you doing?
9446611	9447412	Hey, doing good.
9447672	9451076	I was playing a game recently that I'd like to talk a little bit about if it's okay with you.
9451276	9451676	Of course.
9451736	9452057	What's up?
9453024	9456905	I've been playing the full version, and the full version is not that much different than the demo.
9457045	9459286	Just you can level up your monsters a lot more.
9459366	9460587	And I've been playing just a little bit.
9460607	9463588	I haven't gone through the whole game exactly yet.
9464248	9465888	I've been playing during downtime for a while, so...
9480319	9480639	PC.
9480939	9481679	Okay.
9481699	9482120	What do you think?
9482140	9482800	What are your thoughts on it?
9483140	9483640	I like it.
9483840	9496944	I like because I'm a big Blitz, Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz fan and I think they're taking more after Bejeweled Blitz because the fact you have to rotate the pieces to make the lines to sum around.
9497545	9498265	I like it a lot more.
9499525	9503227	It's a lot more difficult than going, okay, well I'm going to take this and switch these two around.
9503287	9504247	It's not like two pieces.
9504267	9507488	You have to switch actually four around in a counterclockwise position.
9507779	9508480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9529025	9529926	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9548869	9574280	in gyromancer your twists do not have to cause three to line up you'll get higher scores and even penalized you know if it doesn't and higher scores if they do but I just had such a hard time kind of getting used to that idea I mean it didn't ruin the game for me I still think it's kind of interesting but I just think I'm going to suck at it because I always play Bejeweled Blitz because I want my epine to have me at the top of the leaderboard even though that never happens
9574835	9575315	Most definitely.
9575335	9585480	You get more points by doing that, but also at the same time though, if you do a move and you don't make three, it will cause the enemy's power to grow a little bit each time.
9585620	9594323	So you want to make those lines, you want to make the ones, because for each of your characters you get a certain color, so you want to make those lines with the color that you're...
9596664	9600906	Creature Represents, so that way you can use your powers and take more.
9601346	9602746	It's cool because it has a life.
9603947	9615931	It added more of a role-playing element to it with the hit points, so you do certain moves and it'll take away hit points away from the other enemy depending on how many was chained or what was happening.
9617291	9623393	It has a lot of the element to Puzzle Quest to it, but it's a lot of fun, though.
9623473	9624614	Puzzle Quest Puzzle Quest Puzzle Quest
9649651	9650092	I like it.
9650192	9659237	It has a lot of the puzzle quest type feel to it, but it's more storyline driven and a little more interaction that I would say than that.
9661311	9665294	But like I said before, for a puzzle game, $15, it was Pop Game and Square Enix.
9665314	9667236	You can't really go too wrong with it.
9667616	9667997	That's true.
9668057	9669678	It is a damn good price.
9670479	9685151	It's pretty cool how there's been all this puzzle game resurgence in the past couple of years, especially these very, very fleshed out type of puzzle games between what Q Entertainment has been giving us with Luminous and so forth, and now these RPG meets PopCap games.
9685411	9686292	It's pretty fascinating.
9686972	9689214	I just use it mostly, like I said before, as a time killer.
9689254	9698299	If I want something to fill in in 15 minutes, I usually just load it up and then play it, you know, play or maybe play like one level a day or something, so that way I don't get an overkill of it, so.
9698679	9700921	I'm surprised this game hasn't shown up on every platform.
9700961	9702942	I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it's on the iPhone.
9703382	9708105	Well, right now I know it's for the Xbox and PC, but I don't know if they're going to expand it over that.
9708145	9710887	I think they're trying to wait to see what happens first beforehand, so.
9711047	9711287	Right.
9711948	9712508	Very interesting.
9712548	9713969	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?
9715220	9717201	Night of the Old Republic 250
9737515	9745087	and they're just getting people to install Steam to get these hella good deals and maybe even, you know, kind of the idea behind the consoles they're taking a little bit of a loss
9746389	9750370	over these games, you know, especially a game like Knights of the Old Republic that hasn't really generated buzz.
9750510	9752230	Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't put it that way.
9752250	9753211	But, you know, it's years old.
9753311	9753931	It's years old.
9754391	9755671	Well, you have to think about it this way.
9755771	9766493	If someone was sitting around, like, say, for, like, example, even in the video store, a game was sitting around, they wasn't doing anything, and they're going, they put a price tag of $250 on there, and they know it's going to hit, then they, you know, at least they're making something out of nothing.
9766533	9768174	So, I mean, they're making money somehow.
9768234	9768574	True.
9769795	9770035	True.
9770055	9771176	So maybe it's a range of these companies.
9771216	9771496	I don't know.
9771856	9776898	I'm holding out hope that Torchlight is in tomorrow's deals because I really wanted to pick that up.
9776978	9779079	Yeah, well, you know, you get what you pay for.
9779139	9783241	Kind of like I kind of kicked myself in the ass for picking up F.A.W.
9783681	9787483	3 and then two months down the road they're like, oh, by the way, Game of Year Edition, same price.
9787523	9790044	And you get all the downloadable content to go with it.
9790625	9791145	Oh, bummer.
9791605	9799588	Well, I did pick up Civ 4 also from GoGamer when they're doing their Black Friday deals for $10, which was the complete edition.
9799628	9803650	So that was very nice compared to that of $5 from Best Buy.
9804090	9804370	All right.
9804791	9808412	Well, X-Link, we're going to let you go so we can try and get maybe one more call in.
9808432	9809433	But have a great night, okay?
9809673	9809873	Definitely.
9809893	9810073	Thank you.
9810093	9811574	And thanks for the review on Gyromancer.
9811814	9812054	Bye-bye.
9812094	9812314	Anytime.
9814075	9816837	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9816958	9820320	I did get that video brought up here that DarkSakura was talking about earlier.
9820380	9823543	Let me look at a little bit of a clip here.
9824704	9830168	It does look like an actual, like... I just never knew they were making a movie out of King of Fighters.
9830228	9831489	Or maybe... Is that mine?
9831509	9833391	Yeah, this definitely looks direct-to-video.
9841756	9842036	No.
9843298	9848983	Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, and Rick Park.
9852726	9853507	Okay, whatever.
9855689	9857911	It'll be fun for fan of martial arts movies and stuff, I'm sure.
9858091	9859112	Part of my soul cried.
9860513	9861714	Yeah, I don't know what else to say.
9861794	9862755	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9862775	9863135	Who's this?
9863976	9865037	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9865137	9866018	Hi, hey, what's up?
9866778	9867358	Not too much.
9867438	9876002	I'll make this brief because since you guys were talking about DDR and so forth, a funny little anecdote popped up at Anime USA that I have to share with you guys.
9876142	9877442	It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
9877723	9878063	Alright.
9879723	9886886	I'm not sure if you guys covered this about the whole... I think you guys did the whole Konami DDR tournament that they were having.
9887146	9888047	Yeah, I came up on the show.
9888087	9890848	People emailed us about it and we were kind of giving our spin on it.
9891408	9895750	Not enough notice on it, I think, for it to be taken as seriously as they wanted it to be.
9896868	9902549	Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, I believe there was also a cutoff point for the tournament.
9902569	9904510	You had to be under a certain age to compete.
9905070	9906850	Yes, I remember that.
9907190	9910371	So officially DDR has turned its back on me, yes.
9910731	9917013	Yeah, from what I understand, they're saying the cutoff date was like 31 or 32, which I call shenanigans on.
9917453	9921654	But one of the people I know in the DDR fandom community...
9923450	9931953	I believe it was DDR Darryl Bill, he told me how it was crazy that they were having this, and I ran into another friend of mine, Jim DaFly, at Anime USA.
9932533	9941037	He told me that the guy that was hosting the tournament, who more or less put the rules together, he himself had a heart attack.
9942497	9942777	What?
9943738	9944038	Yeah.
9944798	9949220	Wait, the guy who, wait, like a heart attack, like literally had a heart attack?
9949680	9949880	Yeah.
9951984	9953525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9972639	9974059	Caram is kind of fucked up, isn't it?
9974119	9975400	Well, yeah, hold on.
9975620	9982501	I would never, you know, even if it was, let's say it's just like the worst of the worst bottom of the barrel video game personality.
9982541	9986482	Like, for instance, this guy who's suing all the companies for these ludicrous reasons.
9986922	9988442	I would not wish a heart attack upon them.
9989122	9989482	I would wish.
9989502	9992423	Neither would I, but I just find this just odd.
9992483	9995123	It's like he's talking about you can't be over a certain age to compete.
9995163	9995783	This, this, and this.
9995883	9998024	And then, boom, he has a heart attack.
9998104	9998924	I'm like, what?
9999895	10001938	Well, you know, I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence.
10001958	10003600	You know, people get sick as they get older.
10003940	10006203	You have to be the stage to compete, because this is what?
10006543	10015635	How about you have to have a blood pressure under a certain, you know,
10017065	10041845	Well, I think it's sad, and I don't want to make jokes about it, you know, and I don't care if you all hate the fucking rules or whatever, but I just don't think we would ever want to wish that upon somebody, and I hope it gets better soon, but I think what I can speak to is the tournament itself, and, you know, the rules and the tournament itself seemed a little silly, and was hastily thrown together, and I think that's why it didn't get probably the type of coverage that hopefully Konami was going for.
10043484	10044105	but you know what?
10044405	10050130	I think I'm going to host my own national DDR tournament and you can be up to whatever age you want.
10050430	10055374	If you need to bring your walker, your wheelchair, your cane to compete, that's fine.
10055394	10056235	Just don't bar me.
10056275	10061579	Hold on though because then I'll bring a cane and use it to hit the arrows and so forth.
10061699	10062280	That would be cheating.
10062340	10065683	There was the guy though who played on crutches.
10065863	10066643	Freestyle's different.
10067965	10068745	And he mostly PA'd too.
10068765	10068925	Did he?
10068985	10069085	Yeah.
10073570	10076032	Is playing with crutches like holding the bar, though?
10076252	10077413	No, no, he had one leg.
10078073	10078593	Did he really?
10078854	10079034	Yeah.
10079214	10080695	There's a video up on YouTube.
10080815	10081936	We're not thinking of the same guy, then.
10085798	10087319	And if I might, I think he's actually from New York.
10089841	10090361	It's been a while.
10090401	10091082	Does Ranma know him?
10091852	10092212	I don't know.
10092252	10094032	Probably not no, but Zaku might.
10094192	10094493	All right.
10094873	10097673	Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go and, you know, be safe.
10098473	10099374	Us 30-year-olds.
10099794	10101434	I just have my Geritol shake.
10101514	10102714	I saved some for you.
10102814	10103054	Yeah.
10103334	10103694	Thank you.
10103794	10105055	I use Ensure, but thank you.
10105595	10105815	All right.
10105835	10106475	All right now.
10106715	10107355	Bye, Ranma.
10107375	10108095	All right.
10108215	10108555	Later.
10111376	10113136	Well, that, I mean, that's unfortunate.
10113256	10116437	Like, you know, I don't care what fucked up tournament he planned.
10116477	10117657	I mean, heart attacks suck.
10117677	10120618	You know, that's just, that's, that's, I hope he's okay, for God's sake.
10121318	10121518	Yeah.
10121538	10121618	Yeah.
10122082	10122683	Thank you for watching!
10136164	10137924	Anyhow, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10137944	10147906	If you guys didn't get through, please, you can always feel free to leave us a message at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or of course the Twitter and of course the Facebook and all those social networks we interact with.
10148006	10149567	We have eyes and ears everywhere.
10149887	10152487	But for now, it's about time to wrap up the show.
10152527	10155588	But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10156288	10157028	I'll start tonight.
10157208	10163230	My final thought is I need Advil or something that will make my back feel better because it sucks.
10164150	10165030	I have some.
10166118	10168620	I might take you up on that or just do it when I get home.
10168941	10170442	It's not like killing me.
10171263	10174285	Otherwise, I'd be going to a doctor tomorrow, but it's just annoying.
10174505	10175006	It's annoying.
10175927	10176927	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
10177228	10183233	Final thought is this Doom with Mega Man looks kind of interesting.
10183413	10183733	What?
10184394	10185675	It's a Doom mod.
10185695	10186356	Is it Mega Doom?
10186976	10187677	With Mega Man.
10187877	10190159	It's got all the 8-bit sprites and everything.
10190459	10192040	That is fantastic.
10192080	10192821	Kind of amazing, actually.
10192841	10193482	I'm so downloading that.
10194557	10195358	Is that out?
10195418	10196138	Released publicly?
10197219	10200260	It's a Deathmatch mod.
10200280	10201581	That's awesome.
10202022	10204123	I'm not sure if it's out yet to download.
10204783	10216610	The official website looks like cutstuff.net slash blog slash question mark P equals 1677.
10217011	10221753	I'll pull it up for you and you can check it out.
10221874	10221994	It's
10228648	10231329	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10232069	10232569	End of line.
10234470	10240272	And my final thought tonight would be... Oh no, I already said my final thought.
10240392	10241752	I was like, wait, I already said something.
10242652	10243513	I was last for a reason.
10243553	10244433	Clearly it's old age.
10244718	10258776	If you want the direct download, because that URL is kind of hard to find, it'd be cutstuff.net slash file slash megadmalpha.zip and that'll get you the zip file for that.
10258937	10260619	And for the record, I used to play Gatchaman Doom.
10262543	10264746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10276714	10283115	And I also need to say, as I do every week, thank you guys very much for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.
10283135	10284956	Without you guys, this would not be possible.
10285236	10290257	Remember, we don't have any fancy website, multi-million dollar magazine or game company backing us up.
10290317	10294437	It's just three of us do this because we love you and we love doing this broadcasting thing.
10294477	10296818	So all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.
10297058	10297958	And get us pizza.
10298498	10299478	And pizza would be nice too.
10299978	10301319	Order us pizza for next show.
10301719	10302239	So we'll see.
10302939	10304600	I like vegetarian, just letting you know.
10306101	10307041	We'll see if that happens.
10307081	10309162	Anyhow, we'll be here to do it all again next week.
10310323	10313444	In the meantime, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki.
10313805	10316506	We're out, but Jamie has to say...
10317605	10318085	End of line.
10347078	10347902	See you next week!
