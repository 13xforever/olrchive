0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco!
14000	16000	Tonight November 29th, 2009
16000	19000	Will Amber Alert type messages soon be displayed on your Xbox?
19000	22000	Familiar faces return for Super Street Fighter 4
22000	26000	Can we talk about the continued growth of LittleBigPlanet a whole year after its release?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
35000	41000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
41000	44000	My name is Rob Roberts with you here every week on All Games Radio
44000	50000	www.allgames.com where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
50000	52000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
52000	54000	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only
54000	56000	Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura
56000	57000	Rawr
57000	58000	How are you doing?
58000	59000	Rawr
59000	60000	I see you LJing
60000	62000	I am LJing, I was doing it well before the show
62000	65000	It's so nice to see that people actually still use LJ
65000	69000	I have a permanent account, damn well better use it
69000	71000	For the uninitiated LJ is short for LiveJournal
71000	73000	where we actually have an Orange Lounge community
73000	77000	but sadly it's been neglected just like LiveJournal has in general
77000	81000	thanks to Twitter and Facebook and I guess MySpace in a way
81000	83000	but do people actually use MySpace anymore?
83000	85000	I actually logged into MySpace the other day
85000	87000	and this is my exact thing I said aloud
87000	89000	What a crap!
89000	91000	Because MySpace is really ugly
91000	93000	I don't use MySpace anymore
93000	95000	If you're still on there, we have an account on there
95000	98000	I check maybe once a month and if you want to have this as a friend
98000	101000	you can join the many record labels and indie bands
101000	103000	who think we're like an actual radio station
103000	106000	like we want to play their rap music as part of our show
106000	108000	Maybe we should one night just to see what happens
108000	109000	Wouldn't that be fun?
109000	111000	Don't you think so Tech Master Loki?
111000	113000	Also joining us every week here on the program
113000	114000	No
114000	115000	No, it would not be fun?
115000	116000	No, it would not be fun
116000	118000	Hey, also our chat room is always here
118000	120000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com
120000	123000	if you'd like to join it and say hello to us
123000	125000	and of course we always like to interact with our chat room
125000	128000	who right now is razzing me for a technical difficulty
128000	130000	we had before tonight's show started
130000	133000	but those of you on the podcast, it'll all be fixed by the time you hear it
133000	135000	So yeah, if you want to hear all the good technical difficulties
135000	138000	not that we usually edit a lot of things
138000	140000	but most of this is very uncensored radio
140000	142000	we don't really filter anything out
142000	144000	but huge technical fuck-ups do get filtered out
144000	146000	so that's one thing you can look forward to
146000	149000	and our podcast feed is also available on iTunes
149000	151000	just check that out, searching for Orange Launch Radio
151000	154000	or more information on www.orangeloungeradio.com
154000	156000	for those of you that hate all things Apple
156000	158000	I know there are a few of you out there
158000	161000	you can check us out and several other podcast catchers
161000	163000	and Loki's raising his hand right there
163000	165000	So I'm sorry, should I call it a blogcast?
165000	168000	Isn't that what Major Nelson was calling it for the longest time?
168000	170000	because Microsoft doesn't want to use that word podcast
170000	172000	or a Zooncast or whatever
172000	174000	They tried, but podcast just stuck
174000	176000	Do you hate the word podcast, Loki?
176000	178000	No
178000	180000	Certainly one thing we don't hate here is video games
180000	182000	in fact we play a lot of them
182000	184000	and every week we like to tell you about what we've been playing
184000	186000	in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
186000	188000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
188000	190000	I've... whoa
190000	192000	I played World of Warcraft today
192000	194000	and Sims yesterday
194000	197000	and I downloaded another game
197000	199000	that I'm going to try out
199000	201000	that I've heard lots of good things about
201000	203000	and I have to pull it up on
203000	205000	actually I have to pull up iTunes so that I can find it
205000	207000	but it's a little shooting game
207000	209000	like a
209000	211000	like a Gradius type of shooter
211000	213000	and
213000	215000	I just downloaded it
215000	217000	I'll find it
217000	219000	Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?
219000	221000	I honestly didn't play a lot
221000	223000	which is sad
223000	225000	because we had four days off
225000	227000	no, I decided to go ahead
227000	229000	and I played a little bit
229000	231000	I brought out the Wii
231000	233000	when I went over to my sister's house
233000	235000	and we played a little bit of Excitebots
235000	237000	and
237000	239000	then also
239000	241000	of course more Grand Theft Auto this week
241000	243000	and
243000	245000	but mainly I've been busy
245000	247000	doing other things
247000	249000	and that would be for some reason
249000	251000	and I don't know why
251000	253000	during the day
253000	255000	on Tuesday this week
255000	257000	um
257000	259000	I just said, hey, you know what
259000	261000	I'm going to turn a PSP into a MAME cabinet
261000	263000	and so that's
263000	265000	what I've been doing
265000	267000	I've been taking a PSP
267000	269000	that I don't use anymore
269000	271000	You get the most random ass little like inspirations
271000	273000	like, my favorite will always be
273000	275000	when you walked in here
275000	277000	episode 300 last year
277000	279000	and you walked in here in your Sackboy costume
279000	281000	like, hey guys, I made a Sackboy costume
281000	283000	like, WHY?
283000	285000	It's funny
285000	287000	Well, it's just like
287000	289000	um, and it's weird
289000	291000	because I had specific requirements I wanted to do
291000	293000	it had to be everything
293000	295000	that I had in the house already
295000	297000	like just random crap
297000	299000	so it's basically, you know, it's going to be
299000	301000	small, like a bar top
301000	303000	but it'll be out of spare parts
303000	305000	I had and cardboard boxes
305000	307000	and that's what I've done
307000	309000	I've started it, I've been soldering
309000	311000	all year
311000	313000	Are we actually going to make a cabinet out of cardboard boxes?
313000	315000	Yes! I'm serious
315000	317000	No, small
317000	319000	like something I've seen on a counter top
319000	321000	but no, seriously, it's actually really cool
321000	323000	the problem is though, it's really hard to solder
323000	325000	to a PSP board
325000	327000	because I had to use magnet wire
327000	329000	because it's so thin
329000	331000	I actually burned my finger on the soldering iron
331000	333000	which kind of sucks
333000	335000	but um, yeah
335000	337000	I mean, assuming that my soldering
337000	339000	is an absolute crap, which it is
339000	341000	but, you know, it looked
341000	343000	pretty good
343000	345000	then it will actually be done soon
345000	347000	because I actually finished soldering today
347000	349000	and um
349000	351000	what I'm actually going to be running on it
351000	353000	is not MAME because they do have
353000	355000	MAME for it
355000	357000	but the way I soldered
357000	359000	everything, I can't really solder
359000	361000	the directional buttons because
361000	363000	it's really hard to do that
363000	365000	so I instead soldered the
365000	367000	analog because it's really easy
367000	369000	and you can actually use the analog stick
369000	371000	in some of the games, so I can't select
371000	373000	between which emulator I run
373000	375000	I just have to have it auto-boot into that emulator
375000	377000	so the one I found that runs pretty well
377000	379000	is actually the CPS2 emulator
379000	381000	so I can play some Puzzle Fighter on there
381000	383000	and Street Fighter and stuff like that
383000	385000	but um, yeah, it's
385000	387000	coming along, and um
387000	389000	hopefully it'll be done this week
389000	391000	Now there's some haters in our chat room
391000	393000	at chat.orangelandradiot.com
393000	395000	PSP MAME sucks, sorry
395000	397000	Yes, PSP MAME does kinda suck
397000	399000	PSP CPS2
399000	401000	not that bad, actually, it runs pretty well
401000	403000	and um
403000	405000	it's just
405000	407000	you know, this PSP, I haven't used it in like
407000	409000	years, okay
409000	411000	Amae Satsuma in our chat room, chat.orangelandradiot.com
411000	413000	says, Loki's real name isn't Matt, it's Richard Dean Anderson
413000	415000	making a MacGyver reference there
415000	417000	which is somewhat true
417000	419000	and which Act F says, LokiGyver
419000	421000	I don't know if that has the same ring to it
421000	423000	but Chris Hanogram asks a question though
423000	425000	what version of the PSP is it?
425000	427000	Is it a 1000, 2000, 3000?
427000	429000	It's my old 1000 because I bought a 2000
429000	431000	I thought about breaking the 2000 because
431000	433000	the emulators run better on there, but
433000	435000	I can't do that
435000	437000	You know when you talk about like a cute little tabletop
437000	439000	thing made out of a PSP
439000	441000	device, I think back to
441000	443000	and I don't know if you guys remember this growing up
443000	445000	but they used to have tiny, tiny
445000	447000	little tabletop games, and they would be
447000	449000	versions of like Ms. Pac-Man
449000	451000	or Donkey Kong
451000	453000	and these old school 80's games
453000	455000	they weren't the actual game
455000	457000	but they were kind of like a step above
457000	459000	Game and Watch, where the lights would actually
459000	461000	be in color, but they actually put them in
461000	463000	a cabinet looking thing, and I think
463000	465000	these things were pretty expensive
465000	467000	they were probably
467000	469000	50, 60 dollars, which back in 1980
469000	471000	was a lot of money
471000	473000	Yeah, they were like 30 bucks now
473000	475000	I have pictures
475000	477000	Oh, you have pictures
477000	479000	You should upload some of these to our picture feed
479000	481000	It doesn't really show much of anything
481000	483000	I mean, right now other than there's a spider of wires
483000	485000	but here's what I finished before I left
485000	487000	real quick, you can see
487000	489000	I know, I know, but you can see where
489000	491000	it's going to be the actual
491000	493000	control panel
493000	495000	I'm looking at a picture of Loki's
495000	497000	cable modem, of which
497000	499000	it almost looks like the wired
499000	501000	six buttons into the cable modem
501000	503000	The cable modem box
503000	505000	It's just the box
505000	507000	Okay, are you going to paint over the box
507000	509000	No, it's going to be a box
509000	511000	It's going to be the most ghetto looking thing in the world
511000	513000	Exactly, that's the point
513000	515000	And you know what?
515000	517000	You need to send this to our picture blog
517000	519000	And you know what? Because I didn't
519000	521000	I told you, it's everything I had in the house
521000	523000	I don't have packaging tape to put this together
523000	525000	So I'm using duct tape
525000	527000	There's going to be duct tape all over
527000	529000	You need to use chicken wire too
529000	531000	I don't have any chicken wire, so it's just
531000	533000	You are making a PSP
533000	535000	MAME cabinet out of a PSP
535000	537000	Cardboard boxes and duct tape
537000	539000	And arcade spare parts
539000	541000	I have laying in my house
541000	543000	Wow, amazing
543000	545000	Hitstun's come around a little bit and says
545000	547000	this might be cool
547000	549000	See, now when you finish it
549000	551000	It's mini, you're going to have to bring it in here
551000	553000	Oh yeah, it's going to have a handle on it
553000	555000	This is assuming
555000	557000	that this all works after it's done
557000	559000	Like I said
559000	561000	I don't trust my soldering
561000	563000	This saved my life
563000	565000	I don't know how I managed to solder that mod chip
565000	567000	into my Wii
567000	569000	That was just some miracle that I worked there
569000	571000	And this is kind of the same type of thing
571000	573000	Those magnet wires are
573000	575000	really fragile and they'll break
575000	577000	out of there pretty quick
577000	579000	So hopefully I didn't cross anything
579000	581000	or bridge anything
581000	583000	Hopefully it works once I power it back up again
583000	585000	But if it does, then it should be good to go
585000	587000	Bochikawa in our chatroom says
587000	589000	Hey, guess what I got Loki for Christmas?
589000	591000	A box!
591000	593000	Well, at least it wasn't your you-know-what-in-a-box
593000	595000	like Justin Timberlake
595000	597000	Let's see, Pywish, big fan of duct tape
597000	599000	as a lot of our chatrooms are
599000	601000	duct tape fixes everything
601000	603000	I can't wait to see
603000	605000	It's like the force
605000	607000	It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together
607000	609000	This thing is going to be awesomely bad
609000	611000	I can't wait to see it
611000	613000	Please, please post that picture to our picture blog
613000	615000	For your Twitter at least
615000	617000	Do you know how to log into the ULR Twitter?
617000	619000	I'll give you that info off here
619000	621000	Because obviously I'm not going to give you the password on here
621000	623000	It's...
623000	625000	Fire
625000	627000	Alright
627000	629000	DarkSakura, did you find that Gradius game
629000	631000	type game you were talking about earlier?
631000	633000	I did, it's called AX Raven Elite
633000	635000	And I'm going to post a link to it in the chatroom
635000	637000	You can go to rocketeergames.com
637000	639000	and give it a try
639000	641000	It's actually made by a local
641000	643000	Oh wow, very cool
643000	645000	Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says
645000	647000	Step one
647000	649000	Put the PSP in a box
649000	651000	You should
651000	653000	Do like a parody video
653000	655000	Building your PSP MAME cabinet
655000	657000	Like called PSP in a box or something
657000	659000	There's something here
659000	661000	I originally, like when I originally was going to do
661000	663000	actually running MAME on there
663000	665000	I actually made a skin for the background
665000	667000	that looked like MAME but built out of cardboard
667000	669000	So that was kind of funny
669000	671000	But now this CPS2 emulator
671000	673000	doesn't really have that
673000	675000	Nobody else would do a Neo Geo emulator
675000	677000	Haven't decided yet
677000	679000	It really depends on which buttons that I've wired
679000	681000	work and which don't
681000	683000	Because that's really what it's going to come down to
683000	685000	Because if I'm missing any of the buttons
685000	687000	that I needed to work, it's just
687000	689000	trash
689000	691000	The whole thing is ruined
691000	693000	In which case, I do believe you should just set fire to it
693000	695000	Live on air
695000	697000	Alright, we'll make a little bonfire somewhere
697000	699000	I'll make it work
699000	701000	Maybe in DarkSakura's backyard, we'll move all the equipment
701000	703000	and burn the cabinet live on air
703000	705000	Doesn't that sound like fun?
705000	707000	I would rather take a crowbar to it like an office space
707000	709000	with some loud gangster rap
709000	711000	Maybe if it was a PSP Go inside
711000	713000	but PSP 1000 is still kind of valuable
713000	715000	Well I guess you bricked it
715000	717000	Not really, no it's not bricked
717000	719000	I mean it's just
719000	721000	Well
721000	723000	It could be fixed
723000	725000	I just don't care because I have another
725000	727000	PSP already and I wasn't using this
727000	729000	I mean the battery was dead
729000	731000	So yes to fire?
731000	733000	I'm not going to burn it
733000	735000	Yes to crowbar?
735000	737000	No
737000	739000	It'll work
739000	741000	Moving on so we can get to gaming news before midnight
741000	743000	Moving on to my gaming week
743000	745000	Not a whole lot of new stuff
745000	747000	but I will say that
747000	749000	I've been very enticed by Steam's
749000	751000	various deals that they've had this week
751000	753000	You might have seen it, I know Dekeman's been posting them
753000	755000	to our Twitter everyday
755000	757000	The Steam deals, and they're all over the game blogs
757000	759000	There's some really cool deals there on Steam
759000	761000	And one of them that I jumped on was Dragon Age Origins
761000	763000	was on sale for 25% off
763000	765000	So I think I paid like $37 for it
765000	767000	Considering it's like $59.99
767000	769000	on $360 or whatever
769000	771000	Getting that price on the PC wasn't that bad
771000	773000	So I kind of got into the game
773000	775000	and started playing it
775000	777000	But I couldn't really get
777000	779000	very far into it before I got highly
779000	781000	irritated because
781000	783000	my video card apparently
783000	785000	kind of sucks and is behind the time
785000	787000	and cannot run the game very well
787000	789000	even on it's lowest settings
789000	791000	Things I should have thought about before I plopped the money down for the game
791000	793000	Although maybe it's just a sign I need a new video card
793000	795000	I thought since I just bought my
795000	797000	computer new last year
797000	799000	that my video card would not suck that bad
799000	801000	but it was one of those, you know
801000	803000	gateway, everything's there
803000	805000	Gateway, yeah
805000	807000	But I thought when I bought it
807000	809000	there was something about the video card, it was supposed to be better than normal
809000	811000	but whatever
811000	813000	So sadly I can't give you a fair review
813000	815000	of Mage Origins just yet
815000	817000	That wouldn't be a very fair thing of me to review it
817000	819000	I will say this though
819000	821000	I was quickly immersed into the game
821000	823000	I did think they did a very good job
823000	825000	Bioware is kind of well known for this
825000	827000	Very good job of story telling
827000	829000	You know, the cut scenes that I did see
829000	831000	and the part of the game that I did play through
831000	833000	For anybody who's played the game
833000	835000	I rolled a mage
835000	837000	and I played through the first little test
837000	839000	that you have to do with the demon in the very beginning
839000	841000	You know, which obviously wasn't very long at all
841000	843000	which is why I don't want to give you a review
843000	845000	But I did feel very immersed in the game
845000	847000	and I thought the storytelling was done very well
847000	849000	And I did like the fact
849000	851000	you know, just like in Mass Effect
851000	853000	that you can kind of direct the conversations and so forth
853000	855000	Again, something that Bioware has done
855000	857000	very well for
857000	859000	They do very well
859000	861000	I was immersed in it
861000	863000	But I'll give you a longer review after I get a better video card
863000	865000	which is probably going to happen in the future
865000	867000	And the folks in chat
867000	869000	Tiger Claw say
869000	871000	Well, we know what to get Skye for Christmas
871000	873000	A brand new graphics card
873000	875000	I might just go buy that myself
875000	877000	You know, one thing about
877000	879000	I realize everybody's shopping, shopping, shopping
879000	881000	You gotta get all your shopping done before Christmas
881000	883000	But I noticed that all the sales I have gone
883000	885000	and spent money on have been on me
885000	887000	And it's all been clothes
887000	889000	I went to Macy's yesterday
889000	891000	And I bought
891000	893000	something that was half off
893000	895000	And I went to the outlets today and I bought clothes
895000	897000	because they were all cheap
897000	899000	Go to Old Navy
899000	901000	for their whole 3 AM rock band thing
901000	903000	Did you do any Black Friday at all, Loki?
903000	905000	I went to Radio Shack
905000	907000	That's because I couldn't find a screwdriver
907000	909000	So I went and bought another screwdriver
909000	911000	Well, I wouldn't think Radio Shack
911000	913000	was doing a huge Black Friday discount
913000	915000	No, there was no one in there
915000	917000	I had a feeling
917000	919000	Anyhow, so I went out
919000	921000	and bought a bunch of clothes
921000	923000	But I noticed with all these deals
923000	925000	I keep thinking maybe it's just selfish or whatever
925000	927000	But I'm also the type of person
927000	929000	I always do my Christmas shopping like on Christmas Eve
929000	931000	I'm just a huge procrastinator like that
931000	933000	And I never know what to buy, like tons of people
933000	935000	Let's see
935000	937000	Looking in the chat room
937000	939000	and seeing the comments there
939000	941000	RickyGoMac says, Get a Mac, Rob!
941000	943000	Gee, wonder why he might be suggesting a Mac
943000	945000	RickyGoMac
945000	947000	I don't know
947000	949000	I would love to get a Mac, but they're a little pricey
949000	951000	They're kind of the Mercedes Benz
951000	953000	of computers, you know what I mean?
953000	955000	I don't hate on Macs
955000	957000	I have an iPhone, that's great for Apple
957000	959000	But my one Mac laptop I did have
959000	961000	Unfortunately, it didn't last
961000	963000	And I was a little bit disappointed in that
963000	965000	So I don't know how I feel about the desktop
965000	967000	Tigerclaw says, Also, be sure your graphics card is an NVIDIA card
967000	969000	Oops
969000	971000	My one I have right now is an ATI Radeon
971000	973000	It doesn't matter
973000	975000	It doesn't matter at all
975000	977000	And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this incorrectly
977000	979000	Vanislucks in chat says,
979000	981000	Screw Macy's, they made my children cry
981000	983000	See, now I kind of want to know that story
983000	985000	I know that might be traumatic, but I kind of want to know
985000	987000	Was it Santa Claus that made your children cry?
987000	989000	Or did they not want to take something back?
989000	991000	I gotta
991000	993000	say my curiosity is piqued by that statement there
993000	995000	Alright, anyhow
995000	997000	We are going to move on and get into the show tonight
997000	999000	Joining us tonight in about
999000	1001000	20 minutes or so
1001000	1003000	We're going to be speaking to an individual whose name is Brian Moreno
1003000	1005000	And you might not know him by name, but you might know
1005000	1007000	a video that he did that's on YouTube
1007000	1009000	this week
1009000	1011000	A LittleBigPlanet version
1011000	1013000	of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance
1013000	1015000	video, which you know, Lady Gaga
1015000	1017000	she's kind of started
1017000	1019000	a lot of controversy with some of her videos
1019000	1021000	and so forth, but obviously
1021000	1023000	that's what artists do, they make controversy
1023000	1025000	But we don't want to talk to him
1025000	1027000	so much about that end of it, but just
1027000	1029000	the fact that he put all this time
1029000	1031000	in LittleBigPlanet into this creation
1031000	1033000	and with LittleBigPlanet
1033000	1035000	and the community still being really huge
1035000	1037000	a year after the game was released
1037000	1039000	we thought tonight would be a good time to talk about that
1039000	1041000	So he'll be joining us a little later on
1041000	1043000	For now though, we're going to get into some gaming news
1043000	1045000	I did want to just give a quick plug
1045000	1047000	to our brand new Facebook, we just launched it
1047000	1049000	like a week and a half ago
1049000	1051000	www.facebook.com
1051000	1053000	slash orange lounge radio, all one word
1053000	1055000	Thank you guys so much for helping us get the 100 fans
1055000	1057000	we needed to get the short URL within a week
1057000	1059000	It's only been a week and we have like 160 fans
1059000	1061000	So thank you guys very much
1061000	1063000	That's very humbling and very cool
1063000	1065000	I don't know if there's really anything after 100
1065000	1067000	I think maybe if you get to a thousand
1067000	1069000	you get more statistics stuff
1069000	1071000	You don't get to evolve anymore?
1071000	1073000	I don't know, I don't know if there's any more evolving
1073000	1075000	I haven't really looked into it
1075000	1077000	I'll have to ask Seg, my buddy Seg that was on the show a couple weeks ago
1077000	1079000	promoting UmLoud, which is coming up by the way
1079000	1081000	He knows more about that stuff than I do
1081000	1083000	I wouldn't have even known about the short URL
1083000	1085000	if I didn't see him talk about it earlier
1085000	1087000	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight
1087000	1089000	Loki, why don't you start us off
1089000	1091000	Well, Datel is kind of pissed
1091000	1093000	because you may remember
1093000	1095000	Microsoft blocked their
1095000	1097000	memory cards, their max memory
1097000	1099000	from working
1099000	1101000	with the last dashboard update
1101000	1103000	and of course
1103000	1105000	dashboard update came
1105000	1107000	and the max memory cards went
1107000	1109000	and unfortunately
1109000	1111000	they had a workaround
1111000	1113000	they said at one time, but
1113000	1115000	I don't think that
1115000	1117000	ended up working
1117000	1119000	Microsoft has taken steps to render
1119000	1121000	inoperable the
1121000	1123000	competing Datel memory card
1123000	1125000	for no visible purpose
1125000	1127000	other than to have the market
1127000	1129000	entirely to themselves
1129000	1131000	and this is the Datel
1131000	1133000	attorney Marty Glick
1133000	1135000	no relation to
1135000	1137000	the other Glick
1137000	1139000	lol
1139000	1141000	They've accomplished
1141000	1143000	their recent update by making
1143000	1145000	a system change that will not recognize
1145000	1147000	or allow the operation of a memory card
1147000	1149000	with greater capacity than their own
1149000	1151000	we believe that with the power
1151000	1153000	Microsoft enjoys in the market
1153000	1155000	for Xbox accessories
1155000	1157000	this conduct is unlawful
1157000	1159000	so they're kind of going with the whole monopoly thing
1159000	1161000	I don't really know
1161000	1163000	if they have grounds to stand there
1163000	1165000	since it is Microsoft's
1165000	1167000	hardware and I think that they
1167000	1169000	pretty much can say
1169000	1171000	who can make what for it
1171000	1173000	although I do agree I wish they did
1173000	1175000	have some other memory card options
1175000	1177000	because the Microsoft memory cards
1177000	1179000	and Microsoft hard drives
1179000	1181000	are way too fucking overpriced
1181000	1183000	we're talking like 120 gigabyte
1183000	1185000	hard drive for
1185000	1187000	$200 or $150
1187000	1189000	I mean shit you can get way bigger
1189000	1191000	drives for a lot cheaper
1191000	1193000	I got to admit this is tricky for me
1193000	1195000	and chat I'm really curious what you guys think about
1195000	1197000	this one because I'm really on the fence with this
1197000	1199000	because I understand
1199000	1201000	the whole Microsoft is
1201000	1203000	evil and they always have monopolies on
1203000	1205000	everything and they violated antitrust
1205000	1207000	before and all of this
1207000	1209000	I totally understand that side of the argument
1209000	1211000	and yeah they do charge way too much
1211000	1213000	considering that 120 gig hard drive
1213000	1215000	is dirt cheap
1215000	1217000	or even like a 512 megabyte
1217000	1219000	memory unit
1219000	1221000	for 50 bucks I mean when you can buy
1221000	1223000	4 gig thumb drives
1223000	1225000	for like $10
1225000	1227000	here's the part of it though
1227000	1229000	where I'm kind of with Microsoft
1229000	1231000	and that is that these
1231000	1233000	companies take huge losses
1233000	1235000	when they put out these consoles
1235000	1237000	when you buy a console from
1237000	1239000	Microsoft Sony
1239000	1241000	not Nintendo this time because
1241000	1243000	we know the Wii was not quite
1243000	1245000	the same technological level but in the past
1245000	1247000	they've taken a loss on their systems too
1247000	1249000	maybe it was a small loss this time I don't have the data
1249000	1251000	on that I don't think it was though
1251000	1253000	but you know Microsoft and Sony take a loss
1253000	1255000	on every console that they sell to you
1255000	1257000	they've got to make that money back other places
1257000	1259000	and that is usually through software
1259000	1261000	through licensed
1261000	1263000	products through the licenses and so forth
1263000	1265000	that's how they make their money back
1265000	1267000	so I can
1267000	1269000	sort of see where they have the right
1269000	1271000	to lock out the unauthorized products because
1271000	1273000	my fear is
1273000	1275000	let's say Datel wins this suit
1275000	1277000	and it
1277000	1279000	just opens the floodgates to all these unauthorized
1279000	1281000	devices that are going to be out there
1281000	1283000	the next round of consoles are going to cost through the roof
1283000	1285000	because companies are not going to want to take a loss on it
1285000	1287000	No I don't think that's going to happen
1287000	1289000	I mean they had a ton of unlicensed
1289000	1291000	products for the Playstation 2 and the Playstation 1
1291000	1293000	and you know how older
1293000	1295000	consoles and stuff
1295000	1297000	never really affected their system
1297000	1299000	and Sony also tried to charge out the ass for the PS3 when it first came out
1299000	1301000	and they were still claiming a loss
1301000	1303000	but we all lapped them off because we said
1303000	1305000	too damn much money yeah right
1305000	1307000	yeah but that's for other reasons entirely
1307000	1309000	except the hardcore fans of course
1309000	1311000	that's because hey let's throw in this really awesome
1311000	1313000	cutting edge cell processor hey let's throw in some blu-ray
1313000	1315000	technology hey let's throw in some other
1315000	1317000	crap that's why it's so expensive
1317000	1319000	and you know to their benefit
1319000	1321000	they also have allowed you know
1321000	1323000	their end user to upgrade the hard drive
1323000	1325000	because it's just a
1325000	1327000	normal hard drive but Microsoft
1327000	1329000	says fuck you guys we're just going to
1329000	1331000	put that normal hard drive inside of a case and then
1331000	1333000	charge you twice as much for it
1333000	1335000	that's all it really is it's just a fancy
1335000	1337000	little case storing a normal hard drive
1337000	1339000	so it's not like
1339000	1341000	it's a special technology
1341000	1343000	although it is encoded slightly different but
1343000	1345000	you know hell you can make your own hard drives
1345000	1347000	for the Xbox 360 I mean
1347000	1349000	there are programs out there to do that
1349000	1351000	if you really wanted to make your own
1351000	1353000	250 gigabyte hard drive you can do
1353000	1355000	that what about the fact though that a lot
1355000	1357000	of people well I shouldn't say a lot but there was
1357000	1359000	certainly a significant amount of people that were using these devices
1359000	1361000	for the cheat functionalities that you know
1361000	1363000	the SD cards importing the saves
1363000	1365000	inflating gamer scores cheating
1365000	1367000	and you know Microsoft is trying to protect
1367000	1369000	Xbox Live because you know they market it
1369000	1371000	as hey you're paying $50 a year
1371000	1373000	because we lock out this kind of
1373000	1375000	shit well you
1375000	1377000	can't really lock it out
1377000	1379000	permanently I mean they have all
1379000	1381000	those game saves and everything are now
1381000	1383000	I mean because originally they weren't
1383000	1385000	all signed to the profile so
1385000	1387000	yeah you could download game saves and
1387000	1389000	you know throw them onto your console and kind of
1389000	1391000	you know save it at a point right before an
1391000	1393000	achievement or something like that and boost your
1393000	1395000	achievement scores but now everything's signed
1395000	1397000	to your user
1397000	1399000	ID so unless you're
1399000	1401000	the actual user that made that save
1401000	1403000	you can't really use that save unless
1403000	1405000	you re-sign it on your computer
1405000	1407000	which you can do that and you don't really
1407000	1409000	need this memory card to do that so
1409000	1411000	it's really not an excuse it's just them
1411000	1413000	being dicks let me ask this follow up
1413000	1415000	question very plainly because Salacious Pop
1415000	1417000	asks this in chat and I kind of
1417000	1419000	want to know this too because
1419000	1421000	I kind of agree with his thought here he says
1421000	1423000	can't you put save games on like a thumb drive
1423000	1425000	it reads USB fine I
1425000	1427000	think I'm missing something no you can't
1427000	1429000	oh really I always assumed
1429000	1431000	you could because you can do like mp3s and
1431000	1433000	videos and all that if you can put it on a thumb drive
1433000	1435000	then it wouldn't fucking matter that they have their stupid little
1435000	1437000	memory cards but you can't because
1437000	1439000	you know obviously that'd be the easiest
1439000	1441000	route you wouldn't even buy this yeah yeah I guess
1441000	1443000	so I mean it makes sense now that you're saying it but
1443000	1445000	I just kind of always thought but then again
1445000	1447000	I've never tried to use it you know I'm not the type that
1447000	1449000	wants to cheat in games and all this and
1449000	1451000	and so forth you know
1451000	1453000	I never really thought to use this
1453000	1455000	yeah I never even owned a game genie
1455000	1457000	back in the day although I thought they were interesting
1457000	1459000	they were awesome yeah it's too bad we don't have
1459000	1461000	anything like that anymore you know what I mean everything got
1461000	1463000	too not anymore I mean it's all game
1463000	1465000	saves now remember
1465000	1467000	I always wondered how they found those
1467000	1469000	codes for game genie like did somebody
1469000	1471000	have to sit there and actually go
1471000	1473000	0 0 0 0 1 or
1473000	1475000	was it because of the fact it was hex decimal base
1475000	1477000	they could go into the programming and figure
1477000	1479000	it out did you ever like use they had cheat
1479000	1481000	programs similar to that on the PC
1481000	1483000	for cheating and stuff and basically it's
1483000	1485000	memory searches you okay
1485000	1487000	I have five
1487000	1489000	lives right now do a memory search for five
1489000	1491000	okay I die once do a memory search for
1491000	1493000	four I die again do a memory
1493000	1495000	search for three and what it does is it narrows
1495000	1497000	down those memory addresses until you get
1497000	1499000	the one that actually controls
1499000	1501000	you know the extra lives and boom there you go
1501000	1503000	and now you can change that value you freeze
1503000	1505000	the memory to 99 you have
1505000	1507000	infinite lives now and it's basically
1507000	1509000	that interesting okay that
1509000	1511000	makes sense uh salaciouspop follows up with
1511000	1513000	in chat okay I've run avi's off of thunder
1513000	1515000	drive before but never bothered with saves
1515000	1517000	I figured it was universal yeah I mean I
1517000	1519000	thought the same thing honestly I've just never thought
1519000	1521000	to try I just always assumed it would work yep
1521000	1523000	curiosity I don't even know if you know this
1523000	1525000	would a ps3 let you do it ps3
1525000	1527000	yes will let you put game saves on
1527000	1529000	a thumb drive interesting because they don't
1529000	1531000	sell memory cards it's it's all
1531000	1533000	open oh that's right it's all
1533000	1535000	you know thumb drives you know you can use whatever
1535000	1537000	you want but Sony fanboys if you haven't
1537000	1539000	thought to add that to your arsenal of
1539000	1541000	web forum
1541000	1543000	harassing there's something for you
1543000	1545000	their memory cards are just USB
1545000	1547000	drives basically I mean it's
1547000	1549000	just sign different and
1549000	1551000	they're shaped different they've got you know
1551000	1553000	but it's basically a UMD drive
1553000	1555000	or not UMD uh USB drive
1555000	1557000	uh sj100 matt in chat
1557000	1559000	asks uh or says basically I was really
1559000	1561000	hoping they were gonna drop the price of the HD's
1561000	1563000	this holiday season yeah kind of surprising they
1563000	1565000	didn't they're doing weird stuff
1565000	1567000	I don't know because they're now
1567000	1569000	trying to clear out those 20 gig hard drives that
1569000	1571000	they have a backlog of too so you're gonna see
1571000	1573000	remember how they have like the 60
1573000	1575000	gigabyte starter pack where it's like a three month
1575000	1577000	card and
1577000	1579000	you know some miscellaneous crap in there and then
1579000	1581000	the hard drive they're gonna be doing
1581000	1583000	the same thing with the 20 gig hard drive now too
1583000	1585000	so uh tiger klon chat
1585000	1587000	says uh do you mean a trainer
1587000	1589000	when you were talking about that memory scan
1589000	1591000	software for pc games you used a program
1591000	1593000	called a trainer you load the pc game first
1593000	1595000	then load the trainer program and it will
1595000	1597000	modify what's in the memory so you can run some cheats
1597000	1599000	from tiger klon uh no not trainer
1599000	1601000	but this is like predating all the trainers
1601000	1603000	and stuff this is you know because the trainer
1603000	1605000	usually is all it's all the hard works
1605000	1607000	done for you it's basically okay
1607000	1609000	hit button one to have
1609000	1611000	infinite ammo or something like that and those are nice
1611000	1613000	but I'm talking about something it was
1613000	1615000	actually just a program I mean this is back
1615000	1617000	you know floppies and shareware
1617000	1619000	days you know um
1619000	1621000	it was just a program that you'd run that basically
1621000	1623000	would work with any um
1623000	1625000	pc titles because it's just a memory search
1625000	1627000	function and uh
1627000	1629000	you can you know
1629000	1631000	do searches and stuff
1631000	1633000	on different values and I think like
1633000	1635000	the registered version of it or whatever had
1635000	1637000	ability to figure something
1637000	1639000	out with like life bars because life bars
1639000	1641000	are hard to determine since you don't know what
1641000	1643000	the actual number is it's just like kind of a percentage
1643000	1645000	so um
1645000	1647000	I don't know I mean this was like years ago
1647000	1649000	but yeah obviously now they have
1649000	1651000	trainers for everything
1651000	1653000	that come out so very interesting
1653000	1655000	quickly to kind of wrap this up and move on with
1655000	1657000	the show and Jaime, I don't know if you have a thought on
1657000	1659000	this either
1659000	1661000	how do you think this lawsuit is going to go?
1661000	1663000	do you think Deigon frame of view is going to be shit of luck
1663000	1665000	or do you think maybe they have something
1665000	1667000	with this whole monopoly
1667000	1669000	thing... No they are going to be shit of luck
1669000	1671000	they're going to be like
1671000	1673000	it's going to be well
1673000	1675000	you can make you know peripherals for us
1675000	1677000	but you just have to pay a licensing fee and we have to
1677000	1679000	approve it I don't know I don't think they're
1679000	1681000	going to win. Jaime agree
1681000	1690120	agree? I think it could go either way. To be honest, it's not like we haven't had other
1690120	1695720	peripherals be locked out before on certain systems. Like for example, I know that I couldn't
1695720	1700520	use certain third party controllers for certain games back in the day. I kind of look at it
1700520	1709360	as being along the same lines. However, it would really have to be a situation of, I
1709360	1715720	think it would have to be a situation of Microsoft it being on them to have some sort of check
1715720	1721960	in line for cheats instead of just locking out the storage device altogether. So really,
1721960	1728160	I could see a few things in Datel's direction. I've got to say, for me, either way, this
1728160	1732920	story sucks. Because if Datel wins, then I truly believe that's going to drive the price
1732920	1737660	of the consoles up and they're going to use that as justification. And if they lose, then
1737660	1742080	all those people who spent money on that device lose. Ultimately, the consumer loses. Let
1742080	1747660	the buyer beware. Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news here. I want to talk
1747660	1751640	about some news out of Capcom's camp. Two very different stories that have one thing
1751640	1757160	in common. Apparently, Capcom is working on ports of Final Fight and Magic Sword for Xbox
1757160	1762440	Live Arcade and PSN. Now, you might remember Final Fight. That was kind of like the side
1762440	1766320	scroller beat them up, double dragon-esque type of game. Very famous because when it
1766320	1770800	came out on Super Nintendo, it didn't have Guy. And a lot of people freaked out and that
1770800	1776040	caused them years later to release Final Fight Guy. Which I have. Oh, do you really? Final
1776040	1780860	Fight Guy was a Blockbuster exclusive. Oh, that's right. You could only get it by renting
1780860	1784280	it at Blockbuster. That's right, I remember that. And it came out, I think, a couple years
1784280	1791240	later. Or no, maybe actually a year later. But when it came out in Japanese packaging
1791240	1797380	too. Remember. I have it box book everything. Now what's weird about this is that actually
1797380	1801440	these two games apparently are going to come out together. Final Fight Double Impact is
1801440	1805480	what it's called because it's not just Final Fight, but Magic Sword comes with it as well.
1805480	1808980	I'm imagining the games must have run on the same arcade hardware, but I can't think of
1808980	1813000	like more different types of games. But I got to say, I know a lot of you may not have
1813000	1816540	heard of Magic Sword. This is one of my all-time favorite arcade games. We actually have this
1816540	1820360	at the Pizzeria near us. I loved Magic Sword. And they actually had a version of it on Super
1820360	1823720	Nintendo that was pretty badass. And it's one of the games that's going to be featured
1823720	1828720	on my box cabinet. Because it's a Capcom system, of course. And it's a PS2, yeah. Of course.
1828720	1833360	But for those of you that don't have the skill to build a cabinet out of boxes and duct tape.
1833360	1839960	You can also put it on any homebrew enabled PSP too, so they work pretty well. I read
1839960	1844480	you some more comments from chat. Apparently a lot of love for Magic Sword in the chat.
1844480	1850760	Rama's like, Magic Sword. VanisLux, I love Magic Sword. But weird pairing. And let's
1850760	1855840	see, SalaciousPop, my BFF and I spent like $25 on Magic Sword when we were 14. And after
1855840	1859960	the final boss, he accepted the orb instead of destroying it and became the new Dark Lord.
1859960	1866760	That's right. It was also one of those games that had like multiple endings. OMG spoilers.
1866760	1870440	I'm more excited about Magic Sword than I am Final Fight. Although I did love that game
1870440	1874840	too, I gotta say. But I will say this about Final Fight, is that apparently some of the
1874840	1879840	fighters in very familiar faces are making their way into Super Street Fighter 4. And
1879840	1884640	I have to admit, from what I do remember and love about Final Fight, I think this is awesome.
1884640	1888400	Cody and Guy are making their way to Super Street Fighter 4, according to the latest
1888400	1893800	issue of Famitsu Magazine. Also making an appearance, Dawn from Street Fighter Alpha.
1893800	1897480	So those were three new characters that were announced this week. I believe Cody's been
1897480	1901760	in a game before, because he was in Alpha 3. Yeah, Alpha 3. Also, he's going to be one
1901760	1909400	of the characters coming up in Street Fighter 4. Right, right. That's very cool, I think.
1909400	1914000	Well, I thought you were just talking about Final Fight. No, no. And this whole new crossover
1914000	1918760	is kind of interesting. I kind of miss the whole Alpha series of Street Fighter. That
1918760	1922080	all happened during that period of my life where I wasn't as into video games. So I never
1922080	1925400	really played those games. I never realized that they had the crossover. Although I do
1925400	1931880	remember Hagar, the mayor, in Saturday Night Slam Masters, which was also a completely
1931880	1938320	underrated Capcom classic. We had that at my arcade that I worked at. That was the ultimate
1938320	1947560	pizzeria arcade game. I loved that game. Also on there. Shut up. Let's see, Rama asked in
1947560	1952280	chat real quick, before we get to another story here, anyone remember Mighty Final Fight?
1952280	1956200	I do. Wasn't that the version that was on the NES as opposed to the Super Nintendo?
1956200	1959800	Yeah, it wasn't like all kind of super deformed. It was all the chibi characters. What was
1959800	1964400	an 8-bit port, you know? Yeah, I remember that game. Obviously it wasn't as great because
1964400	1968280	it was an 8-bit port. But Dark Sakura, why don't you do one more story for us, then we're
1968280	1973880	going to get to our interview tonight. That's right, we do have it coming up. But how about
1973880	1982840	some PC news? Please. Okay. Well, Valve is basically sticking their tongue out and waggling
1982840	1989480	it at all the people that are boycotting Steamworks. Which I'm actually laughing. They're saying
1989480	1997800	basically that any digital distributors who are boycotting PC games because they come
1997800	2009120	with Steamworks services are missing out on an opportunity. They're actually saying that...
2009120	2015160	Let's see, different companies like Direct to Drive, Impulse and Gamersgate that didn't
2015160	2021800	want to sell Modern Warfare 2 because it had the Steamworks tools acting as a storefront
2021800	2027040	for Steam. But they're saying that if you make a good game it should be out through
2027040	2033360	as many channels as possible. It is kind of interesting though that so many people are
2033360	2038280	up in arms about it, but I also kind of get it. When you get all this included software
2038280	2044760	you don't ask for, that can get really annoying. For instance, when I download programs off
2044760	2049960	the internet like Google Earth, maybe I'll download Google Earth, they try to install
2049960	2056060	that Google toolbar on my system. That's not what I ask for. Whenever you download iTunes,
2056060	2060200	it tries to install Safari on your system. I didn't ask for fucking Safari, I wanted
2060200	2064440	iTunes. I do find that kind of shit annoying. I realize maybe it's a little different because
2064440	2070440	Steamworks directly does relate to the games, but I can kind of see their point. When you
2070440	2080640	get these things you didn't ask for that even eat up 1K of memory, it's a bit of an annoyance.
2080640	2087480	What the word is, is that they've actually based the inclusion of it on what customers
2087480	2093160	have asked for, and that they've actually sold the games as well through Steam as they
2093160	2097480	have in the stores, especially Modern Warfare 2.
2097480	2104760	Reddertainment in our chatroom at chat.orangeleiser.com says, I call for a boycott of the boycott.
2104760	2107300	Perhaps that's something that needs to start, I don't know.
2107300	2111920	You know what, I say if people don't want it, don't get it. If people want it, get it.
2111920	2114940	Who cares, you can uninstall the shit.
2114940	2119520	VaniceLux in our chat says, those distributors that didn't carry Modern Warfare 2 cut themselves
2119520	2122480	out of a crap load of money, and that's about all the effect it had.
2122480	2123480	Pretty much.
2123480	2128240	Goldanthro wants to point out not only Safari, but also QuickTime. I give him a buy on that
2128240	2133160	because the movies that play in iTunes when you download movies and TV shows, which is
2133160	2136360	an integral part of the system, are in a QuickTime proprietary format.
2136360	2141080	I, however, refuse to install Safari. Safari is ass on a PC.
2141080	2144480	Yeah, it's just not as good on a PC as it is on a Mac. Great on a Mac, not on a PC.
2144480	2148920	Well, you know what part of the problem is, is that it actually tries to, instead of actually
2148920	2154400	installing a font and having it default to that, you know, like Firefox does all that,
2154400	2160160	it actually tries to emulate so that you're, it does a weird thing, but it eats a lot of
2160160	2162600	memory and it's really hard to use.
2162600	2166760	It's very interesting, though, that these, it's always these browsers, these browsers
2166760	2170240	now that try to install, because it's that and Google Chrome, too, keeps trying to install
2170240	2171240	it.
2171240	2172240	I hate Chrome.
2172240	2173240	I'm not a fan of it either.
2173240	2174240	I hate Chrome.
2174240	2179200	I'm all about Firefox. People, I'm glad there's choices now, you know, whereas it's not Internet
2179200	2182160	Explorer seeing me to dominate as much as they used to. I mean, I know they still are
2182160	2184840	the number one, but not nearly the hold they used to have.
2184840	2191600	Firefox is, it actually is a lot more secure now in general than Internet Explorer is and
2191600	2193000	has a lot more functionality.
2193000	2199720	A lot of places are really starting to embrace it over, you know, Internet Explorer.
2199720	2202760	I mean, you saw what happened to Netscape.
2202760	2203760	Netscape's gone.
2203760	2204760	Yeah, it's true.
2204760	2206680	But that kind of turned into Firefox, didn't it?
2206680	2212040	I think the Mozilla thing kind of, you know, kind of like a copy of a copy of a copy type
2212040	2213040	of thing, you know?
2213040	2219600	Well, and, you know, and keep in mind, too, we know how they tried to do Betamax, Betamax
2219600	2220600	didn't catch on.
2220600	2221780	Some of these didn't catch on.
2221780	2225960	But now our preferred format is Blu-ray.
2225960	2227360	So I could see that.
2227360	2231200	Anyhow, we got to move on because we actually have a rare live interview tonight.
2231200	2234920	A lot of times our interviews are pre-taped, but we actually have a live interview tonight.
2234920	2237520	But I have to ask you guys, especially here in studio, how many of you guys have seen
2237520	2240120	this video that's floating around YouTube right now?
2240120	2247520	It's this little version of Bad Romance, but it actually has the chibi little Sackboy characters.
2247520	2251560	And I don't know how many of you have seen the actual Lady Gaga video, but this actually
2251560	2253160	parodies the video.
2253160	2254160	Isn't this cool?
2254160	2257960	Thanks to you and Megzi, I've seen both.
2257960	2261160	So in the end, obviously, it's this little video that kind of parries using these Sackboy
2261160	2262160	characters.
2262160	2264480	And it's kind of gone viral this week.
2264480	2265880	Very interesting.
2265880	2269840	The whole thing was created by this gentleman, Brian Moreno.
2269840	2274760	And you know, his little big plan has been continuing to grow via the online co-op mode
2274760	2276000	that you've heard about this week.
2276000	2279440	And after one year of release, the online community is still going.
2279440	2284880	And I think a lot of us kind of poo-pooed at Media Molecule when they said last year
2284880	2289040	when this game came out, oh, we're not going to be thinking about a sequel right away.
2289040	2293820	What we want to do right now is we're going to focus a lot on making LittleBigPlanet bigger.
2293820	2295560	But they actually delivered on that.
2295560	2297760	We kind of rolled our eyes and thought, yeah, right.
2297760	2299760	Next year, they're going to announce LittleBigPlanet 2.
2299760	2301640	But they've actually continued to make good on that.
2301640	2306180	And I think this video going viral is just kind of an example of that.
2306180	2313000	So this video, which you can find, LittleBadRomance, YouTube user BrianRDM, it was on YouTube.
2313000	2316480	Then it got posted to NeoGAF, which is this huge, huge gaming forum.
2316480	2317580	I'm sure you've heard of it.
2317580	2319600	Then it spread through Twitter, through Facebook.
2319600	2320600	That's where I found it.
2320600	2322560	An OLR member posted it on their Twitter.
2322560	2323560	That's where I found it.
2323560	2327060	And then it got coverage on Kotaku, other blogs, so forth.
2327060	2331840	And ironically, Lady Gaga, she's also big right now.
2331840	2334840	She just started a big tour of hers last week.
2334840	2338240	50,000 views on YouTube tonight, just about 50,000, just shy of it.
2338240	2341680	So we want to get Brian Moreno here on the show to talk a little bit about this and about
2341680	2343240	the LittleBigPlanet community.
2343240	2345480	So we're actually going to give him a call right now.
2345480	2348120	Hopefully he is standing by.
2348120	2349520	So we're firing up the telephone.
2349520	2351940	And again, this is a rare live interview.
2351940	2357960	So please bear with us as we have Brian on the line.
2357960	2359960	Hello?
2359960	2367160	Hi, is this Brian?
2367160	2368160	This is Brian.
2368160	2369160	Hey, Brian.
2369160	2370160	How you doing?
2370160	2371160	It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.
2371160	2372620	How are you guys?
2372620	2373760	We are doing great.
2373760	2377560	We were just kind of checking out your video here in studio, looking at it, the little
2377560	2379000	bad romance.
2379000	2380840	Congratulations on the success.
2380840	2383240	About 50,000 views now, huh?
2383240	2384240	I know.
2384240	2386240	It's pretty mind-blowing.
2386240	2390240	Did you ever think that this was going to catch on as big as it did?
2390240	2394640	Me and my friend were actually talking about this yesterday.
2394640	2399400	We thought maybe 1,000, 2,000 modest views, a laugh between ourselves.
2399400	2403760	And then all of a sudden, the second day it was posted, it was number three most viewed
2403760	2408760	in its category in Russia and 95th most viewed on YouTube that day.
2408760	2410520	It was pretty amazing.
2410520	2412960	I had no idea it was going to go that far.
2412960	2415760	You know, it's very interesting because we've been the subject of some of that viral stuff
2415760	2418840	before too, especially the whole president cat ordeal a couple of months ago.
2418840	2423600	It's always interesting to see what kind of stuff the internet spreads like wildfire and
2423600	2424920	what doesn't.
2424920	2426200	It's fascinating, I got to say.
2426200	2430680	And if you guys have questions for Brian in our chat room, head on over to chat.orangelodgeradio.com
2430680	2434280	so you can be in the chat room and we'll ask a couple of questions from you guys to Brian.
2434280	2435920	But I got some questions for you.
2435920	2438240	First off, I got to know Brian.
2438240	2445320	Obviously Lady Gaga is huge, people love this new album, she has these super fans.
2445320	2450480	People get on YouTube and they do karaokes, they dance, do whatever interpretive thing
2450480	2452000	to Bad Romance.
2452000	2457200	What made you decide, I'm going to do a tribute, but I'm going to do it in Little Big Planet?
2457200	2460740	It was actually like a mixture of many things.
2460740	2465740	I work one of my city gigs as a club photographer here in Orange County.
2465740	2471240	And October last year, I actually had an opportunity to photograph and meet Lady Gaga.
2471240	2477640	It was right before her career exploded and she was the nicest person I've ever met.
2477640	2482720	It was 2 a.m., the show was over, fans were outside of her trailer and security was leaving.
2482720	2488480	And she said it herself, she's like, I'm going to be here until I take a picture and take
2488480	2491240	an autograph for everyone, everyone.
2491240	2492840	You know, she does something like that recently too.
2492840	2496560	I heard it like a Best Buy in LA that all these people came out and she said, I'm not
2496560	2499680	leaving until I sign all your stuff.
2499680	2508000	She's great about her and her fans and I thought she was the greatest person since I met her.
2508000	2512920	And then with the release of The Fame Monster, I mean, I've been hooked on that album.
2512920	2516960	I think it's so much better than her original release.
2516960	2520920	And then when it came to Little Big Planet, I had been a fan of it since it had been announced
2520920	2528680	D3, how many years ago, and just the ability to be able to create whatever you want and
2528680	2532400	how accessible it was to everyone.
2532400	2537440	Me being a fan of those two, it just seems like the perfect recipe for something that
2537440	2539960	would go far, that would have long legs.
2539960	2543280	So it just kind of worked out in your mind, I like this, I like this.
2543280	2547040	What happens when we throw them together?
2547040	2548940	Some could say that's the same way the show started.
2548940	2552600	I know Jamie, remember it was about, hey, I like video games and we do amateur radio,
2552600	2554000	let's do a radio show about video games.
2554000	2558040	Well, to paraphrase the quote is two great tastes that go great together.
2558040	2559040	Exactly.
2559040	2563920	I got a question for you, Brian, how long did this whole thing take?
2563920	2568000	Because I got to say, one thing that impressed me when I saw this video is I was thinking,
2568000	2571360	wait a minute, that because I'll admit anyone that's been listening to the show a long time,
2571360	2573960	I'm a big old fan of Lady Gaga, I think she's great.
2573960	2576880	And in fact, I'm not going to be here at the show on December 13th, because I'm going to
2576880	2577880	Monster Ball.
2577880	2579480	I'm going to be more excited.
2579480	2586320	But I was going to say, that video came out like Tuesday, and this video seemed like it
2586320	2588860	was on the internet, like not even 10 days later.
2588860	2592520	How long did this whole thing take you to put together?
2592520	2594320	Hours and hours and hours and hours.
2594320	2599960	I was in fear of my 60 gigabyte PlayStation hitting the dirt, I was afraid of it dying
2599960	2601600	how much I was on it.
2601600	2608920	It was honestly maybe a good 48, 64 hours total, it was just trial and error on making
2608920	2614440	those costumes and matching it with the video and making the set pieces and doing what I
2614440	2617700	could with the tools that I had provided.
2617700	2619000	Was anyone helping you out with it?
2619000	2622640	Because I noticed in a lot of the scenes, it seems like there were always three Sackboys.
2622640	2626520	So was that just you kind of coordinating three controllers, or would you have a couple
2626520	2627520	more inside of you?
2627520	2629120	More incidentally, I didn't have three hands.
2629120	2635000	So I ended up getting another friend to do the backup dancers, while I really tried to
2635000	2639360	focus on the Gaga Sad Girl herself.
2639360	2645440	So I did have some help in terms of just the actual dancing, but I mean in set pieces and
2645440	2650720	costume design, it was just me and the PlayStation and me treating it to friends or facing it
2650720	2654440	to friends to see how well they thought it matched up.
2654440	2659080	Now, this is kind of a subjective question here, but would you say that the two of you
2659080	2663800	tools that Media Molecule gives you in LittleBigPlanet made this process easy?
2663800	2667280	I mean, I know you talked about it takes hours and hours, but it takes hours and hours to
2667280	2670040	build a really good level in LittleBigPlanet too.
2670040	2674920	Do you think you have the tools you needed to produce this video good, or do you think
2674920	2677360	there was something that Media Molecule could have given you that would have made this whole
2677360	2679680	thing easier?
2679680	2688280	I think that the process, it went well, but I did discover limitations that I did not
2688280	2690180	know existed in the game.
2690180	2696040	A lot of the issues was hair with me, because hair for me, I wanted to get the right colors
2696040	2698600	and really differentiate from the Gaga Sad Girl.
2698600	2703120	And one of the problems is, for a lot of the hairstyles, you can't actually change the
2703120	2704120	hair color.
2704120	2710280	So the way I had to go around that was using stickers and carefully putting colored stickers
2710280	2711380	on the hair.
2711380	2717520	But another limitation in that is, it seems that items only have a maximum of three stickers
2717520	2723040	that you can place on an object before it will erase the first one put in and put in
2723040	2725560	the new one.
2725560	2733000	On top of that, it was too deep, a 2.5D perspective game, and you couldn't get the camera right
2733000	2736500	in some ways that you could, especially in close-ups.
2736500	2740820	And the way I found a way around that is, when you go open the pop-it menu and go to
2740820	2745680	the Customize Sackboy option, it zooms in the camera to maximize the screen on your
2745680	2746680	Sackboy.
2746680	2751000	And when you press circle and get out of that, the camera stays on that perspective.
2751000	2755880	So that's how I was able to get a lot of the close-ups, because the camera tools that they
2755880	2757520	give you don't get that close.
2757520	2760880	Well, there's a tip for other aspiring video makers out there.
2760880	2765800	Speaking of which, was this really the first thing you really did in LittleBigPlanet, or
2765800	2769480	have you made levels before, or have you done other projects, and this is just the first
2769480	2772240	one everybody seems to notice?
2772240	2777960	I fooled around with LittleBigPlanet back in the beta, and I made a kind of in-sight
2777960	2784040	joke level for one of the websites that I'm a forum member for, thenextlevel.com.
2784040	2789640	But after that, I really didn't have the time, and so many other great games are coming out,
2789640	2794480	but it was always in the back of my head that I always wanted to do something with LittleBigPlanet.
2794480	2799100	And that was just, with the Gaga and LittleBigPlanet, me wondering what would happen with those
2799100	2803000	two, I went out and bought a capture device, and I was like, I'm going to do this, I'm
2803000	2805480	going to take my time, and I'm going to make sure I make something great.
2805480	2810200	Wait, wait, wait, are you saying you bought the video capture device just for this project?
2810200	2811320	Just for this project.
2811320	2812320	That is dedication.
2812320	2816600	Well, you know, since Lady Gaga is so generous to her fans and so forth, do you think there
2816600	2819360	might be a chance she's seen it?
2819360	2822280	I actually have no idea if she's seen it.
2822280	2823280	I hope she does.
2823280	2829320	And I spammed her Twitter every time I post the link to that video.
2829320	2833920	I do know for sure that some people in Media Molecule have seen it, because if you go on
2833920	2837080	their official YouTube page, it is one of their favorites.
2837080	2838680	Oh, well, very cool.
2838680	2841960	Hey, at least you got one half of the equation that's a fan of it.
2841960	2843880	You should definitely take a compliment from that.
2843880	2848280	Well, my thought is that maybe if Gaga does see it, she could contribute some of her outfits
2848280	2852000	to the game, and then we'd have a huge variance in some of the costumes we have.
2852000	2853000	I don't know.
2853000	2858760	I hope Media Molecule gets me on that, because I'll help anyone I need to to get those costumes
2858760	2859760	done right.
2859760	2860760	Awesome.
2860760	2863920	Well, hey, you're kind of the perfect guy to ask about this, because you said you were
2863920	2866480	in the beta in all this, too.
2866480	2869920	And we were just talking before you came on the air about how LittleBigPlanet, a lot of
2869920	2873960	us didn't really believe Media Molecule a couple years ago, or I should say a year ago
2873960	2878280	when this game first came out, that they weren't going to just jump right in and do LittleBigPlanet
2878280	2879280	2.
2879280	2882480	They came out and said, no, we're going to continue to support LittleBigPlanet, and they've
2882480	2887360	really made good on that promise to a lot of our surprise, a very pleasant surprise.
2887360	2892040	What do you think it is about the game that keeps this community going strong a year after
2892040	2893040	the game is out?
2893040	2894520	Is it all these constant updates?
2894520	2898000	Is it the fact that people keep building these pop culture references?
2898000	2900040	What is it?
2900040	2905400	I think, overall, it's very charming to look at, and it's very peculiar to look at.
2905400	2907520	There's nothing else really out there like that.
2907520	2912560	But most of all, I really feel that it's, you know, the players really feel like they
2912560	2919200	are part of the game, and that they can contribute to this larger whole of what is LittleBigPlanet.
2919200	2925280	I almost feel like once Media Molecule and Sony released LittleBigPlanet, it left their
2925280	2928600	hands and it was everyone.
2928600	2932520	Everyone could contribute, everyone could build, and it's kind of just grown into something
2932520	2935800	that Sony and Media Molecule could never have done themselves.
2935800	2936800	Okay.
2936800	2937800	That would be cool.
2937800	2939960	Well, hey, I want to take some questions from our chat room here.
2939960	2944280	And Redertainment has a question for you, and says, what song will you make a video
2944280	2945280	for next?
2945280	2949160	And he makes a suggestion of Guitar Hero by Amanda Palmer, who must be a favorite artist
2949160	2950160	of his.
2950160	2952360	I guess that's a really good question to ask.
2952360	2955160	After all of this, is this going to be a regular thing for you?
2955160	2959600	Are you going to continue to make more videos, or is this kind of like a one-shot thing?
2959600	2960600	You know what?
2960600	2964200	I'm going to just enjoy this and move on to other projects.
2964200	2969240	What this video was, was a part of a whole of a project that I was doing actually for
2969240	2970320	one of my college classes.
2970320	2972880	I'm about to graduate finally.
2972880	2978200	And it was kind of about context and what would happen if I took something and put it
2978200	2982440	in somewhere, something else, what would happen.
2982440	2986560	The next part of this series, I guess I'll give you a little exclusive right now, my
2986560	2991720	next video, using LittleBigPlanet and kind of going along with these pop references is
2991720	3000160	going to be remaking the New Moon trailer, which if there's anything bigger, then God
3000160	3002480	got it to New Moon.
3002480	3003480	Fair enough.
3003480	3004480	All right.
3004480	3005480	Wow.
3005480	3012720	Along with that, I'd love to continue doing stuff with LittleBigPlanet.
3012720	3019640	With Neil Gaff, I promised them that if this made it on any gaming blocks, that I would
3019640	3022640	go along and do some of their music video requests.
3022640	3027440	So some of them that they've requested are Thriller and White Wedding.
3027440	3031600	So really going to have to see if those are possible, because I did stretch the limits
3031600	3036200	and really got really creative with what I was given to be able to get the costumes as
3036200	3038080	close as they could look.
3038080	3041720	You know, I got to say, it's getting a lot of mixed feedback in our chat room.
3041720	3047240	You're getting some LOLs and XDs, and then of course the Do Not Wants and so forth for
3047240	3048960	the New Moon trailer.
3048960	3051240	But I like this from Tigerclaw.
3051240	3053440	How are they going to make a Sackboy turn into a wolf?
3053440	3057420	And Botikawa says, roll full sparkly and wolf Sackboys.
3057420	3060040	So I guess we'll see, huh?
3060040	3061040	Mm-hmm.
3061040	3067680	Well, you know, if this whole thing was for school, I hope to hell you get an A or else
3067680	3068680	I hope so.
3068680	3070460	You got robbed.
3070460	3072120	You play this for your professor.
3072120	3075440	Give Brian an A. He earned it.
3075440	3078200	This will actually be part of the package that I turn into him.
3078200	3079200	This will be.
3079200	3080200	Awesome.
3080200	3081200	Awesome.
3081200	3082200	Well, there you go.
3082200	3086280	Hey, Brian, one thing we like to ask everybody we have on the show, just a standard question
3086280	3089840	for all the guests, because we always ask it to ourselves at the top of every show.
3089840	3095800	What video games have you been playing this week, now besides LittleBigPlanet, of course?
3095800	3098680	The matter is what haven't I been playing this week.
3098680	3102680	I've been playing Dizzidia, Final Fantasy on the PSP.
3102680	3104640	I'm not too sure about that one.
3104640	3110160	When I played it at E3 earlier this year, I was kind of, I had no idea what was going
3110160	3111640	on, but I'm getting used to it.
3111640	3113200	I'm really enjoying it.
3113200	3115520	It's a really big fan service.
3115520	3119600	On top of that, playing the original Left 4 Dead, because I already bought Left 4 Dead
3119600	3123160	2 on Black Friday to have me finish the first one.
3123160	3128960	And O'Meara Friend also went to the 3 a.m. Old Navy Black Friday opening, and he got
3128960	3131280	herself a copy of Little Rock Band.
3131280	3136520	So we've been rocking out with that, with Elton John and Vampire Weekend.
3136520	3137520	Very cool.
3137520	3140200	I was debating doing that, but I was like, ah, I don't want to fight all those people
3140200	3144320	at 3 in the morning, so props to you for doing that.
3144320	3149620	Very interesting, too, because Lego Rock Band's another game with very cute-looking avatars.
3149620	3154120	You think you might have to have something there with Lego Rock Band and making fan videos?
3154120	3161000	The thing with Lego Rock Band is, for me, I really need those tools, and as far as I've
3161000	3166080	seen, Lego Rock Band doesn't give me anywhere close to what Little Big Planet does.
3166080	3167080	Very true.
3167080	3170880	In terms of the create and being able to have some control.
3170880	3174880	Besides Little Big Planet, I am going to start looking into Uncharted 2, because I'm ever
3174880	3179800	hearing there's a movie-making mode where you can do all kinds of camera tricks and
3179800	3182040	lip-syncing, I believe, is in there.
3182040	3187480	Honestly, what I can do with that, I'm really trying to get into the electronic format and
3187480	3194800	the electronic creative ways to continue this project beyond just the school project and
3194800	3196200	the assignment requirements.
3196200	3199440	Well, Brian, it sounds like you're going to be able to use this as kind of a launch of
3199440	3204920	future Mashima and types of movies based around video games, so props to you.
3204920	3208720	Where can the listeners keep tabs on you and your future projects?
3208720	3214440	The easiest way is going onto my website, www.brianmarino.com.
3214440	3218280	You can find me on YouTube at youtube.com slash brianrdm.
3218280	3222720	Those will be the quickest and easy ways to keep up on any of the work I do.
3222720	3227160	All right, and stay tuned there for the soon-to-come Little Big Planet New Moon trailer, which
3227160	3229200	you heard about here on OLR First.
3229200	3230200	Thank you so much, Brian.
3230200	3231960	I appreciate that exclusive and everything else.
3231960	3233880	And best of luck to you in your future endeavors.
3233880	3235880	Yeah, thank you, guys.
3235880	3243320	I want to thank you guys, Kotaku, NeoGaf, The Next Level, all the listeners on Orange
3243320	3248080	Lounge Radio, everyone on YouTube, Lady Gaga, everything, because without all of you guys,
3248080	3250440	this wouldn't be anywhere close to what it was.
3250440	3254040	Well, I'm glad we can kind of make your day with all of this.
3254040	3255040	And you know what?
3255040	3259280	I really smiled and got a good laugh in a really positive way out of the video when
3259280	3262000	I first saw it, so I'm glad we can kind of turn it around back to you.
3262000	3263000	Excellent.
3263000	3264000	Thank you, guys.
3264000	3265000	All right.
3265000	3266000	Take care, Brian.
3266000	3267000	Have a good one.
3267000	3268000	Take care, guys.
3268000	3269000	Bye.
3269000	3270000	Bye.
3270000	3271000	Well, that was fun.
3271000	3274160	He definitely sounds like he's going to kind of use this to kind of start something else.
3274160	3279240	And although, you know, this may be the one that's really big and maybe the other ones,
3279240	3280240	but I don't know.
3280240	3281240	I mean, that one was so good.
3281240	3282240	And he's right.
3282240	3283240	It was very well done.
3283240	3284480	No, I was quite impressed.
3284480	3288840	Whether I like it or not, you know, I like Gaga, but I don't like Twilight nearly as
3288840	3289840	much.
3289840	3290840	But-
3290840	3294040	I'm actually looking forward to seeing how that pans out.
3294040	3295920	I love parodies.
3295920	3296920	He's right.
3296920	3299800	The only thing bigger than Gaga is Twilight, so why the hell not?
3299800	3302800	So yeah, you're totally right.
3302800	3305600	Who doesn't love a good Weird Al song no matter what it is he's parodying, right?
3305600	3308480	Oh, he should do a Weird Al video.
3308480	3309480	Hopefully he's listening.
3309480	3310480	Hopefully he's still listening.
3310480	3311480	Seriously?
3311480	3312480	A Weird Al one?
3312480	3313480	That would be good.
3313480	3314480	There you go.
3314480	3315480	All right.
3315480	3316480	Well, that was fun.
3316480	3317480	All right.
3317480	3318480	Let's move on.
3318480	3320200	We've got some more news here before we get to our classic game of the week, and then,
3320200	3324640	of course, part B tonight, 7 o'clock here in California, 10 o'clock for those folks
3324640	3326700	on the East Coast, but plenty more show to come.
3326700	3328160	So, Loki, what's up next?
3328160	3333760	As we alluded to in our intro, although the podcast won't be privy to that, New York
3333760	3340700	State apparently now has teamed up with Microsoft to issue emergency alerts via Xbox Live, kind
3340700	3346880	of similar to, I guess, the Amber Alerts that we have and other emergency broadcasts and
3346880	3347880	stuff.
3347880	3353360	They're going to let you know if there's a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, you
3353360	3355560	name it, whatever requires them to do it.
3355560	3360080	I just hope they don't do the tests with that, and I also hope they don't have that
3360080	3362800	annoying beep that goes with it.
3362800	3367080	A message to me might be fine, but, man, I hate watching TV, and all of a sudden there's
3367080	3371120	like an Amber Alert thing going on, and all the audio cuts out, and it's like, dude,
3371120	3372120	I'm inside my house.
3372120	3377120	I'm not going to see some guy driving around with his stolen child in my house, okay?
3377120	3382000	Plus, that's kind of the concern I would think about Amber Alerts is that the more
3382000	3386040	you use it, the more desensitized people get to it, right?
3386040	3388760	Does that make sense?
3388760	3393520	If you saw an Amber Alert every hour on the TV, you would stop paying attention to them.
3393520	3397940	So you really have to use a device like this, and I don't know, we're using Amber Alert.
3397940	3399800	Is that the type of thing they're talking about here, kidnapped kids?
3399800	3402600	It's mainly emergency broadcast system stuff.
3402600	3408160	Mainly I think it's because New York and the whole 9-11 thing.
3408160	3410440	I'm sure other states are probably looking into something like this too.
3410440	3411440	I'm sorry.
3411440	3415040	Do you know if the gaming consoles are exactly a good platformer for that?
3415040	3417800	Because most people would be like, ah, goddammit, who's messaging me now?
3417800	3420000	I'm going to go finish this game first.
3420000	3424000	You know, terror alert, you know, death and imminent.
3424000	3426360	It's like, ah.
3426360	3427560	The Vs have arrived.
3427560	3430440	Get out of town.
3430440	3431440	The bombing's gone off already.
3431440	3433440	That bothers me, Rob.
3433440	3434440	Why?
3434440	3439360	I know I don't like using, okay, that's like seriously my big pet peeve with that
3439360	3442080	show is them calling them the Vs that, no.
3442080	3447920	The whole point of the V in the original series was the reference to World War II.
3447920	3454400	Okay, okay, but you know in the new one they got the whole thing, I know, I know, all right.
3454400	3458480	But I mean regardless, all joking aside, I got to say though, you know, when they originally
3458480	3461820	incorporated the emergency broadcast system, wasn't it kind of a similar deal?
3461820	3466960	You know, people use their free time playing TV, or playing TV, watching TV, and so the
3466960	3471480	emergency broadcast system would alert those people who aren't glued to the radio or going
3471480	3472480	outside.
3472480	3474400	I mean this kind of makes sense in a way.
3474400	3479560	I think that they use this tastefully like, hey, there's a fucking fire right by you
3479560	3480560	right now.
3480560	3484040	You know, it might be a good idea to get the fuck out and stop playing your game.
3484040	3488200	I actually don't think it's a bad idea, but again, it's just about how much they
3488200	3489200	use it.
3489200	3492460	Because if it's an AMBO alert every other hour, people are going to get pissed off.
3492460	3495720	But if it's for like big stuff, like you need to leave your home.
3495720	3497500	You need to evacuate or something.
3497500	3502220	If it's an absolute emergency like that, they have a way to call all the phones and
3502220	3507000	have an automated message play so you can pick up your phone.
3507000	3509800	Because most people might not be playing like a game console.
3509800	3512760	You know, hey, what's that crackling rumbling sound?
3512760	3515040	Oh, hey, it's fire!
3515040	3516040	Awesome!
3516040	3518320	I'm going to play one more level.
3518320	3520960	It's far enough away.
3520960	3521960	I don't know.
3521960	3523840	It's just, it's a neat idea.
3523840	3525840	It's just interesting to see how it's implemented.
3525840	3529080	I think it's going to be just about as effective as it is on TV.
3529080	3532520	Which is, if you're like me, that's the time that I go get a snack.
3532520	3536160	Because that noise isn't, oh god, I hate it.
3536160	3539680	SSJ100Matt in our chat took the words right out of my mouth.
3539680	3543600	The next step would be announcements and wow.
3543600	3545640	But then again, those people won't leave their homes anyway.
3545640	3546880	Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3546880	3547880	I resemble that remark.
3547880	3550560	Thank you very much.
3550560	3553240	Janai in chat, yes, it just goes in the next time.
3553240	3555880	We interrupt this wow raid for this important Amber Alert.
3555880	3558440	And again, guys, I'm not trying to belittle Amber Alerts.
3558440	3560560	Obviously, it's an important thing.
3560560	3565720	But I think that type of thing works best on the highway, where the cars are, on the
3565720	3568880	signs on the highway.
3568880	3576960	On the TV in my home, I'm not likely to see white Honda Civic license plate whatever driving
3576960	3577960	by.
3577960	3580680	I'm not as likely to be receptive to that as I would be.
3580680	3584640	But if it's for a big thing, like town being evacuated, then yeah, you need to have your
3584640	3587580	game paused for this emergency message.
3587580	3589660	But it's all about in how they use it for me.
3589660	3590660	That's my opinion anyway.
3590660	3591660	I don't know.
3591660	3595460	DarkSaga, how would you feel if you were playing a game and then suddenly, a little message
3595460	3599480	comes up, fire, get out?
3599480	3606480	Well, if there was really a fire, then I'd be like, thank you.
3606480	3609120	But if it was just like, what?
3609120	3614720	I'd be like, GTFO my game.
3614720	3619440	Or if it was like, fire in Bakersfield, and then you're like, well, it's like five hours
3619440	3620440	away.
3620440	3621440	Sucks to be there.
3621440	3622440	Do not give a crap.
3622440	3625920	I mean, sucks to be people in Bakersfield, but don't know.
3625920	3628200	That's what I would worry, especially if it's like a statewide thing.
3628200	3636720	I would want to have it be my specific zip code maybe.
3636720	3640320	That might be more appropriate.
3640320	3643960	The chat room collectively, I'm just kind of attributing this to several people in the
3643960	3647920	chat room, seem to think that the iPhone is a good idea for these types of alerts.
3647920	3652580	And I've heard that talk before too, is alerts through text message, which I think could
3652580	3653580	be very effective.
3653580	3654580	That'd be awesome.
3654580	3656640	And then I get charged text messaging.
3656640	3658920	Not if you have an iPhone.
3658920	3660720	Well, and your carrier doesn't charge.
3660720	3664200	I know even when I had Sprint and I got charged for every message on my plan, they didn't
3664200	3665880	charge for messages they sent.
3665880	3666880	Oh, yeah.
3666880	3667880	Yeah.
3667880	3668880	And I wouldn't think those would get charged.
3668880	3672880	But a lot of times, though, it's built into your iPhone plan to have like a certain number
3672880	3673880	of...
3673880	3677040	Or even if it...
3677040	3681040	A little app you could download that's like an alert app or something.
3681040	3684520	It might not have the same impact, though, than just sending it for a text message.
3684520	3685520	Just send it to your email.
3685520	3688000	They just have stuff that goes to your email.
3688000	3691600	And then, of course, as the J-100 Map makes the joke, Nintendo will send their Amber Alerts
3691600	3694840	through friend codes.
3694840	3696960	So an Amber Alert will look like 012463.
3696960	3697960	Anyhow.
3697960	3704520	All right, hey, speaking of WoW came up in that last story, and WoW is the attention
3704520	3706180	this week of a lawsuit.
3706180	3707180	That's right.
3707180	3713320	$1 million in a complaint against Activision Blizzard over the design of World of Warcraft.
3713320	3718760	This complaint says that the publisher maintains a, quote, harmful virtual environment to many
3718760	3723040	of its customers by forcing them to follow the game's sneaky and deceitful practices.
3723040	3727280	Well, now, what would you think about this lawsuit if I told you it was filed by Eric
3727280	3728880	Estavio?
3728880	3729880	That's right.
3729880	3732920	The guy who filed the lawsuit against Sony.
3732920	3735020	And the judge basically laughed it out of court.
3735020	3738800	So he went and sued Microsoft and Nintendo, which we reported on last week.
3738800	3743280	And this week, now he sued Activision Blizzard over this one.
3743280	3752800	Oh, by the way, as part of this case, Estavio has subpoenaed actress Winona Ryder and Depeche
3752800	3758000	Mode's Martin Lee Gore to testify on his behalf.
3758000	3761560	Because apparently, I don't even want to get into it.
3761560	3763320	It's just as ridiculous as it sounds.
3763320	3765960	Does that mean they have to actually show up?
3765960	3766960	I don't know.
3766960	3768200	I think he just wanted to meet them.
3768200	3772320	I'm reminded of that scene from Clerks, the animated series, where they subpoena George
3772320	3775840	Lucas in the courtroom, which, didn't this whole topic-
3775840	3776840	I want my money back.
3776840	3778920	Didn't this topic come up on the show like just two weeks ago?
3778920	3779920	Last week.
3779920	3782960	Well, here it is again, probably for the same fucking guy.
3782960	3783960	Yes, it was.
3783960	3785760	And that's just exactly what it sounds like.
3785760	3787520	I want my eight dollars back.
3787520	3789520	That's exactly what it sounds like.
3789520	3790520	I mean-
3790520	3791520	Someone sued him.
3791520	3795320	Hey, let's have a class action lawsuit against that guy.
3795320	3800640	For ruining all of the news sites that we- for having such an impact on the gaming culture
3800640	3803240	and the game blogs?
3803240	3808120	For mental anguish that someone could be that stupid.
3808120	3809560	Watch out or we might get sued next.
3809560	3811360	Of course, you can't get blood out of a turnip.
3811360	3812520	We don't have any money.
3812520	3813520	Good luck.
3813520	3814520	I'd take him to court.
3814520	3815520	I'd fight it all the way.
3815520	3816520	No, check this out.
3816520	3817520	Check this out.
3817520	3826160	If he sued us, then we could actually petition for damages for cost if-
3826160	3827160	I'd counter sue.
3827160	3828240	Just would win.
3828240	3829760	And then we'd have money to advertise a show.
3829760	3830760	That'd be awesome.
3830760	3831760	We would.
3831760	3832760	Here's my thought.
3832760	3833760	Okay-
3833760	3834760	Buy a studio.
3834760	3839540	In all seriousness, though, okay, this is the point where you rela- I mean, last week
3839540	3844680	we were asking this, but now you really have to ask, why is he doing this?
3844680	3846800	Is it just a tour?
3846800	3849960	Or is it just he's trying to be collecting all the money?
3849960	3855400	But like, I would be with you on the whole he's doing it just for the money until I heard
3855400	3859920	he's subpoenaed Winona Ryder and Depeche Mode because now I'm like, okay, this guy's just
3859920	3862800	cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
3862800	3864400	But how do you have money to pay?
3864400	3867960	I mean, is he getting these lawyers that are just like, you know-
3867960	3873800	I mean, your average lawyer is not gonna probably follow up with this stuff because there's
3873800	3875240	no payout for it.
3875240	3879100	I mean, unless this guy's gonna pay him, you know, to do this stuff, I'm assuming that
3879100	3883760	he's expecting the, you know, win this stuff to, you know, cover his lawyer fees.
3883760	3886400	But I don't know.
3886400	3888260	It's like there's so little grounds.
3888260	3893320	It's like it would be such a high risk case for a lawyer.
3893320	3897960	If I was an attorney, I would think that it would be damaging to my reputation to take
3897960	3899920	such a frivolous case like this.
3899920	3904520	And some people in our chat are invoking the name of Lord Voldemort, which you might remember
3904520	3905640	is a certain lawyer.
3905640	3911400	His name rhymes with Jack Fuckhead-Ompson.
3911400	3913480	That we call him Lord Voldemort here on the show.
3913480	3917240	A few folks invoking that name, dude, this guy is starting to make Lord Voldemort look
3917240	3918240	good.
3918240	3919240	Like, really?
3919240	3923680	Like, at least you kind of knew what Lord Voldemort was thinking.
3923680	3926000	Well, it's not like you could hire him.
3926000	3927000	Right?
3927000	3928680	It's just so weird.
3928680	3935000	Anyway, and I just, I really would like to find this guy and shoot him with a water gun.
3935000	3937880	I have to admit, I kind of want him on the show.
3937880	3939800	Has this guy made a comment publicly?
3939800	3942280	I don't think he's made any type of comment publicly.
3942280	3945600	You know, all these blogs are reporting on it when really he should just be banned.
3945600	3949600	If you pay the town fool no mind, he will just go away and, you know, entertain himself
3949600	3950600	in his house.
3950600	3954160	But everybody likes the town fool that jumps around and makes an ass of himself.
3954160	3957640	But I would kind of like to hear his side of it, like, you know, and I'm willing to
3957640	3959800	give him a fair shot if he'll present himself professionally.
3959800	3961640	Isn't he serving as his own lawyer?
3961640	3963000	I believe he is.
3963000	3966120	Don't they say a man who has himself as a lawyer has a fool for a client or something
3966120	3967120	like that?
3967120	3968120	What was that line there from Addams Family?
3968120	3972120	Well, by God, I am that fool!
3972120	3973240	Yes, exactly.
3973240	3974480	I love that movie.
3974480	3975800	Me too.
3975800	3977920	By the way, totally off topic and I don't care.
3977920	3983680	Did you hear that it's going to be a stage play soon with Nathan Lane as Gomez and Bebe
3983680	3984680	Neuwirth as Morticia?
3984680	3985680	I'm just saying.
3985680	3986680	Epic epicness.
3986680	3987680	Nathan Lane?
3987680	3988680	I can't see that.
3988680	3989680	I'm sorry.
3989680	3994440	It's a little weird, but let's face it, Raul Julia ain't here no more.
3994440	3997400	So if they're going to go with this comic Broadway angle, why not?
3997400	3998400	You know, I don't know.
3998400	3999400	Anyway.
3999400	4002720	He's a little chubby for, you know.
4002720	4003720	Maybe he's worked out.
4003720	4009360	But anyway, Ricky Gomack says about this guy, he just wants to get on Oprah before she's
4009360	4011620	gone.
4011620	4012620	This might be the way to do it.
4012620	4013880	I don't know.
4013880	4016040	And then who was it that said that we should go settle this?
4016040	4017040	Oh, here it is.
4017040	4018040	Amaze Atsuma.
4018040	4019800	Skye, sue him so you can be on the people's court.
4019800	4020800	Yeah.
4020800	4025000	If this guy does, for whatever reason, sue us, even though we're totally under our rights
4025000	4029760	to comment on what is a public news story, for whatever wacky reason, although I don't
4029760	4032620	see it happening, we were to get sued, I would only agree to settlement on the people's court
4032620	4038000	under Judge Millon because, or Judge Millon, she would tear him a new butthole.
4038000	4039680	And you know, you don't fuck with her.
4039680	4042760	I don't know if you've ever watched the new people's court, but she's amazing.
4042760	4043760	Just saying.
4043760	4046960	You know, I remember the people's court back in the day when it was Judge Wapner.
4046960	4049080	Oh yeah, I remember that too.
4049080	4050080	Back in the day.
4050080	4051080	I remember that too.
4051080	4053840	You always waited for the day he was going to send somebody to the electric chair, but
4053840	4054840	it never happened.
4054840	4055840	I don't think they can.
4055840	4056840	No, you can't.
4056840	4058840	They'd make an exception.
4058840	4062200	That's not the way TV court works, but you know sometimes there were just those people
4062200	4064640	on the show that you wish would get the death penalty.
4064640	4069840	No, sir, you can't do that, but you know what, I'm going to make this exception this one
4069840	4070840	time.
4070840	4071840	Alright.
4071840	4074360	I vote for hanging.
4074360	4077280	You know what, part of me just wants to ban this guy from the show.
4077280	4078280	What do you think?
4078280	4079280	Are we going to report on this guy ever again?
4079280	4080760	Actually, you know what I want to do?
4080760	4081760	What?
4081760	4083360	I want to publicly humiliate him.
4083360	4085440	Well, isn't he kind of doing that for himself?
4085440	4086440	No, I'm not.
4086440	4087440	I didn't mean it like that.
4087440	4090960	I mean, I meant mock, like apart from just what we're doing on the show.
4090960	4095160	Again, is there anything additional we could lend to the rest of the internet?
4095160	4099920	Well, we can make a big, well, I'm saying like we could use, are there pictures of this
4099920	4100920	guy around?
4100920	4101920	Probably not.
4101920	4105120	We could totally make lolcat stuff out of this guy.
4105120	4108200	Or we'll get Brian to help us make a LittleBigPlanet level.
4108200	4109200	Yes!
4109200	4115760	We've got $10 with your name on it because we have no money.
4115760	4121140	It could be a level in LittleBigPlanet where OLR goes to the people's court with Eric,
4121140	4124000	and it's about our adventures of traveling to judge me on it.
4124000	4129240	We will provide a voice talent with Judge Mr. Spanky.
4129240	4132680	Seriously, that would be fun.
4132680	4138700	Now, I'm in the mood to do something silly, like I'm tired of making lol Sims.
4138700	4142720	So I want to do something funny.
4142720	4144160	We'll have to brainstorm off air.
4144160	4147560	Maybe if the chatters have an idea, you can email us at mailbagorangelawnsherd.com, especially
4147560	4151200	if you have LittleBigPlanet skills, because I'm loving this idea.
4151200	4157560	Alright, yes, ActDeaf has the perfect name for it, LittleBigLawsuit.
4157560	4158560	How perfect!
4158560	4160120	What a perfect name for this whole story.
4160120	4164880	Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, please change the subject.
4164880	4166100	What I like to ever.
4166100	4168800	How about Konami?
4168800	4169800	Because we like Konami!
4169800	4173480	Yeah, Konami, you know, they've had their ups and downs over the year, but you know
4173480	4177000	what, they gave us DDR, and without it we would have never met, so they'll always have
4177000	4178000	a place in my heart.
4178000	4184600	Well, they've also given us Castlevania, or as it's known, Demon Castle Dracula.
4184600	4193360	And now this statement put out by Dave Cox, who's an executive with Konami, is basically
4193360	4200800	talking about Castlevania Lords of Shadow, and saying that it's a big departure.
4200800	4208020	So they're a little nervous about how it's going to be received.
4208020	4217900	It's going to be a free sort of game, as in you have a free roaming world, you can move
4217900	4219120	through different areas.
4219120	4227080	There's also supposed to be pretty A-list voice credits added in there, too.
4227080	4229340	But they're a little nervous because it's going to be a different kind of Castlevania.
4229340	4231560	Wasn't this the one that had, like, Patrick Stewart in it?
4231560	4232560	Ian McClellan.
4232560	4233560	Oh, okay.
4233560	4234560	Sorry.
4234560	4235560	What?
4235560	4236560	Your mic's not on.
4236560	4237560	Turn the mic on.
4237560	4238560	Mic is on.
4238560	4239560	You know what?
4239560	4240560	Oh, okay.
4240560	4241960	That was weird, you weren't picking up for some reason.
4241960	4242960	No.
4242960	4243960	Oh, weird.
4243960	4244960	It was the ghost.
4244960	4245960	Apparently.
4245960	4251280	You read, I'm sorry, go back to the last story, you read what the lawsuit was about, right?
4251280	4254040	About the whole fact that it takes over people's lives.
4254040	4255760	No, it doesn't take over people's lives.
4255760	4262720	He's complaining that because the speed of which you walk or run in the game is too slow
4262720	4267520	and therefore it takes you longer to finish quests, therefore causing you to have to pay
4267520	4271560	longer and longer subscriptions in order to finish the quest in the game.
4271560	4272560	That was his complaint.
4272560	4276460	That's even dumber than, you know, it being addicting.
4276460	4277460	You know what?
4277460	4283160	I would almost not be, like, so pointing and laughing at this guy, again, if it weren't
4283160	4287400	for the one owner writer and Depeche Mode subpoenas because that's where you went from
4287400	4291680	just petty to batshit crazy, in my opinion.
4291680	4292680	And I have a right to state my opinion.
4292680	4293680	All right.
4293680	4294680	Sorry.
4294680	4295680	No, that's okay.
4295680	4298280	But I want to go back to Castlevania because, you know, I'm nervous about this new Castlevania
4298280	4302400	game too because, let's face it, there hasn't been, in my opinion, a really, really, really
4302400	4308260	memorable, keyword memorable, Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night.
4308260	4314240	And I realize the DS ones were decent and the, above decent, they were pretty good.
4314240	4318480	And you know, the PS2 one was decent, but there hasn't been one that's just been effing
4318480	4320680	awesome like the Nintendo one.
4320680	4322760	Order of the Clesia was pretty freaking rad.
4322760	4323760	I love that game.
4323760	4324760	I don't know.
4324760	4325760	Did you play it?
4325760	4326760	Yeah, a little bit.
4326760	4327760	A little bit.
4327760	4328760	Did you play it a lot bit?
4328760	4329760	Okay.
4329760	4330760	A half bit.
4330760	4331760	A half bit.
4331760	4335260	I think that was one of the games I played when I was really sick last year, so.
4335260	4337040	But I knew what you were getting at.
4337040	4340440	Order of the Clesia was hard, it was actually a challenge to play.
4340440	4343960	Especially if they're taking this series in a whole new direction, but at the same time,
4343960	4347880	Symphony of the Night, which is, I would easily put, in one of my top five video games of
4347880	4350440	all time, was a new direction for Castlevania.
4350440	4351760	I know what will save the series.
4351760	4352760	What's that?
4352760	4353760	More Richter.
4353760	4354760	More Richter.
4354760	4355760	Sorry.
4355760	4358320	We need another Dracula X.
4358320	4359320	Dark Sakura?
4359320	4360320	What?
4360320	4361320	You don't belong in this world.
4361320	4362320	Bah.
4362320	4366920	Anyhow, let's move on to get some release dates, travel the world, and see what's coming
4366920	4368520	out in your neck of the woods.
4368520	4369520	Yep.
4369520	4372560	There's some stuff coming out this week, actually.
4372560	4376400	The first, well I should say the last good week before the end of the year.
4376400	4379680	There's a few other things coming out the rest of the year, but this is kind of the
4379680	4383440	big hurrah before the end of the year.
4383440	4388800	So first thing first, we've got Avatar coming out on pretty much everything.
4388800	4395200	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.
4395200	4396200	And this PC as well.
4396200	4398440	Can I be honest with you for a minute?
4398440	4399440	Yeah.
4399440	4404000	Is it just me, or I am like so not interested in Avatar.
4404000	4406920	Like it just doesn't look good to me.
4406920	4412200	And like, you know, I'll be fair and say, you know, I realize that I'm not always into
4412200	4416360	the same type of movies everybody else is and so forth, but you know, I like Terminator.
4416360	4417740	I like Titanic.
4417740	4420040	I like, you know, all these movies that James Cameron's done.
4420040	4421040	Did you cry?
4421040	4422440	Of course I cried.
4422440	4424220	But I'm looking at- I teared.
4424220	4425840	I'm looking for- shut up.
4425840	4430360	I'm looking at Avatar, and I'm just kind of like, oh boy.
4430360	4435600	This just- it just looks bloated, long, pompous, and it doesn't look like it's going to be
4435600	4436600	good to me.
4436600	4438600	I'm going to go see it just because it's going to be in 3D.
4438600	4441920	It's supposed to be really awesome, but then if, you know, it sucks, I'll be sure to shout
4441920	4444160	it to the world that it sucks.
4444160	4448480	The game itself is supposed to be good.
4448480	4453200	It's- they have been working on it for a few years at least.
4453200	4456280	So it's supposed to be good and not sucky, and we'll see though.
4456280	4460760	I will take my friend- if my friends all come back and say it was freaking awesome, then
4460760	4464400	I will go see it, and maybe I'm wrong, and I'll just blame the marketing.
4464400	4470440	You know, I'm kind of with you on that because, you know, it does look kind of like it could
4470440	4473320	be lame, but you know, I'll give it a chance.
4473320	4474920	I think it's going to be really cool looking.
4474920	4478400	Dark Sakura just exclaimed, I love salacious pop, referring to one of our chatters.
4478400	4479400	Why is that?
4479400	4482920	Avatar looks like Starship Troopers plus Warcraft plus The Spirits Within plus corny
4482920	4483920	diarrhea.
4483920	4486760	That's a pretty good way to come up.
4486760	4496920	Now this is my take on Avatar, is now, I am a big fan of fun tech, and looking into the
4496920	4502480	how they make it, you know, the behind the scenes stuff, the technology going into it,
4502480	4509880	the innovations that are actually being made in the CG process, in the motion capture,
4509880	4512240	that's really, really interesting to me.
4512240	4514320	I'll give you that, I'll give you that.
4514320	4519040	And from the technical, a lot of times, I'll go see a movie, even if it's supposed to be,
4519040	4528520	you know, the corn and crap, I will see it to see how the final product looks like, okay,
4528520	4534760	I do like a lot of movies that people hate, I love bad movies, I loved Hypercube, I loved
4534760	4535760	Xanadu.
4535760	4536760	I love Showgirls.
4536760	4542320	I love Showgirls too, and you got me into that movie, you don't know shit.
4542320	4550760	But no, in the end, but you also know that I don't really go for the stuff that's overhyped,
4550760	4555040	I really avoid stuff that's overhyped.
4555040	4560280	But I think I'll see this one, I will see it, you know, opening week, because honestly,
4560280	4562200	I don't want to see it that bad.
4562200	4564160	But I will see it after it's been in the theater for a little bit.
4564160	4567600	I didn't mean to turn this into Avatar hate, I'm so sorry, but I just, I had to get that
4567600	4570580	out there, because there's just, there was just something about it that just wasn't sitting
4570580	4571580	well with me.
4571580	4574960	And again, maybe it's going to be an awesome movie, and I'm totally wrong, but I love some
4574960	4576560	of the comments from chat.
4576560	4582320	Legend of Zaku says, Avatar equals Dances with Smurfs.
4582320	4583640	That's from South Park.
4583640	4584640	Oh, was it?
4584640	4585640	Yeah.
4585640	4588440	Oh, I didn't see this week's episode, that must be what it is.
4588440	4592840	And then, that's just Joe 100 Matt saying, I heard it's getting terrible pre-screening
4592840	4593840	reviews.
4593840	4598160	You know, this is the time for them to fine-tune it and tailor it and what have you, so I hope
4598160	4600320	for their sake they can pull it off.
4600320	4604520	Now, I will say this, though, at the same time, I so want to go see The Princess and
4604520	4610360	the Frog, because I am all about Disney going back to the way they did movies back in the,
4610360	4613800	you know, 90s with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and all this, so, you know, just because
4613800	4616200	the movie's over-hyped doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be bad.
4616200	4617200	But who knows, maybe-
4617200	4620460	There's been zero hype for that movie.
4620460	4623280	Maybe it's just because I'm a Disney fan, and I'll fully admit, you know, obviously
4623280	4624280	I'm biased in that regard.
4624280	4625280	No, no, no.
4625280	4628440	It looks good, but I'm just saying, there's been no hype, whereas Avatar, they were just
4628440	4632320	like, fucking your eyeballs, you know, in 2009, I'm like, I don't think so.
4632320	4636160	You don't have kids, though, and I think they've been aiming this at the kids.
4636160	4638120	I think it'll do decent.
4638120	4641120	I don't think it's going to be like their huge movie, but I think it'll do decent enough
4641120	4644140	that they'll get back into doing 2D movies, we'll see.
4644140	4646840	I think it'll make more than Avatar does.
4646840	4648600	No, it won't.
4648600	4650360	Oh, we'll see.
4650360	4651360	Care to make a wager?
4651360	4654400	No, I don't, but I can tell you right now it's not going to-
4654400	4655400	I tried.
4655400	4656400	Alright, let's move on.
4656400	4657880	Sorry, release dates.
4657880	4658880	Derailed the show.
4658880	4659880	My bad.
4659880	4660880	Totally.
4660880	4662600	Okay, so other things coming out this week.
4662600	4669360	Rogue Warrior coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, MX vs. ATV Reflex on the
4669360	4679160	DS, PSP Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and god, I forgot that this movie was coming
4679160	4680720	out, and I really don't want to see this.
4680720	4685000	Alvin and the Chipmunks is a squeak-quel on the Wii and DS this week.
4685000	4686440	Why, god?
4686440	4687440	Why?
4687440	4691520	It's got the chipettes this time.
4691520	4700760	I'd rather- I would rather watch like Avatar for 24 hours straight or any- Oh, I know what
4700760	4701760	I was going to say.
4701760	4702920	Here's the thing.
4702920	4707200	When I saw the trailer for Avatar, it looked like an M. Night Shyamalan movie to me.
4707200	4708720	That was what didn't sit well with me.
4708720	4712800	So I would rather than watch the new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I would rather watch
4712800	4713800	what was it called?
4713800	4716600	The Happening or whatever that latest like that just it was so horrible.
4716600	4722160	You sure you weren't watching The Last Airbender, which is an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
4722160	4727920	I would rather watch The Happening five times in a row than watch the new Alvin and Chipmunks
4727920	4728920	movie.
4728920	4732320	For the record, this is actually going back to what you're saying about the Princess of
4732320	4733320	the Frog.
4733320	4734320	Yes.
4734320	4735320	It's from Becky.
4735320	4736320	Oh, yeah?
4736320	4737320	Yeah.
4737320	4740880	And I do have a kid and I actually haven't seen much about Princess and the Frog on Disney
4740880	4741880	Channel yet.
4741880	4742880	Really?
4742880	4743880	Really?
4743880	4745640	She's got a two-year-old who watches Phineas and Ferb, Rob.
4745640	4746960	Remember, I showed you some of that.
4746960	4747960	I know.
4747960	4748960	I know.
4748960	4749960	I know.
4749960	4750960	And it's great.
4750960	4751960	Fair enough.
4751960	4752960	Fair enough.
4752960	4753960	I guess fair enough.
4753960	4754960	But you know what?
4754960	4755960	Once it does come out- Has it come out yet?
4755960	4756960	Or did it come out last Friday?
4756960	4757960	What?
4757960	4758960	The Princess and the Frog?
4758960	4760220	It's in only New York and LA.
4760220	4761720	I think it's everywhere the 11th.
4761720	4762720	Okay.
4762720	4765440	Well, when it does come out, then yeah, their marketing blitz will be just everywhere.
4765440	4767160	You won't be able to get away from it.
4767160	4773640	Anyways, Dirt 2 on PC, the very first DirectX 11 game making its way out.
4773640	4777760	Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on the DS this week.
4777760	4782040	Wreck Room, a generic party game for the Wii.
4782040	4791240	Storybook Workshop, the latest schlock from Konami coming out on the Wii.
4791240	4795440	Seven Wonders 2 on the DS for your casual game fans.
4795440	4799640	Safe Cracker, also casual game fans.
4799640	4803440	World Party Games, yet another generic party game out on the Wii.
4803440	4808320	Of course, next week we're going to have some really awesome stuff with Legend of Zelda
4808320	4809880	Spirit Tracks and Saboteur.
4809880	4814200	All right, let's travel over to Japan and see what they've got to look forward to.
4814200	4818320	And they've got on the 3rd of December, Assassin's Creed 2 gets its Japanese release.
4818320	4819320	They're from Ubisoft.
4819320	4823160	Also, Fallout 3 gets their Game of the Year edition, those coming out both in Japan on
4823160	4824160	the 3rd.
4824160	4828520	And Japan's kind of in the same place we are, where it's going to be a little bit dry through
4828520	4830240	the holiday season.
4830240	4832960	They have a different kind of release pattern than they do here, so I think you'll still
4832960	4836720	see some things, but for the most part, it's going to be pretty quiet the rest of the year.
4836720	4840520	But I will say on the PlayStation 3, they also get Assassin's Creed 2 over there and
4840520	4841840	Fallout 3 again.
4841840	4846220	They're also getting some discounts on Folklore, moving into the PlayStation 3 the best, or
4846220	4850720	as they call it there, Folk's Soul, and Ratchet and Clank's future, as well as Resistance
4850720	4851720	Fall of Man.
4851720	4854960	They're all going into the best series over in Japan, so if you live over there, you can
4854960	4856760	get a price reduction on that.
4856760	4862560	On the Nintendo Wii, this December, you can get Biohazard and Biohazard Zero.
4862560	4865160	That's of course what they call Resident Evil over there.
4865160	4868040	Those are also getting price reductions on the Wii.
4868040	4870960	Lots of price reductions is kind of the theme here, but that's a good thing going into this
4870960	4872360	holiday season.
4872360	4877080	Also in Japan on December 3rd, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, yeah, they had to wait.
4877080	4880600	So they're getting it this week, though, on December 3rd.
4880600	4884020	Sengoku Musou 3 comes out on the Wii as well.
4884020	4886080	That's from Koei Entertainment.
4886080	4889160	That is, I believe, another one of their strategy-type games.
4889160	4893640	That's one of the, I think, Romance of the Three Kingdoms ones?
4893640	4897440	Yeah, well, Koei did all of those games, and I'm pretty sure this is right in that same
4897440	4898440	vein.
4898440	4903280	You know, those games are way more popular over there than they are here, although I
4903280	4907320	will say the game certainly is not without its fans over here.
4907320	4913400	On the Nintendo DS, Cross Treasures, you can get that out there from Squeenix.
4913400	4917160	Also coming out, Kaiju Busters, and Kira...
4917160	4918160	Monsters?
4918160	4920200	Yes, Kaiju Big Brawl.
4920200	4921200	Is it really?
4921200	4922200	I think it is.
4922200	4928760	Kira Kira Rhythm Collection comes out as well, and Metal Fight Beyblade comes out from Hudson.
4928760	4929760	So check that out.
4929760	4931680	It's a big release for stuff on the DS.
4931680	4932680	There's lots and lots of games.
4932680	4936700	Signal coming out on the DS as well from D3 over in Japan.
4936700	4941200	And then lastly, going over to the PSP, seeing if there's anything to look forward to there.
4941200	4946000	Oh, LittleBigPlanet Portable gets its release in Japan this week, as well as Mobile Suit
4946000	4948960	Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.
4948960	4950600	Ooh, that sounds fun.
4950600	4954880	And also, this one might be worth importing to some people, Phantasy Star Portable 2 comes
4954880	4955880	out this week.
4955880	4956880	Ooh.
4956880	4957880	Oh, and Jamie?
4957880	4958880	What?
4958880	4961320	Tokimeki Memorial 4 on the PSP this week.
4961320	4963520	No Toki memo for me, please.
4963520	4964520	There you go.
4964520	4965520	How about you, K?
4965520	4968360	Someone in Japan, send me President Cat.
4968360	4969360	How about the UK?
4969360	4970360	Okay.
4970360	4971680	Not really a whole lot.
4971680	4975980	On the 4th, we have Colin McRae Dirt 2, like anyone cares.
4975980	4980280	We have Easy Piano for DS.
4980280	4983480	And then we have Avatar The Game.
4983480	4984480	And The Saboteur.
4984480	4989920	Oh, and Tony Hawk Ride, but who plays Tony Hawk anymore?
4989920	4992240	How is the ride doing out of curiosity?
4992240	4993240	Not good.
4993240	4994240	No?
4994240	4995240	I heard it was not.
4995240	4997040	Yeah, I heard it wasn't doing too well.
4997040	4998040	I could have called that.
4998040	4999040	Oh, wait, I did.
4999040	5000040	Yes.
5000040	5001040	Sure.
5001040	5002040	It looked like crap.
5002040	5003040	I'm sorry.
5003040	5007120	It's just like, it's a mediocre reboot to the franchise.
5007120	5011680	Just go back to what you did well in Pro Skater and just keep pumping those out.
5011680	5016320	I mean, I don't care how unrealistic it is, I want to grind on the moon or something like
5016320	5017320	that.
5017320	5018320	I mean, that would be awesome.
5018320	5022680	There was a comment from Chad, did we miss Final Fantasy 13 in the release date?
5022680	5025800	You know what, it's very possible because I believe that's releasing on a day all its
5025800	5026800	own, right?
5026800	5028320	And I was only looking at the December 3rd dates.
5028320	5029840	When is Final Fantasy 13 out in Japan?
5029840	5030840	I don't remember.
5030840	5031840	I know it's out in December.
5031840	5032840	Let me look up.
5032840	5035840	I'm looking up its release date real quick to see if I did miss it for this week.
5035840	5037680	Why don't we get into the next story?
5037680	5039680	I'll come back to that.
5039680	5040680	Okay.
5040680	5041680	Okay.
5041680	5042680	So...
5042680	5043680	December 17th.
5043680	5044680	There you go.
5044680	5046680	So we still have a couple weeks.
5046680	5048320	Weighs off.
5048320	5052640	I don't know why you play this game other than for charity, and that's what's been done
5052640	5057520	on the Desert Bus for Charity, an annual event where they play the horrible, horrible game
5057520	5064280	that's part of the Penn & Teller game, and they have raised over $100,000.
5064280	5074720	In fact, they have raised $132,568.94, which is 88% over last year's total, and this is
5074720	5082640	a marathon that's a project of the, I guess, a comedy troupe Load Ready Run, and of course
5082640	5087320	this benefits the Child's Play charity.
5087320	5088320	That's kinda cool.
5088320	5099760	And apparently 88 hours of driving booked by the pre-event donations.
5099760	5103120	But now it's not just one guy that has to do the whole thing, right?
5103120	5106160	They kinda, it's like a comedy, people do the whole thing.
5106160	5110240	I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to tune into the whole thing, although I read
5110240	5113280	about it and I thought it was cool, but you know, there's lots and lots of Child's Play
5113280	5116840	events going on, including Um Wild's coming up, you know, we had SEGA on the show a couple
5116840	5122040	weeks ago, and that's coming up, God, it's not next week, but the week after, it's coming
5122040	5125240	up around soon, but certainly try to support Child's Play wherever you can.
5125240	5128760	I know we also made a donation as a show to another drive that was going on earlier.
5128760	5135480	It wasn't for Child's Play, but for a hospital in Texas, so good stuff.
5135480	5138120	What do we do in our charity marathon?
5138120	5140240	When we have a day off that isn't-
5140240	5141760	I'm not playing that game, though, that's for sure.
5141760	5145160	No, no, we won't play that game, but we gotta do our own spin on charity marathon, find
5145160	5146160	a good charity.
5146160	5148520	We still need to do the classic game stuff.
5148520	5150800	Dan and I were talking about busting out the Master System today.
5150800	5154340	That's what I'm saying, we need to do our classic game marathon for charity, where we
5154340	5156520	let like, donators pick the games or something.
5156520	5163880	Well, here's what I think we should do for that, is I pick like, six or seven of my systems
5163880	5170640	that'll be easy to shift out or whatever, and then put up a list of like, twelve games
5170640	5171800	each.
5171800	5177800	So someone can say, you know, spin a wheel, you get like a twister wheel, okay, you get
5177800	5183120	this system, and then spin a wheel again for the number on the list, and then oh, you get
5183120	5188800	this game, you know, make it all completely random, and go, new game, move, next seat,
5188800	5189800	move down.
5189800	5191560	You know, so you kind of like musical chairs, but with games.
5191560	5197000	Well, like, you know, the Mad Hatter, new cup, move down, new game, move down.
5197000	5200440	Sadly, you know, usually what would be a great weekend for me is Martin Luther King weekend,
5200440	5202240	because I have a holiday there, I don't know if you guys do.
5202240	5203240	I do.
5203240	5207000	I mean, Jamie works for a bank, so she has everything off, but sadly, I'm going to Seattle
5207000	5208000	that weekend.
5208000	5209000	I have Arbor Day off.
5209000	5210000	No, I don't.
5210000	5211000	Arbor Day?
5211000	5212000	I'm kidding.
5212000	5216200	So you can go out and plant a tree, like John Denver told us to, I mean, is that what you're
5216200	5217200	doing?
5217200	5219200	Well, John Denver also, you know, flew a plane.
5219200	5222080	Said he was leaving on a jet plane, and he did.
5222080	5223080	That was so awful.
5223080	5226280	I mean, I love it, but it was really awful.
5226280	5230640	It was definitely, like, when they say tragic irony, I think that's exactly what they meant.
5230640	5235680	It wasn't really a jet plane, it was a little prop plane, wasn't it?
5235680	5236680	Whatever.
5236680	5239760	If he had been leaving on a jet plane, he probably wouldn't have crashed.
5239760	5240760	Alright, let's move on.
5240760	5242880	Now we're making John Denver jokes.
5242880	5243880	I don't know.
5243880	5244880	You started it.
5244880	5245880	Uh-uh.
5245880	5246880	You're, you're, whatever.
5246880	5250280	Alright, hey, every week here on the show, we like to do a little segment here pretty
5250280	5251280	regularly.
5251280	5252520	We've done it for, gosh, over a year now.
5252520	5255560	It used to be, like, the website of the week, then it turned into, like, the Dark Soccer's
5255560	5258360	Advice column, and now it's the classic game of the week.
5258360	5260200	I kind of miss doing the website of the week, though.
5260200	5262320	I do kind of miss it, too, but this is really, this is way more fun.
5262320	5266280	Well, if I was going to do another one, though, I'd do Weebles again, can make that a third
5266280	5267280	time.
5267280	5270080	I'm sorry, I love Weebles.
5270080	5273920	So moving on, it's now the classic video game of the week, where Dark Sakura digs through
5273920	5277720	the classic game archive she was previously speaking of, and picks out a game that she
5277720	5279720	says, you know what?
5279720	5281160	The kids need to play this game.
5281160	5284460	They need to respect their elders, and they need to dust off their NESs, or whatever it
5284460	5286800	happens to be, and go play this game.
5286800	5290000	So Dark Sakura, what is the game that, uh, is the classic game of the week?
5290000	5292780	A game that pisses me off sometimes.
5292780	5295880	Little Nemo Dream Master.
5295880	5297440	It's a cute game, but it pisses me off.
5297440	5298440	Why does it piss you off?
5298440	5300040	It's kind of hard.
5300040	5301040	I mean, kind of hard.
5301040	5304640	I mean, it's got some levels that are easy, it's just you have to be kind of tricky and
5304640	5305640	know your way around.
5305640	5312560	But, the music, though, I have to say, um, was actually composed by, um, Junko Tomie,
5312560	5314640	who was in the game as Gonzo.
5314640	5325800	I always laughed at that, now I know her name, but play a little bit of the music.
5325800	5326800	Isn't that good music?
5326800	5328800	Yeah, but it's very Capcom.
5328800	5336560	One thing about Junko Tomie is that she also did the music in Bionic Commando, and, um,
5336560	5345600	in uh, Strider, actually, so, uh, those are two notable games that had fantastic music.
5345600	5348840	Oh, and, uh, Gunsmoke.
5348840	5359800	But um, back to Little Nemo, in Japan it was called Pajama Hero Nemo, which is pretty cute.
5359800	5365480	It's actually based off of the Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland, the animated movie,
5365480	5371880	actually, that came out based off of the comic strip from the early, I believe the original
5371880	5375700	comic strip came out in, I want to say, the 1920s?
5375700	5379760	I've seen, actually, an original compilation of the Little Nemo books.
5379760	5386560	Okay, no, sorry, I take that back, 1905 was when the, um, the comic series first started
5386560	5392640	in 1905, and then went on through, um, 1914.
5392640	5395680	The books that I saw were published in the 1920s.
5395680	5399520	Anyway, that's another thing, because you know me and book publishing, I'm all into
5399520	5400520	that.
5400520	5409000	So, going back to this, um, it's about a little boy who, um, goes into his magical dream world
5409000	5416760	called Slumberland, and he can, um, actually, uh, ride little animals, and he, what you
5416760	5421920	do is you actually, uh, feed them candy, and then they will, uh, let you ride them.
5421920	5426520	Like, you actually not necessarily ride them, but you sort of become them a little bit,
5426520	5430880	like, you wear them like a, like Mario's, um, Tanooki suit.
5430880	5432920	That's a good, a good description.
5432920	5437600	I have to be honest, Jamie, I, I remember hearing about this game when I was a kid,
5437600	5440200	like, I think I saw the commercials, but I never played it.
5440200	5443640	So now that I'm kind of watching the video here that the music's coming off of, you know,
5443640	5447120	it's kind of interesting, like, it definitely has that whole, like, the different suits
5447120	5449160	of Mario, but it's different.
5449160	5452360	Like, I can't explain it, you just kind of have to play it yourself, I guess, or check
5452360	5453360	out one of the videos of it.
5453360	5456680	Like, you know, right now he's kind of riding a dinosaur, which kind of reminds me of something
5456680	5457680	in Adventure Island.
5457680	5460600	I love, I love the dinosaur, but see, now you, for certain abilities that you get with
5460600	5466280	some suits or some animals, you lose other, like, for example, you see, he could, like,
5466280	5470760	for example, the frog or, I think it's either a frog or a dragon or something, but he can
5470760	5479920	do, like, a belly sla-, uh, like a belly splash move, and land on them, and, um, and he, if
5479920	5484640	his belly lands on the creatures, then he can actually knock them out of the sky, you
5484640	5487840	know, to damage, um, I think that's the creature on the thing.
5487840	5490360	Yeah, it looks like a little, like, kind of gecko-looking thing.
5490360	5492840	Yeah, but he can, he can pop them.
5492840	5498080	Um, but, like, you can get a mole and you can dig or you can get a gorilla and punch
5498080	5499840	them, or climb up the walls.
5499840	5504800	The purple little lizard thing, I think it's like a, a salamander or something, but it
5504800	5509080	can walk up walls, you know, like a lizard can.
5509080	5515360	Um, but it is a side-scrolling, um, you know, it's an NES title, it's, you know, really
5515360	5517760	cute, it actually has some pretty big levels.
5517760	5523560	The whole way that you get through it is you actually find these keys, and, um, the keys
5523560	5528120	unlock a certain number of locks on the door, and so, of course, if you get to the end of
5528120	5531360	the level and you don't have all the keys, you have to go back through the level and
5531360	5532360	find the keys.
5532360	5533360	Oh, good lord.
5533360	5538760	And, and, as you were watching some of this, they actually are hidden, like, you had to
5538760	5543280	actually, in the first level, if you get the mole, you actually have to go all the way
5543280	5548720	over as far as you can through the dirt to the left and then go down through the floor
5548720	5555720	to where two, uh, little blocks of, uh, of, uh, area that you can dig through to get underneath
5555720	5560840	to another place where you get the key and a one-up and some other crap.
5560840	5571960	Um, so, uh, you have to have the right animals to get to some places, but if you don't really
5571960	5578880	have, you know, everything, and on top of that, um, your animals have different life
5578880	5584120	bars than Nemo does, so sometimes you have to, you know, really be judicious with what
5584120	5585960	you have to make it through.
5585960	5592000	So actually, it's, I'd have to say it's one of the harder NES games there are, and it's
5592000	5593540	a cute game.
5593540	5596480	You know what this game kind of reminds me of, just kind of looking at it, again, you
5596480	5599480	know, I, I missed this game, maybe I need to go back and play this, it's my classic
5599480	5602760	game of the week, it reminds me, and again, it's probably because they're both Capcom,
5602760	5606680	but the skeleton of the game and the programming looks very similar to DuckTales to me.
5606680	5608300	Oh yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
5608300	5613440	Just the graphics and the way it's kind of laid out looks like, you know, same engine,
5613440	5615720	quote unquote, if you want to say, as DuckTales.
5615720	5621960	Yeah, I would, I would, I would go that, but, um, in, again, like you said, it was released
5621960	5627400	by Capcom, the year that it came out was in 1990, so I was actually just starting high
5627400	5628400	school.
5628400	5629400	Yeah, I know.
5629400	5632400	Actually, no, no, I was in eighth grade.
5632400	5634880	Yeah, no, you would graduate eighth grade.
5634880	5644200	And I remember having a fit over this game, I had it, um, when it came out, and I would
5644200	5648760	just, I don't think, I think this is actually one game to this day I haven't beaten.
5648760	5653480	So that's an indication, and I've beaten a lot of games.
5653480	5656760	Once again, Jamie, a very popular pick in our chat room, at least those that have played
5656760	5659480	it, but a lot of folks agreeing with you on the difficulty that it was a bitch.
5659480	5665840	I agree with, um, Ricky Go Mac that, um, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES,
5665840	5668040	that game was freaking difficult too.
5668040	5672920	That game pissed me off to the point that I wanted to throw it down the stairs, and
5672920	5675400	I did, and actually it lived through it, and I could still play it.
5675400	5678360	Um, that was actually one game I had that was duct taped.
5678360	5679360	Nice.
5679360	5681760	So you'll have to do that another week.
5681760	5683240	That's a different game altogether.
5683240	5685600	No, that game is not going to make it on my list.
5685600	5690600	That game is not going to make it on my list, because to this day, I'm still angry.
5690600	5694120	Angry, Rob, angry.
5694120	5698680	I'm thinking one day we need to do the anti-classic game of the week, the game that Dark Saga
5698680	5700680	says, do not play this game, it's terrible.
5700680	5704960	I could tell you what that is right now, I'll go ahead and mention it right now.
5704960	5706520	I guess we're done with Little Nemo then?
5706520	5707520	Yeah.
5707520	5709680	Okay, Little Nemo, the Dream Master, your classic game of the week on the NES, there
5709680	5710680	you go.
5710680	5715480	There's a game that is so bad that Dan and I rented it from Blockbuster, because we were
5715480	5718440	really into renting games every week, this was about right before the Dreamcast came
5718440	5719440	out.
5719440	5721480	So, around 98, 99.
5721480	5727400	Um, we rented, we were also into wrestling games at the time, because, um, the, uh, Wrestle
5727400	5732240	Mania 2000 came out on the Nintendo 64, which was rad.
5732240	5742640	We, um, got, uh, NW Thunder, and, um, we got it home, we played it for about 10 minutes
5742640	5747640	and called Blockbuster and said, we just rented this game about, uh, 30 minutes ago, because
5747640	5752560	you know we had to drive back, um, we think, we want, we want our money back, or can we
5752560	5755300	rent it, can we change it out for something else?
5755300	5758560	And we went in there, and the guy's like, oh yeah, I remember you, if it's that bad,
5758560	5759660	then yeah, we'll change it out.
5759660	5764040	It was so bad that Blockbuster let us change out our rental.
5764040	5766040	And that's, well, that's just good customer service, you know, too.
5766040	5767040	But, but it was, it was-
5767040	5768480	They probably, probably wasn't the first time they clapped.
5768480	5771760	I kept Spice World longer than that game, Rob.
5771760	5772760	I loved Spice World.
5772760	5773880	And yes, I rented Spice World.
5773880	5775680	There was some lulzy moments in Spice World.
5775680	5778360	You just make baby Spice do backflips over and over, it's really funny.
5778360	5789080	I've bought games that are arguably bad games, and I liked them better than, than that game.
5789080	5791360	That's probably the worst game I've ever rented.
5791360	5794600	I would say the worst video game experience I've ever had, since now we've started this
5794600	5798800	new topic, and Loki, I'm coming to you next, the worst video game experience I've probably
5798800	5804960	ever had was when I got, um, Tetris Plus on the Playstation 1.
5804960	5810280	What a colossal let down that game was, because Tetris was so huge at the time, you know,
5810280	5813320	especially on the NES, and I think everybody very fondly remembers that game, and it's
5813320	5814840	been done very well on many platforms.
5814840	5817500	The DS has an awesome version of Tetris.
5817500	5821600	Even Tengen Tetris is pretty good and kind of reminiscent of the arcade version, but
5821600	5825560	I'll tell you what, Tetris Plus, which was by, and I remember to this day, Jellico, did
5825560	5829200	it on the Playstation 1, and it is horrific.
5829200	5832600	It is bad, it is terrible, because they changed the game mechanic of Tetris.
5832600	5835960	It was one of those things where I spent, like, I bought it, because I was like, oh,
5835960	5837840	it's Tetris, how can it be bad?
5837840	5838840	I hated it.
5838840	5842420	I played it once, and I said, how can you fuck with the main game mechanic of Tetris?
5842420	5845440	Because what they did, is they changed it so it was like a little professor that would
5845440	5847720	walk along the top, and you didn't want him to hit the side.
5847720	5848720	I remember that!
5848720	5850720	Oh my god, that was awful!
5850720	5851720	Yes.
5851720	5852720	It was a terrible, terrible game.
5852720	5854720	That was hideous!
5854720	5855840	Yes.
5855840	5856840	Thank you.
5856840	5857840	I'm not alone.
5857840	5858840	You know what?
5858840	5859840	That deserves, um...
5859840	5862960	Yeah, I need to, I need to fire up the Price is Right losing horn.
5862960	5863960	Alright.
5863960	5865960	Or a Dalek.
5865960	5868720	Yeah, that game is an enemy of the Daleks.
5868720	5872400	Loki, traumatically bad video game experience, anything you can remember?
5872400	5873400	Not really.
5873400	5874400	Um...
5874400	5875400	No.
5875400	5878160	There's not really anything horribly bad that I played.
5878160	5883400	I always used to find some sort of good out of it, I guess.
5883400	5886080	Well, aren't you just like the Mother Teresa of video games?
5886080	5887080	I don't know.
5887080	5891920	Um, there was a game, though it's not that old, that I bought and then sold back like
5891920	5896680	within a day, and that would be Bullet Witch, because that game is awful.
5896680	5897680	I have another bad game.
5897680	5899720	Okay, one more, and then we're gonna go to break.
5899720	5902080	Dragon Ball GT Final Battle, actually.
5902080	5904400	What was so terrible about that?
5904400	5905400	Everything.
5905400	5909920	Um, I was, okay, keep in mind, it was like the first Dragon Ball game that came out in
5909920	5915840	the US, unless you want to count, um, what the Dragon Ball RPG that they made into something
5915840	5922920	else over here, which doesn't count, um, it was, it had the awful, awful American voice
5922920	5926320	acting, and it was just hideous.
5926320	5931240	But the one problem with that game is that I didn't realize it until a little bit later,
5931240	5935280	that because it was out of print, and they only made a few copies, that that game was
5935280	5937640	going for bucks on eBay, and you know what I did?
5937640	5940240	I traded it for Blue Stinger.
5940240	5943840	The Japanese version, because I had the Japanese Dreamcast at the time.
5943840	5946920	And honestly, to this day, I still never regret it.
5946920	5947920	Never regret it.
5947920	5950000	I mean, it would have been nice to have gotten some money out of it, but I still don't regret
5950000	5951000	the trade.
5951000	5954360	I loved Blue Stinger.
5954360	5956520	Isn't that Twinbee or something?
5956520	5958720	No, Stinger was Twinbee.
5958720	5964360	Blue Stinger was the game that came out, the Japanese version of that one was sort of lauded
5964360	5971960	because it had, um, a movie director directing the cameras and cinematics in the movie, not
5971960	5975800	in the movie, in the game, but when it came out over here, they butchered the camera.
5975800	5979280	Because people were like, oh, you can't control it, and I did just fine.
5979280	5983200	It was a little kind of survival horror type of game, but it was a lot of fun.
5983200	5984200	I loved it.
5984200	5985200	All right.
5985200	5986200	Well, we're going to take a break, guys.
5986200	5990400	We're going to rest our voices here a minute and, you know, refill our waters and run to
5990400	5993520	the restroom and all that good stuff, but when we come back on Orange Lounge Radio,
5993520	5996040	we're going to get into Part B. We've got plenty more news for you guys tonight, a lot
5996040	6000000	of rapid-fire news, including some updates on Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2, and so
6000000	6001000	forth.
6001000	6002000	And then we're going to get into some other stories.
6002000	6006920	We're going to talk Tron in Part B. I know, so definitely stay tuned for that.
6006920	6010600	Does that mean when we start Part B, I can just go greetings programs?
6010600	6013080	If you really want to, and at the end, you can say end of line.
6013080	6016960	In fact, at the very end of tonight's show, I want you to say end of line.
6016960	6017960	Okay?
6017960	6018960	Can we do that?
6018960	6019960	Yeah.
6019960	6020960	Like after the credits and everything?
6020960	6021960	Yeah.
6021960	6022960	End of line.
6022960	6023960	We should do it before the credits.
6023960	6024960	All right.
6024960	6025960	Fine.
6025960	6026960	We'll do it that way.
6026960	6027960	All right.
6027960	6028960	And a proper sequel to Puzzle Quest.
6028960	6029960	Not Galactrix, but something else.
6029960	6030960	We're going to talk all that in Part B.
6030960	6031960	So stay tuned, guys.
6031960	6040640	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6040640	6042880	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6042880	6047240	We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 29th of 2009.
6047240	6050880	We hope all our listeners here in America had a great Thanksgiving holiday.
6050880	6054960	And if you decided to brave the Black Friday shopping, then props to you guys.
6054960	6059760	I know our interviewer earlier tonight, he talked about going out to the old Navy to
6059760	6063480	get the copy of Lego Rock Band, so I know some of you guys went out there.
6063480	6067520	By the way, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
6067520	6070760	where there's lots of great programming all throughout the week.
6070760	6073640	Check out the buffet of great game programming they have here.
6073640	6074640	And you know what?
6074640	6078820	And I always say, if OLR you're finding the show just isn't your taste, hey, no harm done.
6078820	6083080	But there might be a show that is more your taste throughout the various independent podcasters
6083080	6085120	that broadcast over there at All Games Radio.
6085120	6086120	So check it out.
6086120	6090280	We're going to move on and get into some of the rapid fire news tonight.
6090280	6092720	And then we'll move into Twitter topics right after that, for those of you guys who asked
6092720	6094320	us questions on Twitter.
6094320	6096160	And then we got some more gaming news.
6096160	6100280	So Loki, why don't you start us off with some rapid fire news?
6100280	6104680	Red Dead Redemption, Take-Two's brand new game coming out, kind of think of Grand Theft
6104680	6110740	Auto in the Old West, is set to come out actually in April 2010.
6110740	6118040	And funny enough, on the same day as Grand Theft Auto 4 did a few years ago, April 27th,
6118040	6125000	2010 is when you can expect that game to hit PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC.
6125000	6126000	That's pretty sweet.
6126000	6127000	I'm looking to play that.
6127000	6131640	Especially since you can probably mod this game just like you can with Grand Theft Auto,
6131640	6134600	drive around in a car or something.
6134600	6141240	Uncharted 2 is getting some new download content for the price of free.
6141240	6144820	And that actually happened last Friday.
6144820	6150520	And it looks like a brand new map called The Fort.
6150520	6157800	And it's a fortress multiplayer map from a chapter of Drake's Fortune.
6157800	6159440	That's kind of neat.
6159440	6160640	Well may The Fort be with you.
6160640	6161640	Yes.
6161640	6162640	And it's free.
6162640	6165480	It can't be free.
6165480	6171440	And then finally, Valve is selling some Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead themed greeting
6171440	6173080	cards.
6173080	6175880	And those look kind of cool.
6175880	6179440	I wonder if those are actual greeting cards or if they're like e-cards or something like
6179440	6182840	that.
6182840	6186520	Actually they are real cards.
6186520	6193040	So you can actually pick those up at the Valve Software Store at store.valvesoftware.com
6193040	6194040	and check them out.
6194040	6197400	They are a little pricey.
6197400	6199600	Looks like 16 bucks.
6199600	6202200	And I'm not sure how many get in that.
6202200	6206640	But there's a lot of other neat stuff in there as well.
6206640	6209120	How many portal jokes in the Christmas cards?
6209120	6210120	None.
6210120	6211120	Really?
6211120	6212120	Zero portal jokes.
6212120	6213120	Okay.
6213120	6214120	Alright.
6214120	6216840	Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news I have for you guys.
6216840	6218680	There's a whole lot of Rock Band news going on.
6218680	6221360	There usually is because every week they try to add something new.
6221360	6225680	And this week there's more Nirvana coming to the 360 Wii and PS3.
6225680	6229580	Come As You Are, the MTV Unplugged version, which I think is kind of interesting, is coming
6229580	6234240	out for Rock Band as well as Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit, finally, all in Nirvana
6234240	6235900	Pack 2.
6235900	6237560	Also the band Night Ranger.
6237560	6239320	You can still rock in America.
6239320	6241360	Don't Tell Me You Love Me and you're going to hear it from me.
6241360	6242360	Night Ranger.
6242360	6243360	Yeah.
6243360	6244360	You're going to hear it from me.
6244360	6245360	Hey.
6245360	6249240	The member of Night Ranger was in Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent.
6249240	6250240	Wow.
6250240	6251240	Wow.
6251240	6258000	The Rock Band platform, by the way, now has over 1,000 songs, 390 different musical artists.
6258000	6264080	Apparently we have collectively downloaded over 60 million songs from the Rock Band store.
6264080	6266200	Somebody's making a shitload of money.
6266200	6269480	105 consecutive weeks of new additions to the store.
6269480	6271280	Hey, that's pretty impressive.
6271280	6274060	And they actually did some math and figured out that if you wanted to play through the
6274060	6279240	entire catalog, that would take two days, 18 hours, and 40 minutes to play through the
6279240	6281320	entire catalog, which I think I wanted to read some.
6281320	6283560	I thought I read somewhere some guy was doing for charity.
6283560	6284560	Yeah.
6284560	6286360	I saw the whole damn catalog.
6286360	6287360	Good luck to you.
6287360	6290680	Try not to fail on some of those hard songs.
6290680	6295720	Also the Rock Band Network is being announced that it will finally fully roll out in early
6295720	6296720	2010.
6296720	6299600	You might remember that this is a XNA of sorts.
6299600	6302820	I guess that's the best comparison I can make to it so that anybody could get their songs
6302820	6304920	in Rock Band through the Rock Band Network.
6304920	6306880	And apparently this is going to roll out in 2010.
6306880	6311720	So that 1,000 is going to jump up to 2,000 pretty damn quickly when this thing is released.
6311720	6312720	Very interesting.
6312720	6316800	Switching gears here a little bit, Atari is now rolling out arcade games on their web
6316800	6317800	page.
6317800	6321440	What I mean by that, if you want to go play Yars' Revenge or other great 2,600 games and
6321440	6325680	things that Atari was known for back in the day before they made Driver 3 and all this
6325680	6327920	stuff, you can head on over to Atari.com.
6327920	6328920	It's a brand new website.
6328920	6332280	Looks like it also tracks high scores and things like that.
6332280	6335960	Kind of what GameTap was doing back when they were really good.
6335960	6341480	Oh, by the way, the games you can play there on Atari, you can play Asteroids, Adventure,
6341480	6345800	Battlezone, Crystal Castles, Lunar Lander, and yes, Yars' Revenge.
6345800	6347800	There you go.
6347800	6349840	By the way, I used to love Crystal Castles.
6349840	6351640	That was the best game ever.
6351640	6352640	Good stuff.
6352640	6355280	I didn't like the Atari 2,600 version though, nearly as much as the arcade.
6355280	6356280	I know.
6356280	6357840	I think you'll like it for one thing.
6357840	6360120	We've got a trackball.
6360120	6362400	That's the way it's meant to be played.
6362400	6364600	We've got a 2,600 trackball.
6364600	6369880	Lastly, some game controller Christmas tree ornaments are available.
6369880	6373040	I guess they're making their way around the different game blogs.
6373040	6377200	You can get them, it looks like, at ponoko.com, P-O-N-O-K-O dot com.
6377200	6381280	It's $25 plus $10 for shipping or more if it's somewhere else.
6381280	6384200	You can get some various game controller themed.
6384200	6388840	It looks like there's an old school NES controller and a Wiimote, Dreamcast controller, gettin'
6388840	6392240	the love, and of course, where would you be without a DualShock controller?
6392240	6396600	All of that is there in the game controller Christmas tree for those of you that are gonna
6396600	6397600	be decorating.
6397600	6401200	DarkSakura, what do you have for us tonight?
6401200	6402200	Stuff.
6402200	6403880	Actually, I've got good stuff.
6403880	6412840	Well, kind of good stuff because there actually is a statement by Harada Katsuhiro, who is
6412840	6418200	the producer behind Tekken 6, say that there's gonna have more content on its way, download
6418200	6426480	content, but that they're not going to charge for it or they don't intend to charge for
6426480	6427480	it.
6427480	6435000	There could be, and this is a quote, strong possibility of additional download content.
6435000	6440520	But then again, they've said that before and have kind of lied.
6440520	6441520	That's true.
6441520	6442520	Didn't they say like, oh no.
6442520	6444800	We didn't put Darth Vader in the Xbox Soul Calibur.
6444800	6446760	Oh no, we didn't do that.
6446760	6447760	Guess what?
6447760	6448760	Psych.
6448760	6449760	Duh, duh, duh.
6449760	6450760	Right.
6450760	6451760	Okay.
6451760	6455680	Well also, about the games convention online, you remember that?
6455680	6457640	They're doing another.
6457640	6463520	And it will be from July 8th through 11th, 2010 at the Leibseger Messe in Germany.
6463520	6465080	I hope I pronounced that right.
6465080	6469880	I took German for two weeks, sorry.
6469880	6475720	But they got 43,000 attendees last year, so they're hoping that with another day they
6475720	6477000	can get more.
6477000	6480440	So hey, good for them.
6480440	6485360	And lastly, and this is something I'm pretty happy about, Bayonetta demo.
6485360	6490040	We should be getting it in Europe and North America on December 3rd.
6490040	6493960	And that will be freaking fantastic.
6493960	6497280	Little Birdie told me you can get it early if you know where to look.
6497280	6498280	Really?
6498280	6502960	I think it was through gamespot.com, if you're like a member over there, you can get a code
6502960	6505360	generated, something like that, for the demo.
6505360	6508580	I haven't had a chance to check it out myself, because again, I got a BORT 360 that I've
6508580	6509580	been too lazy to replace.
6509580	6515320	See, this, folks, is why you need to create a Japanese region account, so that you can
6515320	6521840	download these region-free demos to your, you know, 360 or Playstation 3 way early.
6521840	6525520	I have one for every region on the Playstation 3, and I have one for Japanese in the US and
6525520	6527400	my 360.
6527400	6528400	Just putting it out there.
6528400	6532240	Anyhow, let's move on to some Twitter topics, and some things that you guys are asking us
6532240	6533240	on the Twitter.
6533240	6535840	Of course, if you don't already have us on Twitter, you should really consider adding
6535840	6536840	us.
6536840	6541520	www.Twitter.com slash OLR, and we always take messages before every show, starting off with
6541520	6543440	Spazinator tonight.
6543440	6547640	How about a discussion of some of the better PC exclusives out there?
6547640	6550580	Must Owns, for example, Recommendations.
6550580	6554120	With me getting a PC not too long from now, I'd like to know what to get above and beyond
6554120	6555120	WoW.
6555120	6558360	Bummer, because WoW would have been the first thing I suggested it would be, but, you know,
6558360	6561800	a lot of MMOs, we haven't really seen console MMOs.
6561800	6565040	Granted, Final Fantasy XI, I know the PS3 has some in development.
6565040	6568720	This spring, there's going to be a lot of stuff in the spring, supposedly, unless it,
6568720	6570600	you know, gets delayed again.
6570600	6575760	But right now, you know, the Guild Wars, the City of Heroes, the Ion, the Champions, the
6575760	6580240	Star Trek Online, none of those are on the console, nor are they going to be on the console.
6580240	6581960	So, you know, all those types of MMOs.
6581960	6584720	Just a lot of stuff in the pipes, just not quite out yet.
6584720	6587840	Loki, anything you can think of as far as PC games, though?
6587840	6589320	As far as PC MMOs?
6589320	6593400	No, just PC games in general that are exclusive that you can't get on the console.
6593400	6599600	Command and Conquer 4, I think, is going to be exclusively on PC at first, at least.
6599600	6603360	I'm not positive on that, but I know that's coming out in the fall, and I haven't heard
6603360	6607160	about a console version yet.
6607160	6610760	X-Link suggests Civilization 4, and I give that a hell yes.
6610760	6615760	The Civilization series is outstanding, and they did do, like, kind of a dumbed-down version
6615760	6620480	of Civilization called Civ Revolution for the Xbox 360 and PS3, although I will say
6620480	6622040	Civ Revolution I liked.
6622040	6626440	It kind of reminded me of the very first Civilization game, so when I say dumbed-down, I don't mean
6626440	6627880	that in a negative way.
6627880	6630820	If you like that game, definitely Civ 4.
6630820	6635960	That's a great suggestion from X-Link in our chat room, so.
6635960	6637880	Let's move on to some other questions.
6637880	6642440	I like this one from Fernando on Twitter, and this is a good one for Loki.
6642440	6647920	Will there ever be an installment of Grand Theft Auto where you play a female, and would
6647920	6650000	it sell?
6650000	6657960	I think it would, and I hope there is, because hell, they've done it with Saints Row, where
6657960	6664320	you can play as a female character throughout that game, and it works pretty well.
6664320	6668160	You may remember before when people were putting out fake screenshots for Grand Theft Auto
6668160	6672400	4, it had a female wheeling a mace, and that looked pretty awesome.
6672400	6673720	I don't see why it couldn't happen.
6673720	6675200	Yeah, I don't see why not either.
6675200	6678720	I think it's just as long as they can work it into the story, so maybe in the next one,
6678720	6679720	who knows?
6679720	6680720	Yeah.
6680720	6682720	Or a future expansion for 4, although, or are they going to say no more?
6682720	6684880	They're not going to do any more expansions for 4.
6684880	6687560	If anything, what they're going to do now is, like, a Vice City or something like that
6687560	6691480	using the same engine, but just slightly tweaked, but they have Red Dead Redemption that they're
6691480	6695720	going to put out first and probably tweak their engine a little bit more.
6695720	6700680	If you want to see that, dude, I would say email them, but you know what I got to say?
6700680	6706200	I think Rockstar's been pretty decent about kind of an equal opportunity, if you will.
6706200	6710280	I'm sure they're about the story and the art they're trying to go for first, and if they
6710280	6714520	can work it in for a female protagonist, they will.
6714520	6723840	Moving on, let's see, looking at this one from Tigerclaw, Nathan Drake gets supersized
6723840	6726640	for Thanksgiving weekend and sends us this over.
6726640	6733640	Apparently, the Uncharted developers made Nathan Drake look fat during Thanksgiving.
6733640	6734640	That's kind of funny.
6734640	6737300	They made him gain a few pounds there.
6737300	6740200	Was that something that was actually in the game, or is that just screenshots?
6740200	6743120	No, I guess that's just something they rendered, those screenshots.
6743120	6744920	That wasn't actually in the game, or what have you.
6744920	6747120	That would be funny, like if you played it on Thanksgiving, that would happen.
6747120	6749240	That would be kind of funny, actually.
6749240	6751600	So that's pretty cool.
6751600	6754840	Yeah, it's just the screenshots there on the website.
6754840	6755840	That's kind of funny.
6755840	6758240	Sorry if we didn't read your tweets tonight, but remember, you can always email us too
6758240	6759240	at mailbagatorangelandtrady.com.
6759240	6763360	We'll be getting into the mailbag a little later in the show, and Tigerclaw wants to
6763360	6765500	point out it's for multiplayer.
6765500	6766500	So that's kind of funny.
6766500	6767500	I like that.
6767500	6768500	That's awesome.
6768500	6769500	Yeah, that's cute.
6769500	6770720	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.
6770720	6772200	Loki, back to you.
6772200	6773200	Yes.
6773200	6782680	So, Obama and apparently the LittleBigPlanet team are teaming up for kids, and the White
6782680	6786240	House, they basically announced that they're going to have a program to improve science
6786240	6791040	and math education with a variety of different entertainment software association-backed
6791040	6799440	initiatives, including a program to put LittleBigPlanet in libraries, as well as $300,000 in game design
6799440	6800440	challenges.
6800440	6801440	So that's kind of cool.
6801440	6807120	And, I mean, hell, LittleBigPlanet, very flexible with what you can do with it, and it's supposedly
6807120	6808280	pretty easy to learn.
6808280	6812000	I still haven't actually sat down to try and make a level, even though I really wanted
6812000	6813000	to.
6813000	6814000	It's fucking hard.
6814000	6816000	Like, it takes a lot of dedication.
6816000	6817120	It's just because we're older.
6817120	6818120	That's why.
6818120	6819120	Maybe.
6819120	6820120	Maybe.
6820120	6823120	But that's why, you know, I invited the gentleman on the show earlier tonight, because I know
6823120	6825480	it's not easy to have that kind of dedication.
6825480	6829520	I thought it was kind of awesome, and then, you know, to have it all take off, and so
6829520	6830520	forth.
6830520	6838720	But anyway, he said, you know, the Sony LittleBigPlanet initiative, Game Changers, is part of a $2
6838720	6845400	million 2010 digital media and learning competition funded by the MacArthur Foundation, and involves
6845400	6850120	Sony donating 1,000 PlayStation 3s and copies of LittleBigPlanet to libraries and community
6850120	6851120	organizations.
6851120	6855800	Participants will strive to create levels that involve science, technology, engineering,
6855800	6860760	and math, well, engineering, health, physics, and LittleBigPlanet.
6860760	6867640	The second program is called the STEM Nation Video Game Competition, and it's a three-pronged
6867640	6874240	$300,000 contest encouraging entrants to create the best browser video games that teach the
6874240	6881880	STEM disciplines for a trio of ages 4-8, 8-12, and 12-16, and the competitions intend to
6881880	6887180	reach historically underserved populations, including girls and minority students, according
6887180	6888840	to the ESA press release.
6888840	6892320	So that's kind of neat.
6892320	6897620	Kind of interesting, and this whole, especially the whole fact that video games usually get
6897620	6898620	a bad rap.
6898620	6902200	In fact, ironically, and I swear I didn't plan this, I'm wearing my ECA shirt today,
6902200	6906200	the whole, with the controllers on it, that says, contrary to popular opinion, these do
6906200	6907200	not make me a killer.
6907200	6912080	And you know, video games get such a bad rap usually out there that, you know, games like,
6912080	6916840	you know, Manhunt 2 are going to turn us all into murderers and all this garbage.
6916840	6921600	And if I remember correctly, the unedited, unrated PC version came out, and the world
6921600	6922600	did not end.
6922600	6924160	Yeah, it really didn't.
6924160	6928200	And so, you know, it's kind of neat to see video games kind of being embraced in this
6928200	6929200	regard.
6929200	6933640	So, do you think this is something that people will actually really get into, and it could
6933640	6934720	be a successful program?
6934720	6935720	I don't see why it can't be.
6935720	6941640	I mean, hell, we had, we grew up on kind of like, um, Oregon Trail and like, Number Munchers
6941640	6942640	and shit like that.
6942640	6945200	It's just, you know, kind of an evolved version of that.
6945200	6951960	I remember we had, um, in my fourth or fifth grade class, you know, back when, you know,
6951960	6959200	they're introducing us to a thing called a mouse for, you know, a PC, um, you know, they
6959200	6962720	would, you know, have a program that kind of taught you how to use it and stuff like
6962720	6963720	that.
6963720	6967680	And that's why they wouldn't do something like this where, you know, challenge people
6967680	6971560	to kind of learn how to use computers and learn how to, you know, build stuff in video
6971560	6977840	games and whatnot, um, to kind of help promote education and, you know, their agendas with
6977840	6980840	the science and, um, math programs.
6980840	6983360	So it sounds like a good idea to me.
6983360	6987920	It's a way to, you know, reach children at a level that they're, you know, going to be
6987920	6988920	interested in.
6988920	6992200	We'll see how this program takes off.
6992200	6995240	I do like the comparison to Oregon Trail and Number Bunchers though, because who doesn't
6995240	6997200	remember that shit from when we were kids?
6997200	7000840	And I know, I realize a lot of our listeners may not have that same memory, although I
7000840	7004680	think the Oregon Trail kind of evolved.
7004680	7008160	So I think they were still using it, you know, years later, but just not the old school Apple
7008160	7009740	2e one that we were using.
7009740	7010740	But uh, you know, yeah.
7010740	7011880	Carmen Sandiego is another great example.
7011880	7014800	I think Math Blasters was one that came around a little later.
7014800	7015800	Turtle.
7015800	7016800	Uh, Logo.
7016800	7017800	Logo.
7017800	7018800	The programming language.
7018800	7019800	Yeah.
7019800	7020800	Right?
7020800	7021800	Forward 30.
7021800	7022800	Right?
7022800	7023800	90.
7023800	7026200	And you know, to draw a square and all that stuff.
7026200	7028200	Fun stuff.
7028200	7029200	Hey Jamie.
7029200	7030200	Tron.
7030200	7031200	Tron!
7031200	7032200	That's right.
7032200	7035400	If you want to see more information about Tron, you're going to have to watch the VGAs.
7035400	7036400	That's right.
7036400	7041880	The Spike Video Game Awards apparently is going to have some new Tron information here.
7041880	7044440	Uh, I guess this is not about the movie.
7044440	7045440	This is about the game.
7045440	7046840	The game based on the movie I think.
7046840	7047840	Apparently.
7047840	7048840	Yeah.
7048840	7049840	The game that's based on the new movie.
7049840	7052440	There was a little teaser that went up and it looks like the game might actually just
7052440	7053720	be called Tron.
7053720	7057880	You might remember they tried relaunching Tron a couple years ago.
7057880	7060960	There was a Tron 2.0 video game I remember that came out.
7060960	7062200	This was pretty awesome.
7062200	7065920	It was pretty cool but it was also uh, it didn't do very well at all.
7065920	7067160	Which is kind of unfortunate.
7067160	7068480	Um, but yeah.
7068480	7073760	Uh, there's movie sequels coming out called Tron Legacy and uh, apparently more information
7073760	7076040	is going to come out at the Spike Video Game Awards.
7076040	7078560	So that'll be on Saturday, December 12th.
7078560	7082160	So very, very brief teaser that's hit the internet recently.
7082160	7083280	I don't know if Jamie's seen it.
7083280	7085840	I'm trying to pull it up here in studio so she can kind of get a peek here at what it
7085840	7086840	looks like.
7086840	7090720	Uh, I don't know if it's going to play very well here.
7090720	7094120	But it just, you just see somebody, virus detected.
7094120	7095120	And remember.
7095120	7096120	Motorbikes.
7096120	7097120	Light cycles Rob.
7097120	7098120	Light cycles.
7098120	7099120	That's it.
7099120	7104580	And remember the Spike TV Video Game Awards, that's also your chance to vote for the most
7104580	7108800	anticipated game where you get to write in your own choice and perhaps President Cat.
7108800	7109800	That's right.
7109800	7112400	We did try to start something on the Facebook about trying to get in and Twitter to get
7112400	7114880	everybody to write in President Cat.
7114880	7117780	So uh, hopefully, and we do hope it makes a clip package.
7117780	7121320	That's what we're hoping for is that when they introduce who wins this award, they do
7121320	7126000	some type of clip package for all the anticipated things and we're trying to get President.
7126000	7128840	We don't think it'll win, realistically, it's not on the ballot.
7128840	7131880	But maybe it'll make the clip package and that's really all we ask.
7131880	7137640	We want it's 15 frames of fame on Spike TV.
7137640	7141580	Because who, don't you want to be the one to send that tweet over to Rina Wee and let
7141580	7145160	them know, hey, did you know your video game was on TV in America?
7145160	7146440	Still been spamming it.
7146440	7151400	All right, let's move on, Jamie, what do you got for us?
7151400	7154440	Well um, how about some stuff about another game?
7154440	7155440	Puzzle Quest.
7155440	7157440	There's a sequel.
7157440	7164400	I never played Puzzle Quest, so I couldn't really tell you anything about the sequel.
7164400	7170400	But there is a, I actually don't really know much about Puzzle Quest.
7170400	7173680	I thought you had played this before, the Puzzle Quest game.
7173680	7174680	Not at all.
7174680	7175680	Huh, okay.
7175680	7177000	I played, I played Peggle.
7177000	7181280	There was Galactrix that came out that was supposed to be some type of sequel to Puzzle
7181280	7184760	Quest, but it wasn't really because they had this whole, it was based around hexagons.
7184760	7187720	So yeah, I was looking at the screen capture going, what am I looking at?
7187720	7192400	Which immediately, basically, it's bejeweled with, it's ye olde bejeweled, basically.
7192400	7197600	But then that also isn't 100% fair because they, especially Puzzle Quest, had all these
7197600	7199120	different other elements in it.
7199120	7202520	I mean, when you first play it, you're kind of like, oh, it's bejeweled with attacks.
7202520	7206760	But then you have to get into learning the spells, which was, you know, being able to
7206760	7207780	clear a board.
7207780	7209680	You had to get into sieging the towns.
7209680	7213140	You had to get into like just all this kind of almost micromanagement that you got into
7213140	7215920	as well, but people got really into this game.
7215920	7219960	Like my roommate, who doesn't play a lot of video games, played a shit ton of Puzzle Quest.
7219960	7223000	I think when I heard about all of that, I said, yeah, I don't want to play that.
7223000	7224000	Aww.
7224000	7225000	My wife did too.
7225000	7226000	That's right, yeah.
7226000	7227000	Your wife was into this too, huh?
7227000	7228000	Well, I guess now it's...
7228000	7230520	I think I was also busy playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
7230520	7231520	Possibly.
7231520	7234720	Well, Puzzle Quest II, I guess, is now going to be a proper sequel to the game.
7234720	7240460	So I don't know exactly what type of stuff is going to be in it, but there's an early
7240460	7244200	screenshot that's leaked out there, and apparently the game is in development for the 360, it
7244200	7245200	looks like?
7245200	7246200	Yeah.
7246200	7251360	It looks like colors and some ogres and some guy with a sword.
7251360	7254120	Now it's interesting though, because there's some new icons here I haven't seen before.
7254120	7257680	Like there's these different colored skulls, although one of them says plus three, so maybe
7257680	7258880	they just changed the color.
7258880	7262640	But then there's these fists, and I don't know what that's all about.
7262640	7264560	And there's no more gold icons either, so...
7264560	7268120	Maybe it means a hand comes out of the screen and punches a player in the face.
7268120	7269920	That would be unfortunate.
7269920	7270920	Puzzle Quest is a fun game.
7270920	7271920	Galactus couldn't get into it.
7271920	7273720	It was just a whole different way of thinking.
7273720	7274720	So.
7274720	7275720	There you go.
7275720	7279160	I saw there was a Neopets one, and I just wanted to laugh.
7279160	7280920	People still play Neopets?
7280920	7281920	I know, right?
7281920	7284920	Let me rephrase.
7284920	7286920	People over 13 still play Neopets?
7286920	7288920	I know, right?
7288920	7290000	Loki.
7290000	7291920	No one plays Neopets.
7291920	7292920	It's all...
7292920	7293920	It's all Gaia!
7293920	7294920	All a hoax.
7294920	7299200	Everyone's using Gaia now.
7299200	7302400	There is a new game that sort of had a...
7302400	7306000	I don't know if it leaked out or if it was an intentional leak or whatever.
7306000	7311280	Anyways, it looked like a multiplayer version of Mercenaries, the kind of open world action
7311280	7316280	game that was once part of Pandemic.
7316280	7323680	Now it has been confirmed that the trailer for Mercs Inc., the brand new game, is actually
7323680	7324920	legit.
7324920	7332320	It's being developed now not by Pandemic since, well, they kind of closed, and EA Los Angeles
7332320	7337040	is actually going to be working on that game, and it will be a multiplayer, or at least
7337040	7343440	have multiplayer in it, and it will be kind of a sandbox game, much like the other Mercenaries
7343440	7344440	games.
7344440	7345800	No word exactly when it's going to come out.
7345800	7350960	It's still a work in progress, and even the title's just kind of a work in progress, so.
7350960	7355520	It's neat, and hopefully it does come out, because I like Mercenaries 2 a little bit.
7355520	7359960	Granted, it was an incredibly buggy game, but that's what made it kind of fun, because
7359960	7361680	it was so buggy.
7361680	7363080	You'd like to exploit those buggy games, though.
7363080	7366600	I would say as much shit as you give a game like Driver 3 here on the show, you'd love
7366600	7368280	to play that game because it was so bad.
7368280	7369600	And same with Mercenaries 2.
7369600	7376480	It's just so buggy, but it's hilarious, because you'll just be watching, and you'll feel like,
7376480	7377480	what just happened there?
7377480	7378480	You know?
7378480	7379480	I don't know.
7379480	7383400	I'm reading some comments from our chat room, chat.orangetontrader.com, and there's a little
7383400	7386760	bit of Pagle versus Puzzle Quest going on there, just a little bit.
7386760	7389040	Rama says, Puzzle Quest got on my nerves.
7389040	7390040	I sold it.
7390040	7391360	I guess the micromanaging's not for everyone.
7391360	7395720	SHJ100Matt says, I've got more non-gamers hooked on Pagle than Puzzle Quest.
7395720	7397600	Pagle for the win.
7397600	7398660	I like Pagle.
7398660	7399940	I liked Puzzle Quest, too.
7399940	7403120	Pagle is my number one I'm stuck somewhere board game.
7403120	7405380	I like Pagle, because it reminds me of Plinko.
7405380	7406380	That's why I like Pagle.
7406380	7409440	You know, that's actually the same thought that I had about it, too.
7409440	7412520	Who didn't want to play Plinko whenever you watched that on The Price is Right?
7412520	7414520	But Pagle is so fun.
7414520	7416800	Like, I'm actually working on the challenge modes.
7416800	7417800	I've beaten one of them.
7417800	7418800	Yeah?
7418800	7419800	Yeah.
7419800	7420800	The extra orange.
7420800	7421800	We've got to beat more than one.
7421800	7422800	I know.
7422800	7423800	Keep trying.
7423800	7424800	What happened to him?
7424800	7425800	After Burner Climax.
7425800	7426800	Awesome game!
7426800	7428480	Hey, guess what?
7428480	7433520	Apparently it's been rated by the OFLC and also the Korean game rating board.
7433520	7436680	The indication is that it might be coming to the PlayStation Network.
7436680	7441200	The rating was applied for by Sony, so possibly this game is actually coming out to the PSN.
7441200	7444440	But then you also have to think, well, wait a minute, because there was an OutRun game
7444440	7449000	that was out not that long ago, and it was both systems, 360 and PSN.
7449000	7451560	So don't know if this game will hit both platforms.
7451560	7453840	I would assume it would.
7453840	7456040	Exclusives are very few and far between these days.
7456040	7461720	If they're going to bring, though, if they're going to bring After Burner Climax, which
7461720	7464040	by the way, they had it at John's Incredibly Sucky Pizza.
7464040	7465040	I remember that game.
7465040	7466040	That was so fun.
7466040	7472280	But, um, I would wish that they would bring out Planet Harrier.
7472280	7476800	And by the way, for those that don't know, After Burner Climax is an arcade cabinet that's
7476800	7478560	like old school After Burner.
7478560	7479560	Except better!
7479560	7482080	Yeah, but, you know, now it was modernized, basically.
7482080	7487240	Well, yeah, it has like a full hydraulic seat in it that moves and turns and everything.
7487240	7490080	Which sadly you won't be able to install in your chair, although if you're Loki, he'll
7490080	7492120	make one out of duct tape and cardboard boxes somehow.
7492120	7493320	I will not make any chairs.
7493320	7494320	And ballpoint pens.
7494320	7496360	Because you have to use a little spring as the ballpoint pen.
7496360	7497360	Anyway.
7497360	7500000	But if they can bring this out, why can't they bring out Planet Harrier?
7500000	7501400	Why?
7501400	7502400	They hate you.
7502400	7506360	Planet Harrier, Sega!
7506360	7507360	So check for that.
7507360	7512740	That might be coming soon if the ratings boards are to believed, which they usually are.
7512740	7513740	Just so you know.
7513740	7515740	Like, are those things ever wrong?
7515740	7516740	No.
7516740	7517740	Redotainment's funny.
7517740	7518740	Why?
7518740	7519740	What?
7519740	7523240	To quote After Burner Climax, is that what happens when Maverick ejaculates?
7523240	7528600	I really should have had that losing horn sound queued up tonight because we've needed
7528600	7529800	it several times.
7529800	7536360	Anyhow, let's open up ye old mailbag at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is where you guys
7536360	7540640	can email us every week with your thoughts on the program or as we've been getting lately,
7540640	7543120	stories about your day, apparently.
7543120	7547440	So Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag and pick some of our favorite emails and read
7547440	7548440	them for you here on the show.
7548440	7550080	So Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag?
7550080	7554440	Well speaking of Redotainment, dear OLR, first of all, thank you for updating the podcast
7554440	7555440	feed.
7555440	7558840	Between these episodes, the other podcasts I listen to, the music I've recently pirated,
7558840	7562320	I haven't left entertainment to last me for the rest of the year at work.
7562320	7563800	What a whole month.
7563800	7568840	Second, can you send me the link for the article from last week about the guy marrying the
7568840	7570200	DS character?
7570200	7571840	Because I call bullshit.
7571840	7578120	A guy marrying a character from a DS game in Guam, the part about Guam alone screams
7578120	7579120	bullshit to me.
7579120	7581640	Now onto the reason I'm emailing.
7581640	7586620	Recently many of us have been sick, including Sky Dark Soccer and myself.
7586620	7589260	When you are sick at home, you need things to entertain you.
7589260	7591120	These things can include video games.
7591120	7593920	What video games do you suggest for someone who is sick at home?
7593920	7598180	This game should preferably need little input, doesn't agitate you much, and can be frequently
7598180	7606200	paused to enable you to visit the bathroom slash sick room on a frequent basis.
7606200	7609000	My suggestion is to get to ride on the Xbox Live Arcade.
7609000	7612160	Little input is required, it's entertaining without being agitating, and can be paused
7612160	7613160	at any time.
7613160	7617480	I say peggle on the iPhone because you can take it with you.
7617480	7623560	I gotta be honest, when I was home for a week with Swine Flu and all that, I wasn't really
7623560	7626180	playing video games at all.
7626180	7628120	Because I didn't want to think.
7628120	7629520	I watched movies.
7629520	7632320	That was more my time to catch up on movies and TV shows.
7632320	7637520	When I'm sick, really, I watch The Muppet Show.
7637520	7640640	The last time I had, well remember when I had the plague?
7640640	7642200	And then I thought I had Plague 2.0?
7642200	7644800	But it wasn't Plague 2.0, it was just another sinus infection?
7644800	7649640	I did nothing for three days but sit and eat burritos and watch The Muppet Show.
7649640	7652440	Because I also have this thing for Mexican food when I'm sick.
7652440	7656840	Okay, listeners, I've gotta ask her, did you see the Bohemian Rhapsody video this week?
7656840	7657840	No.
7657840	7658840	Jamie.
7658840	7660840	That's, I even reposted it on my Twitter.
7660840	7663860	You need to go onto YouTube and look up Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody.
7663860	7668200	It's an official thing that the Muppet company did this week, and it's amazing.
7668200	7670520	But, but, but, but Queen.
7670520	7672200	It's, it's, but it's the Muppets.
7672200	7673200	It's okay.
7673200	7674200	Mmm.
7674200	7675200	You like parodies.
7675200	7676200	I do.
7676200	7677200	You'll like it.
7677200	7679960	Okay, well, also I need a gift for someone who will be approximately five days old on
7679960	7681200	Christmas Day.
7681200	7682200	Diapers.
7682200	7684200	No, no, I'm serious.
7684200	7685900	I'm serious.
7685900	7688100	Buy diapers.
7688100	7690280	Buy big, big boxes of diapers.
7690280	7691880	For a five year old?
7691880	7693600	Five days old, Rob.
7693600	7694920	Oh, five days old.
7694920	7695920	Oh.
7695920	7701760	The, the baby can't see shit, except maybe read, seriously, and is gonna be eating all
7701760	7703600	the time and shitting.
7703600	7708960	Buy the present, buy, eating, shitting, crying, and that's it.
7708960	7713120	And trying to figure out what this big blur in front of its face is.
7713120	7715200	Do a favor.
7715200	7716720	Buy diapers.
7716720	7718580	Buy diapers.
7718580	7720120	For mommy.
7720120	7721120	For baby.
7721120	7724280	Because diapers are expensive and you need a lot of them.
7724280	7727160	And I only know this because I know mommies.
7727160	7729160	Buy diapers.
7729160	7731360	And butt paste, just because it's funny.
7731360	7736400	No, seriously, whenever I go, whenever I go to a baby shower, I make sure that I do like
7736400	7740480	a care basket and put butt paste in it, because I just want an excuse to buy something called
7740480	7741480	butt paste.
7741480	7745160	It makes it sound like you're, it's gonna glue it shut.
7745160	7746160	It's for diaper ash.
7746160	7747560	I know what it's for, but it's just funny.
7747560	7748560	The name is hilarious.
7748560	7749560	Butt paste.
7749560	7750560	I mean, just the way it rolls off.
7750560	7752200	Can you say it anymore on the show tonight?
7752200	7754240	Rob, give it a try.
7754240	7755240	Butt paste.
7755240	7756240	See?
7756240	7757240	Isn't that great?
7757240	7758240	Knock knock.
7758240	7759240	Who's there?
7759240	7760240	Butt.
7760240	7761240	Butt who?
7761240	7762240	Butt paste.
7762240	7763240	See, that's funny.
7763240	7764240	No, it's not funny.
7764240	7765240	It's just not, sorry.
7765240	7766240	Butt paste.
7766240	7767240	It's just hilarious.
7767240	7768240	Moving on.
7768240	7769240	Okay.
7769240	7773840	This was brought to you by, oh, sorry, Stay Care Entertainment.
7773840	7777320	This message has been brought to you by prayer, the preferred birth control method of the
7777320	7779520	state of Utah.
7779520	7780520	That's funny.
7780520	7781520	It is hilarious.
7781520	7782520	Ooh.
7782520	7784520	A long one from Spazinator.
7784520	7785520	Hi, folks.
7785520	7786520	Hi, Spazinator.
7786520	7794320	I just thought I'd send you through this email just in case I accidentally fall asleep like
7794320	7798200	I did last week, dammit, and end up not calling as a result.
7798200	7802000	I initially intended to pass the following information along to other listeners out there
7802000	7805240	who have been following my situation for the past two weeks.
7805240	7807920	I just thought I'd give a little detailed information.
7807920	7814320	Well, the Monday afternoon after OLR's episode 244 aired live two weeks ago, I placed two
7814320	7816960	phone calls to Sony's customer service number.
7816960	7819840	The initial call, as you may have suspected, didn't go well.
7819840	7824720	I had explained my situation as clearly and calmly as I could.
7824720	7830720	After bring, oh, must be being put on hold for an insanely long time, I was told that
7830720	7832340	they couldn't do anything for me.
7832340	7835700	It goes without saying that this tidbit of info did not sit well with me, and I was not
7835700	7837240	about to let it just drop.
7837240	7841280	If need be, I was prepared to be a major thorn in their sides until something was done.
7841280	7845840	A short while later, I had placed a second call to Sony and had asked to speak with a
7845840	7846840	supervisor.
7846840	7851440	The customer service rep that initially answered the call took down some basic info and connected
7851440	7855320	me with a supervisor who, if I remember correctly, was named Gerald.
7855320	7860560	Can I just intervene real quick and say, usually when you get put on hold for a long length
7860560	7863360	of time, and you would know this too, Jamie, I know you worked in a call center for a while
7863360	7865920	and I trained for one and a half for many years.
7865920	7869080	Usually it's not because they just want to sit there and not do anything while they have
7869080	7870080	you on hold.
7870080	7872240	Usually they don't know the answer or they're trying to find out.
7872240	7875640	That's usually why you're on hold for so long, not all the time, but usually.
7875640	7881120	No, well, I'll tell you, where I worked, we actually would have, and reps would be marked
7881120	7887840	down for this, that they'd have a two-minute hold time maximum, and, well, we don't do
7887840	7892000	it like that anymore, but we used to have a training queue that we would answer training
7892000	7896720	calls to our reps on the phone, or we would also take the escalated calls, you know, the
7896720	7899360	pissed off people, which I loved.
7899360	7900360	I was good at it.
7900360	7907360	But anyway, we, but we'd always go back and say, hey, you've had this person on hold for
7907360	7910560	this long, go let them know that you're still talking to somebody.
7910560	7914400	Yeah, and any call center I've been in contact with has a very similar policy.
7914400	7917160	Sony probably doesn't need one, because customer service probably isn't their top priority.
7917160	7920240	Hate to say it, but, you know, they don't need it.
7920240	7924840	Sadly, they're the only people to make the PS3, you know, customer service is not probably
7924840	7926480	their forte, although.
7926480	7933120	But in some cases, too, like when I was actually on the floor doing calls, I would actually
7933120	7937320	run and go to the source of something, which we weren't technically supposed to do, but
7937320	7940800	I knew everybody in the other department, so sometimes you may have just someone who's
7940800	7943200	in the know and knows where to go to find out what you need.
7943200	7946240	So give them the benefit of the doubt.
7946240	7947240	Right.
7947240	7949240	However, moving forward.
7949240	7952960	Again, for what seemed like the trillionth time, I explained as clearly as I could in
7952960	7956880	detail what the situation was and conveyed how upset I was that I no longer was able
7956880	7959320	to use the content that I had paid tons of money for.
7959320	7964080	I also mentioned how aggravated I was due to how previous calls went.
7964080	7967640	Ultimately, the supervisor agreed to allow me to redownload my paid content, again, as
7967640	7969240	a one-time deal.
7969240	7972280	He also made a point to mention that it would take a few days for everything to fully show
7972280	7974880	up on my download queue due to two factors.
7974880	7979560	One, I had bought a lot of stuff, and two, they had to go through it all and reauthorize
7979560	7983040	it manually as soon as the state was going to take some time.
7983040	7986360	Considering all that, I had profusely thanked the supervisor and told him that I was thankful
7986360	7987360	for this.
7987360	7992120	Ultimately, everything started showing up on my list late Tuesday night, which I started
7992120	7993120	downloading.
7993120	7995320	The first wave basically took all day to fully download.
7995320	7998720	The second wave occurred roughly at the same time the following night, and again took a
7998720	8001400	considerable amount of time, even with high-speed cable.
8001400	8005560	Needless to say, two weeks later, I now have all my content back.
8005560	8006560	That's good.
8006560	8007560	Hooray.
8007560	8008560	On...
8008560	8009560	Did you...
8009560	8010560	I was yawning, but I wanted to say hooray.
8010560	8011560	Sorry.
8011560	8012560	I wasn't yawning at the email.
8012560	8013560	I promise.
8013560	8014560	On...
8014560	8015560	Well, I...
8015560	8018680	On a semi-related note, I am still likely to use the service, however.
8018680	8022960	The whole incident and subsequent frustration I've had as a result of the initial calls
8022960	8026680	will most likely give me something to consider on a regular basis if and when I think about
8026680	8028240	using the PSN store.
8028240	8033440	I lucked out this time, but if, God forbid, next time, I may not necessarily be so lucky.
8033440	8035760	So this email was just a little on the long side.
8035760	8038700	Considering that, as of late, the mailbag has been a little light, I figured you three
8038700	8040880	wouldn't necessarily mind too much.
8040880	8043800	Thanks again for your input and help in the whole situation.
8043800	8045320	Believe me, it's greatly appreciated.
8045320	8046880	And that's from Spaznator.
8046880	8050920	Also, he typed this whole thing, I think, on the PlayStation browser.
8050920	8051920	Wow.
8051920	8052920	Or the PSP, so...
8052920	8053920	That's impressive.
8053920	8054920	So, yeah.
8054920	8055920	Very good.
8055920	8056920	Very few errors.
8056920	8057920	I'm quite proud of you.
8057920	8058920	And last email.
8058920	8063840	Um, hey olr, sorry about, oh, this is, oh, this is from the person who didn't sign it
8063840	8064840	again.
8064840	8065840	Um, okay.
8065840	8069320	Hey olr, sorry about last week, I didn't put my name on my email last week.
8069320	8074920	My screen name for my Xbox and everything is DaMoney125, but I'm gonna change it, maybe,
8074920	8076240	something Fallout related.
8076240	8077240	Okay?
8077240	8081480	Um, I had that screen name ever since 1998, so it's long overdue.
8081480	8082480	You know what?
8082480	8085480	I've had Dark Sakura since, uh, 1994.
8085480	8087480	So I take that back.
8087480	8088480	Ninety-four, no.
8088480	8089480	Late ninety-four.
8089480	8090480	So.
8090480	8091480	Yeah.
8091480	8092480	Just saying.
8092480	8097040	I've cycled through several, but, um, I landed on Sky, and, I don't know, I kind of used
8097040	8098040	that.
8098040	8100040	But I don't really, I don't even like using online names anymore.
8100040	8101040	No.
8101040	8102040	Just call me Rob, it's fine.
8102040	8105560	For me, it's a convenient login tool, so I can use it on everything.
8105560	8106560	Sure, sure.
8106560	8107560	Yeah.
8107560	8111560	Um, my graphics, uh, let me, okay, there we go.
8111560	8113960	I had that screen name since 1998, so it's long overdue.
8113960	8117120	Anyway, I was wondering if you guys will ever post another YouTube video.
8117120	8120600	My graphics card from my computer is coming soon, and I'm sure everyone will want to see
8120600	8122080	the room you guys broadcast from.
8122080	8123080	No you don't.
8123080	8124080	No you don't.
8124080	8127720	You do not want to see the disaster this room is right now.
8127720	8132140	I will say I did take a picture of the mixing board, and I took a picture of the computer
8132140	8135280	setup tonight, and put them on our picture feed, so.
8135280	8141560	I also uploaded my photos of the cardboard slash cabinet, you know, that's, uh, in the
8141560	8142560	process of, you know, work on.
8142560	8143560	Oh, sweet.
8143560	8148080	Not so much yet, because, you know, I just took a few quick pictures, and they're probably
8148080	8153760	not even, um, I don't know, I just took a few in case I ever wanted to explain how I
8153760	8154760	made it.
8154760	8157840	Oh, God, there it is, your cardboard box with buttons.
8157840	8158840	Amazing.
8158840	8159840	Sorry, Jamie.
8159840	8160840	No, it's fine.
8160840	8161840	Better in person.
8161840	8163240	Well, um, you should color it with magic marker.
8163240	8164240	I know, really.
8164240	8165800	Or a paint pen or something.
8165800	8166800	That'd be funny.
8166800	8169480	I originally wanted to just do it just in plain cardboard.
8169480	8170480	Electrical tape!
8170480	8172000	No, seriously, electrical tape.
8172000	8173840	Get that cool vinyl look to it.
8173840	8175800	Well, I have duct tape.
8175800	8178960	I was thinking of wrapping some of it in duct tape, I don't know.
8178960	8180000	Use colored duct tape.
8180000	8182040	It's gonna look very ghetto when it's done.
8182040	8184040	That's gonna be great.
8184040	8191340	Anyway, um, yeah, actually this room is ready for a complete cleanup, because, um, I have
8191340	8195040	these storage bins that have been sitting here on the floor forever, and I'm ready to
8195040	8196440	start using them.
8196440	8200920	I just, also, to let anyone know too, this is sort of related, I'm getting rid of a whole
8200920	8206560	bunch of manga, and different books, including a few, I think I'm gonna get rid of my gothic
8206560	8211920	and lolita magazines, so if anyone wants them, let me know.
8211920	8213920	We'll work something out.
8213920	8215920	Back to the email.
8215920	8221200	Um, also, when Loki's arcade cabinet works, maybe we could see Loki drunk playing Daytona
8221200	8222200	USA.
8222200	8223200	Haha, just kidding.
8223200	8226840	Well, I'm writing this from my Blackberry at Christmas party, so I better go.
8226840	8230200	But before I go, and this, by the way, halfway through the email, before I go, I hope you
8230200	8234640	guys check out Fallout 3, or even Fallout 1, I recommend that you guys play Fallout
8234640	8238680	1 first, since the third one is in first person, and I know how dark soccer gets motion sick.
8238680	8240560	Aww, thank you, that's so sweet.
8240560	8244280	Also, I think it's free to play on gamertap, on gametap.
8244280	8250920	The third one has a game of the year edition, now with all five download content packs that
8250920	8253800	I highly recommend anyone who hasn't played a Fallout game.
8253800	8258560	Actually, I've, Becky's husband has Fallout 3, and I saw him play some of it, and it looked
8258560	8259560	really cool.
8259560	8263760	I, you know, like I said, I wouldn't be able to do too much of it.
8263760	8269640	Not to mention how much of a deal it is, well I hope you guys check those out now, if you'll
8269640	8274440	excuse me, I've got gifts to open, sent from my Verizon wireless Blackberry.
8274440	8279840	Wow, we got a crack, we got regular email, a Crackberry, and a PSP all tonight, that's
8279840	8281240	pretty amazing.
8281240	8286560	Well, I'm gonna double check and see if we've got any more, just because I'm nice.
8286560	8287560	Nope.
8287560	8288560	Plank.
8288560	8292800	You can send in an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send them.
8292800	8296040	But for now, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here on the program, because you
8296040	8298200	know, sometimes things piss us off.
8298200	8301600	And so a special holiday edition of the FUs of the Week.
8301600	8307000	Oh, this is bad.
8307000	8310120	Here is justice.
8310120	8312400	Here is punishment.
8312400	8315880	Here is a fucked up.
8315880	8319200	DarkSakura, what's on your mind tonight that you want to get out of your chest?
8319200	8326240	The fact that I still need to, um, FU to me, because I still need to do the faceplate that
8326240	8327240	we were gonna autograph.
8327240	8328240	FU!
8328240	8331720	Yeah, and you know, I had it set out.
8331720	8332720	That's alright.
8332720	8333720	We'll get it.
8333720	8337320	You know, but still, I feel bad about myself because I just remembered it.
8337320	8343160	And also, um, a secondary FU to me for not actually cleaning my room today, or yesterday.
8343160	8346080	I came home very intoxicated last night.
8346080	8347080	Awesome.
8347080	8349680	My car is over at Becky's house.
8349680	8352360	She will be bringing it to me, and I will be taking her home.
8352360	8355440	So FU to me and Boddington Dale.
8355440	8358000	But bless you for doing the right thing and not driving home drunk.
8358000	8359000	That was the right thing to do.
8359000	8360000	Because I'm amazing.
8360000	8361000	Bogey.
8361000	8366060	FU to burning myself on my finger with the soldering iron, because I decided for some
8366060	8369960	reason to grab the tip of the soldering iron to move it to the side.
8369960	8370960	Not smart.
8370960	8375680	Just like that, and like, OWWW, as it sizzled.
8375680	8380920	Well, maybe I'm the only one not giving an FU to myself tonight, although it does have
8380920	8382240	to kind of do with me.
8382240	8384800	FU to my back, because I don't know what I did.
8384800	8387520	I think I might have slept on it wrong or something, but it's been like hurting me for
8387520	8393480	like a week, and it sucks, and back pain is never any fun, and it just makes me remember
8393480	8394480	that I'm getting old.
8394480	8396840	FU to getting old.
8396840	8399720	I know a lot of you people listening to this show are like, I'm 21 now.
8399720	8401440	I'm old.
8401440	8402440	FU.
8402440	8405600	Wait about 10 years, then I'll tell you.
8405600	8408640	Of course, then again, of course, a lot of my friends that are in their 40s would say
8408640	8412120	I'm being just as big of a whiner, so what can you do?
8412120	8414120	Age is just a number.
8414120	8417520	Loki, why don't you give us another story, and then just a couple more stories here.
8417520	8422360	We're going to make our way to the Skype line, where you guys can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8422360	8425680	or of course our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8425680	8429160	So we'll have that open very soon, just after a couple more stories.
8429160	8439920	Now, apparently, not to delay themselves from jumping on the bandwagon too late, Microsoft
8439920	8445240	has decided to go ahead and patent their own Xbox 360 hint system, very similar to what
8445240	8450160	we saw with the Super Guide on the Nintendo.
8450160	8451160	You may remember that.
8451160	8455320	The first game that had that was New Super Mario Brothers.
8455320	8460000	This new patent, though, it doesn't really say what they're going to do exactly, but
8460000	8469960	it's going to have some more guides and digital, kind of like brief audio commentaries or stuff
8469960	8474780	that adds portions of the screen that kind of give you hints and stuff like that.
8474780	8477920	So it's just kind of a generic system that maybe they're going to include in some games
8477920	8481680	going forward to make them more approachable for casual gamers.
8481680	8486280	Gene, have I heard this before?
8486280	8488680	I guess it's a neat idea.
8488680	8497200	We kind of gave the whole hint system crap for the Wii and stuff like that, and it really
8497200	8505480	ended up that it was so behind the scenes like stuff that really shouldn't have been
8505480	8506480	brought up.
8506480	8511920	And in other words, people were reading way too much into the trademark and the patent
8511920	8517000	documents, but to be fair, we've also only seen it implemented in one game.
8517000	8520600	We don't know what it's going to look like in the next Zelda game or some other games
8520600	8523080	that Nintendo might have in the future, just saying.
8523080	8529260	But yeah, maybe a lot of us jumped the gun, and that's what happens.
8529260	8532760	So I don't know, do you think Xbox 360 is just like, hey, Nintendo's got a good idea,
8532760	8535360	let's copy it, or do you think they're really going in a different direction with this?
8535360	8540360	I don't think they were just trying to take the same approach, not necessarily just because
8540360	8544760	Nintendo did it, but maybe had the same ideas.
8544760	8549080	To be fair, Microsoft does this sort of thing very well, where if somebody's got an idea,
8549080	8551000	they sort of take it and make it better.
8551000	8554440	Well, also they're trying to broaden themselves out.
8554440	8559200	They kind of have the opposite problem as Nintendo.
8559200	8562920	They're really trying to broaden the audience so much so that they don't really have any
8562920	8566800	core games for the core gamer, I guess.
8566800	8571080	But Microsoft has a lot of core games, but they're trying to broaden themselves out to
8571080	8573440	more of a family audience.
8573440	8578920	And you might say that the Xbox 360 is probably a little bit more daunting for someone that
8578920	8581080	hasn't played games so far to pick up and learn how to play.
8581080	8582880	Too many buttons!
8582880	8585440	That's a retarded excuse, but I've heard it.
8585440	8586880	I know, yeah.
8586880	8589560	Too many buttons, hey, you use a keyboard at work, do you?
8589560	8590560	Well, yeah.
8590560	8593040	Well, how many buttons are on there?
8593040	8594040	Yeah, I thought so.
8594040	8595040	Shut up, bitch.
8595040	8601760	All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and it has to do with Alienware computers.
8601760	8604480	Alienware computers are coming now preloaded with Steam.
8604480	8607800	Of course, those Alienware computers, those are those high-end gaming machines that they
8607800	8608800	sell.
8608800	8610040	Think like a Dell or an HP.
8610040	8612520	In fact, didn't one of these buy Alienware?
8612520	8613520	Dell.
8613520	8617280	Yeah, Dell bought Alienware a couple of years ago, so it's everything in a box, which is
8617280	8621440	perfect for the non-lokies of the world, the people that can't build their own machines.
8621440	8626160	I know we have a mixture of people that listen to this show, but Alienware is also known
8626160	8627520	for being very expensive.
8627520	8633000	Well, Alienware is now actually bundling with their all-powerful systems.
8633000	8635960	These actually, I got to admit, they're kind of cool-looking, the whole black and red thing.
8635960	8639760	I mean, if you're going to pay that much money for a system, it might as well look kind of
8639760	8640760	awesome.
8640760	8646080	So if you buy one of these all-powerful systems, they're actually shipping with Steam.
8646080	8649020	Steam comes on these systems.
8649020	8652560	Part of the reason why is because Portal is a free game that's included, which of course
8652560	8655360	was a Valve game that they did release through Steam.
8655360	8658880	I actually bought, that was the very first game I ever bought through Steam, was Portal.
8658880	8662000	So no, second game, because I bought AudioSurf 2.
8662000	8667960	But regardless, Steam is now coming in bundled with these systems, which for these box systems
8667960	8669240	is not really new news.
8669240	8672660	I know I talked about earlier, and it's funny kind of to bring this full circle because
8672660	8676660	Jamie had a story earlier about Steamworks, and I was saying, aren't those Google toolbars
8676660	8680260	and all that other crap that tries to install with the program kind of annoying?
8680260	8685080	But this, you sort of grow to expect that when you buy these computers in a box, they
8685080	8688200	come preloaded with tons of crap.
8688200	8689200	Bloatware.
8689200	8690800	Yeah, it's, what do they call that?
8690800	8691800	Bloatware.
8691800	8693300	I've never heard of that, bloatware.
8693300	8694480	That's a good term for it.
8694480	8700680	But yeah, the antivirus demo is installed, and the trial of Microsoft Office is already
8700680	8701680	on the computer.
8701680	8704880	So this honestly just seems like another logical step to me.
8704880	8708760	It is kind of a kick in the groin to the competitors, like direct to drive and so forth.
8708760	8711400	But what are you going to do?
8711400	8715320	I guess you could say the Microsoft Office has its competitors too, and they get to jump
8715320	8718400	up on some of these systems and so forth.
8718400	8723800	Going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangelaunchrater.com, Salacious Pop
8723800	8727880	says, Alienware has a build your own shopping cart, a la the Apple site, where you can build
8727880	8731200	a system for $7,000 without really trying.
8731200	8736240	Pleasurezaco says, Skyit is hella cheaper to build your own PC than to buy from Alienware.
8736240	8737240	Can they be as pretty though?
8737240	8739080	Because I gotta say, those systems are very nice looking.
8739080	8741120	You'd be surprised what you can find in cases nowadays.
8741120	8745680	Although I gotta say, the new computer we've got for the show is pretty sleek looking.
8745680	8746680	That's a nice looking little box.
8746680	8748120	And they didn't, that wasn't even trying.
8748120	8749440	I mean seriously, there's a lot of nice...
8749440	8753160	It doesn't light up pretty, but it looks nicer than the one I've got for myself.
8753160	8755840	Nowadays, it's almost hard to find a case that doesn't light up.
8755840	8767280	I mean, seriously, my computer at the time I think cost me $1,700, and I put in not entirely
8767280	8772840	top of the line stuff, but I put in stuff to overclock a dual core processor pretty
8772840	8773840	heavily.
8773840	8780640	I mean, so it's not top of the line, but it's not bottom of the line, that's for sure.
8780640	8785080	And it still runs stuff nowadays pretty well.
8785080	8789920	Without $1,700, if you're spending like $7,000, holy shit.
8789920	8792480	I mean, there's no way...
8792480	8794800	I don't know if that was an exaggeration or not.
8794800	8797300	Part of me says it probably wasn't.
8797300	8802420	You can, I mean, even if you bought all the top of the line stuff, I still don't see how
8802420	8803680	it costs that much.
8803680	8808240	I mean, I really don't, I don't know.
8808240	8810680	I'm looking at some of the other comments here.
8810680	8813800	Act Def says, the general consumer doesn't know how to build a computer and will go for
8813800	8815720	something that's already built.
8815720	8817640	That's clearly where they're making their money.
8817640	8819040	Tiger Claw says, here's the thing.
8819040	8821840	What is more important, the way the case looks or the performance of the system?
8821840	8823060	I choose the latter.
8823060	8827960	And no, in all seriousness, and for myself and not playing devil's advocate here, obviously
8827960	8830000	you're not staring at the box the whole time.
8830000	8832760	You're staring at what's on the monitor.
8832760	8836080	The box is just for impressing people at landmarks.
8836080	8837120	My computer lights up.
8837120	8838120	My power supply lights up.
8838120	8841200	Mine lights up like a bluish color, but it's nothing special.
8841200	8848200	My favorite, I think, computer that anyone ever built was the one built into a tall tackle
8848200	8851840	box, a metal, no, a tall metal toolbox.
8851840	8856640	And I got to say, maybe lesson learned here, I didn't build my own computer the last time
8856640	8861380	I bought a computer because I'm not quite as talented as Loki or whatever.
8861380	8865500	And I thought maybe I was getting a really good deal because I bought my computer for
8865500	8869960	a certain price that was kind of low to me, but now I'm learning, should have got a better
8869960	8874120	video card and some of these other things I should have considered better at the time.
8874120	8875120	Well, lesson learned.
8875120	8878680	You know, one thing I would change if I were to go back and actually make my computer again
8878680	8884960	is I would not buy another graphics card to run SLI, because I have two graphics cards
8884960	8885960	in mine.
8885960	8894240	And they're both EVGA, GTS, 8800 graphics cards with a half gig RAM in each one.
8894240	8901860	I mean, in the games that run SLI, it's awesome, but most stuff out there does not support
8901860	8902860	SLI.
8902860	8905920	So it's kind of pointless.
8905920	8910960	I did it for Crysis, but Crysis got boring really fast.
8910960	8911960	Bummer.
8911960	8912960	But it ran well.
8912960	8913960	All right.
8913960	8918600	We're going to open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is
8918600	8919600	OrangeLoungeRadio.
8919600	8923040	We're going to take your calls live here for a little bit, and then we'll start to wrap
8923040	8924040	up the show.
8924040	8926360	Meanwhile, while we wait for the calls to come in, because there's a little bit of a
8926360	8932800	delay from studio to encoding to the all-game server to you guys hearing it, let's see if
8932800	8934160	there's any last-minute stories.
8934160	8939480	There's a rumor that there's going to be some exclusive characters for Sonic and Sega All-Star
8939480	8945440	Racing, including for the Xbox 360 that Banjo-Kazooie might be in.
8945440	8952520	That's from some work-in-progress box shots that are appearing, I guess, on their UK site.
8952520	8956080	So that's kind of interesting.
8956080	8963680	Also there's a fun little website I was looking at earlier that you can create your own Zelda
8963680	8966640	scenes with the Zelda II text generator.
8966640	8973400	And if you go check it out, it's at ZeldaPower.com, and it's under their features, the Adventures
8973400	8975440	of Link text box toy.
8975440	8978520	You can make all sorts of weird scenes.
8978520	8981320	But it's not, you can't actually put them in the game, right?
8981320	8982320	No.
8982320	8986480	Just to make little web pages or stuff for forums and stuff like that.
8986480	8989680	So it's kind of neat.
8989680	8994400	Great, more forum macros, just what we needed.
8994400	8999440	And then also there is a rumor that apparently you're going to be able to attend some of
8999440	9003480	these gaming conferences through your Xbox 360.
9003480	9010800	One of the, I guess, new things they're talking about is, imagine an interactive online version
9010800	9017280	of E3, BlizzCon, Gamescom, Comic Con, and every other major video game convention were
9017280	9020460	made available through Xbox Live.
9020460	9024080	So it's something that is being put out there.
9024080	9030220	I guess it's coming from some guy who works in the game industry, VG Market, I guess.
9030220	9036600	They have a, looks like it's another survey, a market research survey.
9036600	9038800	And we know about those market research surveys.
9038800	9042600	They end up coming true.
9042600	9045240	There's a lot of comments there in chat about the SLI.
9045240	9048000	Danger Skew in our chat says, I agree with the SLI argument.
9048000	9053280	You should never build a computer with SLI from the beginning, only if you need more
9053280	9054280	power later.
9054280	9058040	And Tiger Claw says, you only need SLI if you have a huge-ass monitor.
9058040	9059640	It's meant to handle graphics at higher resolutions.
9059640	9063600	If you have a 19-inch widescreen monitor and only one Nvidia card, you're good to go.
9063600	9066240	Again, those comments are coming from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
9066240	9069920	Especially nowadays with the Nvidia cards are actually multi-processor anyway.
9069920	9071600	So it's like having two cards already.
9071600	9076320	So probably no need to have more than that.
9076320	9079080	Still waiting to see if any calls come in at 1877 Game OLR.
9079080	9080400	Is Skype all fucked up today?
9080400	9081960	Is that what's going on?
9081960	9084520	I had something awful linked to me, Rob.
9084520	9087160	Skype was acting weird earlier, but yeah, what's that?
9087160	9090100	A trailer for New King of Fighters movie.
9090100	9091100	And it...
9091100	9092100	Like a real movie?
9092100	9096060	Yeah, and it has Ray Park in it, and I watched some of it and I wanted to cry because I'm
9096060	9098960	like, where's Q?
9098960	9099960	Is it an American movie?
9099960	9100960	Yeah, it's American.
9100960	9101960	Or is this something that's being made overseas?
9101960	9102960	Really?
9102960	9103960	I didn't know they were making that.
9103960	9104960	I think...
9104960	9105960	Ugh, God.
9105960	9106960	You would think I would have heard about this sooner.
9106960	9108720	Why don't I send you the link?
9108720	9109720	Okay.
9109720	9111840	So we can play how awful it is on the air.
9111840	9112840	Hold on.
9112840	9113840	We're getting a call.
9113840	9114840	Hi, you're on Orangelaungeradio.
9114840	9115840	Who's this?
9115840	9116840	It's Legend of Zaku.
9116840	9117840	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
9117840	9119840	What's on your mind, buddy?
9119840	9120840	Nothing much.
9120840	9125960	Just trying to get over this whole Thanksgiving ordeal.
9125960	9126960	I know.
9126960	9127960	Go behind.
9127960	9132360	It's a bummer we all have to go back to work tomorrow, but you know, such is life.
9132360	9140440	Well, yeah, basically, I know we barely cover the DDR and Bomani scene, but I figured you
9140440	9144720	already know by now that DDRX2 has an arcade release.
9144720	9147000	Well, it's going to be released in Japan.
9147000	9148620	We'll mention it once in a while.
9148620	9154560	We don't mention every little story like we used to, but any of the big things will come
9154560	9155560	up.
9155560	9157960	There was a location test last week, and I did read something on the internet this week
9157960	9163720	that somebody out there in Japan was bringing back reports of what was in the location test,
9163720	9169840	which was a lot of your BeatMania 2DX-style artists and a lot of the Konami house originals,
9169840	9175080	which I think is DDR's biggest problem right now in cracking the mainstream is that I realize
9175080	9176560	people love their Konami originals.
9176560	9177560	I do, too.
9177560	9178680	There's a lot of talented artists.
9178680	9182320	It's never going to break into the mainstream unless they start building some good licenses.
9182320	9187440	That all depends on what licenses they end up including in the final version, but right
9187440	9193000	now, apparently, a lot of the community, from the consensus I'm hearing right now, is that
9193000	9194000	they actually...
9194000	9197280	Yeah, I'm actually hearing good consensus from them.
9197280	9202200	I'm actually hearing a lot of good things in terms of the song selection, but that's
9202200	9203200	pretty much it.
9203200	9210200	They may be skeptical as to whether or not they could execute the same version, the same
9210200	9215280	Japanese version, to America, which we already know how much of a disaster DDRX was.
9215280	9217080	Was it?
9217080	9218080	I didn't really...
9218080	9221080	I have to admit, I haven't been following DDRX closely.
9221080	9227520	Yeah, the fucked up pads and the countless number of fixes afterwards.
9227520	9232200	Even my pads, even my Dave and Buster's managed to get a DDRX cab that couldn't even last
9232200	9233200	a month.
9233200	9235720	It was not even playable.
9235720	9239400	The fact that there's not that many machines around.
9239400	9244240	The fact that they killed off our free kids made it even worse, so I pretty much consider
9244240	9247640	that a failure.
9247640	9252480	The way I see it is that I think Supernova is a baseline, because that managed to spread,
9252480	9255600	and that managed to have good coverage all around.
9255600	9260720	Just about most of the places I could think off the top of my head that had Supernova
9260720	9265800	at one point, but then when I try to do the same thing for DDRX, it's just I can.
9265800	9268960	I can only think of one place.
9268960	9273600	One place that wasn't Coney Island that no longer had the machine, but that's it.
9273600	9278120	Honestly, Zaku, I just want to play Fourth Mix Plus.
9278120	9280840	I already had that chance.
9280840	9287880	I've already played that last summer back on 8 on the break, when they basically threw
9287880	9288880	it on their machine.
9288880	9293400	Well, no, I mean, I've played it before, but I'm just saying, with all these fancy new
9293400	9297200	mixes and all that stuff going on, I miss Fourth Plus.
9297200	9299640	Fourth Plus was the bomb, that was the best mix they ever did.
9299640	9305280	On the 8th on the break, apparently they're doing, they've been throwing Fourth and Fifth
9305280	9306840	Mix around pretty recently.
9306840	9310760	I don't know if they're still doing it now, but that's what they were doing a couple of
9310760	9311760	months ago.
9311760	9315640	I'm pretty sure Milpitas Golf Land here locally, I haven't been there in a couple years, granted.
9315640	9318160	Well, maybe not that long, maybe about a year.
9318160	9322080	They still had a Fourth Mix Plus last time I was there, so props to them.
9322080	9325160	And now, of course, I've started the classic amongst the longtime listeners of the show
9325160	9328000	that are DDR nerds from the beginning.
9328000	9330960	The Fourth Mix Plus versus Fifth Mix debate.
9330960	9331960	My bad.
9331960	9333160	Fifth Mix was pretty badass, too.
9333160	9334280	Where else can you play Moonlight Shadow?
9334280	9335280	I'll give you that.
9335280	9336280	Fifth Mix was awesome.
9336280	9337280	All right.
9337280	9338280	Yeah.
9338280	9339280	All right.
9339280	9345200	Look, please, is there anything else on your mind this week besides just the DDRX2?
9345200	9349800	Basically going on what you said about Alienware, you can build yourself a PC for less than
9349800	9353680	a thousand, a really good gaming rig for less than a thousand clocks.
9353680	9359080	You just have to look hard and deep, and you've got to really consider what you prioritize,
9359080	9363280	graphics, sound, or both.
9363280	9364280	That's pretty much it.
9364280	9371280	I've managed to get mine for $1,700 and change when I built it, but it still runs pretty
9371280	9372280	good as of today.
9372280	9378760	Obviously, it can't do 60 frames per crisis, but it can play stuff like Left 4 Dead, Team
9378760	9382080	Fortress 2 pretty well.
9382080	9386080	Just the better of how much you're willing to spend on something like that.
9386080	9388760	I think that's important, too, is prioritizing.
9388760	9391200	What do you really want out of your machine?
9391200	9395800	If you buy a cheapo graphics card but buy a bit monitor, it's not going to do a lot
9395800	9396800	of good.
9396800	9397800	Right.
9397800	9403200	You've got to get at least something, at least Geforce 9 or better right now.
9403200	9407240	That should do you good for another year or two before you have to refresh.
9407240	9408800	All right.
9408800	9412520	Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, see if anybody else
9412520	9413520	is trying to call tonight.
9413520	9414520	Have a good one.
9414520	9415520	Okay, buddy?
9415520	9416520	All right.
9416520	9417520	All right.
9417520	9418520	Later, buddy.
9418520	9419520	All right.
9419520	9423440	1-877-GAME-OLR, if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9423440	9424440	Either way will do it.
9424440	9428560	I will keep the phone lines open a little bit longer to see if anyone wants to get through.
9428560	9430440	I know some people told me earlier they wanted to call in.
9430440	9432480	I'm not sure if they're going to try to get through or what.
9432480	9433680	Do we have any other last minute stories?
9433680	9434680	I sent you the link.
9434680	9435680	Oh, yes.
9435680	9436680	Oh, thank you.
9436680	9437680	I forgot about it.
9437680	9438680	Oh, and of course, we're getting another call.
9438680	9439680	We'll bring up the link for after this, though.
9439680	9440680	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9440680	9441680	Who's this?
9441680	9442680	Hey, this is XLink.
9442680	9443680	Hi, XLink.
9443680	9444680	How are you doing?
9444680	9445680	Hey, doing good.
9445680	9450960	I was playing a game recently that I'd like to talk a little bit about, if it's okay with
9450960	9451960	you.
9451960	9452960	Of course.
9452960	9453960	What's up?
9453960	9454960	I was playing a game called Gyromancer.
9454960	9458000	It was the new one from Pop Games and Square Enix.
9458000	9460240	Yes, the Marriage of Popcat Games and Square Enix.
9460240	9462760	I played the demo for this.
9462760	9464240	Have you played the full version?
9464240	9467600	I've been playing the full version, and the full version is not that much different than
9467600	9468600	the demo.
9468600	9473400	You can level up your monsters a lot more, and I've been playing just a little bit.
9473400	9475320	I haven't gone through the whole game exactly as of yet.
9475320	9477480	I've been playing during downtime for a while, so...
9477480	9478480	I imagine it takes some time.
9478480	9479480	PC or 360?
9479480	9480480	PC.
9480480	9481480	Okay.
9481480	9482480	What do you think?
9482480	9483480	What are your thoughts on it?
9483480	9484480	I like it.
9484480	9489200	I like, because I'm a big Blitz, Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz fan, and I think they're
9489200	9494280	taken more after Bejeweled Blitz, because the fact that you have to rotate the pieces
9494280	9498520	to make the lines this time around, I like it a lot more.
9498520	9502640	It's a lot more difficult than going, okay, well, I'm going to take this and switch these
9502640	9503640	two around.
9503640	9504640	It's not like two pieces.
9504640	9507940	You have to switch actually four around in a counter-clockwise position.
9507940	9511560	It's so funny you compare it to Bejeweled Blitz, because I was literally, literally
9511560	9517080	having this conversation last night with somebody about Bejeweled versus Bejeweled Twist or
9517080	9521600	Gyromancer or what have you, that for me, when I tried to play the demo for Gyromancer,
9521600	9527380	I was having such a hard time conceptualizing the twist, because I was so used to playing
9527380	9533680	Bejeweled Blitz and just regular Bejeweled 2 and so forth, that I kept wanting to swap
9533680	9537600	the gems to make lines of three, like it was very hard for me to kind of change that and
9537600	9538880	do the twist.
9538880	9542720	And then the other thing that really messes with me is that in Bejeweled Blitz or any
9542720	9548920	other version of Bejeweled, you have to make a move every turn that causes gems to disappear.
9548920	9555160	In Gyromancer, your twists do not have to cause three to line up.
9555160	9559080	People get higher scores and even penalized, you know, if it doesn't, and higher scores
9559080	9563800	if they do, but I just had such a hard time kind of getting used to that idea.
9563800	9567000	I mean, it didn't ruin the game for me, I still think it's kind of interesting, but
9567000	9571400	I just think I'm going to suck at it, because I always play Bejeweled Blitz, because I want
9571400	9575040	my E-peen to have me at the top of the leaderboard, even though that never happens.
9575040	9576040	Most definitely.
9576040	9579080	You get more points by doing that, but also at the same time, though, like if you do a
9579080	9585000	move and you don't make three, it would cause the enemy's power to grow a little bit each
9585000	9589760	time, so you want to make those lines, you want to make the ones, because you get like,
9589760	9592680	for each of your characters, you get like a certain color, so you want to make those
9592680	9600640	lines with the color that your creature represents, so that way you can use your powers and take
9600640	9601640	more.
9601640	9605960	It's cool because it had like a life, it added more of a really role-playing element
9605960	9611240	to it with the hit points, so like you do certain moves and it'll take away hit points
9611240	9616120	away from the other enemy, depending on how many was chained or what was happening, you
9616120	9617120	know.
9617120	9623360	It has a lot of the element to Puzzle Quest to it, but it's a lot of fun, though.
9623360	9624360	Good thing it fucks.
9624360	9627960	I was going to ask, did you play any Puzzle Quest previously at all?
9627960	9628960	I did.
9628960	9630680	I played the original Puzzle Quest.
9630680	9634600	Not the galaxy, because it looked a little too sci-fi, and the way the board was set
9634600	9636400	up was like, oh my god, what the hell.
9636400	9640280	Yeah, the hexagon thing was too much of a departure, I think, for some of us, which
9640280	9644680	in a way is similar to the whole thing that bugs me about the twist, but that's okay.
9644680	9649520	So how do you feel about this game compared to Puzzle Quest?
9649520	9650520	I like it.
9650520	9655320	It has a lot of the Puzzle Quest-type feel to it, but it's more story-line driven and
9655320	9659920	more, there's a little more interaction that I would say than that, so.
9659920	9665280	But like I said before, for a puzzle game, $15, it was Pop Game and Square Enix.
9665280	9667700	You can't really go too wrong with it, so I mean.
9667700	9668700	That's true.
9668700	9673960	It is a damn good price, so it's pretty cool how there's been all this puzzle game resurgence
9673960	9677440	in the past couple years, especially these very, very fleshed out type of puzzle games
9677440	9681920	between what Q Entertainment has been giving us with Luminous and so forth, and now, you
9681920	9685460	know, these RPG meets PopCap games.
9685460	9686460	It's pretty fascinating.
9686460	9689120	I just use it mostly, like I said before, as a time killer.
9689120	9693100	If I want something to fill in at 15 minutes, I usually just load it up and then play it,
9693100	9697720	you know, or maybe play like one level a day or something, so that way I don't get overkill
9697720	9698720	of it, so.
9698720	9700880	I'm surprised this game hasn't shown up on every platform.
9700880	9703040	I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it's on the iPhone.
9703040	9707120	Well, right now, I know it's for the Xbox and PC, but I don't know if they're going
9707120	9708120	to expand it over that.
9708120	9711280	I think they're trying to wait to see what happens first beforehand, so.
9711280	9712280	Right.
9712280	9713280	Very interesting.
9713280	9715280	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, XLink?
9715280	9716280	Not really.
9716280	9721920	You know, that, I mean, I got confused a good deal from Steam when it was doing the Black
9721920	9722920	Friday stuff.
9722920	9723920	Well, yeah.
9723920	9724920	What did you jump in on?
9724920	9725920	Oh.
9725920	9726920	Knights of the Old Republic.
9726920	9728680	I definitely picked that up for 250.
9728680	9730200	I heard about that.
9730200	9731200	250.
9731200	9732320	That's an amazing deal.
9732320	9734720	You know, and you've got to wonder how Steam makes money off of it.
9734720	9738360	My thought is they're selling these games at cost, and they're just getting people
9738360	9740880	to install Steam to get these hella good deals.
9740880	9744220	And maybe even, you know, kind of the idea behind the consoles, they're taking a little
9744220	9748480	bit of a loss over these games, you know, especially a game like Knights of the Old
9748480	9751880	Republic that hasn't really generated buzz, well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't put it
9751880	9752880	that way.
9752880	9753880	But, you know, it's years old.
9753880	9754880	It's years old, so.
9754880	9755880	Well, you had to think about it this way.
9755880	9759320	If something was sitting around, like, say, for example, even in the video store, a game
9759320	9761880	was sitting around, and it wasn't doing anything, and they're going, they put a price
9761880	9765400	of 250 on there, and they know it's going to hit, then they, you know, at least they're
9765400	9766400	making something out of nothing.
9766400	9768320	So, I mean, they're making money somehow.
9768320	9769320	So, I mean.
9769320	9770320	True.
9770320	9771320	True.
9771320	9772320	So, maybe it's arranged with these companies.
9772320	9773320	I don't know.
9773320	9775920	I'm holding out hope that Torchlight is in tomorrow's deals, because I really wanted
9775920	9776920	to pick that up.
9776920	9777920	So, I'm waiting to see them.
9777920	9778920	Yeah.
9778920	9779920	Well, you know, you get what you pay for.
9779920	9784440	Kind of like I kind of kicked myself in the ass for picking up Fallout 3, and then two
9784440	9787120	months down the road, they're like, oh, by the way, the Game of the Year edition, same
9787120	9788120	price.
9788120	9790360	And you get all the downloadable content to go with it.
9790360	9791360	Oh, bummer.
9791360	9797040	But I did pick up Civ IV also from Go Gamer when they're doing their Black Friday deals
9797040	9798040	for 10 bucks.
9798040	9799040	Nice.
9799040	9800040	Which was the complete edition.
9800040	9801040	So, that was very nice.
9801040	9802040	Very nice.
9802040	9803520	Compared to that of five bucks from Best Buy.
9803520	9804520	So.
9804520	9805520	All right.
9805520	9806520	Well.
9806520	9807520	We'll see you in the game.
9807520	9808520	Excellent.
9808520	9809520	We're going to let you go, so we can try and get maybe one more call in.
9809520	9810520	But have a great night, okay?
9810520	9811520	Definitely.
9811520	9812520	Thank you.
9812520	9813520	And thanks for the review on Gyromancer.
9813520	9816840	One eight seven seven Game O-L-R, or his name on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio.
9816840	9820120	I did get that video brought up here that DarkStalker was talking about earlier.
9820120	9824720	Let me look at a little bit of a clip here.
9824720	9828280	It does look like an actual, like, movie.
9828280	9830240	I just never knew they were making a movie out of King of Fighters.
9830240	9831240	Or maybe.
9831240	9833240	Is that mine?
9833240	9841120	Yeah, this definitely looks direct to video.
9841120	9842120	No?
9842120	9843120	Okay, whatever.
9843120	9858240	It'll be fun for Phantom Martial Arts movies and stuff, I'm sure.
9858240	9859240	Part of my soul cried.
9859240	9861800	Yeah, I don't know what else to say.
9861800	9862800	Hi, Orange Launch Radio.
9862800	9863800	Who's this?
9863800	9864800	Hey, hey.
9864800	9865800	It's Ronma.
9865800	9866800	Hi, hey.
9866800	9867800	What's up?
9867800	9868800	Not too much.
9868800	9872080	I'll make this brief, because, um, since you guys are talking about DDR and so forth,
9872080	9876240	funny little anecdote popped up in Anime USA that I have to share with you guys is
9876240	9877760	the funniest thing I've ever heard.
9877760	9878760	Alright.
9878760	9883760	Okay, um, I'm not sure if you guys covered this about the whole, think you guys did the
9883760	9886800	whole Konami DDR tournament that was going that they were having?
9886800	9890000	Yeah, I came up on the show, people emailed us about it, and, you know, we were kinda
9890000	9891520	giving our spin on it.
9891520	9895600	Not enough notice on it, I think, for it to be taken as seriously as they wanted it to
9895600	9896600	be.
9896600	9897600	Yeah.
9897600	9902640	But, if I'm not mistaken, I believe there was also a cutoff point for the tournament.
9902640	9904960	You had to be under a certain age to compete.
9904960	9910320	Yes, I remember that, like, so officially DDR has turned its back on me.
9910320	9911320	Yes.
9911320	9915520	Yeah, from what I understand, they're saying the cutoff date was like 31 or 32, which I
9915520	9923520	call shenanigans on, but, um, one of the people I know in the DDR fandom community, um, I
9923520	9928160	believe it was DDR.O Bill, he told me how it was crazy that they were having this, and
9928160	9932560	I ran to another friend of mine, Jim the Fly, at Anime USA.
9932560	9938040	He told me that the guy that was hosting the tournament, who more or less put the rules
9938040	9941880	together, he himself had a heart attack.
9941880	9942880	What?
9942880	9943880	Yeah.
9943880	9948840	Wait, the guy who, wait, are you, like, a heart attack, like, literally had a heart
9948840	9949840	attack?
9949840	9950840	Yeah.
9950840	9953880	Was it- That's a hardcore tournament.
9953880	9958680	Was it related to this, or was it just unfortunate timing?
9958680	9963520	It's just odd timing, because everyone's saying he was, like, 33, 34, something like that,
9963520	9964520	you know?
9964520	9965520	Oh, God.
9965520	9966520	Wow.
9966520	9967520	That's a, yeah.
9967520	9968520	Yeah, wow.
9968520	9971520	That's a little close to home.
9971520	9972520	Wow.
9972520	9973520	That's-
9973520	9974520	Karma's kind of fucked up, isn't it?
9974520	9975520	Well, yeah, hold on.
9975520	9979940	I would never, you know, even if it was, let's say, it's just, like, the worst of the worst
9979940	9984600	bottom of the barrel video game personality, like, for instance, this guy who's suing all
9984600	9989000	the companies for these ludicrous reasons, I would not wish a heart attack upon them.
9989000	9990000	I would wish-
9990000	9994120	Neither would I, but I just find this, just, odd, it's, like, he's about, you can't be
9994120	9998120	over a certain age to compete, this, this, and this, and then, boom, he has a heart attack.
9998120	9999120	I'm like, what?
9999120	10002780	Well, you know, I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence, you know, people get sick as
10002780	10003920	they get older, and-
10003920	10007320	You have to be this age to compete, because this is what, ugh!
10007320	10016600	How about you have to have a blood pressure under a certain, you know, instance.
10016600	10021080	Well, I think it's sad, and I don't want to make jokes about it, you know, and I don't
10021080	10025360	care if you all hate the fucking rules, or whatever, but I just don't think we would
10025360	10029280	ever want to wish that upon somebody, and I hope he gets better soon, but I think what
10029280	10034040	I can speak to is the tournament itself, and, you know, the rules and the tournament itself
10034040	10038760	seemed a little silly, and was just hastily thrown together, and I think that's why it
10038760	10043160	didn't get probably the type of coverage that hopefully Konami was going for.
10043160	10044280	Perhaps so, but you know what?
10044280	10049280	I think I'm gonna host my own National DDR tournament, and you can be up to whatever
10049280	10054760	age you want, if you need to bring your walker, your wheelchair, your cane to compete, that's
10054760	10055760	fine.
10055760	10058860	Hold on, though, hold on, though, because, like, you know, then I'll bring a cane and
10058860	10062400	use it to hit the arrows and, and so forth, that would be cheating.
10062400	10065880	There was the guy, though, who, uh, who, uh, played on crutches.
10065880	10066880	Freestyle's different.
10066880	10068880	And he mostly PA'd, too.
10068880	10070200	Did he?
10070200	10071200	Wow.
10071200	10072200	Yeah.
10072200	10076040	I don't, is, is playing with crutches, like, holding the bar, though?
10076040	10077040	No.
10077040	10078040	No, he had one leg.
10078040	10079040	Did he really?
10079040	10080040	Yeah.
10080040	10081040	Well, that's, I'm, we're not thinking-
10081040	10082040	There's a video up on YouTube.
10082040	10083040	We're not thinking of the same guy, then.
10083040	10084040	So.
10084040	10087840	And if it might, I think he's actually from New York.
10087840	10090440	It's been a while.
10090440	10091720	Does Ramen know him?
10091720	10092720	I don't know.
10092720	10093720	Probably not.
10093720	10094720	No, but Zaku might.
10094720	10095720	All right.
10095720	10098720	Well, Rama, we're gonna let you go and, uh, you know, be safe, us 30-year-olds.
10098720	10099720	Oh, I am.
10099720	10100720	Clearly.
10100720	10101720	I just have my Geritol Shake.
10101720	10102720	I have saved some for you.
10102720	10103720	Yeah.
10103720	10104720	Thank you.
10104720	10105720	I use Insure, but thank you.
10105720	10106720	All right.
10106720	10107720	All right now.
10107720	10108720	Bye, Rama.
10108720	10109720	All right.
10109720	10110720	Later.
10110720	10115800	Well, that, I mean, that's unfortunate, like, you know, I don't care what fucked-up tournament
10115800	10116800	he planned.
10116800	10120400	I mean, heart attacks suck, you know, that's, that's, that's, I hope he's okay, for God's
10120400	10121400	sake.
10121400	10122400	Yeah.
10122400	10124840	I hope to hell we didn't get a call like that if the poor guy passed away, but I doubt that's
10124840	10126440	the case or we would have heard more about it.
10126440	10127440	All right.
10127440	10131000	So, get well soon, guy, and, and, and plan your tournament six months in advance next
10131000	10134400	time and maybe we'll have, be able to actually, uh, save the money from the change in the
10134400	10135400	couch to go.
10135400	10137960	Anyhow, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight.
10137960	10141520	If you guys didn't get through, please, you can always feel free to leave us a, um, message
10141520	10145960	at mailbag at orangelaundry.com or, of course, the Twitter and, of course, the Facebook and
10145960	10148040	all those social networks we interact with.
10148040	10149960	We have eyes and ears everywhere.
10149960	10152560	But for now, it's about time to wrap up the show.
10152560	10155760	But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10155760	10157200	Um, I'll start tonight.
10157200	10162720	My final thought is I need Advil or something that will make my back feel better because
10162720	10163720	it sucks.
10163720	10165960	I, I have some.
10165960	10168680	I might take you up on that or just get, do it when I get home.
10168680	10171320	It's, it's not like killing me.
10171320	10173120	Otherwise I'd like be going to a doctor tomorrow.
10173120	10174120	But it's just annoying.
10174120	10175120	It's annoying.
10175120	10177400	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
10177400	10183240	My final thought is this, um, Doom with, uh, Mega Man looks kind of interesting.
10183240	10184240	What?
10184240	10187960	It's a, uh, Doom mod with, with Mega Man.
10187960	10190640	It's got, like, all the 8-bit sprites and everything.
10190640	10191640	That's fantastic.
10191640	10192640	Kind of amazing, actually.
10192640	10194560	I'm so downloading that.
10194560	10195560	Is that out?
10195560	10196560	Like, released publicly?
10196560	10204640	Um, it's, uh, it's a Deathmatch mod and, um, I'm not sure if it's out yet to download.
10204640	10213800	The official website, um, cut, looks like, uh, cutstuff.net slash blog slash question
10213800	10216240	mark p equals 1677.
10216240	10221680	That'll, uh, pull it up for you and you can check it out.
10221680	10227440	And it's, um, it's got a public alpha version right now.
10227440	10229080	Mega Man Deathmatch.
10229080	10232120	Um, DarkSakurai, your final thought tonight?
10232120	10234600	End of line.
10234600	10240200	And, uh, my final thought tonight would be, um, I, oh, no, I already said my final thought.
10240200	10241920	I was like, wait, I already said something.
10241920	10243640	I thought I was last for a reason.
10243640	10244640	Clearly, it's old age.
10244640	10251000	If you want the direct download, because that URL's kind of hard to find, it'd be cutstuff.net
10251000	10258880	slash file slash mega DM alpha dot zip, and that'll get you the, um, zip file for that.
10258880	10262640	And for the record, I used to play Gotcha Mon Doom.
10262640	10266360	You could, like, throw the, the feather and the yo-yo and everything.
10266360	10267360	That's cool.
10267360	10268360	Wow.
10268360	10270160	That takes a lot of dedication to make something like that.
10270160	10271160	It's pretty impressive.
10271160	10275720	I was, this was years ago, like, before I moved out here.
10275720	10279920	Uh, and I also need to say, as I do every week, thank you guys very much for tuning
10279920	10283200	into Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent radio and independent podcasting.
10283200	10285160	Without you guys, this would not be possible.
10285160	10289520	Remember, we don't have any fancy website, multimillion dollar magazine or game company
10289520	10290520	backing us up.
10290520	10294520	There's three of us do this because we love you and we love doing this broadcasting thing.
10294520	10298600	So all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show and how to spread the word.
10298600	10300120	And pizza would be nice too.
10300120	10301800	Order us pizza for next show.
10301800	10302800	So we'll see.
10302800	10306240	I like vegetarian, just letting you know.
10306240	10307240	We'll see if that happens.
10307240	10309640	Anyhow, we'll be here to do it all again next week.
10309640	10312000	Uh, in the meantime, I'm Rob.
10312000	10313000	She's Jamie.
10313000	10314000	He's Loki.
10314000	10315180	We're out.
