Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, April 5th, 2009, Konami prepares to juggle two scary franchises,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
most Oblivion DLC gets a price cut,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and have the release dates been leaked for highly anticipated Wii games?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that video game show dedicated to video games,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as well as the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yo, what up?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good, how are you?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I survive.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You survive?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I survive.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the souls of innocent children?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How are you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm doing fine.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Excellent.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And are you trying to Techmaster Justin.tv right now?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, because Justin.tv is getting that wonderful network error at server error,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which usually means, I just don't want to work today.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So I'm trying to load Flash Media Encoder 3 to see if that works.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now even though we're not a video show, so we don't usually show video,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but we've kind of found a good niche for Justin.tv is that when we tape live,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
because for some reason, some people can't get to all games radio

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
because it would be behind a firewall or what have you.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I don't know.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But we do this video of a particular game that we'll be playing,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and tonight's game is what, Loki?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ninja Blade.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we do that video and then we do audio of the show.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now soon, we're going to upgrade and have a little switch box,

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and then we can switch back and forth between the camera and the game,

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and that would be super.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It would be even cooler.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What would that be?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Picture in picture.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Picture in picture?

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know about that.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now you're talking money.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Switch box, like $19.99.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You'd be surprised.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not as hard as you think.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We'll see.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe for the future.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Joining us tonight, we do have a special guest.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm actually very excited because I didn't think we were going to have a special guest,

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but he just kind of showed up last minute.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Boy, I'm happy he's here.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Say hello to Casper the Gay.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who is now the doctor.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, the doctor.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I forgot.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How long ago did you change your name?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
About six months ago.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A long time ago.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, Casper the Gay doctor is here.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Basically, yeah.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It still works.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How are you doing, Casper?

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Awesome.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm really good.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm helping everyone with their medical problems.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ghost.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Excellent.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt today.

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, and a hat.

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
See, I got the Hyrule symbol and a hat.

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, look at you go.

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm nerded out today for the show.

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are all.

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll ask you real quick.

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yay or nay?

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Keep in mind, this is a Zelda fanboy right here.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Absolutely nay.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Absolutely nay.

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
What are they doing?

90
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,680
It's just a sequel to the freaking game that came out in the DS.

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
That's all it is in.

92
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,120
Just a gimmick and people think, oh my God, the whole game is going to be like that.

93
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,960
No, they're just showing you what new stuff is going to be there.

94
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Which is a disaster.

95
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
All right.

96
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Well, we'll see.

97
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,360
I still like the whole Lynx on a train.

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
That's what it should have been called.

99
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Listen to Zelda.

100
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
Lynx on a train.

101
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,400
What they should have done is every time that he, in the original game, every time that

102
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,400
he got on the boat, they would play the Lonely Island I'm on a Boat song because that would

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,840
be awesome.

104
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Because believe me when I say, Lynx effed a mermaid.

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm on a boat, you guys, in Hyrule, you guys.

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
I don't know.

107
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,280
Do you think they're going to sell a lot of copies of that?

108
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Probably.

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,160
I mean, it's a Zelda title, so I'm sure, but it'll probably be boring.

110
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,520
And if it sells a lot, then, you know, they're going to do a sequel, Spirit Tracks 2, Lynx

111
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:57,240
on a Boat.

112
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,500
That one I would actually buy.

113
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
If it had...

114
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,640
Bustin' Octorocks with Bob Boomerang.

115
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,800
If it had T-Pain as a character only, though.

116
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
Oh, hell.

117
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,920
All right.

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,080
Let's get to how we always like to start the show off with a little bit of how is your

119
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
gaming week?

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,320
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

121
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
I played stuff.

122
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Actually, I played Pet Society on Facebook, which I've become oddly addicted to.

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,920
At least it's not Neopets.

124
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,100
Fuck no.

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,800
I played some more Cookie Wama on my phone, and then I didn't actually finish what I was

126
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,680
cooking, so whatever.

127
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Mama fixed it.

128
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,960
And we ordered, we got something from Alpha eBay that arrived in perfect condition for

129
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
seven bucks.

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
The item was fine.

131
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
The box was nasty.

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,060
It had mildew and shit, but it was brand new.

133
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,320
We have a Capcom fighting stick for the Genesis.

134
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Wow.

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Why did you order that?

136
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Because we have several Genes-i.

137
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Geneses.

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
It was seven bucks, dude.

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Why not?

140
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Just impulse buy.

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
You didn't break it out to try anything with?

142
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,640
You didn't get old school championship edition or anything?

143
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Well, we already have all that.

144
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Alright, just checking.

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Alright.

146
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Oh, oh, oh.

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
And we got the FC Mobile.

148
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah, what is this all about?

149
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
The FC Mobile?

150
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
It's a handheld NES.

151
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Uh huh.

152
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
That's really all it is.

153
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
I don't know how long the battery life is.

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,120
Dan played it more than me, but we played City and Legend.

155
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,260
The thing's gotta be somewhat big if you actually put an entire cartridge into it.

156
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,240
Is it about the size of an NES cartridge, the system?

157
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,100
About the width plus another two inches, yeah.

158
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,320
So it's not the Atari, like, where it has all the games inside it in the memory.

159
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
It's like...

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
You plug in your cartridge.

161
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
It's like a Game Boy, but it plays NES games.

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
That's amazing.

163
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
That's amazing.

164
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
It's called the FC Mobile.

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
They're like 40 bucks.

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Wow, that's not bad.

167
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
And they're really light.

168
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,260
Is that because of the whole thing, like, the same reason they were selling the third

169
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,760
party NESs at E3 a few years ago, where it's something like the patent on the Nintendo

170
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,160
property expired, because it's been like 20 years?

171
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,640
Something like that, I want to say?

172
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
So would that mean that in a couple years we're going to start seeing like Super Nintendos

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
and Genesis start coming out and all these things?

174
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,640
You don't need to do a Genesis one, Rob.

175
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm just saying.

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Because of the Nomad.

177
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,840
Oh my god, Dan was hilarious, though.

178
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,720
Well, also the fact Sega repackages their games like 50 times over, but...

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,640
Dan was very hilarious about this, and if he hears it, he's going to be a little embarrassed,

180
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
but I don't care.

181
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,280
He was like, uh, I wonder if, um, if, you know, they're going to do a Super...

182
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Because it was like you were just saying, if, you know, talked about doing a handheld

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Genesis.

184
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,440
I was like, wait, wait, we have that, it's called the Nomad.

185
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,600
So I was like, yes, sweetie, pat, pat, pat.

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Question from our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, because we are the show where every gamer

187
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,560
has a voice, so be heard, join our chat live on Sunday night.

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,280
Hitstun asks, how is the hardware, is the screen good?

189
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Pretty good.

190
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Pretty good.

191
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I like it.

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
You don't have dead pixels?

193
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
No.

194
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Well, that's good.

195
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
All right.

196
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Well, let's move on then, if that's all that Dark Sakura has for her gaming week, we will

197
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
talk to Loki.

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
How was your gaming week?

199
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,360
Uh, first off, I'd like to mention, um, for our live listeners, Justin TV is up, I think.

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,800
Um, I don't know if it's working correctly, because I got a lot of errors that popped

201
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,200
up, so I didn't know if, uh, we were good or not, but it looks like we're good.

202
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Okay.

203
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,880
Um, anyways, uh, I played a little bit this week, um, more Grand Theft Auto IV, Lost

204
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,560
in Dam, because we're still doing, you know, multiplayer and that, and, you know, my boss

205
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,640
playing the modded copy is still hilarious, uh, even though he can't win still with it,

206
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,600
but, you know, watching a bus rocket by and making a whoosh sound has got me cracking

207
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
up all the time.

208
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Um, and then I played, uh, some WiiWare stuff, I actually played, um, Bit.Trip Beat, which,

209
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,640
it's okay until they thought, hey, it's a great idea, let's have, um, you know, little

210
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,760
blocks that are dark blue against a black background where you can't see them.

211
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,000
That's when I stopped playing the game, and, um, that was it.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,480
Just FYI, Chad is giving us feedback that they can't hear us on Justin.TV right now.

213
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
They're not getting audio on there.

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,720
They're getting video, but no audio.

215
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Eh, whatever.

216
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,480
You're just gonna have to run them both side by side, I don't know.

217
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
We'll figure it out.

218
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
We'll figure it out.

219
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,680
Eh, we're gonna, they don't have to do it for now.

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:31,800
Um, anyways, so, what else, let's see here, um, I also played another homebrew game that's

221
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,600
a demo for another game that I'd like not to mention on this show.

222
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Let me just say it sucks as much as you would think it sucks, and the guy who made it is

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
a douchebag, and I think we know who we're talking about here, but we are not mentioning

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,520
his name, because that would be, um, wrong.

225
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,400
And then, um, my wife started playing Excite Truck again, to, in preparation for, uh, Excite

226
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,600
Bots Trick Racing, so, uh, very excited by that, um, she is.

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
And then, what else did I play?

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,560
I think that's pretty much it.

229
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I got a lot of stuff that I was going to play, but I didn't get to play a lot of it.

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,680
Oh, I checked out that stupid, I think we talked about it last week, the Kamasutra DS

231
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
thing.

232
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
It's funny.

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
That's about it.

234
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,960
And then, um, yeah, that's it.

235
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,200
I have a Rhythm Tengoku, or, Rhythm Heaven, I guess, to try out, and then, uh, more, uh,

236
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Pagel DS, because that's fun.

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,760
Uh, it looks like I may have fixed the audio on Justin.tv, because I'm a superstar.

238
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
You did?

239
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Yes.

240
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Because it got unplugged?

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,320
Uh, yeah, I guess somehow the little grey connectors weren't the ones in the converter

242
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
box, the regular ones were.

243
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Oh.

244
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Yeah.

245
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I think we fixed it.

246
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I don't know, nobody in Justin.tv is confirming, so, I don't know, we'll find out in a minute.

247
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Wait, which one did you put in there?

248
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Go look!

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Alright.

250
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
This is terrible radio.

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,680
But we'll have you, uh, if the audio is working, we'll have you walk us through Ninja Blade

252
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
in just a minute here.

253
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,800
Uh, let me talk about my gaming week, though, which, um, you know, not too exciting.

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,120
Not a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week.

255
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,780
Just kind of revisited a lot of old stuff.

256
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,600
Like, I actually went back to the Wii myself, and went back to Wii Fat, and played that

257
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,720
for a little bit, because, you know, I wanted to see, I know I've been gaining weight since

258
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,960
I was, like, sick last year, and I wanted to see how much.

259
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
So now you weigh 20 pounds.

260
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Oh, shut up.

261
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,640
Uh, so I went back and played that for a little bit, and, uh, EO was playing some of the old

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,800
school classics on there, like, uh, Legend of the Mystical Ninja and all that stuff.

263
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Cool, cool.

264
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,720
And, um, let's see, went over to PlayStation 3, was playing a little bit more Flower, because

265
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,900
I remember there was that trophy that you get if you revisit it after not playing it

266
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,400
for a week, and it's been, like, a month.

267
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,680
So I wanted to go get that, and, uh, played some of the levels, and was showing it to

268
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,720
some friends, like, you know, look how pretty this game is, because it is a very pretty

269
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
game.

270
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,440
And went back to, uh, Home, because if there's one thing that'll always crack people up,

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,200
it's looking at the dancing in Home, because you can do the Cabbage Patch, and the Running

272
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Man, and the Robot, and that's always good for a laugh for, like, five minutes.

273
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,080
But I decided while I was there to check out some of these new areas that we'd heard about

274
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,800
at Game Developers Conference, like, they have the new, uh, Guitar Hero Backstage area,

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,760
and the Resident Evil 5 backlot, which, you know, they're cute ideas.

276
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,120
Again, I'm having a hard time seeing the big picture of Home, like, all these things they

277
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,640
really wanted to accomplish, like, I just don't see myself logging into Home as, like,

278
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,320
a back-end system, as, like, the thing I'm gonna do when I get home, I'm gonna boot up

279
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,400
my PlayStation and go right into Home, and, you know, launch everything from there, because

280
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,760
it still feels a little clunky to me.

281
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,040
And when I say clunky, I mean the download speeds of the areas as you load them.

282
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,940
You know, yes, I realize you can download in the background and all this, but I kind

283
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,920
of wish the thing was a little more intuitive.

284
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
Like, if I was gonna start walking towards a particular map, it would be cool if that

285
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,840
map would start, you know, kind of loading, and it's kind of, a little, it's profiling.

286
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,860
There's a lot of, shut up, there's a lot of polish, I think, that still needs to be done

287
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,760
in Home, but it is getting slightly better and better at the same time.

288
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,540
You know, and just slightly, but I do see improvement in Home, and I think that has

289
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,260
to be acknowledged, because it is a pretty ambitious thing.

290
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,200
So is there a download yet that, you know, gives Home a point?

291
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,480
There are still more minigames popping up, like, the Guitar Hero area has a Simon Says

292
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
style minigame.

293
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,280
It's nothing that awesome, it's, you know, free, but it's free, you know, it's, again,

294
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,900
might I remind everybody, you don't pay for Home.

295
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,000
So considering it's a free thing, it's, you know, granted, they microtransactional a lot

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,960
of these clubs and things, but I have yet to pay a dollar.

297
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,560
And if you're not in Home, you're homeless.

298
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,760
And nobody wants to be homeless.

299
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
ActDeft in chat says, Home is second life without the crazy antics.

300
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,000
GameGuru says, the big picture of Home is make money.

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see where the more nickel and diming comes in a little later,

302
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
so, I don't know.

303
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,280
All right, let's see, what else?

304
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,360
In my gaming week, really not a whole lot else that I can think of.

305
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,200
Xbox 360, just playing some of the old arcade titles, Pagle, and so forth, but not a lot

306
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
of new stuff.

307
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
I did forget one game I played.

308
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What's that?

309
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,960
Which is the game that we're playing right now.

310
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,920
But Ninja Blade, I played during the week, actually, because I haven't really gotten

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,480
a chance to play it since I got it.

312
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,080
It's fun, it's actually not too, sorry, if you heard an echo there, it's because I was

313
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,920
checking Justin.tv, where we do have audio, thank God.

314
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Yes, because you unplugged something from your splitter coming out of your computer.

315
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Whatever.

316
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,440
The way you had it hooked up there would have been fine, but they wouldn't have been able

317
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,440
to hear the music that we played during the little break.

318
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
All right.

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Whatever.

320
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Anyways, give us a quick walkthrough.

321
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,200
I know this is radio, and we'll try to keep the references to the video minimum, but kind

322
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,560
of walk us through this game a little bit.

323
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,840
You were talking about, I know, earlier, before we started, this big epic cut scene at the

324
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
beginning of Ninja Blade.

325
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,800
It's so over the top that it's hilarious.

326
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,560
The main character looks like he's the spirit, you know, Sans' crappy movie.

327
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,760
But it's actually very God of War-esque.

328
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,560
You basically kind of go through the game, you have multiple different weapons you can

329
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
choose from.

330
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
One that's a heavy weapon that's slow, one that's two blades that's fast, and then a

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,520
weapon that's just a normal katana that's kind of in between.

332
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,040
And you've got really fast moves and stuff.

333
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,720
There's a lot of these cut scenes that are interactive that they have quick time events

334
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,680
that you do, which I tend to screw up a lot, but that's all right.

335
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
The game itself is pretty fun.

336
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
So what's the flippin' point?

337
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You say it's kind of God of War-esque?

338
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Yeah, the point is you're this team of ninjas that are descending upon Japan because it's

339
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,760
being overrun by these mutant things that are basically turning people into monsters,

340
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,620
and so you're fighting off these monsters that are attacking Tokyo.

341
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,240
And it's just really over the top.

342
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,340
There's these dragon-looking creatures, like you're skydiving out of a helicopter to begin

343
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,280
with in the very beginning of the game, and you're actually cutting these dragons in half

344
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,920
and just kind of running down the side of buildings as they're collapsing.

345
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,560
Just really crazy shit.

346
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,260
So that's pretty much the game.

347
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,800
But you like these over the top, don't you?

348
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Oh yeah, it's awesome.

349
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
It's defense force.

350
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,060
I do, but it's actually, you know, a lot of the games that are put out from software and

351
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,400
stuff like that, they're not that great.

352
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,960
But this is actually pretty good, and it's been pretty entertaining so far.

353
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,440
Even like, it actually looks like it's going to start me from the beginning because apparently

354
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,120
I didn't get far enough to save.

355
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,920
But all the more, you know, exciting, because I'm going to show you that whole skydiving

356
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
part.

357
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,840
Okay, this is a little cutscene that shows what happens, and some old man sees like some

358
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,480
chick that's been infected.

359
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,120
We don't need to see that.

360
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Skip that.

361
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Alright.

362
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,640
Alright, let me go to Caspar, sorry, the doctor, and we'll ask the doctor about his gaming

363
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
week and we'll come back to you.

364
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Hopefully you're a little bit into Ninja Blade at that point, you can tell us a little bit

365
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,300
about the gameplay.

366
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,720
So, alright, the doctor, how was your gaming week?

367
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,160
It was pretty good.

368
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,640
Kind of like, there's not a lot of new stuff that I'm into at all.

369
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,720
So I just, you know, one of my friends came over and we played a party game, which, on

370
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,600
the Wii, imagine a party game.

371
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Which was actually hilarious because, you know, this was one of my straight friends

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,440
and it was Raymond Raving Rabbit's TV edition.

373
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I don't know if you guys have ever played that, but there's lots of crazy minigames.

374
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes, we have played that, or at least I watched Loki play it.

375
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,680
The best minigame has to be the dancing.

376
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,960
It's kind of like DDR, where you have to move your whole body.

377
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,640
And watching my friend get into this, like, was hilarious.

378
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,120
It was, we were like cracking up, so.

379
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,080
But I'm with you, I mean, there's not a lot of new stuff on any system that I'm like,

380
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
woo!

381
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,840
So just kind of bored with a lot of the games coming out.

382
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,280
Well, I think too, we're in that period where summer's right around the corner and I think

383
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,120
we're going to start seeing a lot more releases in the summer, especially with, you know,

384
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
E3 around the corner.

385
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,400
A lot of companies have stuff in their pockets that they're going to be showing at E3.

386
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,080
So there's not a lot to get excited about just yet, except for the fact, you know, if

387
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,440
you're a DS fan, there's the DSi that just came out this week.

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
That's really a big, big thing.

389
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,520
And you're a total Nintendo fanboy and you're very eh on the DSi.

390
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,840
It's, I mean, it's, to use a fancy word, it's, I mean, it's got the superfluous camera.

391
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,200
I mean, what does that even do?

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
That's just, that's no point to me.

393
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, it takes pictures doctor.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Ah, I have a camera and I don't need another one.

395
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Um, fair enough.

396
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,400
All right, well, so, uh, yeah, but we're watching, uh, we're also watching, uh, Loki here.

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,040
There are monsters and blood and swords and ridiculousness.

398
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,400
This looks a little like with that combo meter in the corner.

399
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm reminded of one of those like dynasty warrior kind of games.

400
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Apparently it's also twilight and you sparkle when you go into the darkness.

401
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
You sparkle!

402
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Gold glitter flies everywhere.

403
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,800
I actually have not seen the sparkly vampires.

404
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Oh, good.

405
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You're not missing a mention.

406
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah.

407
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
So are we ready for the commentary?

408
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Uh, Loki?

409
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,320
Well, I'm just, you know, basically right now they're just kind of teaching you the

410
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
basics of the game.

411
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Oh, you can do jump attacks.

412
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,120
Oh, you can do like heavy attacks and yada, yada, yada.

413
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Kill these guys.

414
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,760
So, um, but it gets ridiculous cause like you're like sensei or whatever is kind of

415
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,240
helping you out through the game and he gives you like these different weapons to use.

416
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
Meanwhile, like he's like flipping around and you know, throwing people like there's

417
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,840
a quick time event where I got to jump and I dodged that thing.

418
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,000
Well, so now it's all dragon's lair where you just press like a button and hit a button.

419
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Interesting.

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,920
There's a lot of interactive cut time or cut scenes and quick time events and lots of stuff

422
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,640
that I miss because it's hard to read them on this TV, but that's okay.

423
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Interesting.

424
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
All right.

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
Well, um, and I'm looking at a comment in chat.

426
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
For some reason, the Justin TV chat is borked tonight.

427
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
Like I'm not seeing anything in the Justin TV chat, so if you guys are trying to yell

428
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,280
at us there, don't even bother.

429
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,640
You've got to go to our main room.

430
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Uh, but I do see Misty saying woop blood.

431
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
So very, very bloody game.

432
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,420
Can I get a woop blood?

433
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,240
That game you were playing the other week on the GameCube mad world, that was way worse

434
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
on the blood.

435
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Yeah.

436
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I was, I almost brought that again, but that's all right.

437
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I like that.

438
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
I like this.

439
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,960
I like this setup for the show where we have the, uh, game that will be running during

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,000
the show and then someday we'll have the switcher.

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,280
So we'll go back to having the camera in studio when something exciting actually happens here

442
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,080
in studio, which is not that often, but slowly but surely we're starting to become orange

443
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
launch television.

444
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
This is kind of scary.

445
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,480
And the, and the interactive cut scenes, you know, that's in other games too.

446
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,840
I mean, you got that in a force unleashed.

447
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,800
I mean, which kind of makes it more epic because then you're like, you know, if they're really

448
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,740
complex battles, you can just press, you know, you have to do the certain combos.

449
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,920
So that looks cool.

450
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,160
Tiger client chat says basically OLR wants to copy FNG, which is a Friday night gaming

451
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,400
Bobby show here on all games radio.

452
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,200
No, we don't want to copy Friday night gaming.

453
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
He did.

454
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
They did their own thing.

455
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,760
They fixed stuff and on air and we don't really get into that kind of stuff.

456
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,240
And plus they have that whole gaming center thing where people like that, um, all games

457
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,320
interactive used to have back in the day where people could like walk in and out as they

458
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
want to.

459
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,480
And as soon as we taped the show at my house, that's not exactly going to be happening.

460
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,120
Although we have had perfect strangers show up here before.

461
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,800
I remember Mo, remember we, we didn't even know her before.

462
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,680
We sent her an email on YouTube and she came here and sung the show or sung the song on

463
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
the show.

464
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,000
So no, I, we, I mean, we do, you know, we've, we've done the same shit for what, seven years

465
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
now.

466
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
We're just slightly evolving a little bit as time goes on.

467
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,380
All right, let's get in the entire class as OLR could turn into a gaming center of more

468
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
guests show up.

469
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I hope not again.

470
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
This is my house.

471
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,360
It's like, you know, at 10, 10, 10 30, I want everyone to get out.

472
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
So I'm another guest.

473
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
What about me?

474
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Yeah.

475
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
But you're different.

476
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Cause I know you.

477
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
I'm the doctor.

478
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
I'm different.

479
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
All right.

480
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,000
Uh, housekeeping tonight before we get into the gaming news, we're like 20 minutes into

481
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
the show.

482
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We need to get into gaming news.

483
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,720
Uh, just a quick warning, kind of a disclaimer tonight.

484
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,440
It was April fool's week this week.

485
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,240
And while we think we've done a pretty good job of weeding the actual news stories from

486
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,920
the bullshit, there might have been some bullshit that snuck through, but I don't think tonight,

487
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,000
I think we got pretty much everything cleared.

488
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,160
Um, also, uh, don't forget to follow us on Twitter at username, OLR, or follow us on

489
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,720
a Facebook, OL army, or follow us on a live journal, a username, orange lounge.

490
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,560
Uh, also want to make a mention of orange lounge radio, March madness.

491
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,840
That's the thing that Breslull really heads up, kind of Spears it up for, um, the Saturday

492
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,680
night program here under station live.

493
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,100
And you know, we kind of give our commentary running on it.

494
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,000
It finally ended this last week.

495
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,780
Seems like it went on for a while, but considering you had like 64 games that had to get narrowed

496
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
down to one.

497
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,280
Um, there were no ties this year.

498
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,120
There was one clear winner in the final, no ties that we have to break.

499
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,600
Super Mario brothers three is your, uh, ultimate video game of all time per OLR March madness

500
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
this year.

501
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,160
Um, which once again beat chrono trigger chrono trigger was the runner up for the second year

502
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
in a row.

503
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
So there you go.

504
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
And no, I agree.

505
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,640
I mean, when I got that a virtual console was like just as fun as when I played it when

506
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
I was 10.

507
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Um, you know, and I'm sure there's a lot of, especially the chrono trigger fanboys and

508
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,080
girls that are like, Oh my God, fuck my life.

509
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,920
I can't believe the super Mario brothers three would win.

510
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
But come on.

511
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,640
Super Mario brothers three is Epic in so many ways and really reached a much more broad

512
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,720
audience I think than chrono trigger did.

513
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
Don't get me wrong.

514
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm not knocking on chrono trigger.

515
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,480
It's a fabulous game.

516
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,280
Definitely worthy of the runner up prize.

517
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,320
However, you can't get mad that a game like super Mario brothers three beat it.

518
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,920
If if rock band had ultimately won, I could see you cause that was in the final four.

519
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,240
I could see you getting mad if rock band, I would join you video games forever.

520
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,040
I would have joined you and I love me rock band, but it's like a, like a fine wine.

521
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
It needs to age a little bit.

522
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,800
It needs to age a little bit before it can truly be the ultimate video game of all time.

523
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
So all right.

524
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Yeah.

525
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,660
Necessitic vampire in chat says it's just a poll.

526
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,720
It's just a damn poll.

527
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't cry.

528
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Don't cry.

529
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
All right.

530
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's get into some gaming news.

531
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Here's your game.

532
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,040
So you can start us off with some gaming news tonight about Sony.

533
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Big press conference, right?

534
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,760
Well, it wasn't even a press conference is just announcement basically.

535
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,120
And the announcement was, Hey, we're going to drop the price of the PlayStation two.

536
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
And they did.

537
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,240
They dropped it by 30 bucks and now it's 99 99 the magic 99 99 and that is supposed to

538
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,320
spike sales and allow the PlayStation brand to grow even more, or it's just another way

539
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,200
for them to say, Hey, look, you know, this is look how many people we have on the PlayStation

540
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
platform.

541
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,840
You know, not the PlayStation three because the PlayStation three is in third place as

542
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,280
far as the new consoles go.

543
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:24,040
But the PlayStation platform is number one because the PlayStation two is so popular.

544
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I don't know.

545
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,240
I think it's about time that they dropped the price of it.

546
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,480
I mean, it's old.

547
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,020
It's over 10 years old now.

548
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,600
So not a big surprise.

549
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,440
And then also, you know, other than the US getting the price job, of course, we're going

550
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,400
to see a price drop in Europe as well to 99 euros.

551
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,560
And unfortunately, no price drop for the UK.

552
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,200
Sorry.

553
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,360
But you know, 99 99.

554
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
We'll see if this spike sales.

555
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,480
Let me just say as far as I'm concerned.

556
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,320
I haven't had any other people buy PlayStation two systems.

557
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,360
In fact, I haven't had anyone buy a PlayStation two system in a very long time and the price

558
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
drop.

559
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
No one cared, at least on my end.

560
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,520
But Hey, you know, if your console died, maybe you can save a few bucks and the use prices

561
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,280
drop so you can buy use console even cheaper.

562
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,320
But I don't think this is going to make any difference night and day.

563
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,960
It doesn't make the poor college kids happy.

564
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
There's a market for this.

565
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
This is huge news for a lot of people.

566
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,240
That's not the core gamers like you and I, you know what I mean?

567
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,800
This is the let's get a really cheap video game system to put in the kid's bedroom type

568
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
of thing.

569
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,760
This is not going to be exciting news for the core gamer like you and I, because this

570
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,160
we've moved on.

571
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,440
We've graduated to 360 PS three, et cetera.

572
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,800
Well then they're like, Oh, it can impact sales of the weed.

573
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,160
No, I don't think it will because well, because that's the market they're going for.

574
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,540
Instead of trying to either trying to make the price of the PlayStation two so lucrative

575
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,120
that people will want to buy it instead of the we, because I think, I do think the PS

576
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,520
two is competing with the we for that sort of a kid's bedroom toy, you know, and the

577
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,080
we is not having the mass shortages that he used to have.

578
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,120
That was kind of what was keeping the PlayStation two in some ways of flow was that there was

579
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,640
sometimes the we was gone.

580
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,080
So people would opt for a PlayStation two, but I, you know, it's, you can't say PlayStation

581
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,140
two is a bad system.

582
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,160
You can't say there's no games available for the PlayStation two and then it's going to

583
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,400
drop the new price and the use price.

584
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
So, you know, you know, it's interesting that you had to come eventually.

585
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm kind of curious to see what the sales are going to be on the week in the next few

586
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,360
months because no, they have met the demand.

587
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,740
And because of that, I've had a lot less people buying them.

588
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:42,800
And you know, this is when it meets as a man is usually a time when the colors come and

589
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,860
I wouldn't be surprised if the colors come during E3 because that's when they're going

590
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,640
to announce stupid, you know, superfluous shit like this, uh, comments from chat, comments

591
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,200
from chat, uh, tiger class says it's amazing that Sony still supports the PS two given

592
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,740
its enormous library.

593
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
You got to give it to them.

594
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,040
Unlike Microsoft and Nintendo that screw their fans by discontinuing their consoles.

595
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,560
Uh, the fact that Sony still supports the PS two shows that there are a large or still

596
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,320
a large contingent of people that still own their PS two is all that from tiger claw because

597
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
there's no backwards compatibility for the PlayStation two anymore on the PlayStation

598
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
three.

599
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,160
That's exactly what Brad from pod culture says.

600
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,680
Yeah, folks will pick one up, especially if your PS three is not backwards compatible

601
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,880
and your old chunky PS two is acting odd.

602
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,480
Um, also I want to say for Misty, kind of a dissenting voice here, it annoys me because

603
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,400
I just replaced my PS two since the beginning of the year and now it dropped to $99 slanted

604
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,320
and then face and Nintendo still will repair the old systems.

605
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,620
So really all of them, um, the last time I checked on their website, there was still

606
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,000
a repair for the NES, but there was no price listed.

607
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,040
It was, uh, I bet you basically had to call them and then they would probably drop the

608
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
bomb.

609
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah, that's not going to be pretty.

610
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
All right.

611
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,800
Well, Hey, I'm going over to the PSP because obviously the DSI has been much in the limelight

612
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
this week with his launch and everything.

613
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,720
But one of the highly anticipated games for the PSP, Elise for me, and probably most of

614
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,700
us here at music game loving orange launch radio, rock band unplugged.

615
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,920
And the reason why of course that we're all salivating over this game is that it's supposed

616
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,840
to be a lot like amplitude and frequency, uh, rock band unplugged.

617
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,080
The box art has leaked out to the internet and apparently it reveals a partial track

618
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
list.

619
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
However, do take this with a tiny grain of salt.

620
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,160
This news came out not March 31st, which, you know, in a certain time zone might've

621
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,640
been April 1st, but I could see this happening because this, this is legit.

622
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
It's very legit.

623
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,320
Cause a lot of these songs crossover into the actual rock band games.

624
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I could see this.

625
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,680
Um, for example, the way for me to check, well, for example, uh, let's see, we have

626
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
blink one 82.

627
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
What's my age again?

628
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,320
Really idle white wedding Boston, more than a feeling through fighters ever long.

629
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
That game is definitely wrong.

630
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,760
That's not as in rock band, modest mouse float on also Jackson five ABC.

631
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,400
Now that I don't recall being in rock band.

632
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,400
So there are some new tracks, uh, the police message in a bottle, the who pinball wizard,

633
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,840
et cetera, et cetera.

634
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,280
Now also the box apparently also confirms that there will be download content.

635
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,000
There's going to be a music store.

636
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Uh, unfortunately there will be no multiplayer at all in the game.

637
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,080
They had, um, also some screenshots from it in, on the back of the box as well.

638
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,880
Uh, yeah, I remember seeing the screenshots elsewhere on the internet and it, uh, definitely

639
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,840
looks like it's going to be an amplitude, you know, frequency type of game, which, Hey,

640
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,800
fine by me, you know, and I was just saying on Bobby show earlier, you know, Bobby black

641
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,920
Wolf, the guy who does the show, um, before us here on all games radio on Sunday nights,

642
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,960
um, was talking about the whole, he was, he was talking about the DS and DSI.

643
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,040
And the, how guitar hero on tour, one of the biggest selling third party DS games is kind

644
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,440
of screwed by the DSI because the game boy advanced slots now really.

645
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,600
And I was kinda, you know, we joked when we called on the show like, well, who, who the

646
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,760
fuck should be playing guitar here on the DS anyway?

647
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,440
You know, if they're trying to like emulate the whole, it doesn't matter the actual guitar

648
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,280
hero, it doesn't matter anyways.

649
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,760
It's a new system on top of the DS are still selling four colors of the DS and there's

650
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,240
still that many, you know, millions of, you know, DS is out there.

651
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
They're not going to suffer one bit.

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,480
But see, I give that a hard time yet.

653
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,960
I allow rock band because this whole rock band on tour, because they're making a different

654
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,160
game out of it that, you know, is really a throwback to something a lot of people have

655
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
been selling.

656
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
It doesn't have any peripherals.

657
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,360
That too.

658
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
They could easily too.

659
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,680
I wouldn't be surprised if they port this to the PlayStation two without, without the

660
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,760
salt, you know, song store and stuff like that.

661
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Who knows?

662
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
We'll see.

663
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
All right.

664
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,520
Well, anyhow, um, we will, uh, continue to watch rock band unplugged and let you know

665
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
more on it.

666
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,840
And as soon as we know, which I'm sure will be E3, I'm sure that game is going to be playable

667
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
on the show floor.

668
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,160
And I know that will be one of the first things I check out.

669
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
What about you?

670
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Dark soccer.

671
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
You interested in rock band unplugged?

672
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,000
Um, well, not particularly, I thought you were being amplitude frequency type fan.

673
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,320
I, I like it, but I'm, there's other things you're more interested in motion sick.

674
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Oh yeah.

675
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
I can see that.

676
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:02,280
Well, um, there is going to be a new Jack and Dexter game for the PSP and the PS two.

677
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Why?

678
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,160
I don't know, but there is, and it's going to basically pick up from where the, the last

679
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,440
uh, game left off.

680
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,760
And so you are in the last frontier and you're going to help someone become a sage Kira,

681
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,560
I think is the name.

682
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:28,400
And uh, so it's a adventure up in the mountains or in the air or with pirates of the sky.

683
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,240
Well, you know, this series obviously still has its fans.

684
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
And I think this goes right in line with the whole PlayStation two price drop.

685
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,560
It's interesting to see, wow, they are still making freaking games for the PlayStation

686
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,040
two, but you know, and this isn't like a D list title.

687
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,000
This is at least the B list.

688
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,760
Well, um, it actually is, uh, done by, uh, being developed by a high impact games.

689
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,040
So they're the ones that did size matters.

690
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:05,720
And uh, it's looks like it's going to be fairly less depressing than, you know, the second

691
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
one was.

692
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
All right.

693
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,960
I had any interest in Jack and Dexter for you.

694
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,920
No, I haven't been interested in that ever.

695
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,360
It's more of a kid's franchise, right?

696
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Yeah.

697
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,120
But I know we have listeners that are fans and they're probably screaming at us right

698
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
now.

699
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
It's not necessarily a kid's franchise.

700
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,520
And I'm not really saying that it's just like ratchet and clank.

701
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,440
I tried to get in the ratchet and clank cause I had never really been a fan of it on the

702
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,040
PlayStation two with the PlayStation three version tools of destruction.

703
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,160
I played it for a little bit and then I ended up selling it to my friend cause I just couldn't

704
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
do it.

705
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,600
It just, it not my thing, just not very entertaining.

706
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,880
I was like into like Spyro and stuff for a little bit and my sister really went gung

707
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
ho with that.

708
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,080
But, um, yeah, grand theft auto that steals away all my time, unfortunately.

709
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:59,040
Anyways, some other games though that are going to be coming out that are kind of neat.

710
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,280
Tales of Vesperia, coming in the PS3.

711
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,640
And this is not really a big surprise since, you know, Tales of Vesperia came out on the

712
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
360.

713
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,040
This is kind of a similar thing with Eternal Sonata.

714
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,800
Now of course after the wait, not only do you get a game that is on par with the 360

715
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,440
version but they've also added in new stuff.

716
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,280
Including some new characters you'll get to play as that were kind of hinted in the Xbox

717
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,680
360 version but now they are playable, which is kind of cool.

718
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,420
And another game they also announced Tales of Versus, which is going to be a PSP title

719
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,000
and it's kind of like the Tales version of Dissidia.

720
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Which is neat.

721
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,080
So you got all the Tales characters fighting each other.

722
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,160
It's still part of the Tales series, yeah.

723
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,040
But um, you know, a little bit different.

724
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,200
But uh, they're putting out a lot of Tales games, that's for sure.

725
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,640
Which is definitely crazy in Japan, right?

726
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,480
Didn't the Xbox 360 get a huge boost from Vesperia?

727
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Yeah, yeah.

728
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,360
That and Internal Sonata I think did pretty good.

729
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,280
But I don't know, I never really noticed the Tales franchise that much.

730
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,140
I haven't really played any of them, so I kind of feel bad in that sense.

731
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,960
But I don't want to play any of them right now.

732
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,680
Well, Tales for Fantasia on Game Boy Advance is actually pretty good.

733
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,200
Like if you're into old school, like 16-bit.

734
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,840
Oh yeah, Tales definitely has a very cult following to it.

735
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,920
You know, there's lots of fans of this series.

736
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,200
But you know, I'm not surprised this game is showing up on Playstation 3.

737
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,480
It is a little bit late to the party, but I think over in Japan it's going to mean more

738
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,640
than it will here.

739
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,580
Because in Japan, the Playstation 3 has penetrated a bigger slice of the market.

740
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,120
So I think, you know, it's going to be a bigger deal over there.

741
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,100
I would say put it out this year if you can, because come the end of this year and possibly

742
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,680
next spring Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out and no one's going to care about

743
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,280
anything else as far as RPGs go.

744
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,040
And whether it's good or bad, I mean, just no one's going to care.

745
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,840
Speaking of which, remember, we're only like a couple weeks away, and I'll be getting my

746
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
copy of the demo.

747
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Ooh, that's right.

748
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,040
And we'll definitely be doing that on the JT.

749
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Definitely we'll be doing that.

750
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
We won't be the first, though.

751
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
There's going to be tons of people.

752
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Oh, yeah.

753
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Absolutely.

754
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,840
But we will definitely check it out on Sunday in case you forget to check earlier in the

755
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
week.

756
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Okay.

757
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,960
So I want to talk about Playstation as well, which got a firmware update this week.

758
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
You know, they're on Playstation.

759
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,880
They do pretty regular firmware updates over there.

760
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,040
One of the big features now, in-game text chat, 16 people at a time, is one of the big

761
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,680
features of the new firmware, which was released this week.

762
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,040
Also, you can send, apparently, files to your friends as big as 3 megabytes now.

763
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,760
And you can sort friends in your friends list now alphabetically or by online status and

764
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,440
last login time, so you can kind of have some, which is good, because it seemed like there

765
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,120
was no rhyme or reason to the friends list sorting before, so that was a feature that

766
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
was needed.

767
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,680
Also, there's some other features, a dynamic normalizer that will prevent sudden increases

768
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,480
in volume between music tracks.

769
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,360
For those games that don't know how to normalize their volume, that's pretty good.

770
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,560
If you don't have a sound system, it'll do that as well.

771
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,400
Also, the ability to cut and paste text, which I guess if you're a huge chatterer in home

772
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,520
might be useful or something.

773
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
I can't think of a lot of chatty things I do on the Playstation 3, but I guess cut and

774
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
paste is needed.

775
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,080
And now the dawn of the age of text spamming in home.

776
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
That's true.

777
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,440
I hope they figured out a way to curb that in home, but, you know, cut and paste is also

778
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
a big, big...

779
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,680
You know, you might be laughing going, well, cut and paste shouldn't be a big fucking deal.

780
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,040
Look at all the iPhone users that are, like, rejoicing that cut and paste is finally coming

781
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
to iPhone.

782
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,720
Oh, hell yes.

783
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,840
That's a big deal over there, so I can see that.

784
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,920
So there you go, Playstation 3 firmware out now.

785
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,920
I actually upgraded earlier today before I went into home, but unfortunately those really

786
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,260
aren't a lot of features I use very often, except the friends list.

787
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,360
That will probably be the biggest thing for me.

788
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,800
Well, there's a particular series that I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

789
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
I won't see any of it.

790
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,440
I hate this whole series of movies.

791
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,600
The concept of it is disgusting and just repugnant to me.

792
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,560
What movie series is that, Rob?

793
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,320
Um, I would have to say...

794
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Too slow, Saw.

795
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Pokemon.

796
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Oh.

797
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
I really, really hate Saw.

798
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Pokemon in Saw?

799
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
No.

800
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,560
Would you watch that if the Pokemon starred in the next Saw movie?

801
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Fuck no.

802
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Pikachu!

803
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Pikachu!

804
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Pikachu!

805
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Pikachu!

806
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Pikachu!

807
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Pikachu!

808
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,160
What do we do with Pikachu's armor?

809
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,620
As I was saying, Konami has the Saw license.

810
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,000
They pried it out of the dead fingers of Brasher Entertainment.

811
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank God.

812
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Because then it might actually be a decent game.

813
00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:00,720
But now they were actually drawing comparisons between that and Silent Hill, which I thought

814
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:09,240
was more funny um more funny funnier there's my grammar today um the marketer David Daniels

815
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,200
was telling what sorry I'm laughing at the chat room hold on we got we got DJ Tyrant

816
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,840
hello Ash I'd like to play a battle with you and gold anthro says gotta saw them all

817
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:34,280
dear chat room they make Ritalin for a reason sorry dark soccer okay um but the marketer

818
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:44,040
David Daniels is quoted saying that Silent Hill is more about psychological terror but

819
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,120
soft for us is more about graphic intense horror that overwhelms you we want players

820
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,160
to turn away from the screen for just a moment because of the visual intensity or because

821
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,640
the graphics really really suck in other words it's going to be blood pornography these games

822
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,200
are going to be just that they're already preparing us for the fact that these games

823
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,000
are going to be blood pornography wait well it's supposed to be out in the fall it actually

824
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,240
has Tobin Bell doing the voice of jigsaw he does have a sexy voice I'll put it that way

825
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,600
it's a very sexy scary voice and considering you know Vincent Price is like long dead and

826
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,480
gone and there will never be anyone as wonderful as Vincent Price um you know Tobin Bell's

827
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,680
got a pretty scary voice for this generation well it's going to be out on PC, Xbox 360

828
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,400
and PS3 and guess who's not going to buy it me I'm not even going to let it come into

829
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,160
my house aren't you worried this might have an impact on the Silent Hill series I hope

830
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,460
not, better fucking not I do like that he has the distinction it's going to get worse

831
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,760
Silent well I like that they've made the clear distinction Silent Hill psychological thriller

832
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,200
because when I think psychological thriller I think of great scary movies like The Silence

833
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,640
of the Lambs these types of like classic psychological thrillers that's more in the suspense sense

834
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,380
right and but that's kind of what Silent Hill is right more of like a suspense mind fuck

835
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:11,640
kind of movie but it has the gross it has the gore attached to it it has but it's not

836
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,640
The gore is not the focus. The gore is part of driving in the psychological part.

837
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,640
You are walking through a personal nightmare for your character.

838
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,640
In essence, that is Silent Hill. You are walking through their nightmare.

839
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,640
You know, everything in the game has some aspect of their personality or their guilt

840
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,640
or something having to do with them that's going back to that person.

841
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,640
It requires more thought than just splattering blood everywhere.

842
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,640
But you know there are going to be people that are all about the blood orgy of Saw.

843
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
It will sell. It will sell.

844
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
It'll sell, but...

845
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Which, Loki, you're a big blood fan. Are you going to be purchasing the blood orgy that is Saw?

846
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
No, because it's not going to be any good.

847
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I'm sorry, even if...

848
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,640
Now, what they should have called it is blood orgy of the game, but you know...

849
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I'd buy a game called blood orgy.

850
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,640
No, but seriously though, I'm sorry, but not to knock Konami or anything.

851
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,640
It's not going to be any good because it's made by Konami.

852
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I don't want to knock them or anything, but it's...

853
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
God damn, your game is going to suck.

854
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm sorry.

855
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Hold on, Loki. To be fair, none of you have touched the game.

856
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,640
And you're basing your review of the game off the movie, which isn't completely fair.

857
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,640
No, I'm basing my review off of the screenshot that I saw, okay?

858
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,640
And also the fact that Saw cannot be made into a game very well.

859
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Because how are you going to do that?

860
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,640
No, I'm sorry. Konami's not clever enough to figure that out.

861
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Point and click.

862
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:45,640
How about I have read enough about Saw to know that I have zero interest in playing the game or seeing the movies or anything remotely related to it.

863
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
And I don't even watch the damn trailers.

864
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Then again, I don't watch TV.

865
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,640
But still, I have zero interest in nothing but loathing for the franchise.

866
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Now, I noticed the consensus amongst chat, and I'm not going to read a lot of the individual quotes from chat here.

867
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Because it seems like there's a consensus that Saw 1, decent.

868
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
The rest, blood orgy.

869
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Stupid porn movies.

870
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Blood porn.

871
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
The Leo Shannon chat, I will read this comment.

872
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Blood orgy and titties would be the best selling game ever.

873
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,640
It just might. It just might.

874
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,640
You know, it could be decent, but it's not going to be good.

875
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
And they've got a lot of things going against them.

876
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Just because, one, it's a movie tie-in.

877
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:37,640
And two, really, when is the last standout awesome game other than Metal Gear Solid 4 that's come out from Konami in the recent years?

878
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Oh, I can't think of one! That's why!

879
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,640
And I'm sorry, I don't all of a sudden see them turning themselves around any time soon.

880
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
And, I don't know.

881
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Low expectations, let's put it that way.

882
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,640
If it comes out and it's awesome, good, then I'll eat my words, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

883
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
And no, I'm not making a bet on this game.

884
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Agdef is telling me to give the first movie a try, but I'm going to go ahead and explain this right now.

885
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,640
The concept of that kind of thing, about putting people in that position, disgusts me.

886
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Like you have no idea how much it disgusts me.

887
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,640
It's so reprehensible of an idea that thinking about it makes me want to vomit.

888
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
So no, I won't see it.

889
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,640
I did see the first Saw movie and it's one of those things where it's like, it's not that great.

890
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
You can live your life and not see it.

891
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Like, there's a hundred other movies I would say a person has to see before they see Saw.

892
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
See Saw.

893
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Saw!

894
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Oh god, you're all done.

895
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
And that's the thing, I'm a pretty big fan of the Saw movies.

896
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Granted, they've kind of gone downhill because once you kill off the main bad guy...

897
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Oops, spoiler.

898
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
It's been like movies since then.

899
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,640
But once you kill off the main bad guy, it's kind of hard to, I don't know, continue the series without a new bad person.

900
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
And they've kind of done...

901
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,640
They've made it as confusing as possible unless you've watched the other movies.

902
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,640
And you're just like, oh, that's that dude from that other movie.

903
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
And, wait, what?

904
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,640
But next Silent Hill game, I am so there.

905
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
I bought Homecoming. It was fun. Good game.

906
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
I need to actually go back and beat it.

907
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
There's a lot of games that came out around the same time.

908
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,640
We were watching Annie and Jim play Homecoming this week.

909
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
It's okay. Also watched Siren.

910
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
And that was... I don't know.

911
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,640
But I just saw the movie...

912
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,640
I just don't see how you can make this into a game.

913
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
What's it gonna be?

915
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
I mean, it's just like an adventure game that doesn't make any sense.

916
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
It's gonna sell.

917
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,640
I would bet money this Saw game's gonna sell even though we all hate it.

918
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Because there's an audience out there for it. There really is.

919
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Well, I don't think there will.

920
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
There will be a Saw 2 video game.

921
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
It'll probably come out in October.

922
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,640
And it's gonna be coming out at the same time as a bunch of other bigger games.

923
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
And I'm sorry.

924
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,640
When this comes out, there will be people that pick it up because it's Saw.

925
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,640
But think of the last really good movie title that's come out on consoles.

926
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,640
That's right. Because most of them aren't that good.

927
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,640
And even Wanted, which I thought was gonna be awesome, wasn't that good.

928
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,640
And it's just not gonna happen.

929
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
It's not gonna be all of a sudden amazing.

930
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
They're not gonna break the mold.

931
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
It's just not gonna work.

932
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Okay, I want to get over this Saw topic.

933
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
But I do want to say one other comment here.

934
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
It's in support, basically, of what DarkSakura is saying.

935
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
TigerKlon's chat says,

936
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
I feel the same way about movies that glamorize the gore.

937
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,640
I don't get why people are so turned on by it.

938
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
That I find deeply disturbing.

939
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
One final thought I want to put out there is

940
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:46,640
this is just gonna give ammunition to those people that say that video games are, you know, poisoning the minds of people everywhere.

941
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,640
And those people that say, you know, Manhunt 2 is corrupting America,

942
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,640
and Grand Theft Auto is poisoning our children, et cetera, et cetera.

943
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,640
These Saw games, especially if people's predictions that you are going to be the puppet in these games is correct.

944
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,640
If you're the little puppet creature, that'd be awesome.

945
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
I don't know.

946
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:11,640
I have a bad feeling that this game is going to be one of those things that certain lawyers who I wish would stay out of the goddamn news

947
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,640
are going to use to propel their case into the next decade.

948
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,640
They should be more offended by the movies because the movies are actually graphic and stuff.

949
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,640
Whereas this game, I don't think enough people are going to buy it to even, you know, care that it's violent.

950
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,640
I will go ahead and say, by the way, it is not the gore that bothers me.

951
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,640
It is the concept of what the people in the movie...

952
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
Torture porn. Torture porn bothers you.

953
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,640
That's it. I do not, I can't stand torture of people who really haven't done anything wrong.

954
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
Alright. Let's move on.

955
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
I'm so done with Saw.

956
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,640
But the people have done stuff that's wrong.

957
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
That's the whole point of why they're being tortured.

958
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
Well, you know what I mean.

959
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,640
Whatever.

960
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Anyways, something that's not wrong in any way whatsoever would be Saints Row 2.

961
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,640
And there's brand new download content coming out for it on April 16th, which makes me pretty excited.

962
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Because now I have a new reason to play that game again.

963
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,640
The new download content will be called Ultor Exposed, which makes sense because there's areas of the map that you can't conquer yet.

964
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,640
And they're all owned by Ultor.

965
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,640
And it will give you a few new things, including a co-op meta game.

966
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,640
You'll be able to use porn star Tara Patrick as one of your homies.

967
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Okay. And new vehicles, new weapons, and some new multiplayer maps are also coming out along with that.

968
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,640
It's going to be available for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

969
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,640
And I look forward to checking that out.

970
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,640
Alrighty. Let's move on to some release dates.

971
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,640
And let's travel the world and check out what's coming out in some other countries this week.

972
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,640
And I'm looking over at Japan and in the next gen systems, there's really not a whole lot.

973
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,640
You get a price reduction on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 on Playstation 3.

974
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,640
But not a lot of new stuff.

975
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,640
And I'm wondering if that's because you got the whole Advent Children coming out next week over in Japan.

976
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
I don't know.

977
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,640
On the Nintendo Wii, you do have Oboro Muramasa comes out this week.

978
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,640
And I'm not sure what this game really is, but it does look kind of stylized.

979
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
It is awesome.

980
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,640
This game is by the developers of Odin Sphere.

981
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
It's all hand drawn.

982
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
It's very stylized.

983
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
This looks kind of neat actually.

984
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Like a side scroll action game.

985
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
It's coming out in June here in the US.

986
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,640
It's going to be called Muramasa Demon Blade.

987
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,640
Yeah, this game looks cool.

988
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,640
So if you're in Japan, you get an extra sneak peek at this this week.

989
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
Maybe we'll have a sneak peek of it next week. Who knows?

990
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
That would be awesome actually.

991
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,640
This game, I love the art in this. This looks really cool.

992
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,640
And this is a Wii game.

993
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
What's that, doctor?

994
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,640
I was going to say, there's videos of it on YouTube and whatnot.

995
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,640
And the animation is pretty high quality.

996
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,640
It looks really good.

997
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Well, there you go.

998
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,640
At least there's that big title coming out.

999
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Maybe people are afraid of that.

1000
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,640
I don't know.

1001
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,640
On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart 2.

1002
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Full title is Sugoi Arcana Heart 2.

1003
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,640
Arcana Heart, that is the female chick fighter game, is it not?

1004
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
Where it's all women, I guess.

1005
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
They got a sequel.

1006
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,640
So I'm assuming it's a matter of time before that comes out over here.

1007
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,640
It actually looks pretty good on, is that just on PlayStation 2?

1008
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,640
That is a PlayStation 2 game.

1009
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
They have some really good captures.

1010
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Those are not bad graphics for PlayStation 2.

1011
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Again, showing that they're still cranking it out on the PlayStation 2.

1012
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,640
Looking on the Nintendo DS, not a whole lot of stuff.

1013
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Rhythm to Run Run Run is a game coming out,

1014
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,640
as well as another cooking game called Happy Cooking.

1015
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,640
A party stylized concept game on the DS? What?

1016
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,640
And then lastly in Japan, looking at the Sony PlayStation Portable.

1017
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,640
I don't believe I see a whole lot on the PSP.

1018
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Where is my list here?

1019
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,640
We do have another Evangelion game.

1020
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,640
It's a Neon Genesis Evangelion,

1021
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,640
Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Tokubetsu Hen Portable.

1022
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
So you know what that means.

1023
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Dating Evangelion Sim on the PSP again.

1024
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
Enjoy that.

1025
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Oh, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes is a big title coming out on the PSP.

1026
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,640
I think that one is something you get a little more excited about.

1027
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Again, looks like this game's got some pretty sweet graphics too.

1028
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
That's another Dynasty Warriors game?

1029
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,640
It looks kind of, a little bit.

1030
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
I mean, there's like zero English in this game whatsoever,

1031
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
so looking at the screenshots I can't tell.

1032
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,640
It's probably Sengoku Basara, that's, oh, I can't...

1033
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Battle Heroes is the subtitle.

1034
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,640
I'm thinking what it's called over here.

1035
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
They've only released one game.

1036
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,640
I actually have that for the Wii and I haven't actually played it yet.

1037
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
It's only in Japan.

1038
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,640
I have this special edition, it's like a two disc game,

1039
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,640
but it has the first and second one.

1040
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,640
It was localized over here by Capcom and I can't remember,

1041
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,640
it's like, it's going to bug me now.

1042
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
It's comments from Chatroom.

1043
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
Goldanthro says,

1044
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Sky wants a guy version game that's Arcana Heart style.

1045
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,640
To be fair, that's most other fighting games.

1046
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
To be fair.

1047
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Leo Shen says, Arcana Heart 2.

1048
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Get it.

1049
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,640
They have a freaking loli fighter modeled after Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.

1050
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
There's no place like home.

1051
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,640
There's no place like home.

1052
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Punch.

1053
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Does she like, does she roundhouse kick people with her ruby slippers?

1054
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
I guess so.

1055
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
Let's see.

1056
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
It's called Devil Kings over here.

1057
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,640
That's what it was.

1058
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
There you go.

1059
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,640
Devil something.

1060
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
Alright, let's move on to Europe.

1061
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Dark Sakura.

1062
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,640
Europe release dates.

1063
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,640
There's stuff.

1064
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Well, as far as our European release dates, just give me just a second.

1065
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
It was thinking about it.

1066
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
My apologies.

1067
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
Modern technology.

1068
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,640
On the seventh, we have Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

1069
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,640
Logs Lost Challenges.

1070
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,640
We have Flock on PC.

1071
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,640
The ninth, we have Elven Legacy and Helldorado.

1072
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
Helldorado?

1073
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Okay.

1074
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
I'm not even going to ask.

1075
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,640
On the tenth, we have The Godfather 2.

1076
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,640
And that's it.

1077
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,640
Cool.

1078
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,640
Over here, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

1079
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,640
Of course, this is all coming out today.

1080
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
Of course, the DSi systems.

1081
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,640
I mean, a lot of people knew that was coming out, both in blue and black.

1082
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Rhythm Heaven to kind of coincide with the DSi, but not necessarily a DSi game.

1083
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Coming out on the DS.

1084
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,640
We've got Gravity coming out on the DS and on the Wii.

1085
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Kind of a fun little incredible machine type of game.

1086
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,640
We've got Air Conflicts Aces of World War II coming to the PSP.

1087
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,640
Because I don't think the PSP's had a World War II flight sim game yet.

1088
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,640
So that's kind of cool.

1089
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
The Chronicles of Riddick Dark Athena.

1090
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,640
And it was about time they got one.

1091
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,640
It was about time.

1092
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Every system needs their World War II flight sim fighting game.

1093
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
Yes.

1094
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Yes.

1095
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Definitely.

1096
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,640
And The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 this week.

1097
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:03,640
Hannah Montana the movie, the game everyone's been waiting for coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.

1098
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
Yay!

1099
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Yes, awesome.

1100
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,640
And then if you're not interested in Hannah Montana, you might be interested in Godfather 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

1101
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,640
Those two, you'd be surprised how the fans...

1102
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:21,640
If you're interested in both of those games, I think something might be wrong.

1103
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,640
I think most people would be interested in one or the other.

1104
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,640
I don't really see somebody saying, yeah GameStop employee, I'm here to pick up my copy of Godfather 2 and Miley Cyrus.

1105
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,640
It's for my daughter.

1106
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Miley Cyrus is going to get an offer that she can't refuse.

1107
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,640
Because Miley Cyrus stars in The Godfather 4.

1108
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,640
Nobody knows this.

1109
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Her and Sophia Copeland.

1110
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,640
Where the Godfather becomes hip and sassy.

1111
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,640
Alright.

1112
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Some actual serious...

1113
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,640
Where RuPaul is the Godfather.

1114
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,640
I'm going to make you offer You Camera Feels, okay?

1115
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,640
Girl, you better work.

1116
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:13,640
And then on Playstation 2 and PSP this week, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus coming out if you're looking for a good 2D fighting game.

1117
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,640
On PC, DCS Black Shark.

1118
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Looks like some flight sim game.

1119
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,640
Deer Drive is getting a re-release from Zoo Games.

1120
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,640
It's a game where you drive your jeep and kill deer.

1121
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,640
Just like, you know, that brings me back to, was it Cruisin' USA?

1122
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,640
Hit the deer and they explode.

1123
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,640
The game that we're featuring tonight actually on Justin TV, Ninja Blade will be making its way out this week if you want to own your own copy.

1124
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,640
I actually recommend it, it's pretty fun.

1125
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,640
And then, let's see here, Guilty Gear, I mentioned that.

1126
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,640
Oh, and this is awesome on PC, apparently if you like crappy games or you're a girl.

1127
00:53:52,640 --> 00:54:02,640
OMG High School Triple Play Pack featuring, I believe it's like the Cheetah Girls, Mean Girls, and...

1128
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Oh, I'm sorry, Mean Girls Clueless and Pretty in Pink.

1129
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
I didn't know they had games for those.

1130
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,640
I like all of those movies.

1131
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,640
I think something's wrong with me.

1132
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,640
There is something wrong with you.

1133
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,640
And then, let's see, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor coming out on PC.

1134
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,640
Elven Legacy on PC as well.

1135
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,640
And this is kind of cool, an Atlus PSP game, Hammerin' Hero coming out.

1136
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,640
And another crappy Wii game, Escape the Museum.

1137
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,640
And finally, you get a twofer here.

1138
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,640
Not only do you get a crappy movie this week, but a crappy game based on said crappy movie that's based off of an anime series.

1139
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,640
It's not so crappy, but Dragon Ball Evolution.

1140
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,640
The game, the movie, the myth, the failure.

1141
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,640
That's it.

1142
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,640
Other Gay Guy on the show tonight, I have a question.

1143
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,640
What is that show on VH1 with RuPaul, is it Drag Races?

1144
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Yeah, RuPaul's Drag Race.

1145
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
How do you know that, Loki?

1146
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
I watch The Soup.

1147
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,640
Oh, Loki watches The Soup.

1148
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,640
Don't you think they need to make a video game out of that?

1149
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,640
Again, point and click.

1150
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Yeah, you dress the guys, you get them into their tucking panties.

1151
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,640
It would be a Wii game, because it would be a party game.

1152
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,640
Like, you know, it could be heel clubbing.

1153
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,640
And you gotta do the dance, but it would be like Spice Girls the Game 2.

1154
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,640
I am all over this game.

1155
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,640
Let's put another girl through her paces.

1156
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
RuPaul's Drag Races.

1157
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,640
I like SSJ-100 Matt RuPaul GPS.

1158
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Work, turn to the left, work, turn to the right.

1159
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Any game where you replace the main character with RuPaul would be hilarious.

1160
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
I love RuPaul.

1161
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,640
God damn, RuPaul.

1162
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,640
I love RuPaul, but I think that'd be great.

1163
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,640
I think RuPaul would think that'd be funny.

1164
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,640
Oh my god, is there a game developer out there listening?

1165
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,640
Please, call them and make this happen.

1166
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,640
There is an audience for that game.

1167
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,640
Like Super Mario Bros. 3 RuPaul Edition, but instead of like the raccoon suit, it's like the sparkly suit.

1168
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Look, if you want to put in a little bit of money into this game, you will sell like, you're not going to sell a million.

1169
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,640
You're probably not even going to sell 100,000, but you'll sell like 25,000.

1170
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
No, I still think there should have been a gay X-Men where RuPaul was stormed.

1171
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,640
I'm sorry.

1172
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,640
That would be a great game.

1173
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
Oh, here's something RuPaul should be in.

1174
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Oni Chambara.

1175
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,640
No, seriously, I'm trying to tie this into the next story.

1176
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Did you know there was actually a movie based off of Oni Chambara?

1177
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
Yes, I did, and I have...

1178
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,640
It's out here as well.

1179
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,640
It's localized here in the U.S. called Chambara Beauty, apparently.

1180
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
I know, I got it.

1181
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,640
I haven't got a chance to watch it yet, but...

1182
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
Well, you better hurry because...

1183
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,640
I will.

1184
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,640
Guess what?

1185
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,640
Apparently, even though this movie got negative reviews across the board, who would have thought?

1186
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:04,640
For some reason, bikini-clad women slaying zombies with swords apparently had an audience for it.

1187
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,640
Believe it or not, I played this game, and it was very fun.

1188
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,640
And yet they won't make the RuPaul game.

1189
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Right.

1190
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,640
They think there's no audience for that.

1191
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
They'll make this shit, but they won't make it.

1192
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,640
What's also awesome about...

1193
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,640
You know, all the zombies are apparently farmers because they all wear flannel.

1194
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
Here's the thing.

1195
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,640
Chambara Beauty is now getting a sequel.

1196
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
The movie is getting a sequel.

1197
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,640
Oni Chambara the Game getting a sequel, that's probably a given as well.

1198
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,640
But there will be another movie, Chambara Beauty Vortex.

1199
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,640
And I guess there is a game called Vortex as well that's going to be coming out as well.

1200
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
Amazingly enough, though, the Oni Chambara...

1201
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Like, for a Wii game, like, blood splattering on the screen.

1202
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Like, you get too much blood on your sword, and it sticks into the zombies.

1203
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,640
I mean, it's not like a terrible blood fest, but it was a blood fest.

1204
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
Now, something you should know.

1205
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:56,640
The star of the first film, Starlit Eri Otogoro, is not coming back for the second movie.

1206
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,640
So you know it's going to be a winner.

1207
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,640
So this is a live action Japanese movie.

1208
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,640
Is that what you're saying?

1209
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,640
Yeah, this is a live action Japanese movie that's now getting a sequel to It.

1210
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,640
Wow.

1211
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,640
So we are seeing the beginnings of, like, Oni Chambara Mania.

1212
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,640
That's amazing.

1213
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,640
I love live action Japanese movies because they're so terrible.

1214
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,640
But yet, no RuPaul game.

1215
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
I'm just saying.

1216
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
Such injustice in this world.

1217
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,640
Such injustice.

1218
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
You would like Skye...

1219
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,640
I think I need to start one of those petition online things.

1220
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,640
You know those things that don't mean anything?

1221
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,640
But we need to start collecting signatures for a RuPaul video game.

1222
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
No, Rob, but...

1223
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,640
And I'll email fucking RuPaul somehow.

1224
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,640
Back to live action really quick.

1225
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,640
Akouge is a live action Japanese film about fag hags.

1226
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,640
Check it out.

1227
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,640
Akouge.

1228
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,640
Really?

1229
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,640
Yes, because I dated a Japanese guy for a little bit and he showed it to me.

1230
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Really?

1231
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,640
It was awesome.

1232
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,640
Because basically this chick likes to watch guys make out in the park.

1233
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,640
Gee, you know...

1234
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,640
I have a problem with that.

1235
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,640
A lot of straight guys like to watch girls make out in the park.

1236
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,640
Like, hello, cruel intentions.

1237
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,640
Why not?

1238
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,640
Some girls like to watch girls make out in the park.

1239
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,640
La la la la.

1240
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,640
Innocent, innocent.

1241
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Anyway.

1242
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,640
How about different stuff?

1243
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Yes, how about different stuff?

1244
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,640
Well, there is a game that's called Beyond Good and Evil.

1245
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Ooh.

1246
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,640
And it's getting a sequel.

1247
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,640
Ooh.

1248
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:36,640
And it's inspired by the Trade Center airplane bombing thing.

1249
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:43,640
And I refuse to refer to the event by the date because I think that's fucking retarded.

1250
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,640
You can just refer to it as Loki's 21st birthday.

1251
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Okay, it happened on Loki's 21st birthday.

1252
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,640
So when Loki was getting, what, liquor or something?

1253
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,640
Eating steak at a steakhouse.

1254
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,640
That was empty.

1255
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Okay.

1256
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:02,640
But at any rate, the game is supposed to be based off of that.

1257
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:13,640
They're saying that that day's event actually gave across the same type of element of fear

1258
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,640
that he was looking for in the game.

1259
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:26,640
And so he's going to incorporate that same sense, that same emotional sense into the sequel.

1260
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:32,640
But he also, though, tried to compare it to Zelda.

1261
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,640
Saying that...

1262
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,640
Oh, come on.

1263
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,640
Saying that they're good games but out of time.

1264
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,640
And I'm like...

1265
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,640
Is that like Majora's Mask?

1266
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:55,640
No, it just means that there's people who like happy and some people who like to play fucking depressing stuff.

1267
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,640
I had...

1268
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,640
Braid, in a way, was depressing to me.

1269
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,640
Like, I don't know. There's definitely depressing games out there.

1270
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,640
All the Silent Hill games are pretty depressing, too.

1271
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,640
God, they're fantastic.

1272
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,640
I actually think that the UFO endings on Silent Hill are more depressing.

1273
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,640
I have really yet to play that game that makes me want to eat an entire canister of ice cream, though.

1274
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Like, you know, getting that depressed.

1275
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,640
Like watching a Lifetime movie or one of Steel Magnolias or something.

1276
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,640
I have yet to really see the video game equivalent of that.

1277
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Well, the only problem I have with games like that that'll be about an actual horrifying event like that.

1278
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Or even the World War II games is the people who, when they play those games, are like,

1279
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,640
"'Cause I'm showing respect to the event and I'm remembering it. Nah."

1280
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,640
And I'm like, "'Cause you're sitting on your ass in your living room on a couch pressing buttons."

1281
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,640
So I'm like, that's the only...

1282
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,640
But, you know, it could be a good game. I don't know.

1283
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:55,640
I... You know what? I have to say, and I'm just gonna leave it here, and yes, it was incredibly awful,

1284
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:01,640
but making a big to-do about that is actually just perpetuating fear.

1285
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,640
We just need to go back to business as usual.

1286
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,640
It kinda seems like this person's reaching for buzzwords that are gonna catch people's attention.

1287
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
I'm thinking...

1288
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,640
That's the impression I get.

1289
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:20,640
I can understand trying to evoke an emotion, and I understand that was a very particularly...

1290
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,640
Well, for lack of a better description, that was definitely a unique sort of feeling, you know?

1291
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,640
The combination of gutted and really numb, I would think.

1292
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,640
And I can understand someone trying to evoke an emotion that is that unique,

1293
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:43,640
but at the same time, don't drag that into it. Just fucking drop it.

1294
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,640
I gotta say, going to the depressing games topic, which is kinda open to thing in chat here,

1295
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,640
I gotta say this. Kitsune says, Lost Odyssey made me sad.

1296
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
It's very depressing, but it's a good game. That's a good point.

1297
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,640
Lost Odyssey was really, really sad. That was a really good story, too.

1298
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,640
That was a horrifically-underlooked game by a lot of people.

1299
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,640
You know what? Another game had a really depressing ending?

1300
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,640
Hmm.

1301
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
Klonoa.

1302
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,640
Really? I never played that to completion.

1303
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,640
The game is, you start it off, it's all cutesy happy, cutesy happy.

1304
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,640
Get towards the end of the game. Oh my god!

1305
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,640
Wind Waker also said.

1306
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,640
Really? I didn't really play enough of it.

1307
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,640
No, I thought it was. I was like, I've been playing this game for 15 years,

1308
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,640
and then this is what happens to the kingdom?

1309
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:27,640
Okay. I don't want to get a depressing show, so let's go back to LoL RuPaul for a minute here, okay?

1310
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
Apparently we have a friend at Sony that listens to the show,

1311
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,640
and they're gonna email some people about the RuPaul game and making it happen.

1312
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,640
So, god bless you. You are a public servant of the people.

1313
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,640
You are a brave man, so best of luck with that.

1314
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
It better have the word fierce in the title.

1315
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,640
That's right.

1316
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,640
And it better not be soccer practice.

1317
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,640
God bless you, sir. God bless you. I hope it happens.

1318
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,640
If they need input of any sort, please give them my email.

1319
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,640
Also, I want to point this out.

1320
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,640
SSJ100Matt made a good point.

1321
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,640
Rob, seriously, keep wishing, because last time you did that, they made SingStar Abba.

1322
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,640
This is true.

1323
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,640
What if they did SingStar RuPaul?

1324
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
I don't think that would work as much.

1325
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,640
You could sing Back to My Roots, which is actually...

1326
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,640
Okay, that song is a guilty pleasure for me.

1327
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,640
No, I don't think I'd want an entire SingStar game out of RuPaul,

1328
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,640
but I think they could make a party game out of drag races.

1329
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,640
That would be totally great.

1330
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,640
I think they could. RuPaul's Fierce Drag Race.

1331
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,640
ZakuPilot256, there's the name right there.

1332
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,640
It's got to have fierce in the title.

1333
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,640
That's right.

1334
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,640
Most Fiercest.

1335
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,640
It just has to be...

1336
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
This game is fierce, just buy it.

1337
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,640
The end.

1338
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,640
The title should just be This Game is Fierce.

1339
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,640
Alright, Lord Almighty, let's get past the RuPaul thing.

1340
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,640
I'm so sorry to our listeners.

1341
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,640
I know it's my fault, but I neglected the chat.

1342
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,640
Candy!

1343
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
I was laughing so hard, I couldn't see the chat,

1344
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,640
so I just went back and caught up on it and wanted to mention that.

1345
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Sorry.

1346
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,640
Anyways, so there's a rumor going around that Mortal Kombat,

1347
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
the team that's working at least on Mortal Kombat,

1348
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,640
is trying to leave Midway.

1349
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,640
I guess that's kind of like rats escaping a sinking ship.

1350
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,640
So they're looking for new developers.

1351
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,640
Yay.

1352
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
Probably going to buy them up.

1353
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
I can totally see that happening.

1354
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,640
It'd be hilarious if Capcom bought them up.

1355
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,640
That would be cool.

1356
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,640
Actually, that would be all kinds of strange,

1357
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,640
because you know there would be that inevitable

1358
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat game,

1359
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
and that's just going to really weird a lot of people out.

1360
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
That's going to be creepy.

1361
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,640
That's going to be like when Sonic and Mario started showing up in the same place.

1362
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,640
I have a feeling if they were ever going to leave Midway,

1363
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,640
which I doubt that they will,

1364
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,640
but if they were, EA would probably buy them up,

1365
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,640
because EA likes to snatch up properties like that,

1366
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,640
and they've got enough money to throw around.

1367
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,640
So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that.

1368
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,640
Because, you know, EA needs a good fighting game franchise,

1369
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:03,640
because that Marvel game that they put out sucked.

1370
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Did they do DC and Marvel?

1371
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,640
Midway did.

1372
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,640
No, it was Marvel vs. DC. Never mind, I'm stupid.

1373
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,640
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, yeah.

1374
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,640
EA did Marvel Ultimate Alliance, right?

1375
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,640
No, that was Activision.

1376
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,640
EA did Rise of the Imperfects or something like that.

1377
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,640
Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer? No, it wasn't Silver Surfer.

1378
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,640
No, Silver Surfer was also Activision.

1379
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,640
Yeah, they did the Rise of the Imperfects game,

1380
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,640
which is so ironic that they had Imperfect in the title,

1381
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:40,640
but yes, it was not very good.

1382
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,640
But, yeah, so we'll see if this actually happens.

1383
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,640
I don't know.

1384
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,640
I just have a feeling that Midway wouldn't part with the Mortal Kombat team that quick.

1385
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,640
I mean, because if they do that, what does Midway have left?

1386
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,640
I mean, nothing.

1387
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Not a lot of good stuff, at least.

1388
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,640
Unreal Tournament, I guess? I don't know.

1389
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,640
Eh, I don't know.

1390
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,640
They're just in financial struggle right now, but I just, I don't know.

1391
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,640
We'll see.

1392
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,640
Well, I'm going to pull up a video here in studio,

1393
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,640
and I apologize you guys can't see this on the radio,

1394
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,640
but what's interesting about this, this is an Unreal...

1395
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,640
Whoa, hello.

1396
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,640
This is Unreal Tournament, but it's a Sonic the Hedgehog level

1397
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,640
using the Unreal engine.

1398
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,640
This is gorgeous.

1399
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,640
I apologize for the volume. Good lord.

1400
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Let's see if we can turn that down.

1401
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,640
There we go.

1402
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,640
Oh, my God.

1403
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,640
This is kind of interesting.

1404
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,640
It looks a little bit like Smash Brothers.

1405
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
It does kind of look like Smash Brothers.

1406
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,640
There's giant lasers and lots of blood.

1407
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
Very interesting level.

1408
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,640
Somebody spent a lot of time on that, that's for sure.

1409
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,640
They did something similar with, like, Legos and stuff before.

1410
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,640
They had Lego maps and stuff, mods.

1411
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,640
What's cool about stuff like this is, you know,

1412
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,640
a member of the PC mods do work on the PlayStation 3 version,

1413
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,640
so you can actually get this for the PlayStation 3 as well.

1414
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,640
All right.

1415
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,640
Enough of that background noise there from the game.

1416
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,640
Question for you, though.

1417
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,640
Which types of mods have you really been into for that?

1418
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
I'm not an Unreal Tournament player, so I can tell you.

1419
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,640
No, I'm not.

1420
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,640
Well, what about, like, you know how they did with Quake?

1421
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,640
Because, you know, there's a lot of Quake.

1422
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,640
Oh, I love the Quake mods.

1423
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,640
I love Kujo and the grappling hook,

1424
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,640
because I'd be used to the grapples with the ceiling.

1425
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Yeah, the grappling hook was awesome in Quake.

1426
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,640
That was a completely, like, user-done mod.

1427
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,640
That changed the game significantly.

1428
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,640
Yeah, I'd grappling hook to the ceiling and drop Kujo down

1429
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,640
and have Kujo attack people, because it was awesome.

1430
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,640
Oh, there's one that I like.

1431
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,640
Hmm.

1432
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,640
The cube mod.

1433
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,640
Like the movie?

1434
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,640
Yeah, like the movie.

1435
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,640
For Quake?

1436
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,640
Yeah.

1437
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,640
Wow.

1438
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,640
Because Quake's kind of old.

1439
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,640
Well, not for Quake, but for one of the later...

1440
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,640
Oh, okay.

1441
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Yeah.

1442
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,640
They did a cube mod, and someone tried to do a hypercube one,

1443
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,640
where it would randomly regenerate the room.

1444
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,640
By the way, I don't mean to bring the Saw topic back up,

1445
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,640
but Cube is a very good example of what's more of, like,

1446
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,640
Cube's a very gory movie.

1447
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,640
The first one especially is extremely gory.

1448
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,640
I haven't seen the later ones, so I can't really speak for them.

1449
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,640
The second one's kind of.

1450
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,640
But more psychological.

1451
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,640
Yes.

1452
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,640
Very psychological, very intellectual type of movie.

1453
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,640
Kind of just a good thing to kind of compare.

1454
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,640
We're talking about this whole psychological thrill versus blood orgy.

1455
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,640
My whole point between that is that I don't really want to see people put into situations

1456
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,640
where they are forced to kill slash maim themselves or each other

1457
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,640
to get out of the situation because of something someone else perceives they did,

1458
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,640
or they might have done.

1459
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,640
The cube, I think, is that you're putting the people together,

1460
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,640
and they can either work together or they can kill each other.

1461
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,640
And hypercube, they can just go crazy because time is freaking out.

1462
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,640
I totally, I just want to say, I support you.

1463
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,640
I cannot stand the Saw movies.

1464
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,640
I'm like, because I saw part of one of them,

1465
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,640
and the guy basically thinks he's helping them out by doing this.

1466
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,640
Yeah.

1467
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,640
And I'm like, dude, no.

1468
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,640
I actually just went on Wikipedia to read the premise again.

1469
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,640
And for me, I'm always the type of person that tries to get my brain into the character.

1470
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,640
And that's something that just gives me a headache thinking about.

1471
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,640
All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to open a can of worms.

1472
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,640
I just wanted to mention that real quick.

1473
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,640
Well, I will also say another defense.

1474
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,640
How about those dolphins?

1475
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,640
I will say another defense about that versus cube,

1476
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,640
is that cube, you don't technically have an antagonist.

1477
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,640
Technically.

1478
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,640
You have the situation as your antagonist.

1479
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,640
All right, let's move on. More gaming news. I'm sorry.

1480
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,640
Dude, gotta.

1481
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,640
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1482
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,640
We want to get to the break and then get to part B.

1483
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,640
It looks like we might do a list list after all tonight.

1484
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,640
And I know we had talked about a topic before the show about doing the, what was it,

1485
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,640
trick we would most want to see in Excitebots.

1486
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,640
But I think I might have a better idea.

1487
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
Let's do two.

1488
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,640
What about this?

1489
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,640
How about this for an idea for tonight's list list?

1490
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
And maybe chat can give their input.

1491
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,640
And if they have topic ideas, they can do that too.

1492
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:57,640
What the DSI most needed in it to get me to buy one.

1493
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,640
Feature that the DSI needed the most to get me to buy one.

1494
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,640
Hmm.

1495
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,640
That might be a good one.

1496
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Very topical. Think about it.

1497
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,640
Hmm.

1498
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
All right, we'll see.

1499
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,640
Is it topical like an ointment?

1500
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,640
All right, we'll see. Maybe the chat room has some better ideas.

1501
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,640
If you have an idea for tonight's list list, let's send it over.

1502
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,640
Well, we have some.

1503
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,640
I got your joke. I got it.

1504
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,640
I just didn't laugh.

1505
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,640
Love ya.

1506
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,640
Well, guess who I think is awesome?

1507
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,640
Me.

1508
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,640
Er.

1509
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,640
Um.

1510
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,640
Steve Weeby.

1511
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,640
Oh, he's pretty cool.

1512
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,640
For anyone who hasn't seen King of Kong,

1513
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,640
the movie is pretty much about him.

1514
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,640
Steve Weeby.

1515
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,640
He's the guy who's trying to beat the big bastard Billy Mitchell,

1516
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,640
who was the guy who had the Twin Galaxies highest score at Donkey Kong.

1517
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,640
And Steve Weeby, he was just a really nice guy who thought he could do a better job,

1518
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,640
and he beat the score.

1519
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,640
And it turns out Billy Mitchell's a cock,

1520
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,640
and sent in a videotape instead of coming in and doing it himself,

1521
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,640
of him topping a million, over a million points on Donkey Kong.

1522
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,640
Um.

1523
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,640
So, Steve Weeby's going to be at E3.

1524
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,640
And that is reason enough for me to go.

1525
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,640
I want to witness this.

1526
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,640
Here's what's interesting, though.

1527
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,640
They did the same thing at E for All.

1528
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,640
And to be fair to our, I guess you could say, you know, I don't know what to call it.

1529
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,640
It's not really parent company, because we own ourselves.

1530
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,640
But, you know, the company that enables us to do this live for you all every Sunday night,

1531
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,640
All Games had a ginormous booth at E for All.

1532
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,640
They had Steve Weeby there trying to break the score for Donkey Kong,

1533
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,640
so it's kind of been there, done that.

1534
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,640
So it's just interesting that now people seem to care because it's E3 and not E for All.

1535
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,640
Which, you know, I get.

1536
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,640
This is going to have far more people.

1537
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,640
Yeah, but I also, nothing would have gotten me to go to E for All, I think.

1538
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,640
Nothing.

1539
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,640
E for All, to me, was just a ginormous waste of time,

1540
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,640
and I could have slept, or done my laundry,

1541
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,640
or, you know, washed dirty dishes with my tongue.

1542
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,640
It just looked better on paper, I think.

1543
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,640
It was one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper.

1544
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,640
At any rate, this is funny because even the guys at Twin Galaxies

1545
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,640
were just saying that it was completely awful of Billy Mitchell,

1546
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,640
and he's just such a dick.

1547
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,640
Oh my God, he's such a dick.

1548
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,640
I don't like him.

1549
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,640
Anyway, the other cool thing, though, is that with the two of them,

1550
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,640
I think, I don't exactly agree with how my source says it,

1551
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,640
because there have been other people who have hit the Donkey Kong kill screen,

1552
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,640
but I think that those two are the only ones who have done it in a live event.

1553
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,640
But the kill screen is basically after you pay so many levels of Donkey Kong,

1554
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,640
it'll just stop.

1555
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,640
It won't work anymore.

1556
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,640
It'll just be game over.

1557
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,640
It doesn't care how many extra lives you have or what your score is or anything.

1558
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,640
It's just like, ugh, I'm dead.

1559
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,640
Seriously.

1560
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,640
Mario will be running around, freeze, dead.

1561
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,640
Don't they show it in the movie?

1562
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,640
Don't they show it in the movie?

1563
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,640
Yeah, they show it.

1564
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,640
But I've seen someone do it.

1565
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
When?

1566
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,640
A long time ago.

1567
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,640
Huh.

1568
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,640
I had to have been like 11.

1569
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,640
Interesting.

1570
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,640
And apparently, it was at Godfather's Pizza.

1571
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,640
It seems to be one of those people who just didn't care.

1572
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,640
Because we also had, I don't think I was that young.

1573
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,640
I think I was a little older than that because we had one of the Mario machines,

1574
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,640
the Nintendo arcade.

1575
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
I bet there are a lot of people out there that could do it and just don't,

1576
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,640
they don't want to get in the scene.

1577
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,640
You know what I mean?

1578
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,640
They do it for themselves.

1579
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,640
I ask him if it broke.

1580
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,640
If he broke the machine, he's like, yeah, I broke the machine.

1581
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,640
And that's all I remember until I saw the movie.

1582
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:43,640
But anyway, I really, I really, really would like to see him do it.

1583
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,640
And I would love to be there when it happens.

1584
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
I think it would be fantastic.

1585
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,640
And that, and I would like to see what Billy Mitchell does about it,

1586
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,640
just because he's a dick and I'm enjoying,

1587
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,640
I'm kind of enjoying the drama a little bit, even though it's kind of stupid.

1588
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,640
If he does, I will self-fornicate into my trousers.

1589
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,640
Can we put it on the internet?

1590
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,640
Can we broadcast that live on G4?

1591
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,640
Yes, yes.

1592
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

1593
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,640
Immediately following, immediately following,

1594
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,640
Steve, we'll be breaking the record live on G4.

1595
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,640
We'll be live on G4, the doctor self-fornicating into his pants.

1596
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
Trousers, all right, into his trousers.

1597
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
He might not be wearing pants.

1598
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,640
He might just be wearing the trousers.

1599
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,640
AcidicVampire in chat says, I'd go to see Billy's flowing hair.

1600
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,640
I don't think he's going to be there at E3.

1601
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
All right, look, let's move on.

1602
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
Maybe he will.

1603
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
I don't know.

1604
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,640
I'm a little low for the drama.

1605
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,640
It was just a movie, people.

1606
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,640
It was just a movie.

1607
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,640
GS68 makes the best point, and immediately thereafter,

1608
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,640
Billy Mitchell posts his new record on YouTube.

1609
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,640
All right, look, a couple more news stories,

1610
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,640
and we've got to take a break.

1611
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,640
Yes.

1612
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
So this is kind of funny.

1613
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,640
For April Fool's Day, Bethesda decided

1614
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,640
that they're going to go ahead and kind of do

1615
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,640
a half-price sale on all the download content for Oblivion,

1616
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,640
which is pretty cool, except there's a catch.

1617
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,640
Horse Armor, they decided, you know what?

1618
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,640
Horse Armor's awesome.

1619
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,640
We're going to double the price of that, just to be funny.

1620
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,640
To which I say nay.

1621
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,640
I say nay.

1622
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,640
And after that, he goes, hey.

1623
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,640
OK, I had to throw that in.

1624
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,640
I think this is their form of an April Fool's joke.

1625
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,640
Like, not that it's a joke.

1626
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,640
Like, it actually happened.

1627
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,640
Yeah, it actually happened.

1628
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,640
But I think it's like an April Fool's joke still.

1629
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,640
You know what I mean?

1630
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,640
Like, it was what they did in celebration of April Fool's

1631
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,640
Day.

1632
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,640
Because everyone realizes that, you know,

1633
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,640
and including them that Horse Armor is ridiculous.

1634
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,640
Yeah, I think even Bethesda realized, OK, you got us.

1635
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
Horse Armor was pretty dumb.

1636
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,640
But people still buy it.

1637
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,640
Yeah, people still buy it.

1638
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,640
I bet there's people that bought it with the double price.

1639
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,640
And it doesn't make Oblivion a bad game by any means,

1640
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,640
because Oblivion is one of the best games they've

1641
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,640
made in many, many years.

1642
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,640
And I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.

1643
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,640
Like, Elder Scrolls V will make me

1644
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,640
self-fornicate in my trousers, I hope.

1645
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,640
Because if it doesn't, I'm going to be very disappointed.

1646
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:18,640
Feature net guaranteed.

1647
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,640
All right.

1648
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,640
Look, last week we brought you a story

1649
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,640
about a man who was suing Microsoft and Lionhead

1650
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,640
over reports that he was being harassed because he was gay.

1651
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,640
You might remember about this.

1652
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Apparently, we're not going to get

1653
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,640
to see the drama unfold in the courtroom,

1654
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,640
because there has been a settlement.

1655
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
Likely didn't think that would happen.

1656
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,640
The case has been settled out of court.

1657
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,640
Microsoft has released a very brief statement.

1658
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,640
And guess what?

1659
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,640
This is all you're going to hear on it,

1660
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,640
because usually with these settlements come gag orders.

1661
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,640
Microsoft says, we are pleased to have

1662
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,640
reached a makeable resolution to this matter with Mr. Durant.

1663
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,640
The terms of the settlement are confidential,

1664
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,640
but we can confirm that Mr. Durant will not

1665
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,640
continue his employment at Lionhead

1666
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,640
as part of the agreement.

1667
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,640
That's probably what he got for taking his case to the media.

1668
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,640
But hey, it sounds like everybody got what they wanted.

1669
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,640
Isn't Bill Gates gay?

1670
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,640
No, he's a wife, dummy.

1671
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,640
He's still gay.

1672
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,640
Like, oh, get my stuff.

1673
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,640
Oh, shut.

1674
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1675
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,640
All right.

1676
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,640
So there you go.

1677
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Follow up to last week, to be fair.

1678
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,640
We wanted to follow up on that.

1679
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,640
It's kind of, we'll never know the real answer

1680
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,640
because of the settlement, but that's life.

1681
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,640
All right, let's get into a segment

1682
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,640
we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1683
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,640
It's called the classic video game of the week.

1684
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,640
And as part of this segment,

1685
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,640
Dark Sakura will dig into her archive of classic gaming

1686
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,640
and find a title that she believes you all should be checking out.

1687
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,640
She's been doing this quite a while now.

1688
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,640
We have, like, over a year's worth of games

1689
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,640
that they're tracking on the OLR Wikipedia,

1690
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,640
which you can get to at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1691
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,640
and go to that little thing that says,

1692
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,640
the little box in the corner with all the pictures

1693
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,640
that has the big W in it,

1694
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,640
and that's how you get to the Wiki on Wikia.

1695
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,640
I can't remember the name of the box.

1696
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,640
Extended play.

1697
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,640
That's it.

1698
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,640
Had a brain fart.

1699
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,640
All right, anyhow, what is the classic game of the week this week, Dark Sakura?

1700
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,640
The classic game of the week is Incredible Crisis.

1701
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,640
That game is crack.

1702
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,640
And by crack, I mean crack.

1703
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,640
Welcome to Incredible Crisis.

1704
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,640
This is a game that came out on the PlayStation.

1705
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,640
And...

1706
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,640
Incredible Crisis with puppies.

1707
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:34,640
The game is about playing in a day in the family member's lives,

1708
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,640
the main character being Taneo.

1709
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,640
And they're trying to get everyone home early today

1710
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
for Grandmother Haruko's birthday.

1711
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:49,640
And this game very much is a parody of daily Japanese life.

1712
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,640
This game is incredibly what the fuck.

1713
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,640
For real. For real.

1714
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,640
I can't think of many more WTF games that have ever been made.

1715
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
I'll let Jamie explain.

1716
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,640
Then I'll give my comment.

1717
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,640
I'll say the music in the game if you'll listen to a little bit of it.

1718
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,640
They're dancing, by the way, in the office.

1719
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,640
I think that's not a good point.

1720
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,640
It's done by the Tokyo Scott Paradise Orchestra.

1721
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,640
So it's good music.

1722
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,640
I love them.

1723
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,640
So basically the way that this goes is you have a bunch of minigames

1724
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,640
where you're playing through people's lives and it's sort of sequential.

1725
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Taneo, for example, this scene is him at work.

1726
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,640
And they are dancing to relieve stress.

1727
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,640
However, you've got this head meter

1728
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,640
and just the redder and more full that it gets.

1729
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,640
Finally his brain just explodes and he stresses out completely and freaks out.

1730
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:57,640
So the way that it goes is that the main character is getting out of work

1731
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:06,640
and he's attacked and has to get away from a boulder that's chasing after him.

1732
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:12,640
And then the emergency crew straps him to a stretcher and send him into traffic.

1733
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,640
So it's one of the minigames that's having to dodge traffic on a stretcher like a luge.

1734
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:25,640
And then he meets this pretty lady and makes out with her in a Ferris wheel.

1735
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,640
And so it's totally like, Rob, if you'll skip up to just a little bit further.

1736
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Any bit.

1737
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,640
There it is.

1738
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,640
This is it.

1739
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,640
There.

1740
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:49,640
Wow.

1741
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:55,640
She tells you how to position yourself for the major boink action.

1742
01:21:55,640 --> 01:22:02,640
Well, technically the translation says he's giving an erotic back massage.

1743
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,640
No.

1744
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:09,640
Dude, they're doing it on a Ferris wheel.

1745
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,640
Exactly.

1746
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,640
And there's fireworks.

1747
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,640
I don't think that's a back massage because that's not how we roll.

1748
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:20,640
DJ Tyrant says, I jizzed in my pantsu.

1749
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:27,640
I'll see you play as Etsuko who is the mother and she's out trying to buy stuff for Haruko's birthday

1750
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,640
and she has to go to the bank and it's being robbed.

1751
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,640
And just all this crap is happening to this family.

1752
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:42,640
So the last one is about the little boy Tsuyoshi and more weird stuff.

1753
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:46,640
He's like turned into an ant or something or shrunk to ant size.

1754
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,640
It's like the game's just freaking bizarre.

1755
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:55,640
It's so much weird crap this family has to go through all for the sake of getting home early.

1756
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:01,640
You know, have a birthday party.

1757
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,640
There are 24 mini games.

1758
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:10,640
Some of them do repeat and it only is a one player game, but it doesn't.

1759
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,640
It can still count as a party because really it's better to pass it around.

1760
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,640
It's a lot of fun.

1761
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,640
This game looks amazing.

1762
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,640
What the fuck was I thinking?

1763
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,640
I remember renting this game years ago and not liking it.

1764
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,640
But granted, it was during a period of my life where I didn't play a lot of video games.

1765
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,640
Admittedly, it was when I was in college and pretty much all I played was Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter.

1766
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,640
And I remember renting this game and going, what the fuck?

1767
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,640
But now I would have an appreciation for the WTF factor.

1768
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,640
And I'm a little disappointed.

1769
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:39,640
I don't think it's available on the PlayStation 3 download library.

1770
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,640
But seeing that Ferris wheel level, I'm kind of not surprised.

1771
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,640
You can borrow mine if you want to.

1772
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,640
Cool.

1773
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,640
Because I have a goal this month to pick all games that I own.

1774
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
Which isn't hard.

1775
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:56,640
But also there were two mini games that actually were left out of the game.

1776
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,640
Because they were very kanji intensive so they couldn't translate them.

1777
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,640
It would have been for him...

1778
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,640
It was very difficult to translate.

1779
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:10,640
To actually translate the play of the game into it because of the way it involved the kanji.

1780
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,640
But one of them was...

1781
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:17,640
Involved the daughter and the family singing karaoke.

1782
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,640
Which I think would have been fun.

1783
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:25,640
But it's a pretty cool little game.

1784
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:30,640
Deathwishing in chat says, seriously man, I wanted to break a brick over my head after I played this.

1785
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,640
It freaked me the fuck out.

1786
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,640
It was like taking acid smoking crackpot and then spinning around in a wash cycle.

1787
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,640
And actually if you want to know...

1788
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,640
I'll link this in the chat room.

1789
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,640
But if you want to know a little bit about part of the problem that went into translating the game.

1790
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,640
Or just stuff that goes into translating and localizing games.

1791
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,640
There's an article and it's from last April actually.

1792
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,640
It's called The Art of Translating Video Games.

1793
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:03,640
And I will link that in the chat room for people to see if they're interested in it.

1794
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,640
It's a pretty cool little article.

1795
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,640
Alright, well that's going to do it.

1796
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,640
Your classic video game of the week, Incredible Crisis.

1797
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,640
Good pick DarkSakura.

1798
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,640
This is one I kind of forgot about but what a WTF kind of game.

1799
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,640
Oh, it really is, isn't it?

1800
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,640
I love the game.

1801
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,640
I mean, I think it's crazy, crazy crack.

1802
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,640
This is exactly what the classic game of the week should be.

1803
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:33,640
One of those games that you kind of forget about but you need to go back and say, wow, that game was like fucking nuts.

1804
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,640
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Launch Radio.

1805
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,640
But stay tuned guys, we have plenty more to come here on Orange Launch Radio.

1806
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,640
Tonight's part B. We're going to do a listless game.

1807
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,640
I didn't see a lot of topics submitted in chat.

1808
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,640
Although, to be honest, I kind of missed a bunch of stuff when they were doing Incredible Crisis.

1809
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,640
So what do you want to do? Do you want to do the Excitebots thing or do you want to do the DSi thing? What do you think?

1810
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,640
I have zero preference.

1811
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,640
Zero preference? I don't know.

1812
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,640
I'd like to do what kind of flavor does Jamie want for pie.

1813
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,640
I don't think that's going to work.

1814
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,640
Let's see how creative we can get making up a trick.

1815
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,640
Alright, you want to do the Excitebots one?

1816
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,640
No, I want to do the DSi one.

1817
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,640
Okay, I think the DSi one is a little more open and topical. So we'll do the DSi.

1818
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,640
We'll do the Excitebots one when the Excitebot comes out.

1819
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,640
Okay, so DSi, feature we most want or wish...

1820
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,640
No, how do we phrase this?

1821
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:26,640
Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it yesterday or today.

1822
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,640
Okay.

1823
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,640
Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it today.

1824
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,640
Because none of us bought it, right?

1825
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,640
Okay, but if it had this feature, I would have.

1826
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,640
So there you go.

1827
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:42,640
Alright, we're going to answer that question and do plenty more here on Orange Lounge Radio, such as talking about Blizzard Entertainment and a possible interesting franchise they could be doing.

1828
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,640
As well as a Silent Hill game on the Wii.

1829
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,640
Wii!

1830
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,640
We're going to talk all about that when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1831
01:26:50,640 --> 01:27:01,640
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, April the 5th of 2009.

1832
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:06,640
We're taping live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

1833
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,640
It's about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night.

1834
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,640
Join us for live taping, why don't you?

1835
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,640
I'm sure you don't have anything better to do on a Sunday night.

1836
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,640
There's nothing on TV, right?

1837
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:23,640
Anyhow, Loki's here in studio, of course. He's playing through Ninja Blade.

1838
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,640
So if you are joining us on this Sunday evening, check it out on Justin TV.

1839
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,640
Dark Sakura's with us as well.

1840
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:34,640
You guys are with us in our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, and on the Skype line a little later in the show.

1841
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,640
We'll be taking your calls and also playing listless a little later as well.

1842
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,640
But we still have some news to get to, and Loki's going to start us off in this Part B with some news.

1843
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:45,640
Yes, there's some interesting rumors coming out.

1844
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,640
Well, actually, I'm getting ahead of myself here.

1845
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:54,640
The rumor is that apparently the Lips mic is going to be good for things other than Lips.

1846
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:59,640
And starting things off, Guitar Hero Metallica actually has support for the Lips mics.

1847
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:06,640
And apparently, Rock Band 2 will be getting a patch sometime this summer that will also add support for the shiny mics.

1848
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:13,640
Because, you know, nothing screams Metallica likes sparkles on the mics.

1849
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:18,640
I don't know. I don't understand why you need it to be supported.

1850
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:24,640
I mean, I would think if people, you know, have Guitar Hero Metallica, most people probably already have World Tour.

1851
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,640
So, you know, I don't know.

1852
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,640
But hey, support for stuff is always good.

1853
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,640
Well, plus the Lips mark is sparkly, you know, and all that.

1854
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,640
So, you know, who doesn't like sparkles?

1855
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,640
Me.

1856
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,640
Oh, good point. The Lips mics are also wireless, says ZachDeft in chat.

1857
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,640
That's true. That's pretty good.

1858
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Isn't there a third-party wireless mic too, though?

1859
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,640
Um, I don't know.

1860
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,640
You know, I've never played the Lips games.

1861
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,640
I'm just kind of burned out on the karaoke games.

1862
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,640
Between the Rock Band, between SingStar, ABBA, and the other SingStar stuff that's available on PS3,

1863
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,640
I kind of didn't want to get Lips because I don't need another one.

1864
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,640
You know, SingStars, as far as karaoke games go, SingStar is rock solid enough, you know?

1865
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,640
Lips kind of was late to the party, if that makes sense.

1866
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:14,640
Also, possibly late to the party, a revival of Redneck Rampage?

1867
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,640
Now, here's one of those things I look at and I go,

1868
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,640
surely this is an April Fool's joke, but I...

1869
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,640
I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at the...

1870
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,640
Redneck Rampage is pretty freaking funny.

1871
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,640
So it's a game about my hometown?

1872
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,640
I think it's stupid. I think it's one of the stupidest video games I've ever seen.

1873
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,640
Like, I realize it's supposed to be a parody, but WTF.

1874
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,640
But, okay, wait, I'm not done yet.

1875
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,640
But apparently this story broke on, like, the 4th of April or whatever, but here we go.

1876
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,640
Blizzard, apparently there's a rumor that Blizzard Entertainment

1877
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,640
actually has the Redneck Rampage brand right now.

1878
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,640
And apparently this is some research done by a website called INC Gamers.

1879
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,640
They were doing some trademark following or what have you.

1880
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,640
And apparently Redneck Rampage was originally trademarked in 97,

1881
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,640
then Redneck Rampage rides again.

1882
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,640
Redneck Rampage sucking grits on Route 66.

1883
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,640
Yes, that was really the name of apparently the 3rd game that was made.

1884
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,640
They are apparently all now under Blizzard's control.

1885
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,640
So Blizzard apparently owns the rights to, you know, these games.

1886
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,640
And I don't know, is that through, like, acquisitions and things like that? Who knows.

1887
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:18,640
But, yeah, and apparently, you know, Activision actually acquired the Redneck Rampage thing.

1888
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,640
But why would it then be given to Blizzard and not Activision?

1889
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,640
Don't know.

1890
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,640
But apparently there are some Blizzard folks on staff who actually worked on the original Redneck Rampage.

1891
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,640
I hope to hell this doesn't mean they're making a new one.

1892
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,640
I mean, talk about unnecessary, unnecessarys.

1893
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,640
X-Link in chat suggests Redneck for the iPhone.

1894
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,640
You know what? I would rather it be something like that.

1895
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,640
And DJ Tyrant said Blizzard isn't this stupid, are they?

1896
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,640
And hopefully not.

1897
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,640
DJ Tyrant, maybe it's something that's a nod to those employees who were there that worked on the game.

1898
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,640
I don't know.

1899
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,640
But let's just hope it's just an interesting observation and nothing more.

1900
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,640
I don't know, DarkSakura, would you buy a new Redneck Rampage?

1901
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,640
Would I buy it? No.

1902
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,640
Would I buy it? Yes. Definitely.

1903
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,640
I'll tell you what I'd buy. A new Hexic. Or Hexen.

1904
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,640
Hexen!

1905
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,640
Those games were pretty awesome.

1906
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,640
Heck yeah, I love Hexen.

1907
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,640
Anyhow.

1908
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,640
That game was awesome, though.

1909
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,640
What, Redneck Rampage?

1910
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:21,640
It was using the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D, but it had more features for it.

1911
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,640
How about they just bring us Duke Nukem Forever?

1912
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,640
Yeah, Hexen uses the same engine as Quake, right?

1913
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,640
Yeah.

1914
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,640
And it was awesome.

1915
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:34,640
I just like turning people into chickens.

1916
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:49,640
Well, as we covered on our last show, we're actually supposed to be getting those arcade games coming out for the Wii service.

1917
01:31:49,640 --> 01:32:00,640
Well, Sega is also taking a step to put actual arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade a lot more than what we've been seeing lately.

1918
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:08,640
We're getting, and this makes my heart soar, Virtualon or Tariotangrim.

1919
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,640
I don't have to figure out my Dreamcast to play it, except I have twin sticks.

1920
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,640
So it's better to play it on the Dreamcast, but I digress.

1921
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:23,640
There's release ratings for Shinobi and Altered Beast.

1922
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:27,640
So that means System 16 will be getting some of those.

1923
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,640
That's cool.

1924
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:36,640
Also, there is one that's rumored as a Sega Vintage Collection Volume 2.

1925
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:44,640
And there's also other Genesis titles listed as Comic Zone, Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.

1926
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:49,640
Gunstar Heroes, of course, being one of the best Sega games ever.

1927
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,640
Now, Comic Zone was already on the Virtual Console, though.

1928
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,640
This is a Virtual Console. This is Live Arcade.

1929
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,640
I thought you said for the Wii.

1930
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:02,640
I started off with the Wii because we had talked about Sega arcade games coming out on Wii.

1931
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:09,640
To recap, last week on Orange Challenge Radio, Rob ate a live frog.

1932
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:16,640
And Loki's head exploded, leaving Jamie as the victor in Battle Royale Orange Challenge Edition.

1933
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:24,640
Anyway, of course, you know, really you can play a lot of those on the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.

1934
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,640
Not Outrun, though.

1935
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,640
Shinobi Arcade.

1936
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,640
Not Outrun. Surprisingly absent from the collection.

1937
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,640
Did you know that Yuji Naka officially retired?

1938
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,640
I did hear that this week, actually.

1939
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,640
I don't think it made our show roll for whatever reason, but I did hear that news.

1940
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,640
Dan got to meet him.

1941
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,640
Cool.

1942
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,640
At E3! One year.

1943
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:46,640
Isn't it random how you'll just run into people that you just totally adore for their video game creations at E3?

1944
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,640
I got my hug on with not Koji Kondo, the other, Igarashi.

1945
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,640
I got a picture with a Kiriyamaoka. That was the thing.

1946
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,640
I would hump him.

1947
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,640
Which E3 is not supposed to be about fanboy moments, but look.

1948
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,640
Yes, it is.

1949
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,640
Here's the thing.

1950
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:06,640
In defense, look, I realize E3 is supposed to be a trade event only open to journalists and people in the media.

1951
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,640
Here's the thing. A good game journalist is a little bit fanboy.

1952
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,640
Little bit.

1953
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:16,640
They need to be fair, but I think a good game, you have to have a passion for video games.

1954
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,640
And you have to have your obvious favors and things like that.

1955
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:23,640
So I completely justify my, you know, screaming like a little 12 year old girl when I saw a Kiriyamaoka, okay?

1956
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,640
So there you go.

1957
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,640
That, he's also, it doesn't hurt that he's really good looking.

1958
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:34,640
Aww, Black Wolf and DJ Tyrant both in chat said, I met Rob Roberts at E3.

1959
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,640
Aww.

1960
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,640
Yeah.

1961
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,640
No, we said celebrities.

1962
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,640
We're internet celebrities.

1963
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,640
Black Wolf said, I totally squeed with fanboy delight when I met Rob Roberts.

1964
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,640
He did actually.

1965
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,640
I have yet to meet Rob Roberts, just so you guys know.

1966
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,640
We did the whole, oh my god, oh my god.

1967
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,640
I totally blush with embarrassment after running into Hideo Kojima.

1968
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,640
Like three E3s in a row.

1969
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,640
I don't know how this happens.

1970
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:06,640
If it happens again this year, I'm gonna just go off and cry, or tell him to give me a job.

1971
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,640
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

1972
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,640
Let's stop talking about E3 and who we may or may not see at E3 this year.

1973
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,640
So, this is kind of weird, I guess.

1974
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:24,640
Last week we talked about how File Front was going away, and, you know, oh darn.

1975
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,640
But, apparently, it's back.

1976
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:35,640
And, it says File Front has been acquired by the original founders of the site, and will not be suspended as previously announced.

1977
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,640
This is not an April Fools joke.

1978
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,640
And, that's funny.

1979
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,640
So, what once was dead is now back.

1980
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:50,640
Well, congratulations to the folks at File Front for inserting a coin to continue.

1981
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,640
Congratulations.

1982
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,640
That's all it took, right?

1983
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,640
And, in other news, EGM is coming back.

1984
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,640
Oh wait, no, that's not true.

1985
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,640
April Fools.

1986
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,640
Alright.

1987
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,640
That would have been a great, like, EGM yearly joke, right?

1988
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,640
Because they used to do these epic April Fools jokes every year.

1989
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:10,640
Like, you know, remember Ermac in Mortal Kombat was born of an EGM April Fools joke?

1990
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,640
That could have been their epic joke this year, that they're coming back.

1991
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,640
And then, aw, April Fools, it's a joke.

1992
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,640
That would have been insulting for their fan base, yes.

1993
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,640
Alright.

1994
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,640
Not an April Fools joke.

1995
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:29,640
When this news broke on April Fools Day, a lot of us were like, is this an April Fools joke?

1996
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,640
Apparently, it's not.

1997
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:35,640
It was announced that there is a Silent Hill game coming out for the Wii.

1998
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,640
It's called Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

1999
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,640
Here's the thing.

2000
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:44,640
It's a remake, sort of, of the first game, but they don't want you to call it a remake of the first game.

2001
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,640
It's a reimagining of the first game.

2002
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,640
Which, you know, means Boohoo, no Pyramid Head, but at the same time...

2003
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,640
The first game didn't have Pyramid Head.

2004
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,640
Right, Boohoo, no Pyramid Head.

2005
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,640
But the first game was pretty fucking phenomenal.

2006
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,640
And a lot of people still say it was probably the best game in the series.

2007
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:03,640
So, you know, definitely going to be a must-have for Silent Hill fans.

2008
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,640
And a quote from the magazine where this originally appeared, Nintendo Power.

2009
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,640
The characters play different roles.

2010
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:12,640
Things don't necessarily happen in the same order.

2011
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,640
And the story is taken in lots of new directions.

2012
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,640
You still play as Harry Mason.

2013
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,640
You're still looking for your daughter.

2014
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,640
You don't see familiar elements, but they're all twisted to betray your expectations.

2015
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,640
So this is kind of cool because it sounds like maybe it's going to be fucking with what people are expecting in the game.

2016
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,640
Because they think it's going to be a remake.

2017
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,640
That's going to be kind of cool.

2018
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:36,640
So, apparently though, yes, they are going to exploit the Wii thing a little bit.

2019
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,640
They are going to use some of the Wii remote action.

2020
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,640
Some of the in-game puzzles will use Waggle in it.

2021
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,640
You know, I heard...

2022
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,640
Maybe I'm not supposed to repeat this, but I heard a long time ago...

2023
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:54,640
Rumors that there were some tests being done in Konami of a Silent Hill type game where you would use the Wii mode as the flashlight as you were moving around.

2024
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,640
And doesn't that sound scary?

2025
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,640
I hope that concept made it into this game somehow.

2026
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,640
I think that could be super creepy.

2027
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,640
Fantastic.

2028
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,640
And pretty cool.

2029
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,640
If executed correctly. I mean, it could also be kind of dumb.

2030
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,640
And thank god, because they should have been doing this kind of stuff on the Wii since the beginning.

2031
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,640
So if they start doing that, great.

2032
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,640
Yeah.

2033
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:20,640
By the way, also, fans, you should know, part of the thing that bugged about the first Silent Hill game, that locked doors were everywhere.

2034
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,640
Now there will be a way through every locked door.

2035
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:27,640
You will no longer have to find that most of the doors in the game are permanently shut.

2036
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,640
Sounds like it's going to be pretty awesome.

2037
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:34,640
So, I'm definitely looking forward to this.

2038
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,640
More information, at least.

2039
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,640
I bet this is going to be one of the big things we're going to see at E3.

2040
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,640
Or, Konami's having an event, if I remember right, this next week.

2041
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:46,640
I mean, we weren't invited, but they're doing the Saw thing, and I know they're showing that.

2042
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,640
I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up as well, along with your mandatory DDR and Yu-Gi-Oh for the year.

2043
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,640
So, we'll see.

2044
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,640
And, oh yeah, don't forget Winning Eleven.

2045
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,640
All those games, you've got to get your mandatory entries for the year in there.

2046
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,640
So, we'll see.

2047
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,640
Are you excited about the Silent Hill Wii make?

2048
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,640
Yes.

2049
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,640
You're a clever one.

2050
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:05,640
Alright.

2051
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:12,640
Rob made me go hee for a game on the Wii.

2052
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,640
Well, good. Let's hope there's more Wii-going Wii games later on.

2053
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,640
Do you think you might have one in this next story, Dark Sakura?

2054
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,640
I might.

2055
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,640
Mm-hmm.

2056
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,640
We can see.

2057
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,640
Mm-hmm.

2058
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,640
Because it's about Puyo Puyo.

2059
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,640
Oh, never mind then.

2060
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,640
Oh, hush.

2061
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:37,640
There was, I don't know if you remember hearing about Project Ringo.

2062
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,640
There had been talk going around about it.

2063
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:49,640
It turns out that Project Ringo is a new Puyo Puyo game that's going to be on DS, Wii, and PSP.

2064
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,640
And, of course, we get it as Puyo Pop.

2065
01:39:53,640 --> 01:40:01,640
And it will be technically it's just Puyo Puyo 7, which is more Puyo Puyo.

2066
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:08,640
But you also will have a transformation mode, which will let you actually deflect attacks,

2067
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:14,640
instead of, I guess, just preventing them from happening, and have larger chain combos.

2068
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,640
So, that would be pretty cool.

2069
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:26,640
But there should be some, I would say, information on the Project Ringo site when it actually goes active.

2070
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,640
Actually, I think it is active.

2071
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,640
Yeah.

2072
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,640
It is active as of the third.

2073
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,640
So, I'll link that into the chat room.

2074
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,640
But it's the same damn puzzle game you've played for the last, like, 20 years, right?

2075
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,640
Yeah.

2076
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,640
It's more Puyo Puyo.

2077
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,640
All right.

2078
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,640
But, hey, if it's got online and you say something-

2079
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,640
It's not Puyo Puyo!

2080
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,640
Game guru being a butt.

2081
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,640
All right.

2082
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,640
But you are a big fan of the Puyo Puyo series, so you'll probably buy this if no one-

2083
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,640
I'm a big enough fan to pronounce it correctly.

2084
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,640
All right.

2085
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,640
Yes.

2086
01:40:53,640 --> 01:41:02,640
And, I don't know, we kind of talked a little bit in Part A about the new, well, not really a new game,

2087
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:06,640
but, you know, Tales of Vesperia coming to the PS3.

2088
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:12,640
Well, there is a new Tales game coming to the Wii as well, Tales of Graces.

2089
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:17,640
And it's been announced for the Wii thanks to Fumito Magazine.

2090
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:21,640
And it looks actually neat.

2091
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:28,640
It's supposed to be, I don't know, similar to, I guess, the other Tales games as far as appearance goes.

2092
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:37,640
They haven't really said, you know, what the game is about other than, you know, as an adventure protecting people.

2093
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,640
Or is it just waggle, waggle, waggle?

2094
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,640
So the last Tales game that they put out was okay on the Wii.

2095
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:47,640
And then this is supposed to be coming out in Japan in the winter.

2096
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:51,640
So I guess we'll see more about this later on.

2097
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,640
Well, some rumors are going around about upcoming Wii titles.

2098
01:41:54,640 --> 01:42:03,640
There's apparently a list that was leaked to the internet this week showing an upcoming release date list of some various games coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

2099
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:10,640
But here's the interesting thing. It dates Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort on July 10th.

2100
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:16,640
It also dates, here's the other interesting thing, Wii Fit Plus on November 19th.

2101
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:21,640
Nintendo repackaging something and slapping Plus in front of it? No. You don't say.

2102
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,640
Well, now here's something you should take though from this.

2103
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,640
And, you know, yes chatters, I am aware.

2104
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,640
Apparently this list came out of the Netherlands.

2105
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,640
It wasn't actually from the US.

2106
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,640
And, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

2107
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:37,640
But I think most of us are looking at this going, Wii Fit Plus? Yeah, I can see that.

2108
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,640
And I can see that happening.

2109
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,640
That's innovation for you.

2110
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:46,640
Well, but why, you know, why Nintendo should be leaking their release dates?

2111
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,640
I don't know what the secrecy is. It's like, my god, we're not going to tell you.

2112
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,640
It's like, good god.

2113
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,640
Somebody might steal the idea to repackage something and add Plus to it.

2114
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:58,640
Oh, wait a second. Guilty Gear did it first.

2115
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:01,640
Well, doesn't, I mean, Loki, you kind of have an insider perspective on this.

2116
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:06,640
Don't sometimes the retailers and the folks on the inside have to know this a little sooner before the consumer?

2117
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:11,640
Yes, because Nintendo's a bitch and they, other than providing horrible pricing on stuff,

2118
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:16,640
they also require two months prior notice for as far as orders and stuff go.

2119
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,640
And then they tell you, oh, by the way, you're only getting 10% of that.

2120
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:27,640
So, yeah, something like this, I could see them, you know, positioning it as, you know, a big holiday title.

2121
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:33,640
You know, they're trying to basically, because Wii Fit, you know, it's still doing very well, it's still very hard to find,

2122
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,640
and now we're going to have Wii Fit Plus.

2123
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,640
No, no, no, no. I saw a stack of Wiis at two different Best Buys this weekend.

2124
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:40,640
Wii Fit.

2125
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,640
Oh, sorry, Wii Fit. I've still seen that around, too.

2126
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:46,640
It's still, you'd be surprised, it's still hard to get from Nintendo.

2127
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,640
Same with Mario Kart. What the hell is up with Mario Kart? I don't get that either.

2128
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:59,640
But, for whatever reason, I could totally see this happening, you know, and it's going to be something stupid.

2129
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:05,640
I don't know if it's going to now support Wii Motion Plus for something, but I'm not buying it, that's for sure.

2130
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,640
Probably more crappy minigames. I mean, well, I shouldn't say that.

2131
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:13,640
You know, Wii Fit isn't bad, per se, it's just not for the hardcore gamer.

2132
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:19,640
But there's definitely an audience for it. It's not a bad piece of software, let's put it that way.

2133
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:30,640
But really, okay, let me put it this way. Is this what they're going to come, you know, is this what they're going to basically load their guns with for their E3 press conference?

2134
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:38,640
Because if they're like, and you thought we forgot you, core gamer, Wii Fit Plus.

2135
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,640
Yeah, because right now it's looking like more of the same, and that's scary.

2136
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,640
Well, no, I actually think that the Motion Plus is going to be the big thing.

2137
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:50,640
But my concern is, because Nintendo is such a bitch about revealing things to people or telling them stuff,

2138
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,640
I'm just afraid that they're going to alienate the developers and nobody's going to develop anything.

2139
01:44:54,640 --> 01:45:00,640
You know, I think number one, they should have developed Wii, I mean the Wiimote should have had this extra sensor in it anyway.

2140
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:05,640
But then I just think they're going to alienate the producers again and nobody's going to make good games for it.

2141
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:12,640
Here's what's going to happen. They basically said, okay, how are we going to make money based on, you know, our previous history with stuff?

2142
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,640
What's sold so far? Okay, let's look at it today.

2143
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:22,640
Okay, what's our number one selling product? Peripheral with game for, you know, like ten bucks more, okay?

2144
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:28,640
So we tried that again with the Wii Zapper. Not quite, you know, where we needed to be, you know, it's peripheral with, you know, a game.

2145
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,640
But it still sold pretty well because of that.

2146
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:35,640
Now, okay, what else sells really well? Well, everyone buys a Wii system for Wii Sports.

2147
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:40,640
Okay, there we go. We're going to do Wii Sports Resort. We're going to throw in something that people need to buy.

2148
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:44,640
So not only is it the Wii Sports angle, but it's also the Wii Play angle at the same time.

2149
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:47,640
Oh, and now we're going to do the same thing, you know, with Wii Fit.

2150
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:52,640
We're going to do Wii Fit Plus. We're going to add some other new thing that people probably don't need.

2151
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:57,640
And then we're going to try to resell it again because people eat up Wii Fit and they want to buy a Wii system for Wii Fit.

2152
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:03,640
What about the Core Gamer? Oh, well, you get some ported GameCube games. Sweet.

2153
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:10,640
And then we get, you know, a version of Excite Truck, which has really been toned down kid-wise.

2154
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:14,640
And I hear they removed the whole, you know, custom soundtrack thing, which sucks.

2155
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,640
Why? Let's go step backwards, you know, as far as innovation goes.

2156
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:24,640
And I will bet you anything there will be multiple colored Wiimotes and people will piss themselves over it because I don't know why.

2157
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,640
Oh, I got to own a red remote now.

2158
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:34,640
I just have to disagree on the MotionPlus because for a lot of us that bought the Wii, we thought it was going to have one-to-one control from the beginning.

2159
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:39,640
And I still think it should have. I don't understand why they didn't just make the Wiimote with this extra.

2160
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:44,640
And I've heard people, I've heard things online that say that it does add that one-to-one control and the possibilities are great.

2161
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:50,640
I just, I'm going to be pissed if Nintendo alienates all the producers again and doesn't actually, you know,

2162
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:57,640
like I heard that LucasArts was upset because they weren't aware of this before they came out with their lightsaber game.

2163
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:02,640
Yeah, AlphaKananagram backing you up in chat says they already alienated the devs.

2164
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,640
That lightsaber game and the game using the lightsaber, the devs were pissed.

2165
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:10,640
And sure enough, what does Wii Sports Resort have? Like a fencing game that is, it's fucking lightsabers.

2166
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:13,640
And so I think that the potential is huge for those of us who bought the Wii.

2167
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:18,640
We were willing to sacrifice graphics because it was going to have this complete interactivity of one-to-one control.

2168
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:22,640
I'm just afraid that they're not going to support people on this, so.

2169
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:29,640
You know, maybe we'll get knocked completely on our ass that they're going to reveal that game for the core gamer.

2170
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:36,640
They're going to, you know, Reggie's going to whip it out and say, you know, here it is, Kid Icarus, the game you've all been waiting for, something like that.

2171
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,640
You know, and it's going to rock.

2172
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:39,640
Right, I hope.

2173
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,640
I hope.

2174
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,640
I'm just going to put out a good music game again.

2175
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:48,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There are patterns for a reason. And, you know, what they're going to announce, what?

2176
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,640
A new Pikmin game. Big whoopin' shit, okay?

2177
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:58,640
You know, big deal, okay? New Pikmin game. Oh, the fans have been crying for it, yada yada yada.

2178
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,640
Maybe a new Zelda game.

2179
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:05,640
Okay, we're really going to get down to the point where we're just re-releasing the same franchise games over and over.

2180
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,640
Let's do something new, okay?

2181
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:11,640
I mean, the Wii Sports stuff is okay, but let's create a new character. Let's do something different.

2182
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,640
Let's make, you know, something really epic.

2183
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:22,640
But no, we're going to, you know, now you see the majority of the people that own Wiis aren't the core gamer anymore, so you're not the target audience.

2184
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:30,640
And so, unfortunately, you're not going to get these games, or if you are going to get these games, there's going to be sacrifices made, and you're going to have to wait a long time for them.

2185
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:37,640
You know, so if you want your new Zelda game, well, you better be prepared to wait until, like, 2010 fall, you know, if that.

2186
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:56,640
And I totally agree with you. I totally agree, and I think that my thing is with the Wii Motion Plus is that this would open up the possibility for that true new style of gaming that we were all expecting with the Wii, where it's like your virtual reality, but I'm just afraid that the third-party producers are not going to feel like they're supported by Nintendo.

2187
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:02,640
I don't think that is. What's going to happen is you're going to see a bunch of these games now. It supports the Wii Motion Plus. It's a sequel, Red Steel 2.

2188
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:09,640
Oh, but the controls still suck. You know, it's not going to help anything. It's good as a new tool and stuff, but it's not anything innovative.

2189
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,640
It's not, it's not, it's just fixing a problem. That's all it is.

2190
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:22,640
And it's another peripheral that they can sell for ten bucks, bundle it with a game, and then they're going to include, you know, the remotes. They're going to have it built into it now.

2191
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,640
And then it's going to be something else. It's going to be always something to fix the flaws of what the system was.

2192
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:33,640
Not new. And I won't be damn surprised if there's anything from this press conference that surprises me.

2193
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:39,640
But, you know, last year it was just like, yep, stupid peripheral. Really funny.

2194
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:44,640
You know, with the whole Wii Zapper. It used to be awesome. The original Wii Zapper was really kick-ass.

2195
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,640
When they first showed off, you know, the prototype and all that stuff, they should have stuck with that.

2196
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:54,640
No, now it's a plastic shell that I don't even use anymore. The third-party peripherals are better than the goddamn Wii Zapper.

2197
01:49:54,640 --> 01:50:00,640
All right. Well, we'll see. We are two months away from E3, and a lot of these questions will be answered.

2198
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:06,640
But in the meantime, we're going to answer some of your questions by going to a segment we like to do every week known as the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

2199
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:11,640
By the way, I do want to remind everybody in studio and in our chat live that we are doing List List tonight.

2200
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:17,640
And the topic tonight for List List, which we'll get to a little later in the show, but everybody should be thinking about their lists, right, for List List. It's been a little while.

2201
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:24,640
It would be the feature that the DSi should have had to get me to buy one today. So be thinking about that.

2202
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:31,640
In the meantime, let's open up the mailbag, mailbagorangehoundsradio.com, and read some of your emails right now.

2203
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,640
DarkSakura.

2204
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:38,640
We have one from Deathwishing. Hey, guys, remember how I called and ranted about how Microsoft stole my $20?

2205
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:39,640
I do remember that.

2206
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:46,640
Well, patience paid off. Not only did I get my original points of $1600 back, but I threw in an extra $1600.

2207
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:51,640
I guess this shows you that being polite and waiting gets you a reward better than bitching 24-7.

2208
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:55,640
Anyways, I'm gonna sleep now. K, thanks, bye.

2209
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,640
I'm glad to hear all was resolved.

2210
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:02,640
This is the next one is from Isabelle.

2211
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:09,640
Well, first off, I want to start off by saying hi. How's it going? I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long while now, and I hope all of it is great for you guys.

2212
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:16,640
Now to get to the point of my email, I finally got to play Tatsunoko vs Capcom after what seems like a million years, and all I have to say about that game is wow.

2213
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:21,640
I've heard how you guys said it was well done and really awesome, but I didn't expect it to be this awesome.

2214
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:26,640
I played its arcade version, and for an arcade game, it's really good.

2215
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,640
DarkSakura, have you gotten to play the arcade version?

2216
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,640
Another arcade game I got to play was Tekken 6.

2217
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:38,640
Just from the arcade version, I can tell that once it hits homes, no one will leave their couches. Yes, it really was that good.

2218
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:42,640
So I wish you all the best, and thanks for taking time for reading this email.

2219
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:49,640
I actually haven't played the arcade version yet. I never got a chance to go check it out at any of the state local places that have it.

2220
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,640
Yeah, I had no idea there was an arcade version of Tatsunoko vs Capcom. That's pretty rad.

2221
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,640
Well, it originally was the arcade version.

2222
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,640
You know, and I should have known that, but yet I didn't. I don't know why.

2223
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:04,640
But I have played the Wii version, and I played with Jun and Ken as my team, and I was very happy with it.

2224
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:08,640
I still need to get out and play Tekken 6, because I love Tekken and everything.

2225
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:14,640
So, no, but I can't really say anything else I got, you know, more about any arcade versions of them.

2226
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:18,640
Just that Tatsunoko vs Capcom is super cool.

2227
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:22,640
And the last email. This comes from Spirit of Radio.

2228
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,640
Okay.

2229
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,640
I've been playing video games since I was little and never been scared in any game.

2230
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,640
I'm sorry, but Silent Hill 2 to 3 are boring and controls like garbage.

2231
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:35,640
I will agree with some of the control issues.

2232
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:39,640
The only game that honestly gave me a hard time going to sleep was the original Manhunt.

2233
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:44,640
The concept of someone forcing you to do snuff films is the stuff of nightmares.

2234
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:50,640
Cool first time sending guys an email. Anyways, keep up the great podcast, you guys.

2235
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:56,640
Also, Manhunt is something that I find repugnant. I don't really care for the game at all.

2236
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:04,640
I like the psychological type of edge. The stuff that requires intelligence and not, you know, blood.

2237
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:09,640
Well, yay for first time emailers, if nothing else.

2238
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:12,640
Yeah. Thanks for emailing. Keep it up.

2239
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:16,640
Alright. That's it for the emails. Alright.

2240
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:22,640
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for reading in a future show.

2241
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:28,640
In the meantime, let's get back to some gaming news. We just have a few more stories and then we're going to get into tonight's list list.

2242
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,640
And we're going to respond to some of the tweets we got on Twitter this week.

2243
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,640
We're going to respond to those in just a little bit.

2244
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,640
We got one more round of stories, though, starting off with Loki.

2245
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:41,640
Yes. It's interesting how, you know, April Fool's jokes can now become reality.

2246
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:54,640
Basically, THQ and the developers of Red Faction, Guerrilla, had a funny little video that they put out of a fictional weapon that they were going to, you know, originally they were teasing.

2247
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,640
They were going to include in the game the Ostrich Hammer, which is basically a giant ostrich that you use as a hammer.

2248
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:04,640
And funny enough, it actually made it into the game.

2249
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:10,640
Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that the company behind it, Volition, also puts out Saints Row.

2250
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:15,640
So they are, of course, very used to quirky, weird shit.

2251
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:20,640
So, Ostrich Hammer, that almost sounds like something that should be in, like, Team Fortress 2, but...

2252
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:23,640
Sounds like the name of a real good metal band.

2253
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:26,640
Ostrich Hammer!

2254
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,640
But, yeah, so you'll be able to hit people with an ostrich.

2255
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:34,640
Well, maybe you can use the Ostrich Hammer to mash buttons as fast as you can.

2256
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:38,640
It's a new app that's coming to the iPhone. It's called the Hudson Button Masher.

2257
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:42,640
And, yes, all you do in this game is you mash buttons.

2258
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,640
Look, here's the thing.

2259
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:49,640
I guess what the deal is is that there's this guy at Hudson, you go all the way back,

2260
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,640
and that's actually where the name Master Higgins comes from, was his name.

2261
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,640
That's where the guy in Adventure Island comes from.

2262
01:54:54,640 --> 01:55:02,640
Apparently, he was really, really famous in the 1980s because he could actually press a button 16 times in one second.

2263
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:05,640
16 times in one second, if you can believe that.

2264
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:14,640
Now, they made this little device back in, like, the 80s to kind of cash in on this whole button mashing thing called the Shooting Watch.

2265
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:19,640
And you could use this to try and match, beat, or try and tie this guy's score.

2266
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:26,640
Well, Shooting Watch has now been ported to the iPhone, so you can try and mash buttons as fast as you want.

2267
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:27,640
But here's the thing.

2268
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:30,640
I don't think this thing's going to be that...

2269
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:38,640
It's going to cost you 99 cents. It's not going to be as real as the real deal because I don't think the iPhone screen is good enough.

2270
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,640
It's not going to match the electronics of an actual button.

2271
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:48,640
But look, if you just want a stupid app, pointless thing, have fun.

2272
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,640
I guess you could say a little piece of history.

2273
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,640
There might be people that remember these things.

2274
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,640
Whoa.

2275
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:56,640
Not yet. It's not time for listless yet. Shut up.

2276
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:01,640
There might be people that remember these things that want to, you know, relive it.

2277
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,640
I guess it's 99 cents. I don't know.

2278
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:06,640
Impress your friends with how fast you can hammer the screen on your iPhone.

2279
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,640
Whatever.

2280
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:10,640
Yeah, and break your iPhone screen, please.

2281
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:13,640
16 times in one second.

2282
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,640
Like, imagine, 16 times. Ready?

2283
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,640
One 1,000.

2284
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:19,640
Okay, 16 times. Right in that.

2285
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,640
Crazy.

2286
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,640
One more story, then listless.

2287
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:25,640
That makes my brain hurt to think about.

2288
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:34,640
That would have come in really freaking handy doing the drinking minigame in Chrono Trigger.

2289
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:40,640
Anyway, speaking of, for iPhone, there is actually a good game coming out.

2290
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:43,640
Cooking Mama's a good game. This is a good game.

2291
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:50,640
There is a version of Galaga that is coming out, which was...

2292
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:56,640
You could actually play this particular version in...

2293
01:56:56,640 --> 01:57:01,640
I do believe that it came out in 1981? No.

2294
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,640
There was the 1995 one.

2295
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,640
That was the Galaga Remix.

2296
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,640
But, Galaga Remix is coming out on iPhone.

2297
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:13,640
I remember that. Wasn't that packaged with Pac-Man and Dig Dug Remixes?

2298
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:14,640
I do believe so.

2299
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,640
I think so. I remember. They had that at a local arcade around here. It's closed down.

2300
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:28,640
And actually, as far as I was always aware, the Galaga Remix was based off of the Galaga 90 and Galaga 88.

2301
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,640
But that was just in my observation.

2302
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:34,640
But it's supposed to be coming out on the iPhone.

2303
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:37,640
And it will be $5.99.

2304
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:45,640
And you can use directional buttons, but there's also a sliding method and there is a tilt method.

2305
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:48,640
Which I'm going to use the buttons, I swear.

2306
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:54,640
Because trying to play pole position in tilt mode is not fun.

2307
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,640
So, it's going to be pretty good. I think it's going to be good.

2308
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,640
I was watching a video about it. It looks pretty good.

2309
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,640
Let's have an interesting round table on this point here before we get into the list tonight.

2310
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,640
Because an interesting comment was said in chat.

2311
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:07,640
And I think everybody might want to have to say something to this.

2312
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:09,640
GameGuru in chat says,

2313
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,640
I don't see how you love the iPhone and hate on the DSi.

2314
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:15,640
Apple's worse with updating hardware.

2315
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:17,640
I didn't say I hate it.

2316
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,640
No, you as in all of us.

2317
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,640
Well, I don't hate the DSi.

2318
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:25,640
I just haven't, I have other things to spend my money on right now, like Disneyland.

2319
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,640
As far as, for me, here it is.

2320
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:29,640
I already have a Nintendo DS.

2321
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:33,640
What does the DSi add to it that the DS didn't already have?

2322
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:37,640
Like, you know, I'm not saying the DS is a bad gaming system. It's not.

2323
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:42,640
And if you don't have a DS yet, the DSi is probably a pretty good purchase for you.

2324
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,640
I would actually recommend it over the DS at this point.

2325
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:49,640
Because you know there's going to be those games later on that are going to have the DSi only functionality.

2326
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,640
So you might want to think about that.

2327
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:55,640
But with the iPhone, at least before I got one, there was really nothing like it out there before.

2328
01:58:55,640 --> 01:59:05,640
And yeah, Apple's really bad about releasing these updates with the 3G and the GPS and all this stuff a year later.

2329
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:10,640
But at the same time, they're also really good about updating the software.

2330
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:16,640
Like, think about it. The iPhones, when they first launched, didn't have the App Store and the user-made apps and those things built into it.

2331
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:20,640
So, you know, that was something that Apple added for everybody.

2332
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:26,640
You know, whereas I feel like with the DSi, there was nothing being given to current DS users.

2333
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,640
You can't update the firmware on the DS.

2334
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:30,640
So, I don't know.

2335
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:34,640
I think for me, there's kind of the difference in those two things.

2336
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,640
And the iPhone's not perfect.

2337
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:44,640
You know, yeah, Apple is a huge abuser of this whole, let's upgrade the whole thing in a year and watch everybody buy it all over again.

2338
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:47,640
But, you know, we give them crap for that, too, and it's deserved.

2339
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:52,640
So, anyway, speaking of that, let's get to tonight's List List.

2340
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,640
Now, I know it's been a while since we've done one of these on the show, so let me remind everybody how it works.

2341
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:06,640
We are going to make the ultimate list, the definitive top three list.

2342
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:09,640
And we're going to use our live chatters to help, along with the folks here in studio.

2343
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:12,640
Those of us here in studio have paired our top three answers.

2344
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:16,640
We're going to compile those into a list of 12, since there's four of us tonight.

2345
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,640
Then we're going to go around the room and each one of us is going to take something off of the list, leaving a list of eight.

2346
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:28,640
Then you guys in chat will vote on that list of eight and make our top three using your votes.

2347
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:32,640
And then we will have the definitive top three list, no arguments, no debates.

2348
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,640
It is the official list.

2349
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,640
All right.

2350
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:39,640
I say that, but of course there's always room for debate.

2351
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:44,640
Okay, so that being said, tonight's topic, feature that should have been on the DSI that would have got me to buy one today.

2352
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,640
Who wants to start us off tonight?

2353
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:49,640
How about Loki? Loki's always got some evil answers for us.

2354
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:52,640
Loki, what is your number three answer of the feature the DSI should have had?

2355
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,640
You know, I was thinking a bunch of different things.

2356
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,640
Let me say this, I'm sorry, real quick.

2357
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:02,640
If it matters, if you have ideas, put them in our chat room, because if one of us gets an answer stolen,

2358
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,640
like somebody else says the same answer we were going to use, usually we take backup answers from chat.

2359
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:08,640
So just want to get that out there.

2360
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:09,640
Which would be kind of neat.

2361
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:14,640
I mean, I don't really use this on the Wii, but like the DSI message board.

2362
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:19,640
You know, basically allowing you to send emails and attachments and stuff like that to each other.

2363
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:25,640
Really, you know, DSI should have a lot of stuff that the Wii has, but you know, that's what I'm going to start with.

2364
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:28,640
Alright, not a smart-ass answer from Loki, I'm impressed.

2365
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,640
That's a very reasonable good answer.

2366
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:34,640
Should be a way to email each other and have, you know, all that stuff.

2367
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,640
A DSI message board, I like that.

2368
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,640
The Doctor!

2369
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:37,640
We'll just go on a line here.

2370
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:41,640
Doctor, what is the number three feature the DSI should have had to get you to buy one today?

2371
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,640
Voice recognition.

2372
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,640
Software.

2373
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:47,640
I think that would be an awesome feature in games.

2374
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,640
You speak and then it responds.

2375
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:53,640
Well now, I think about brain training and you have the blue and some of those things, but what would be-

2376
02:01:53,640 --> 02:02:01,640
It's so rudimentary, like actual practical where you could say, you know, you cast a spell in a fantasy game and they do it, you know.

2377
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,640
I want to cast Magic Missile!

2378
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:05,640
Yeah, really fully developed voice recognition software.

2379
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,640
Improved voice, okay, I can go with that.

2380
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,640
Alright, alright, cool.

2381
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:15,640
Alright, I'll go next and my number three answer I'm going to use tonight is open app development like the iPhone.

2382
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:19,640
That they should open up, because they're going to have this DSI downloadable stuff, I think they should open it up.

2383
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,640
I think open app development is going to be my number three answer.

2384
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:26,640
That anybody should be able to make a DS game.

2385
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,640
Because the community, I think, could come up with some good stuff and maybe like a message board.

2386
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:34,640
And I think it's been very good for the iPhone, so if we're going to make that comparison, then there you go.

2387
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,640
DarkSoccer, you're number three.

2388
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:39,640
Me.

2389
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:40,640
Interesting.

2390
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:50,640
I honestly think having your me being able to travel, you know, from your Wii to your DSi to go visit other people's, you know.

2391
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:53,640
Technically they can already do that.

2392
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,640
Well, they're going to have support for it, but yeah, they should.

2393
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,640
You haven't integrated it into the actual OS of the system.

2394
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:07,640
And I think it's kind of forgotten that you can put those things on the Wiimote, too, because there's not a lot of practical use for it.

2395
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:08,640
You know what I mean?

2396
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,640
I've brought mine over to your house before that way.

2397
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,640
I remember that.

2398
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,640
I remember that.

2399
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:12,640
Okay, so Mii integration, I guess we could say.

2400
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,640
Better use of the Miis on DS.

2401
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:14,640
I like that idea.

2402
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,640
Okay, Loki.

2403
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:21,640
You know what would be kind of cool?

2404
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:22,640
Bluetooth.

2405
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,640
Okay.

2406
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,640
Because just think of it as you will.

2407
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:30,640
You could use your Wii Remote for motion sensitive games.

2408
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,640
You know, not necessarily obviously waggling your Wii Remote around, but like racing games or something like that.

2409
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:37,640
You could use it for wireless headsets.

2410
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:40,640
Okay, okay.

2411
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:43,640
Communication with other devices.

2412
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:44,640
Okay.

2413
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:47,640
The doctor, what's your number two?

2414
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:51,640
The tilt feature, the motion feature like the iPhone is.

2415
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:56,640
Are you guys wanting to turn the DSI into an iPhone?

2416
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,640
What's going on here?

2417
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,640
Oh, I guess I did one, too.

2418
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,640
All right, what do you think the tilt feature would add to the DSI?

2419
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:09,640
Well, gimmicks, but it seems like that would not have been a useless feature like the camera.

2420
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,640
I'm sorry.

2421
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:18,640
All right, my number two answer I'm going to say is, okay, I'm going to give the first smart ass answer of the night.

2422
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:24,640
A virtual boy slot would have been something, too, since they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot.

2423
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:31,640
Give me a virtual boy slot to give me a use for those games that are just collecting dust from the great red headache machine of death.

2424
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:36,640
So a virtual boy slot.

2425
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:42,640
Dark Sakura, your number two pick for a feature that you most would want to see in the DSI that would have gotten you to buy one.

2426
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,640
TV tuner.

2427
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:46,640
Oh, I like, I like that.

2428
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:47,640
Okay, TV tuner.

2429
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:55,640
I mean, if the freaking Turbo Express, the handheld Turbo Graphics could have a TV tuner.

2430
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,640
And NEC didn't really, well, they kind of did.

2431
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:01,640
But anyway, why can't the other links have one, too?

2432
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:02,640
Why not?

2433
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,640
Why the heck not?

2434
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,640
Okay, I'll tell you why not.

2435
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:06,640
The nomad.

2436
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,640
No, I'm kidding.

2437
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,640
Because they're getting rid of analog TV signals soon.

2438
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,640
Doesn't matter.

2439
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,640
Have a digital TV tuner.

2440
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,640
No.

2441
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,640
That's impossible.

2442
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,640
Yes.

2443
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,640
Impossible.

2444
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,640
All right.

2445
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:19,640
Now we're getting to the number one answers.

2446
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:24,640
The number one feature you want to see in the DSI that would get you to buy the system right now.

2447
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:26,640
Loki, what is your number one answer?

2448
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:31,640
My number one answer is there's nothing they can do.

2449
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:38,640
Honestly, they would have to, it's made out of bacon.

2450
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,640
I don't know.

2451
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:51,640
I have no number one answer.

2452
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:53,640
Made out of bacon.

2453
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:56,640
Or at least scratch and sniff bacon smell.

2454
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,640
I don't know how with that.

2455
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:58,640
Made out of bacon.

2456
02:05:58,640 --> 02:05:59,640
Bacon integration.

2457
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,640
All right.

2458
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,640
I like made out of bacon.

2459
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,640
All right.

2460
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:09,640
The DSI would sell, you would have bought one today and it was made out of bacon.

2461
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:14,640
The doctor, your number one answer for what would have got you to buy the DSI today.

2462
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:16,640
Since I guess the theme is crazy stuff now.

2463
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:20,640
Like, you know, you can interact with it, it can interact with you back.

2464
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:25,640
So like an energy hand will come out and like slap you in the face.

2465
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:28,640
Is that your real answer?

2466
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:29,640
That is.

2467
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:30,640
And my final answer.

2468
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:34,640
Energy hands.

2469
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,640
You know, there's so many apps for that.

2470
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,640
Slap in the face.

2471
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:41,640
Helps with self-trouser fornication.

2472
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:49,640
Hands made out of pure energy.

2473
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:50,640
All right.

2474
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:54,640
My number one answer, it's a little bit long, but this is a true answer by the way.

2475
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,640
This is not a smart ass answer.

2476
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:00,640
My number one answer for the thing that would have most got me to buy a DSI today.

2477
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:05,640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.

2478
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:13,640
My runner up answer would have been a multi-touch touch screen, but you know.

2479
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,640
Like anything with a multi-touch touch screen.

2480
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:19,640
We're not just limiting it to the iPhone.

2481
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:20,640
All right.

2482
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,640
Enough about you.

2483
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,640
Let's talk about me and my answer some more.

2484
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:25,640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.

2485
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:27,640
I think that speaks for itself.

2486
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:30,640
I bought these games for five damn dollars.

2487
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:32,640
I ought to have the right to download it.

2488
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,640
PS3 does it.

2489
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:35,640
Why can't Nintendo do it?

2490
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:37,640
Why can't you do it?

2491
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:40,640
You got rid of the advanced slot, so don't give me that argument you released on the Game Boy Advance.

2492
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,640
But now I can't play them anymore.

2493
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:46,640
So he does what Nintendon't.

2494
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,640
All right.

2495
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:51,640
DarkSakura, your number one answer.

2496
02:07:51,640 --> 02:08:00,640
Mine would be to take PictoChat and make it truly networking, as in you can hop on the Wi-Fi,

2497
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:04,640
and you don't have to be just in the general vicinity of somebody else with one.

2498
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:11,640
You can draw penises on full-blown penor on people's DSIs in Malaysia.

2499
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,640
Or an enhancement of that.

2500
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:16,640
It could be like there's a camera on it, like video chat.

2501
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,640
Can I just say PictoChat across the internets?

2502
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,640
That would be cool.

2503
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:21,640
All right.

2504
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:22,640
There you go.

2505
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:29,640
Although my bullshit answer could either be a Jelly Belly dispenser or gay porn.

2506
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:30,640
Gay porn.

2507
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,640
All right.

2508
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:32,640
Gay porn always sells.

2509
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:35,640
Let's see what the chat room had to say with some answers there.

2510
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:36,640
Let's see.

2511
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:40,640
We had a DDR pad was one answer.

2512
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,640
Airport tuner, shortwave tuner.

2513
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,640
We tried a DDR pad, remember?

2514
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,640
Legend of Zelda ghost camera.

2515
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,640
A vibrator.

2516
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:53,640
I think I saw different forms of vibrator, a trance vibrator was one that came up as

2517
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,640
well.

2518
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:55,640
Let's see.

2519
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,640
What do we have as well?

2520
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,640
Laser Cats DSI game at launch would have made it better.

2521
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,640
That's from S2100mat.

2522
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,640
Virtual handheld for Mac Dev.

2523
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,640
Kind of like my answer.

2524
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,640
How about a fart sound maker or a swear button from the Dark Knight?

2525
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,640
All right.

2526
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,640
There you go.

2527
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,640
Some of the answers we have from chat.

2528
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,640
But sadly...

2529
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,640
You know, they did make a DDR pad, though, for the Game Boy back in the day.

2530
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:11,640
Way back in the day.

2531
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,640
I have one.

2532
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:15,640
Because they brought out the super midi version of DDR.

2533
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,640
They were kind of shit.

2534
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:17,640
They were funny.

2535
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:19,640
Was it for your fingers, though?

2536
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:20,640
Yeah.

2537
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:23,640
ActDeft wins a RuPaul game for the DSiWare.

2538
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:24,640
All right.

2539
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:26,640
Here's the list so far, but now we're going to get to the elimination round.

2540
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:27,640
Here we go.

2541
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,640
DSI message board.

2542
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,640
Voice recognition software.

2543
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:31,640
Open app development.

2544
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,640
Miis.

2545
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,640
Bluetooth integration.

2546
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,640
Tilt feature like the iPhone.

2547
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,640
Virtual voice slot.

2548
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:37,640
TV tuner.

2549
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:38,640
Made out of bacon.

2550
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:39,640
Energy hands.

2551
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:44,640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

2552
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:46,640
And PictoChat across the internets.

2553
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:54,640
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2554
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:57,640
Energy hands, I'm sorry.

2555
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,640
Energy hands.

2556
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:01,640
Maybe just a little too soon for energy hands.

2557
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:02,640
All right.

2558
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:05,640
The Doctor, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2559
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,640
The virtual voice slot.

2560
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:08,640
Oh, you bastard.

2561
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:09,640
All right.

2562
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:12,640
Virtual voice slot comes off the list.

2563
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:17,640
I am going to say, I have to be honest, the one I've got to take out is voice recognition

2564
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:18,640
software.

2565
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:23,640
Sorry, Doctor, that's not a retaliation thing, but I just think that would be hoarded to

2566
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:27,640
the extreme and would just make the thing crap.

2567
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,640
Dark soccer is going to be the last one to eliminate dark soccer.

2568
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:32,640
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2569
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:36,640
It was a toss-up between one and made out of bacon.

2570
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:39,640
And I'm going to take out the tilt function because I'd rather be made out of bacon than

2571
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,640
have tilt function.

2572
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:41,640
All right.

2573
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,640
So there you go.

2574
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,640
Trust me.

2575
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:47,640
I don't want them to even remotely consider it because some of these iPhone games are

2576
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:49,640
unplayable because they have tilt function.

2577
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:50,640
All right.

2578
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:51,640
Fair enough.

2579
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:52,640
Fair enough.

2580
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,640
But then you have some good ones, too, like Rolando is kind of cool.

2581
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,640
Let's check it out.

2582
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,640
But I like bacon, too.

2583
02:10:58,640 --> 02:10:59,640
No, seriously.

2584
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,640
Fair enough.

2585
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:03,640
Every Friday after typography class now I have to go have bacon because bacon is meat

2586
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:04,640
candy.

2587
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,640
Fair enough.

2588
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,640
All right.

2589
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,640
So here we go.

2590
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,640
Now here's the list you guys will vote on.

2591
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:15,640
Spotify message board, open app development, Miis, Bluetooth integration, TV tuner, made

2592
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:21,640
out of bacon, virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit,

2593
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:23,640
and Picto chats across the internets.

2594
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,640
Place vote now.

2595
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:28,640
Send a private message with your number one and number two answer.

2596
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,640
Make sure both are labeled or I will assume the first is your number one.

2597
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:36,640
Send those over private message to Rob Roberts in chat room.

2598
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:39,640
And if you don't know how to do that, ask somebody or maybe somebody will mention it

2599
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,640
in chat how to do that right now.

2600
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:45,640
Place those votes within the next 120 seconds you have to vote.

2601
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:51,640
And we will tally it up and reveal for you who won a little later on in the show.

2602
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:57,640
For now, while those votes are coming in, let's take a trip over to our Twitter.

2603
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:00,640
And we're actually going to look at, you know, we put a call out on Twitter today saying,

2604
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,640
you know, we're a little short on stories this week.

2605
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,640
What do you guys want to see us talk about?

2606
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,640
And we put the call out on Twitter.

2607
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:11,640
And we did get some replies, some various tweets in our response here.

2608
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,640
And I wanted to read some of those for you guys right now,

2609
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:17,640
although right now I'm seeing a lot of gaming weeks.

2610
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:18,640
Let's see.

2611
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,640
We talked about the, let's see.

2612
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:23,640
Act Def says talk about the March Madness winner some more.

2613
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,640
We kind of talked about that already.

2614
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:28,640
DJ Ratchet wants to know about the new PSP and PS2 Jackson Dexter game,

2615
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,640
which we talked about earlier.

2616
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:35,640
ZakuPilot256 asks, DSI, is it worth the upgrade?

2617
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:40,640
Can I get a side of handheld console wars as well, please, lol.

2618
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:42,640
There hasn't been a lot of PSP bashing tonight.

2619
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:43,640
I don't know.

2620
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:47,640
Is there, is the DSI, I mean, okay, let me back up.

2621
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:50,640
The PSP's kind of a little bit behind in the console wars right now,

2622
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:54,640
but the DSI is kind of out there to increase the lead, so to speak.

2623
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:56,640
I know what we could talk about.

2624
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:59,640
Did you hear about that news story where Sony apparently put out a press release

2625
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:03,640
saying that, basically saying the DSI was a kiddie system,

2626
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:07,640
and then touted that it had a Miley Cyrus game in the exact same press release.

2627
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:09,640
Did you hear about that?

2628
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:13,640
Well, I mean, they have their own kiddie stuff on the PSP,

2629
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:18,640
but yes, it's mainly the DS that has kiddie stuff,

2630
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:22,640
but that's, you have to understand, though, there's a double edge to everything.

2631
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:25,640
I mean, because, yeah, you know why there's more kiddie games in there?

2632
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,640
Because more kids own a DS than a PSP.

2633
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:30,640
D'oh.

2634
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:32,640
Well, you know, I got to disagree with that a little.

2635
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:35,640
I just, I don't like all these uber-violent, uber-serious games.

2636
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,640
I'm like, I fall asleep watching COD, I'm sorry.

2637
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:44,640
So I like the more down-to-earth or the more silly games myself, so.

2638
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:46,640
Well, but here's the thing, and I still feel this way,

2639
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:51,640
and you know, maybe, okay, the PSP is still like games and more.

2640
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:54,640
It might not be the best system at games, even though it still has,

2641
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:58,640
you know, it does have Disada, it does have some games that are pretty awesome,

2642
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:01,640
but the PSP is still, you know, for that college kid.

2643
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:06,640
This is like the great college system, because you've got your MP3 player,

2644
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:08,640
you've got your little internet browser you can use at Starbucks,

2645
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,640
you've got your gaming system, you know, it's all right there.

2646
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:15,640
And I think the DSi was trying to compete with that a little bit,

2647
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,640
but it didn't work, because, you know, where's the internet?

2648
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:20,640
Where is the MP3 player built in?

2649
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:21,640
None of that is here.

2650
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:25,640
So I still think the PSP excels at being more than a gaming,

2651
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:28,640
but if all you want is handheld games, I think the DS still wins.

2652
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:31,640
And then also the DSi, though, I mean, their music player is kind of crap,

2653
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:34,640
because it's only the AAC format or whatever,

2654
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:37,640
which I understand, you know, iTunes and stuff, that's fine,

2655
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:39,640
but really I think it should have been MP3.

2656
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:41,640
I mean, come on, man, give it the times.

2657
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,640
And then also, you know, there's the internet browser,

2658
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:50,640
which apparently is not very good anyways, so it's like, ugh, okay, whatever.

2659
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:54,640
And then, you know, what, the photo manipulation stuff?

2660
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:56,640
Really? Is that what you're going to do?

2661
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:58,640
A photo manipulation? Is that really that important?

2662
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:00,640
Are we going to, like, throw those around the internet now

2663
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:03,640
and take pictures and manipulate them with silly faces,

2664
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:06,640
like you couldn't do that in Microsoft Paint or something?

2665
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,640
I mean, come on.

2666
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:12,640
It's just, it's got potential, but they're never going to utilize it,

2667
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,640
and that's sad.

2668
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:16,640
I like AcidicVampire's response in chat.

2669
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:20,640
In the PSP's defense, the games look saucier.

2670
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:21,640
I like that word, saucier.

2671
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:24,640
They could have had MP3 support if Nintendo had paid a license,

2672
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:27,640
just like the Wii could have played DVDs if they had paid the license

2673
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:30,640
for, you know, the use of DVD codecs.

2674
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:33,640
But you know what? You know what's more important than Nintendo?

2675
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:34,640
Money in their pocket.

2676
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:38,640
So, you know, so much for that, you know,

2677
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,640
and so I guess the consumer loses because Nintendo needs to make a buck.

2678
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,640
Yeah, but nobody uses their consoles to play movies, though, anymore,

2679
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:47,640
I don't think, anyway.

2680
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:49,640
I use my consoles to play movies all the time.

2681
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:51,640
It's my primary DVD player.

2682
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:54,640
Whatever happens with it, PlayStation 3 is my primary movie player.

2683
02:15:54,640 --> 02:16:00,640
We do use it for Blu-ray, and our HD DVD player is our Xbox 360.

2684
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:03,640
You know, and whatever I happen to have hooked up at the time,

2685
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:05,640
you know, it would be kind of cool to have, you know,

2686
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,640
a DVD player for the Wii.

2687
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:10,640
Don't be surprised if that's, like, not something

2688
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:11,640
that they're going to start selling to.

2689
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:14,640
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

2690
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:16,640
And yeah, I know most people already have DVD players,

2691
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:18,640
but you know what?

2692
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:22,640
People also have TVs, too, but yet still buy tons of TVs out there.

2693
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:24,640
And who cares? It's another DVD player.

2694
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:25,640
That's the point.

2695
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:27,640
You know, we may be in the kids' room or something like that,

2696
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:29,640
now, boom, it's a DVD player in the kids' room.

2697
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:33,640
So, you know, I don't know.

2698
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:38,640
Minor cost for, you know, another bullet point.

2699
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:40,640
So, whatever.

2700
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:41,640
All right, I'm still trying to tally the votes,

2701
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:43,640
so let's move on to another topic here.

2702
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:45,640
Crows asks on Twitter,

2703
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:48,640
maybe talk about some April Fools' jokes that spread on the internet

2704
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,640
that were actually entertaining.

2705
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:50,640
I don't like April Fools' Day at all,

2706
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,640
although I think, you know, for hating April Fools' Day,

2707
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,640
I think Dark Tetsuya did a pretty funny one on our site,

2708
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,640
where he did for I Heart that song,

2709
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:59,640
he did Let Them Move from DD,

2710
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:02,640
which is, like, a total throwback to the old school days

2711
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:03,640
of Orange Lounge Radio.

2712
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,640
So, like, I like dumb shit like that.

2713
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:08,640
I don't know.

2714
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:10,640
Loki, Dark Soccer, did you guys see anything funny on the internet?

2715
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:12,640
I kind of turn off the internet on April Fools' Day.

2716
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,640
This year, they actually kind of,

2717
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:16,640
a lot of the sites that would normally do April Fools' jokes didn't.

2718
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:19,640
They're just like, you know, I'm too busy with stuff, so forget it.

2719
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:24,640
You know, basically, I saw a few in, like, the hacking communities,

2720
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:25,640
like, some, you know, people,

2721
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:27,640
oh, yeah, look, we're releasing, you know,

2722
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:29,640
a tool to hack the PSP 3000,

2723
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:32,640
or, you know, a new one to hack the Wii or something,

2724
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:34,640
and it's just, whatever, you know,

2725
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,640
those we kind of figured were fake.

2726
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,640
And then, um,

2727
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:42,640
I'm trying to think here, what are some of the other, you know,

2728
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:45,640
April Fools' jokes that were just very obvious?

2729
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,640
The new Metal Gear Solid game,

2730
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:49,640
you know, they announced, you know,

2731
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,640
what the new character was going to be,

2732
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:52,640
which is kind of retarded,

2733
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,640
and then, um,

2734
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:55,640
I'm trying to think here.

2735
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:56,640
They were kind of lame.

2736
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,640
I mean, it was, you know,

2737
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,640
the World of Warcraft thing that they did was kind of cool,

2738
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:04,640
and then there was another one with IGN,

2739
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,640
you know, tried to do this,

2740
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:09,640
Wii Extend or Wii Expand or something like that,

2741
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:12,640
which was supposed to be download content for, like, Wii games,

2742
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:17,640
and the first one was Super Smash Brothers Brawl Extreme,

2743
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:20,640
where they were going to have, like, blood and stuff like that,

2744
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:22,640
and it just looked so fake, and, you know,

2745
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:25,640
they had Mario getting decapitated and stuff like that.

2746
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:28,640
You know, despite all the shit we give the mainstream press sometimes on this show

2747
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,640
and all that stuff,

2748
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:33,640
I think their Zelda trailer will never be topped.

2749
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:35,640
That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' joke.

2750
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:36,640
That was great.

2751
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:37,640
That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' prank.

2752
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:41,640
Not for the fact that I don't think anyone really fell for it,

2753
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,640
but just, like, goddamn, they went all out with that shit that year,

2754
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,640
and I think, like,

2755
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:48,640
and, Doctor, you're a big Zelda fanboy.

2756
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:51,640
Did you not get a huge boner April Fools' or not at that trailer?

2757
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,640
No, and obviously it was fake,

2758
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:54,640
but yeah, I mean,

2759
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:57,640
if you've ever seen the fan-made Zelda movies,

2760
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:59,640
I mean, this was, like, a bazillion,

2761
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:02,640
the production value was pretty good.

2762
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,640
And sadly enough, it will never come to fruition,

2763
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:05,640
which is, you know,

2764
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:07,640
I don't think it would cost that much,

2765
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:08,640
you know, for something like that.

2766
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:10,640
Now, this wasn't even an April Fools' thing,

2767
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:11,640
but have you seen,

2768
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,640
there's a trailer for a movie that someone made,

2769
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:15,640
or short movie, called Turbo,

2770
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:17,640
which is a little bit of a cross between, like,

2771
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:19,640
Street Fighter and Tron and, you know,

2772
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:20,640
the Karate Kid.

2773
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:22,640
And it actually looks pretty cool,

2774
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:24,640
and that's also made, you know, with a really low budget and stuff,

2775
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:26,640
so, you know, nowadays,

2776
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:28,640
you know, you can do pretty amazing stuff.

2777
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,640
Hell, I mean, look at that,

2778
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:32,640
was it the Half-Life short,

2779
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,640
or it was, like, a series that's going on,

2780
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:37,640
and I gotta wonder if they've got more episodes for that,

2781
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:39,640
but, you know, the guys did it, like, on a shoestring budget,

2782
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,640
and it's just, like, it's amazing.

2783
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:44,640
It's absolutely amazing as far as visuals and stuff go,

2784
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:46,640
which is sad, because sci-fi movies look like crap,

2785
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:48,640
you know, like the sci-fi channel stuff,

2786
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,640
so if a guy can do it in his basement,

2787
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:52,640
then why can't they?

2788
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:56,640
All right, and then one other thing on Twitter

2789
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:57,640
I thought was pretty interesting,

2790
02:19:57,640 --> 02:20:00,640
and, you know, our good friend Marin,

2791
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,640
or Tiara, whatever you want to say,

2792
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,640
kind of likes to pimp her own stuff,

2793
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,640
but I liked it.

2794
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:08,640
It was actually a piece that she wrote on her own blog,

2795
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:11,640
which I've jokingly referred to as the Giggling Girls blog,

2796
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:14,640
but, no, it's what, AvengersTower.com?

2797
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:15,640
Yes, it is.

2798
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:17,640
I can't remember if it's Avenger Tower or Avengers Tower.

2799
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:18,640
It's Avengers Tower.

2800
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,640
Avengers Tower.

2801
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:22,640
Like the old comic?

2802
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:24,640
Like the Avengers Tower and the comic books.

2803
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,640
Gotcha.

2804
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:29,640
It was an article about the Beatles rock band,

2805
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,640
which we talked about a couple weeks on the show,

2806
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:34,640
but what I liked was there was this article she read on March 29th

2807
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:39,640
about how the Beatles rock band game is going to carry a price tag

2808
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:43,640
that's like $60 more than the current Rock Band 2 bundle,

2809
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:47,640
and she's kind of speculating where could this extra $60 be coming from,

2810
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:48,640
and I like some of the ideas.

2811
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:50,640
One rumor was a keyboard,

2812
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:53,640
which I think is more of a wishful thinking,

2813
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:54,640
at least on my part.

2814
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:56,640
I would love to see a keyboard, but I don't know.

2815
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:57,640
I mean, definitely there are some Beatles songs

2816
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:59,640
that would benefit from keyboard integration.

2817
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:02,640
Another idea was extra microphones,

2818
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:05,640
so maybe you could have more than one person singing.

2819
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:07,640
You could have two people singing at once.

2820
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:09,640
To kind of go with the keyboard thing,

2821
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:12,640
their site, I don't know if it's viral or what,

2822
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,640
but their actual, the Beatles site,

2823
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:19,640
they've been having instruments slowly being added to their studio recording room,

2824
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:21,640
and one of the instruments was a keyboard.

2825
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:23,640
Hmm. Interesting.

2826
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:27,640
Rumor number three, drums with cymbals

2827
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,640
that maybe they're actually going to put actual cymbals or whatever

2828
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:32,640
on the drum kit for the Rock Band.

2829
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,640
Well, they did say that, you know, later on,

2830
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,640
it's potential that they can have like, say,

2831
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,640
Rock Band 3 or something like that,

2832
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:39,640
where cymbals would be their own notes,

2833
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:40,640
which is kind of cool.

2834
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,640
Another rumor, two guitars instead of one.

2835
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,640
Instead of, why not have the whole band?

2836
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:48,640
I think it's more that is what's going to be why it's more expensive,

2837
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:51,640
is the second guitar, I think, is going to be in there,

2838
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:52,640
because they're going to model the bass.

2839
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,640
They're probably going to have an actual bass and then a guitar.

2840
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:58,640
And the last rumor, just milking the damn cash cow.

2841
02:21:58,640 --> 02:21:59,640
Milking the damn cash cow.

2842
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:01,640
I really hope it's the keyboard one,

2843
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:05,640
but I think, Loki, I think it's going to be one of their bass guitars

2844
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:07,640
with the regular guitar, I think.

2845
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:09,640
Especially because you have the,

2846
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:13,640
and she goes into talking about the whole Hoffner violin bass,

2847
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:16,640
which, you know, it seems likely that, you know,

2848
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:17,640
with the Beatles and everything,

2849
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:20,640
they would have like a special, you know, Beatles bass.

2850
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:23,640
That seems likely.

2851
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:25,640
Some folks in chat are saying, you know,

2852
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:27,640
what about like a strobe light?

2853
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,640
They can already buy that.

2854
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:30,640
Oh, no, they're talking, oh, no, no, no, no.

2855
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:31,640
They're talking about Nine Inch Nails.

2856
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:33,640
I guess their April Fool's joke or something like that

2857
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:39,640
had something to do with, oh, it was the album.

2858
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:41,640
Oh, that Nine Inch Nails was putting out a new album

2859
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,640
that was produced by Timbaland called Strobe Light.

2860
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,640
That was a good April Fool's joke that was out on the internet.

2861
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:53,640
All right, let's get into the listless results.

2862
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,640
So we can get to your calls,

2863
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,640
last minute stories, and the end of the show pretty soon.

2864
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:01,640
Believe it or not, for being a slower Newsweek,

2865
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,640
we sure seem to fill a couple of hours

2866
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:05,640
and then some here on the show.

2867
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:07,640
All right, here are your top three tonight,

2868
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:09,640
the definitive list, as you guys in chat have voted

2869
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:12,640
for the feature that they should have put on the DSI

2870
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,640
that would have made me buy one today.

2871
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:19,640
Number three, open app development, just like the iPhone.

2872
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:20,640
Let anybody make an app.

2873
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:22,640
There you go, open app development.

2874
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:26,640
Number two feature that would have got me to buy a DSI today,

2875
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,640
made out of bacon.

2876
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,640
Made out of bacon was the number two feature.

2877
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:31,640
There you go.

2878
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:33,640
Where there's bacon, there's profit.

2879
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:37,640
And the number one feature that would have gotten people

2880
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:42,640
to buy the DSI today, virtual console games on my goddamn DS,

2881
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,640
you money-sucking pieces of shit.

2882
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:49,640
There it is, your number one answer on the list.

2883
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:52,640
List segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2884
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,640
All right, all right.

2885
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:58,640
Lots of votes spread around amongst all the choices, though.

2886
02:23:58,640 --> 02:23:59,640
Everybody got a little love,

2887
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:02,640
but I think those three struck a particular nerve,

2888
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:05,640
because people just love their bacon and virtual console

2889
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:07,640
and open app development.

2890
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:10,640
All right, actdeft makes a good point.

2891
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:14,640
If anybody can make an app, you know who will make his game a reality.

2892
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,640
That individual who has a game named after himself.

2893
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,640
Well, you know whose game sucks balls,

2894
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,640
because I've actually played the demo,

2895
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:24,640
and it's as crappy as it looks.

2896
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:29,640
And I'm sorry, I don't care if it's one person developing it.

2897
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:32,640
It's not good, and I would never...

2898
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:37,640
If I paid retail for that, I'd have to kick myself in the junk.

2899
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:41,640
BlackWolf asks in chat, what if Bobby BlackWolf made a game?

2900
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:44,640
Would you talk about it if I called it Bobby's Game?

2901
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,640
Yes, I would talk about it every week.

2902
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,640
Every week, Bobby. Every week.

2903
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,640
As long as it didn't suck.

2904
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:51,640
In fact, I think you should beat him to the market,

2905
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:53,640
because I would laugh my ass off at that.

2906
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:54,640
Do it now.

2907
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:55,640
But only if the theme song to the game is

2908
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:59,640
La la la la, la la la la, Bobby's World.

2909
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:00,640
No?

2910
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:03,640
Oh, my God.

2911
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:05,640
All right.

2912
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:08,640
Also, before we get to the Skype line and so forth,

2913
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,640
we have one segment we always do here on the show

2914
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,640
that we don't want to miss,

2915
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:13,640
but we just haven't had any really angsty stories.

2916
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:17,640
But perhaps the invoking of said name,

2917
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:20,640
of said band individual from said show,

2918
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,640
and just even thinking about his game

2919
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:23,640
should invoke anger and rage

2920
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:26,640
in a certain segment we do here every week on Orange Launch Radio.

2921
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:41,640
.

2922
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:43,640
FUs of the Week.

2923
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:48,640
Um, man, making me be angry, and I was starting to feel good.

2924
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:52,640
Um, FU to having to go to work tomorrow.

2925
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:58,640
Just, I really, I, you know, that's all.

2926
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:01,640
I just really want to stay home and sleep.

2927
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,640
What's wrong with that?

2928
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:05,640
So, FU being tired.

2929
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:08,640
FU to this glass of wine I'm drinking for being so yummy

2930
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:10,640
and making me a little tipsy during the show.

2931
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,640
I love it.

2932
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:12,640
It's freaking delicious.

2933
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,640
It's a muscata?

2934
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:15,640
It's a muscato.

2935
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:16,640
Muscato.

2936
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:17,640
It's delicious.

2937
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,640
It's a sweet wine.

2938
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,640
It tastes like candy.

2939
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:20,640
Mm-hmm.

2940
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,640
It tastes like champagne without the bubbles,

2941
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,640
as my friend put it.

2942
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,640
It's delish.

2943
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:27,640
Hey there, doctor.

2944
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:28,640
Do you have any FUs of the Week,

2945
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:29,640
even though Loki's holding the mic?

2946
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:31,640
Yeah, even though this is a little old news,

2947
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:33,640
I had a lady confront me about this the other day.

2948
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:35,640
Fuck you to anyone who doesn't support gay marriage,

2949
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:37,640
because you are fucking assholes.

2950
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:39,640
Props to Iowa, though.

2951
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:41,640
Props to Iowa, of all places.

2952
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:44,640
Props to them, although I have heard those comparisons about,

2953
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,640
well, isn't Iowa just doing what California did,

2954
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:48,640
like, five years ago, which, or however long ago it was,

2955
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,640
like, three years ago,

2956
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,640
which ended up getting turned around by Prop 8 anyway.

2957
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:53,640
Maybe, but I hear it's harder

2958
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,640
to pass a constitutional amendment in that state,

2959
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:59,640
so if you live in Iowa, please don't screw this up.

2960
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:02,640
Please don't screw this up.

2961
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:04,640
But right now, hey, you know,

2962
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:07,640
I think some person in Iowa is probably really concerned.

2963
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:09,640
I actually read about this somewhere,

2964
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:11,640
that they are concerned,

2965
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:14,640
the conservative moral majority, let's say, in Iowa,

2966
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:20,640
that there's just going to be this outbreak of gay-ness

2967
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,640
throughout the state.

2968
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,640
It's going to become a gay mecca.

2969
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:26,640
Like, there's just going to be a sodomy outbreak

2970
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:29,640
within the state of Iowa because of this law passing.

2971
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:31,640
You know what?

2972
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:33,640
Why is that a bad thing?

2973
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:38,640
Like, maybe people can come clean the place up,

2974
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:42,640
throw a party in Des Moines that people want to come to.

2975
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:43,640
And make it fierce.

2976
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:46,640
Quick, when I say Des Moines, what do you think of?

2977
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,640
My crappy customer.

2978
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:51,640
Silent S. That's corn.

2979
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,640
There's not a lot else I can think of.

2980
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,640
All right, anyway.

2981
02:27:55,640 --> 02:27:57,640
ZakuPilot256 in chat says,

2982
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:00,640
if gay people want to ruin their life with marriage, let them.

2983
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,640
Amen to that. All right, anyhow.

2984
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,640
Didn't I say it in my little rant that I put in my blog?

2985
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:09,640
That everyone should have as much right to mess it up

2986
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:11,640
like, you know, anyone else?

2987
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:14,640
Just like Britney Spears. We have every right to fuck it up like Britney Spears did.

2988
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,640
All right, look, I don't want to turn this into a political show,

2989
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:19,640
but obviously it's an issue important to myself and the doctor.

2990
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:21,640
So yay, Iowa.

2991
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:23,640
F you. Everybody else.

2992
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:26,640
All right. Yeah, Loki, please, your F you is the week.

2993
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:30,640
My F you is the week goes to some of my airsoft guns not working correctly.

2994
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:33,640
Did your airsoft thing, did you get to have that?

2995
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:35,640
Because I saw multiple pleas on live channel,

2996
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:37,640
and we were like, pretty please come play airsoft with me.

2997
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,640
And I felt bad, I wanted to go, but I had plans.

2998
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:42,640
No, we had like three people, including myself, and that's it.

2999
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:44,640
But it was all right, we had fun with the small group.

3000
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:47,640
I promise I will go airsoft with you in a future week.

3001
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:52,640
That's fine, I just, I have, I've been bad and I've been buying too many guns.

3002
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:58,640
So unfortunately, unfortunately I'm probably going to sell some,

3003
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:02,640
but it's fine because I, you know, my primary gun that I normally use,

3004
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,640
I don't really like anymore, but the new one I got is pretty cool.

3005
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:11,640
But I'm going to stop buying guns and stick with the one that works really well.

3006
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:13,640
All right.

3007
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:15,640
ActDef says, bad Loki, what will the wife say?

3008
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:17,640
She doesn't know.

3009
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:22,640
And thankfully she doesn't listen to this show, all right.

3010
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:24,640
Damn, all right, there you go.

3011
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:27,640
Let's open up the Skype line if we can here.

3012
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,640
1-8, do not disturb, let me open it up there.

3013
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:33,640
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3014
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:35,640
If you want to give us a call and interact with us,

3015
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,640
talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight,

3016
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:40,640
or as long as it's gaming related, we'll talk about anything pretty much.

3017
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:43,640
So go ahead and call us right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3018
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:46,640
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3019
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:50,640
Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for these calls to come in?

3020
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,640
Yeah, sorry, I'm fighting a giant slug thing.

3021
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:54,640
That's right, you still, well, actually you're getting saved.

3022
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,640
We've got a call right now.

3023
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:57,640
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3024
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:00,640
This is DS Master 26.

3025
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:02,640
Hey, DS Master 26, what is on your mind?

3026
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:04,640
Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm going to ask you.

3027
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:07,640
How about the DSi?

3028
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:12,640
Uh, seriously, I've seen, actually one of my friends has one.

3029
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:15,640
She gets imports from Japan a whole bunch of times,

3030
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:19,640
so she got one before the rest of us Americans did.

3031
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:24,640
And I've seen the picture printouts from that camera on that DSi.

3032
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,640
They're a bunch of crap.

3033
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,640
Plus the internet browser,

3034
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,640
we did a speed test you could get to Google first

3035
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:37,640
on a PSP versus DSi and the internet on there is slow as hell.

3036
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:43,640
Like dial up Windows 95 slow.

3037
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:47,640
That's like on the Nintendo Wii, it's very, very slow.

3038
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:52,640
Yeah, same thing with the DSi, but slower.

3039
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:55,640
And seriously, the music player is crap.

3040
02:30:55,640 --> 02:31:00,640
I mean, besides, I already got that feature with my R4 card.

3041
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:02,640
Wait, did they actually put a music player in the DSi?

3042
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,640
I didn't even realize that was there.

3043
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:06,640
It's built in now?

3044
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:11,640
Yeah, but you use your SD card and it takes AAC.

3045
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:14,640
But yeah, I already have a PSP or more importantly,

3046
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,640
you know, an iPod and iPhone that will do it as well.

3047
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,640
You know, I do use my PSP.

3048
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,640
Yeah, same here.

3049
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:27,640
I use my PSP, like the R4 does two videos, as I found out.

3050
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:30,640
Actually, that's the reason why I called in.

3051
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:34,640
I'm giving a review on Silent Hill, which I just saw last night.

3052
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:35,640
The movie?

3053
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:36,640
Freaking awesome.

3054
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,640
Yeah.

3055
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:41,640
Wow, you're only about three years late, but go ahead.

3056
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:43,640
I'm just messing.

3057
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:45,640
Wow, it came out three years ago?

3058
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:46,640
It was a while ago.

3059
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:47,640
I'm just messing with you.

3060
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,640
I don't remember when, but it was a while ago.

3061
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:50,640
What did you think?

3062
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:56,640
Well, anyways, out of all the movie, out of the game movies I've seen,

3063
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:59,640
this is like probably the best ever.

3064
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:02,640
And plus on the factory scene, witch burnings,

3065
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:06,640
and then the massive blood splatter in the awesome epic Pyramid Head,

3066
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:09,640
which I'm thinking of being for Halloween.

3067
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:11,640
Awesome flick.

3068
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:14,640
Now you know why we fan-gasm over Pyramid Head all the time on this show.

3069
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,640
He is sex.

3070
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:17,640
He just, he really is.

3071
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:21,640
He has a lot of it with the nurses.

3072
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:23,640
And plus, not to mention, if you guys ever,

3073
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:29,640
okay, have any of you played the DDR Extreme for the US version on the PS2?

3074
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,640
On the PS2, yes.

3075
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:34,640
Extreme 1, yes.

3076
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:40,640
Okay, the ending song, the Silent Hill for the ending credits,

3077
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:42,640
very reminiscent to the soundtrack.

3078
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:46,640
I think it's like the last song you'll lock in Extreme,

3079
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,640
but it was very similar to me.

3080
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:50,640
I couldn't remember the first few times until the chorus came in.

3081
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,640
I'm like, deja vu.

3082
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:56,640
Yeah, I mean, it was pretty cool that they inserted that in the game.

3083
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,640
Of course, that song originally comes from Silent Hill 3.

3084
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:01,640
It was like the theme song of that game.

3085
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:05,640
But yeah, I remember they put it in DDR with a funny little video too.

3086
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:08,640
And wasn't it Extreme 2 that had that?

3087
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,640
Because Extreme 1 had your reign from 4, if I remember right.

3088
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:13,640
And the reason why I remember that...

3089
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:16,640
No, it was Extreme 1.

3090
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,640
It was. You know what, you're right, it was.

3091
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,640
I remember that, though, that it also had your reign,

3092
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,640
because that was a big thing for us here at OLR.

3093
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:24,640
We got to play that song before anyone else,

3094
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:26,640
and we had a ton of DDR people listening.

3095
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:27,640
That was like the night we broke through,

3096
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:30,640
and we actually got a lot of new listeners when we got that.

3097
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:32,640
So, anyhow.

3098
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:33,640
Yeah, I remember that.

3099
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:35,640
That was a very controversial game in the community, though,

3100
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:37,640
because they really changed the engine and all that stuff.

3101
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:39,640
Anyway, sorry.

3102
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:45,640
Well, have you ever noticed there's a Pump It Up game for the PSP?

3103
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:49,640
I had heard there was a Pump It Up game on the PSP.

3104
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:55,640
I found out on Playasia, and I'm like, what the heck?

3105
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:58,640
Okay, I can understand DDR on this thing, but not Pump It Up,

3106
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:01,640
because that takes five icons.

3107
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:04,640
And we got the four external sort of square.

3108
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,640
I don't know what I'm supposed to use, like R.

3109
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:07,640
Well, what about the shoulder buttons?

3110
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:09,640
I assumed it was the shoulder button.

3111
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:11,640
I mean, if you're going to play DDR on a handheld,

3112
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:14,640
Pump It Up makes sense to me.

3113
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:17,640
Especially because there's a ton of fans of that other...

3114
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:19,640
God damn, what's the Korean game?

3115
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:20,640
The name escapes me.

3116
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:21,640
DJ Maxx, thank you.

3117
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:24,640
There's huge fans of that game.

3118
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,640
Yeah, even though I got to say that's a little bit harder,

3119
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:31,640
but okay, here's one thing I'd really love to see remade on the Wii

3120
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:33,640
that Konami should really do,

3121
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:36,640
especially with download content now available for Wii and everything,

3122
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:37,640
the Guitar Hero.

3123
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:40,640
I mean, why doesn't, in 360 and PS3,

3124
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:45,640
why doesn't Konami try to re-release Beat Mania with the download content?

3125
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:48,640
I mean, that would make a whole lot of sense.

3126
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,640
I would love that, but unfortunately,

3127
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:53,640
I think because of how Beat Mania 2 did,

3128
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:56,640
or I'm sorry, not Beat Mania 2, Beat Mania on the PS2 did,

3129
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:59,640
I don't think they're in any hurry to put out a new Beat Mania game.

3130
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:01,640
I don't think it sold well enough for them.

3131
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:03,640
I had heard it exceeded expectations,

3132
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:05,640
but I could have always heard wrong,

3133
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,640
because they never did do a second one.

3134
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,640
If it sold that well, they would have done a second one.

3135
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:13,640
I mean, as far as I know, DDR Universe 2 did not sell that great

3136
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,640
compared to older DDR titles,

3137
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,640
but they still made a 3,

3138
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:20,640
and it wasn't just a reskinned version of the other ones,

3139
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:23,640
because 2 was kind of just a reskinned Universe 1.

3140
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:25,640
Just thinking of DDR,

3141
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:29,640
haven't you noticed there hasn't been a single one out for the PS3?

3142
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:32,640
They're still rehashing on the PS2.

3143
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:34,640
It is interesting there hasn't been one on the PS3,

3144
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,640
and I'm wondering if that's not going to be one of the things

3145
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:39,640
Konami pulls out of their hat at E3 this year,

3146
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:40,640
because you're right.

3147
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:45,640
The PS3 is one of those platforms that hasn't seen a DDR game on it yet.

3148
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:48,640
Maybe that will be where we start to see the download content and all that stuff.

3149
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:49,640
Who knows?

3150
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,640
But I don't know.

3151
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:53,640
At the same time, I'm not going to hold my breath.

3152
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:55,640
Plus, here's one thing.

3153
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:57,640
I've been seeing tons of YouTube videos

3154
02:35:57,640 --> 02:36:00,640
where people have been controlling Beat Mania

3155
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,640
using a guitar hero controller with the five keys mode.

3156
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,640
Pretty darn interesting.

3157
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:08,640
And then the scratch is the strum bar.

3158
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:10,640
Pretty bored.

3159
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,640
Let me ask you this.

3160
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:15,640
I would probably have to try it out, but I don't know.

3161
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:18,640
I'm not bored enough to set that all up.

3162
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:20,640
If I'm going to play Beat Mania, I'm going to play it the way it was intended.

3163
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,640
Let me ask you this, because the call's going a little long.

3164
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,640
I've got to get some other calls.

3165
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:26,640
I want to ask you this, because obviously you're a big music game fan.

3166
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:29,640
I want to ask you about this question that came up kind of earlier in the show

3167
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:33,640
about the whole guitar hero on the DS versus rock band on the PSP thing.

3168
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:35,640
Are you interested in rock band on the PSP,

3169
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:37,640
or are you interested in guitar hero on the DS?

3170
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:39,640
What do you think?

3171
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,640
I've actually bought the guitar hero DS,

3172
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:46,640
and it's pretty darn interesting and pretty good for what it is.

3173
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:51,640
I was surprised at the graphics for it for a DS game for guitar hero-wise,

3174
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:54,640
and the sound quality was pretty darn good.

3175
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,640
I think the style that they're going with,

3176
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:59,640
the PSP version of rock band, that was pretty darn interesting.

3177
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:05,640
You'd think they would try to mod, like, redo the guitar grip,

3178
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:10,640
and then try to do some little quirky little drum set that you plug on top,

3179
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:12,640
and then you just hit it with your fingers,

3180
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,640
because I think that would be kind of fun.

3181
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:18,640
Yeah, but at the same time I like the idea that they're just doing an amplitude-type game

3182
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,640
that you're not going to need any of these stupid peripherals for.

3183
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:22,640
I kind of like that idea.

3184
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:26,640
Yeah, but that's also the same control scheme for DJ Max on the PSP,

3185
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,640
which I kind of suck at.

3186
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:33,640
I try it with the two-hand configuration like you would for Beatmania,

3187
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:35,640
and I still suck.

3188
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,640
I guess it's extremely hard even on the slow play mode.

3189
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,640
I cannot do it.

3190
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:43,640
All right, well, DS Master, we've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls,

3191
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,640
but thank you so much for your opinions tonight,

3192
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:47,640
and have fun with the music games, okay?

3193
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:49,640
Oh, by the way, one more thing before I go.

3194
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:52,640
Hopefully EA and the whole gaming industry of America

3195
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:56,640
does not call for a bailout from Barack Obama.

3196
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:58,640
That would suck.

3197
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:01,640
Do they need one? Maybe.

3198
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:02,640
Would they be eligible?

3199
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:05,640
Probably midway.

3200
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:07,640
They need more than a bailout.

3201
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:09,640
They need a freaking water pump.

3202
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:11,640
All right, DS Master, I've got to let you go,

3203
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:13,640
but thank you so much for the call.

3204
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:14,640
Take care, buddy.

3205
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,640
Keep going and keep rocking the good shows.

3206
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:17,640
Thank you very much.

3207
02:38:17,640 --> 02:38:22,640
All right, Dark Soccer, you seem like you're dying to comment on the bailout message.

3208
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:23,640
No.

3209
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:25,640
All right.

3210
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:28,640
Are you guys talking about the...

3211
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:29,640
I would think I was just saying them all.

3212
02:38:29,640 --> 02:38:31,640
Am I seeing a glitch in Ninja Blade here?

3213
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:33,640
Because the monster has no health left,

3214
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:36,640
and I keep hitting it, and it's not dying.

3215
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:37,640
No, you just suck.

3216
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:38,640
All right, let's go to the call.

3217
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:41,640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3218
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,640
It did the Mega Man 3 trick.

3219
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,640
Uh-oh, did it cut off?

3220
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:47,640
Okay, whoever...

3221
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,640
I have to explain this trick.

3222
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:49,640
What?

3223
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:50,640
Hurry, because we've got to call on the line.

3224
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,640
Okay, we'll call her going.

3225
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,640
Okay, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3226
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:55,640
Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

3227
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:58,640
Hey, DJ Tyrant. I haven't heard you on the show in a long time. What's up?

3228
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:03,640
Hey, not much. I'm trying out the Skype for iPhone app. It seems to work pretty well.

3229
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:05,640
Whoa, you're calling us from iPhone right now?

3230
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,640
Yeah.

3231
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:09,640
Wow, not too shabby. All right, I forgot that that's available now.

3232
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:12,640
So those of you with iPhones, you can Skype us during the show on your iPhones.

3233
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:14,640
Thank you for reminding us of that. I have to check that out.

3234
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:17,640
It only works on Wi-Fi, though. Remember that.

3235
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:22,640
That's true. Still, that's, you know, your regular Skype will only work with an internet connection, too.

3236
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:23,640
What's on your mind?

3237
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:30,640
That's true. Just, I know it's all the talk of today, but DSI, I really enjoy mine personally.

3238
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:37,640
I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade. I got to play it last week at an event I got invited to,

3239
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:45,640
and I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade, but I can see it's not for everyone, definitely.

3240
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:48,640
What about it makes it such a great upgrade?

3241
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:58,640
I like, I really like the screens. The controls are much better. Like, the D-pad and the buttons just in general feel a lot better and more sturdy.

3242
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:03,640
Because the D-pad was really floaty on the light, I thought.

3243
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:09,640
Sometimes I keep forgetting this is actually the third DS now we've gotten between DS Fat and DS Lite. I sometimes forget that.

3244
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:12,640
Anyhow, do you still work in games retail?

3245
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:13,640
No, I don't.

3246
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:16,640
Okay, I thought for some reason you did, but then I also heard you'd moved on.

3247
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:22,640
I don't know if you still know people there or what have you, but have you heard what the reception to this has been at all?

3248
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:28,640
I haven't heard too much. Yeah, I haven't really heard anything.

3249
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:31,640
Alright, sorry. My bad for asking.

3250
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:33,640
No worries.

3251
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:39,640
So, okay, so you're more of a fan of the DSI then. Is there anything that you're looking forward to?

3252
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:45,640
Like, we've seen some announcements recently of the Zelda Spirit Tracks and so on. What are you looking forward to from Nintendo on DS?

3253
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:54,640
Definitely the Zelda game. I honestly am looking forward to these new play control games because I missed out on them on the GameCube.

3254
02:40:54,640 --> 02:41:00,640
I'm kind of looking forward to them and they're not too badly priced either, which is a good thing.

3255
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:03,640
Cheap is good. You're right, cheap is always a good thing. I don't mind that.

3256
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:09,640
And of course the DSI where I really hope that that takes off like the App Store has on the iPhone.

3257
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:14,640
I know it's not open though. That's really going to, I think, hurt it in the long run though.

3258
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:21,640
I tend to agree, but at the same time, you know, it is a double-edged sword and I could see the other side of the argument where,

3259
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:27,640
well, look at all the shit that's on the iPhone store because there's some real crap apps on the iPhone.

3260
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:31,640
It's so hard to comb through there and find some decent games sometimes.

3261
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:37,640
And you think there's supposed to be some quality control out there, but it's not much. It is not much.

3262
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:44,640
So I guess maybe, you know, by closing it off, Nintendo will release quote-unquote quality apps on the DSI,

3263
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:47,640
but at the same time, some of these games don't sound that quality.

3264
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:49,640
Well, look at the WiiWare stuff.

3265
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:52,640
Yeah, I guess that's true. Is there anything on WiiWare you enjoy?

3266
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:59,640
I don't know if you really enjoy the fun. I see Crystal Chronicles, or not Crystal Chronicles, whatever.

3267
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:01,640
My Life is King?

3268
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:08,640
Yeah, and The Lost Winds has been really good. I haven't really bought anything since then because of the whole storage issue,

3269
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:12,640
but now that they fixed that, I might start buying again.

3270
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:17,640
Yeah, I actually finally updated the firmware this week and put some games on my SD card,

3271
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:21,640
and I have like 500 blocks free on my Wii now. I'm just like, wow, this isn't real.

3272
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:26,640
I don't know if I'm going to go on a buying binge because I already bought a new sound system that sent me back a lot of money.

3273
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:31,640
But it's nice to know I have the space available when something comes out on the Wii that I must have.

3274
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:38,640
Yeah, but I agree with you that I really hope they have some sort of support like the PS3 and the PSP.

3275
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:44,640
I have a bad feeling I'm just dreaming with that, but you know it can be done.

3276
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:48,640
Look at the Nintendo channel that streams DS demos to your DS. It can be done.

3277
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:53,640
They just don't want to do it, or they're leaving it in their hat to unveil at a later conference.

3278
02:42:53,640 --> 02:43:00,640
Yeah, I mean that got me to buy Rhythm Heaven because they released a demo the day they gave it out at GDC,

3279
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:03,640
and I tried it and I was like, well, this is a game I have to pick up.

3280
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:06,640
Yeah, you know what, I played it at PAX and I remember really enjoying it.

3281
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:10,640
I did not realize the demo was on Nintendo channel and I might have to go check that out.

3282
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:15,640
Yeah, sometimes really good games sneak on there. They don't really announce what goes out there.

3283
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:18,640
They really don't. People got to keep a better eye on that.

3284
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:23,640
Alright, well, Jimmy, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in tonight, but any quick closing thoughts?

3285
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:24,640
Thanks for having me on.

3286
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,640
No problem. Any quick closing thoughts?

3287
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:29,640
Um, I can't think of anything right now.

3288
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:31,640
Alright, that's alright. Live radio is a lot of pressure.

3289
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:32,640
Take care, buddy.

3290
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,640
Alright, take care, buddy.

3291
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:38,640
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3292
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:41,640
We'll probably take one or two more calls and then we're going to call it a night.

3293
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,640
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3294
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:44,640
Hi.

3295
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:45,640
Hi.

3296
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:46,640
It's Deathwishing.

3297
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:47,640
Hi, Deathwishing.

3298
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,640
What's up?

3299
02:43:48,640 --> 02:44:01,640
Um, well, first of all, I'm burnout on my 360 and second of all, I'm rejecting that for one month because Operation Flashpoint, the new one's coming out I think next month.

3300
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:05,640
Okay, hold on. Back up. Aren't you the same guy that was having the points problems earlier?

3301
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:06,640
Yeah.

3302
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:14,640
Okay, so obviously that's all fixed and Nintendo. Xbox was very kind to you and all that. What did you end up running out and buying with those points?

3303
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:35,640
Um, I bought some rock band songs, my Call of Duty maps, and then with the extra points, oh, and I bought, my extra points, I bought one rock band song and a pack of burnout cars that came with a legendary cars pack which has like a DeLorean, like Back to the Future.

3304
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:37,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah.

3305
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:39,640
It has the Manhattan, you know.

3306
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:40,640
The Dukes of Hazzard.

3307
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:47,640
The Dukes of Hazzard one, but it has a Mexican flag on it.

3308
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:51,640
My other question, was one of the rock band songs you bought Don't Stop Believin'?

3309
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:52,640
No, I didn't buy that.

3310
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:53,640
Fail.

3311
02:44:53,640 --> 02:45:09,640
I bought, like, Trash Unreal from Against Me, Come On, Come On from the Von Bondies, The Joker from Steve Miller, Sick Sick Sick from Queens of the Stone Age, and My Curse from Kill, Switch, and Gauge.

3312
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:13,640
Now, look, those songs are all fine and dandy, but it needs more epic classic rock.

3313
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:20,640
Um, thing is, I would buy classic rock, but there's no Led Zeppelin.

3314
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:26,640
Maybe, that's one of those bands that could put out their own game, like Aerosmith and Metallica.

3315
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,640
I don't like Aerosmith. In fact, I hate Aerosmith.

3316
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:35,640
Well, I'm just saying, though, they were able to put out their own game. You know, we can argue about the success of that game.

3317
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:37,640
Lead singer looks like a beat chick.

3318
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:43,640
Alright, look, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight? I asked you the question about the points. You were talking about...

3319
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:49,640
Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rise, I think it's Dragon Rise or something. Remember the old Operation Flashpoint? Did you ever play it?

3320
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:51,640
What system was it on?

3321
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:52,640
It was a PC game.

3322
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:53,640
And it was Xbox, I think.

3323
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,640
And Xbox, same thing.

3324
02:45:55,640 --> 02:46:01,640
I don't recall this game, but I'm going to look up and see if I get screenshots, because I'm a very visual person, sometimes that jogs my memory.

3325
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:03,640
I doubt it. It's a Call of Duty type of game.

3326
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:12,640
It's a military simulator, actually. It's like one of the more... I think, from what I remember, it was like one shot, pretty much, and we were dead.

3327
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:22,640
Hmm. You know, surprisingly enough, I think I saw this game, like, once. So, what about... are they making a new one, or what's up?

3328
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:25,640
Uh, yeah. Sequel's coming out. I think it's next month.

3329
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:27,640
End of next month.

3330
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:30,640
I'm not sure, though, but it's end of next month.

3331
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:32,640
Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rising.

3332
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:36,640
Yeah, and it's just like... it's like what I like.

3333
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:45,640
I want these shoot... like, I'm this guy who wants these shooters that aren't... like, I'm tired of kind of seeing these really Call of Duty-esque super arcadey.

3334
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:49,640
I get shot. Oh, look. I sit in the corner, suck my thumb. I'm okay.

3335
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:55,640
I love this, because it's like you get shot, you bleed out while moving around, or you're downed.

3336
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:59,640
And I love games, because it has a medic system. That's simply it.

3337
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:07,640
Um, you're a fan of shooters, and something that caught my eye this week was some of the screens from the new Wolfenstein game.

3338
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:09,640
What do you think of that?

3339
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:11,640
Is that a good... aw, was that like...

3340
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:13,640
It is in my pants.

3341
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:15,640
Okay.

3342
02:47:15,640 --> 02:47:17,640
I wasn't gonna say that, but there you go.

3343
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,640
I think it looks like crap, but, you know, that's...

3344
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:23,640
Shut up. Okay, can you play a gag in his mouth?

3345
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:25,640
Alright, well, he's playing a game.

3346
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:29,640
Wolfenstein Enemy Territory was so great, and it was free, too.

3347
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:31,640
What do you think of this new one? Is it gonna...

3348
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:33,640
Yeah, but that's Enemy Territory, that's not...

3349
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:36,640
Shut up! Is it gonna make everybody talk Wolfenstein again, or what?

3350
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:41,640
It looks like an updated version of Wolfenstein. It looks like Wolfenstein to today's standards.

3351
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:45,640
Ironsight, sprinting, you know, and then, all I notice is they better keep it class-based.

3352
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:51,640
They better keep it class-based, and they better keep it in that objective, like, online campaign stuff that I saw in Enemy Territory.

3353
02:47:51,640 --> 02:47:57,640
Where I will go to a school, go up to the principal, hit him in the balls, and then laugh.

3354
02:47:57,640 --> 02:48:00,640
And then go home and make myself a sandwich.

3355
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:06,640
Alright, what about the whole Hitler robot? That's what I would like to see make a comeback in Wolfenstein.

3356
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:08,640
Hitler robot is the boss.

3357
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:11,640
Sounds like an idea. Sounds like a plan.

3358
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:18,640
Don't you remember the old-school Wolfenstein? Like, I don't know, you might be a little young, but the old, old-school Wolfenstein game.

3359
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:22,640
Like, which one? Wolfenstein 3D or Wolfenstein, like, 2D?

3360
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:25,640
Okay, not that old-school. Yeah, Wolfenstein 3D.

3361
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:34,640
Uh, yes and no. I do remember there being a robot, but maybe I just couldn't tell if it was Hitler because I was, like, too stupid to know it was Hitler yet.

3362
02:48:34,640 --> 02:48:41,640
And plus, you know what, he wasn't the boss in the shareware one that most people played. He had to have the full one to see that.

3363
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:43,640
Hitler robot.

3364
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:49,640
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail the point from what you'd called in to talk about, but I just remembered I saw those Wolfenstein.

3365
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:53,640
Because, you know, I was a fan. I may not be the biggest shooter fan, but I loved Wolfenstein 3D.

3366
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,640
I love Wolfenstein 2.

3367
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:56,640
So, there you go.

3368
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Alright, well, uh...

3369
02:48:57,640 --> 02:49:02,640
That's the list of the games I love. Wolfenstein and, uh, Delta Force Black Hawk Down.

3370
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:06,640
Alright, well, we're gonna need you to call back when that game comes out, because I need to hear it from a shooter fan.

3371
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:09,640
Because I don't follow a lot of the shooters, so I need to know if the game's worth...

3372
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:10,640
I follow everything.

3373
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,640
Worth crossing over for.

3374
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:14,640
Alright, Deathwishing, any final thoughts before we let you go?

3375
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,640
Um...

3376
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:18,640
I still play Street Fighter IV. It's still awesome.

3377
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:19,640
It is still awesome.

3378
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:22,640
Think they'll unveil any secret characters. Downloadable.

3379
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:23,640
Or think it's just a dream.

3380
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:26,640
I think they need to get that tournament mode out quicker.

3381
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:27,640
Alright.

3382
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:29,640
If my principal's gonna get hurt faster.

3383
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,640
Deathwishing, we gotta let you go.

3384
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:34,640
Be careful when you threaten violence on the radio. Don't do it.

3385
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:35,640
Alright.

3386
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:36,640
See you, Deathwishing. Take care, buddy.

3387
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:37,640
Allegedly. Bye.

3388
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:38,640
Bye. Allegedly.

3389
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:39,640
Yeah, good, good.

3390
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:40,640
Throw that in there.

3391
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,640
Throw that in there. Allegedly.

3392
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:42,640
Alright, uh...

3393
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,640
We have time for one more call?

3394
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:45,640
One more quick call.

3395
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:47,640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3396
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:49,640
Uh, this is Spazinator.

3397
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:51,640
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

3398
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:53,640
Uh, yeah, um...

3399
02:49:53,640 --> 02:50:02,640
I just wanted to get your input on the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate.

3400
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:12,640
I was wondering, compared to Rock Band, do you think they're kind of whoring out Guitar Hero a little bit?

3401
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:13,640
Yeah, just a bit.

3402
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:18,640
Uh, yeah, they're whoring it out a lot, but at the same time, they can kind of get away with it right now.

3403
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:25,640
Because, you know, Best Buys and all these stores have sections upon sections dedicated to these games because they sell.

3404
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:28,640
I'm not a big fan of the artist-based games.

3405
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:32,640
I am not a big fan of them. I don't think they need the big fanfare they're getting.

3406
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:38,640
I think if they were released as, like, a CD and put in the CD rack or what have you, they would be a little more...

3407
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:41,640
I don't know. I kind of see that could be the way it's going at some point.

3408
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:47,640
But, I don't know. I think at some point, the market is going to crack at some point and it's...

3409
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:49,640
People are going to start rejecting it.

3410
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:58,640
And it's all going to come crashing down. Like a little leak in the dam, suddenly it's all going to come crashing down.

3411
02:50:58,640 --> 02:51:05,640
Yeah, I was thinking more or less the same thing. I mean, although it's kind of a different genre altogether,

3412
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:09,640
you kind of saw the same thing with the Tony Hawk games.

3413
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:15,640
I mean, they were releasing iteration after iteration with that series.

3414
02:51:15,640 --> 02:51:22,640
And basically, like what happened to that series, people kind of gave up on that series in favor of skates.

3415
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:31,640
I mean, you can't always draw a few parallels between the Tony Hawk series and Guitar Hero, almost.

3416
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:37,640
You know, I will say this, though. I think Rock Band 2 has really succeeded with the store.

3417
02:51:37,640 --> 02:51:40,640
And, you know, I think it's succeeded in a place where Guitar Hero hasn't.

3418
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:45,640
Granted, Guitar Hero has released a lot of downloadable content and songs,

3419
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:49,640
but the place where Rock Band 2 has got them is that they've done it consistently.

3420
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:52,640
They've consistently put out a lot of songs on their store.

3421
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:59,640
And, you know what? Very few games can I say that six months after release, I'm still playing it at least once a week.

3422
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:02,640
You know, very few games can I say that.

3423
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:12,640
Yeah, yeah. In fact, I'm checking the Rock Band store constantly, and to some degree I even do the same with Guitar Hero.

3424
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:19,640
And occasionally, you know, I do see some songs on the Guitar Hero store that I do like,

3425
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:27,640
like Blyton Allen's No Rain and whatnot, but compared to Rock Band, you know,

3426
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:35,640
Guitar Hero really doesn't have a whole lot that I would consider going out and getting compared to Rock Band, you know.

3427
02:52:35,640 --> 02:52:38,640
But, again, that's just me.

3428
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:47,640
You know, at least in my opinion, it seems like Rock Band has a better structure of music, though.

3429
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:55,640
I think Rock Band's got the better music, too, but I do understand that Guitar Hero has to lean towards more guitar-driven songs.

3430
02:52:55,640 --> 02:53:01,640
Sometimes, you know, that might not necessarily be the same stuff I listen to, but I like Rock Band because you do more band-based songs, you know.

3431
02:53:01,640 --> 02:53:05,640
And some have guitar solos, but some have drum solos, some have vocal.

3432
02:53:05,640 --> 02:53:08,640
Like, Don't Stop Believin'. Not a song really notable for its...

3433
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:13,640
Well, it does have a pretty bitchin' guitar solo, and it's really fuckin' hard on Rock Band Expert, by the way.

3434
02:53:13,640 --> 02:53:19,640
I can't do that part, but, like, most people know Don't Stop Believin' for the vocals.

3435
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:26,640
You know, you don't really get songs like that in Rock Band. I mean, in Guitar Hero.

3436
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:36,640
Yeah. Now, with me, one thing I noticed is, well, kind of like you, I can't really do the Expert level stuff yet.

3437
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:43,640
I'm still getting started on the Medium level because I'm kind of new to the whole music-y thing.

3438
02:53:43,640 --> 02:54:03,640
But, you know, at least with Guitar Hero, since they're more or less emulating the Rock Band sets, you would think that, even though the name is Guitar Hero, they would encompass some other varieties of music.

3439
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:08,640
You know, it's probably some of the guitar-heavy stuff, you know?

3440
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:21,640
Yeah. I don't know, though. Guitar Hero just... Guitar Hero feels like a bit of a scattered mess right now, and I hope if they're going to do another big Guitar Hero, what, five this year as their big game, I hope they find some focus.

3441
02:54:21,640 --> 02:54:26,640
But, Spaznier, we gotta let you go because we're running out of time. We want to end tonight so we can get to our afterbirth and so on.

3442
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:29,640
Do you have any quick final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

3443
02:54:29,640 --> 02:54:35,640
Uh, yeah. Final fantasy, you know, whoever rules, well, sucks. No, just kidding.

3444
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:39,640
Yeah, yeah. All right. Get off the show. All right. See you, Spaznier. Thanks for the call.

3445
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:41,640
All right. Take care. Have a good one.

3446
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:42,640
All right. Bye.

3447
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:51,640
By the way, I didn't mention during my gaming week this week, I actually went back to World of Warcraft this week because I'm a big fat addict, but I haven't been playing that much.

3448
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:56,640
Look, we got one more call coming in. I want to take it because I noticed it was a name I haven't heard from in a while. I want to let him on the show.

3449
02:54:56,640 --> 02:54:38,640
Hi, you're on Orange

3450
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,640
It's Brad from Pod Culture.

3451
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:08,640
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How's Dollhouse going? I've heard Dollhouse, and I know you do your Dollhouse show, too. I've heard Dollhouse has really picked up in the last three weeks.

3452
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:10,640
Oh, yes, it has.

3453
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:17,640
I need to go back and catch up because I want to watch the first couple episodes and then I just kind of got distracted and was watching other stuff, but I heard it got really good.

3454
02:55:17,640 --> 02:55:23,640
Yeah, if you kind of gave it up, it's definitely picked up some steam.

3455
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:26,640
All right. Well, I think you still watch it all on Hulu, right?

3456
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:27,640
I believe so, yeah.

3457
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:34,640
All right, I'm going to have to go check that out. Well, look, I know you didn't call to talk about Dollhouse so that you probably would anyway. What did you call in to talk about tonight, Brad?

3458
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:45,640
Actually, I don't know if you'd mentioned it on the show before, but I've got an iPhone game that is just great.

3459
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:46,640
Hmm, what's that?

3460
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:48,640
It's Zombieville, USA.

3461
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:52,640
I'm interested already. What's in Zombieville, USA?

3462
02:55:52,640 --> 02:56:01,640
It's just this little side scroller cartoony shooting zombies game. Three simple controls, right, left, and you tap in the middle and you shoot.

3463
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:05,640
Is it a bloody game? Do you get decapitated zombies and all that fun stuff?

3464
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:07,640
You do, but it's kind of cartoony.

3465
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:15,640
I can deal with cartoon violence. I don't like blood orgy. We already had the blood orgy discussion earlier in the show. Cartoony violence, especially with zombies, is okay.

3466
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:24,640
Oh, it's great. It's pretty much the same level over and over, but at the end of each level you can find cash, you upgrade your weapons.

3467
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:26,640
Is there a cost with said game?

3468
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:28,640
It's like two or three bucks.

3469
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:32,640
It's not that bad. Is there a demo or a movie or anything I can see online to get a taste for it?

3470
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:35,640
I'm not 100% certain.

3471
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:39,640
You're not the developer. I shouldn't grill you on this stuff, but I'm just curious how you found it or what have you.

3472
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:45,640
Well, there you go. Check that out if you're interested in some zombie killing.

3473
02:56:45,640 --> 02:56:51,640
It's good to hear about some good iPhone games, especially when we're talking about all the crap that's out there on the marketplace as well.

3474
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:55,640
It's a good way to waste a lot of time.

3475
02:56:55,640 --> 02:57:01,640
Yes, I've wasted a lot of time with some of those games, like WordFu and some of those iPhone games they have.

3476
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:05,640
Great time wasters, especially when I'm lying in bed, but I don't want to go to sleep just yet.

3477
02:57:05,640 --> 02:57:08,640
I'll reach over and grab my phone and play a couple games and it'll make me tired.

3478
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:13,640
Alright, Brad, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up. Any quick thoughts for our listeners?

3479
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:14,640
Later on.

3480
02:57:14,640 --> 02:57:16,640
Any final thoughts?

3481
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:18,640
Nope.

3482
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:20,640
Well, take care and have a good one, buddy.

3483
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:21,640
Later on.

3484
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:25,640
Alright, that was our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad, here on Orange Lawns Radio.

3485
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:32,640
That was definitely, definitely the last call, but he hadn't been on the show in a while and he's a good friend of the show and does his own indie podcast.

3486
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:39,640
We'd like to support our fellow indie podcasters, but as for tonight's show, it's got to be coming to a close.

3487
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:43,640
So, is there any other last minute stories that we didn't get to earlier?

3488
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:44,640
Yes, Loki.

3489
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:47,640
It kind of ties into what we were talking about a little bit earlier.

3490
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:48,640
Sure.

3491
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:57,640
Apparently, there has been a, what is it, a kind of like a slide that had been leaked out.

3492
02:57:57,640 --> 02:58:05,640
It was during one of the GDC, I guess one of their conferences that they had with Dan Teasdale.

3493
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:12,640
And he did a panel called Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Design Lessons Learned from Rock Band.

3494
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:24,640
And it's interesting, though, because he then released a PDF version, or they released a PDF version of the session and all the slides are on there.

3495
02:58:24,640 --> 02:58:31,640
It had an earlier version of the slide that had been omitted from the actual show.

3496
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:36,640
And it reveals Lego Rock Band.

3497
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:38,640
I heard about this.

3498
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:43,640
I think Tiger Claw sent me a link to this and I neglected to get to it in the Twitter part, but okay.

3499
02:58:43,640 --> 02:58:48,640
But it's interesting, though, they're also mentioning the PSP Rock Band is on there as well.

3500
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,640
The Beatles Rock Band.

3501
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:55,640
And then there's a ton of Guitar Hero stuff, which I'm really whoring that stuff out.

3502
02:58:55,640 --> 02:59:03,640
But they have Guitar Hero Modern Hits, Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits, Guitar Hero, well now Smash Hits.

3503
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:10,640
Guitar Hero Arcade, which I guess maybe they're porting the arcade version over, which I don't know why because it was three.

3504
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:13,640
Guitar Hero Fiving, Guitar Hero Band Hero.

3505
02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:19,640
And then there's Guitar Hero Mobile 2, and Mystery Game that's also on mobile.

3506
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:25,640
And I know everyone says, oh my god, both companies are whoring the franchise out.

3507
02:59:25,640 --> 02:59:33,640
And yeah, Lego Rock Band I can understand is maybe not, I don't know, it's not exactly the way they go.

3508
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:39,640
But the way I look at it, it's a way to introduce Rock Band to younger kids and you don't have to buy it.

3509
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:43,640
It's not like it's going to have songs in there that you're really probably going to need to buy.

3510
02:59:43,640 --> 02:59:46,640
They're only going to be available in Lego Rock Band.

3511
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:51,640
Whereas the Guitar Hero games, you can't port that shit over.

3512
02:59:51,640 --> 02:59:56,640
If you buy Metallica, well those Metallica songs are stuck on the Metallica game.

3513
02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:03,640
So you can't really bring that over, which I think is where the developers differ the most.

3514
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:10,640
That's why I kind of respect Rock Band a little bit more because at least if you're going to put out a song, or anything they do to their track packs obviously,

3515
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:13,640
those are also optional since they're all available online.

3516
03:00:13,640 --> 03:00:21,640
It's an option, you don't have to buy it, but if you do buy it you can import it into your game and it all seamlessly works.

3517
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:24,640
Whereas Guitar Hero, I gotta have a stack of discs.

3518
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:28,640
That's it. Oh, that's it for that story at least.

3519
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:36,640
We also talked a little bit about Unreal Tournament 3 and how they had a mod for that to play in another video game, like Sonic the Hedgehog.

3520
03:00:36,640 --> 03:00:42,640
Well, Team Fortress 2, someone's made a map that's sort of like a Mario Kart track, which is kind of neat.

3521
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:47,640
But, I mean, it's definitely not based on a real Mario Kart track, it just kind of has the graphics of it.

3522
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:50,640
So that's kind of neat.

3523
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:54,640
And then, let's see here.

3524
03:00:54,640 --> 03:00:59,640
There was another website, I guess, WeOperaSDK.com.

3525
03:00:59,640 --> 03:01:07,640
They've released a Twitter, which is a WeRapid blogging, I don't know if it's, I'm assuming it's like Twitter,

3526
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:13,640
but it's their own website that's formatted for the Wii.

3527
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:15,640
Neat.

3528
03:01:15,640 --> 03:01:18,640
Could have been that DSI message board, right?

3529
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:19,640
Could have been.

3530
03:01:19,640 --> 03:01:24,640
And yeah, I guess they're going to have different things that they've incorporated to this.

3531
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:33,640
IRC style commands, smileys, possible integration with the Wii message board, I guess email updates or something like that.

3532
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:38,640
Web skinning, that sort of stuff. That's neat.

3533
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:41,640
That's it.

3534
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:45,640
Alright, well we need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up the show tonight.

3535
03:01:45,640 --> 03:01:51,640
DarkSakura, you've been awfully quiet over there in the corner, poking away, talking to some of our AIM listeners and so on.

3536
03:01:51,640 --> 03:01:53,640
Any final thoughts tonight?

3537
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:57,640
Yawn, you look like you're going to, I don't think you're going to nap.

3538
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:00,640
If you go and lie down, you're going to go to sleep.

3539
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:03,640
I'm pretty tired. We spent three and a half hours in IKEA.

3540
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:04,640
Oh my god.

3541
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:11,640
We went to eat, and the intention was to spend two, and then we ran into some people that Becky knew, because I went with Becky.

3542
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:14,640
And I sort of know one of them.

3543
03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:17,640
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but Swedish meatballs.

3544
03:02:17,640 --> 03:02:18,640
And shiny.

3545
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:19,640
And Swedish meatballs.

3546
03:02:19,640 --> 03:02:23,640
Well, that's what I had. And there was shiny, there was so much shiny, I kept going, ooh, shiny.

3547
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:24,640
Ooh, shiny.

3548
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:28,640
And then staring at stuff, so, hi, Kia, evil.

3549
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:32,640
Alright. Um, the doctor, thank you so much for being here tonight.

3550
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:37,640
And, you know, you definitely joined in on the conversation, and we always appreciate having you here on the show.

3551
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:38,640
Please come back again.

3552
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:39,640
Woo!

3553
03:02:39,640 --> 03:02:41,640
And thanks for participating in tonight's Listless and all that fun stuff.

3554
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:43,640
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

3555
03:02:43,640 --> 03:02:47,640
Um, in honor of Rice Princess. Poop.

3556
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:49,640
Why isn't she here tonight? Shame on her.

3557
03:02:49,640 --> 03:02:50,640
I don't know, she didn't get my text.

3558
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:54,640
You didn't, I didn't get your text either. I think you need to check your cell phone company.

3559
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:56,640
You need to call them and yell at them.

3560
03:02:56,640 --> 03:03:03,640
Um, my final thought is, I need food. I'm very hungry. I'm, like, dying of hunger pains.

3561
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:05,640
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought.

3562
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:07,640
I don't know, I don't have anything.

3563
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:09,640
Alright, boy, aren't you boring.

3564
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,640
Yes, I am.

3565
03:03:10,640 --> 03:03:13,640
How is Ninja Blade? You've been playing that for, like, three hours now during the show.

3566
03:03:13,640 --> 03:03:18,640
It's frustrating, because you die pretty easy in it, so it's hard.

3567
03:03:18,640 --> 03:03:20,640
And I'm playing on normal difficulty in it.

3568
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:34,640
Um, the thing is, I, as you probably saw, there was a glitch, a level-ending glitch where I couldn't defeat the boss because he ran out of life and I just sat there slashing at the dead corpse and it wouldn't trigger the event that I needed it to trigger.

3569
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:40,640
So I had to restart there, but, um, it's okay. It's alright. It's neat.

3570
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:45,640
They've got a lot of really over-the-top stuff going on, but, um, it's a neat game.

3571
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:47,640
I'll probably finish it.

3572
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:52,640
Okay. Alright, well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3573
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:56,640

3576
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:06,640
You can, um, you know, post a kind review, a five-star review on iTunes.

3577
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:08,640
That helps sell the show and bumps up our ranking a little bit.

3578
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:11,640
Or mention us on your Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff.

3579
03:04:11,640 --> 03:04:17,640
I'm looking at Twitter right now and looking at some of the at OLR messages and DJ Ratchet says I'm listening to OLR and laughing my butt off.

3580
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,640
Well, I laughed a lot tonight too, so thank you.

3581
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:23,640
DJ Tyrant is pimping his appearance on the show tonight. We appreciate that. Hey, hey.

3582
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:27,640
So, uh, thank you guys so much for, uh, all of that, supporting the show.

3583
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:30,640
You guys are awesome. We do it for you guys for free every week.

3584
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:33,640
And we'll do it all again next week. How's that sound?

3585
03:04:33,640 --> 03:04:35,640
Yay.

3586
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:37,640
Alright.

3587
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:45,640
Well, we'll see you in one week here on Orange Launch Radio. Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's Dark Soccer, he's Loki, he's the Dokta, and we're out of here. See you next week.

3588
03:05:07,640 --> 03:05:17,640
Orange Launch Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Launch Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway. See you next week.
