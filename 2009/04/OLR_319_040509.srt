00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:25,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I, April 5th, 2009, Konami prepares to juggle two scary franchises, most Oblivion DLC gets a price cut, and have the release dates been leaked for highly anticipated Wii games?

2
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:41,406
[SPEAKER_13]: We are that video game show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:46,669
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week, as well as the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what up?

6
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, how are you?

7
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I survive.

8
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:52,812
[SPEAKER_13]: You survive?

9
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:53,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I survive.

10
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,094
[SPEAKER_13]: On the souls of innocent children.

11
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:58,708
[SPEAKER_13]: FlashMediaEncoder3

12
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:24,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Ninja Blade

13
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,031
[SPEAKER_13]: and we do that video and then we do audio of the show.

14
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:53,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Now soon, we're going to upgrade and have a little switch box and then we can switch back and forth between the camera and the game and that would be super.

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,353
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be even cooler.

16
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:55,134
[SPEAKER_13]: What would that be?

17
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:55,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Picture in picture?

18
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Picture in picture?

19
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:57,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know about that.

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you're talking money.

21
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:01,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Switch box like 1999.

22
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:03,638
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd be surprised.

23
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,739
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not as hard as you think.

24
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:06,380
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe for the future.

26
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:09,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Joining us tonight, we do have a special guest.

27
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:15,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually very excited because I didn't think we were going to have a special guest, but he just kind of showed up last minute.

28
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:16,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Boy, I'm happy he's here.

29
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Say hello to Casper the Gay.

30
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:19,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Who is now the Doctor.

31
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:20,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the Doctor.

32
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:20,689
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,090
[SPEAKER_13]: How long ago did you change your name?

34
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,331
[SPEAKER_12]: About six months ago.

35
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,252
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago.

36
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:24,692
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

37
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Casper the gay doctor is here.

38
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, yeah.

39
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:27,675
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

40
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:28,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it still works.

41
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:29,417
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing, Casper?

42
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

43
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:31,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really good.

44
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm helping everyone with their medical problems.

45
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

46
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Ghost.

47
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:36,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

48
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,687
[SPEAKER_13]: You're wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt today.

49
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:39,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and a hat.

50
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:40,969
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I got the Hyrule symbol on my hat.

51
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:41,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, look at you go.

52
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm nerded out today for the show.

53
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:44,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to ask you real quick.

54
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Legend of Zelda spirit tracks, yay or nay?

55
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:47,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah.

56
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:49,714
[SPEAKER_12]: ZELDA FANBOY

57
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:25,521
[SPEAKER_02]: What they should have done is every time that he, you know, in the original game, every time that he got on the boat, they would play the Lonely Island I'm On A Boat song.

58
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would be awesome.

59
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:31,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, believe me when I say, Link F'd a mermaid.

60
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a boat, you guys.

61
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,205
[SPEAKER_07]: In Hyrule, you guys.

62
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:38,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

63
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think they're going to sell a lot of copies of that?

64
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:41,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

65
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,858
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a Zealot title, so I'm sure, but it'll probably be boring.

66
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,121
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it sells a lot, then they're going to do a sequel, Spirit Tracks 2, Link on a Boat.

67
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,541
[SPEAKER_13]: That one I would actually buy.

68
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Busting Octoroks with my boomerang.

69
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:55,644
[SPEAKER_04]: If it had T-Pain as a character only, though.

70
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:56,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell.

71
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:11,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get to how we always like to start the show off with a little bit of, how was your gaming week?

72
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,048
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

73
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I played, um, stuff.

74
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I played Pet Society on Facebook, which I've become oddly addicted to.

75
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,411
[SPEAKER_13]: At least it's not Neopets.

76
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck no.

77
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:32,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I played some more Cookie Mama on iPhone, and then I didn't actually finish what I was cooking, so whatever.

78
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:33,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

79
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Mama fixed it.

80
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:42,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got something from Alva eBay that arrived in perfect condition for seven bucks.

81
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,960
[SPEAKER_07]: The item was fine.

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The box was nasty.

83
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,503
[SPEAKER_07]: It had mildew and shit, but it was brand new.

84
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:50,685
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Capcom fighting stick for the Genesis.

85
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:51,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

86
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Why did you order that?

87
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have several Genesees.

88
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I wanted one.

89
00:04:58,471 --> 00:04:59,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It was seven bucks.

90
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:01,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, why not?

91
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Just impulse buy.

92
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,477
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't break it out to try anything with?

93
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,818
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't get old school championship edition or anything?

94
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:08,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we already have all that.

95
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, just checking.

96
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got the FC Mobile.

97
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, what is this all about?

98
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:15,183
[SPEAKER_13]: The FC Mobile.

99
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:16,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a handheld NES.

100
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really all it is.

101
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:20,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how long the battery life is.

102
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:23,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan played it more than me, but we played Guardian Legend.

103
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,229
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing's got to be somewhat big if you actually put an entire cartridge into it.

104
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it about the size of an NES cartridge, the system?

105
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:33,072
[SPEAKER_07]: About the width plus another two inches.

106
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:37,614
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not the Atari where it has all the games inside it in the memory.

107
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,834
[SPEAKER_07]: You plug in your cartridge.

108
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:41,055
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a Game Boy, but it plays NES games.

109
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,395
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the FC Mobile.

110
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:42,716
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like $40.

111
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:44,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's not bad.

112
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:45,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're really light.

113
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:46,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that because of the whole thing?

114
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:56,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the same reason they were selling the third-party NESs at E3 a few years ago where it's something like the patent on the Nintendo property expired because it's been like 20 years?

115
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Something like that I want to say.

116
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:04,076
[SPEAKER_13]: So would that mean that in a couple of years we're going to start seeing like Super Nintendos and Genesis start coming out and all these things?

117
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to do a Genesis one, Rob.

118
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

119
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the Nomad.

120
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, Dan was hilarious.

121
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, also the fact Sega repackages their games like 50 times over.

122
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was very hilarious about this, and if he hears it, he's going to be a little bit embarrassed, but I don't care.

123
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:30,475
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, I wonder if, you know, they're going to do a super... Because it was like you were saying, it talks about doing a handheld Genesis.

124
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,677
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, wait, wait, we have that.

125
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Nomad.

126
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:48,289
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was like, yes, sweetie, pat, pat, pat Question from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice So be heard, join our chat live on Sunday night Hitstun asks, how is the hardware?

127
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the screen good?

128
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good, pretty good, I like it You don't have dead pixels?

129
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:54,794
[SPEAKER_13]: No Well, that's good

130
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:57,408
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:18,801
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

132
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played some WiiWare stuff.

133
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:53,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played Bit.Trip Beat, which it's okay until they thought, hey, it's a great idea.

134
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:58,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have little blocks that are dark blue against a black background where you can't see them.

135
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,130
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I stopped playing the game.

136
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was it.

137
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:08,416
[SPEAKER_13]: JustinFYIChat is giving us feedback that they can't hear us on JustinTV right now.

138
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:09,577
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not getting audio on there.

139
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:10,878
[SPEAKER_13]: They're getting video but no audio.

140
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:15,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

141
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:35,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Another homebrew game, that's a demo for another game that I'd like not to mention on this show.

142
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:49,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just say it sucks as much as you would think it sucks, and the guy who made it is a douchebag, and I think we know who we're talking about here, but we are not mentioning his name, because that would be wrong.

143
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:58,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, my wife started playing Excite Truck again, in preparation for ExciteBots Trick Racing, so...

144
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited by that.

145
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,730
[SPEAKER_02]: She is.

146
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else did I play?

147
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty much it.

148
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:10,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of stuff that I was going to play, but I didn't get to play a lot of it.

149
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:14,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I checked out that stupid, I think we talked about it last week, the Kama Sutra DS thing.

150
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:15,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

151
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:16,934
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

152
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:20,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, that's it.

153
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Rhythm Tengoku, or Rhythm Heaven, I guess, to try out.

154
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:28,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And then more Peggle DS, because that's fun.

155
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,320
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,284
[SPEAKER_13]: NinjaBlade NinjaBlade

157
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:07,457
[SPEAKER_13]: and played that for a little bit.

158
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:11,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I've been gaining weight since I was sick last year and I wanted to see how much.

159
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,162
[SPEAKER_13]: So now you weigh 20 pounds.

160
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:13,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shut up.

161
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:21,489
[SPEAKER_13]: So I went back and played that for a little bit and was playing some of the old school classics on there like Legend of the Mystical Ninja and all that stuff.

162
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool, cool.

163
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,202
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:41,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

165
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

166
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,546
[SPEAKER_13]: It still feels a little clunky to me.

167
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:24,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I say clunky, I mean the download speeds of the areas as you load them.

168
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:30,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I realize you can download in the background and all this, but I kind of wish the thing was a little more intuitive.

169
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:35,593
[SPEAKER_13]: If I was going to start walking towards a particular map, it would be cool if that map would start loading.

170
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of a little...

171
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,377
[SPEAKER_13]: That's profiling.

172
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of polish that still needs to be done in home, but it is getting slightly better and better at the same time.

173
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:52,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Just slightly, but I do see improvement in home, and I think that has to be acknowledged because it is a pretty ambitious thing.

174
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:56,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a download yet that gives home a point?

175
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:59,197
[SPEAKER_13]: There are still more minigames popping up.

176
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:02,339
[SPEAKER_13]: The Guitar Hero area has a Simon Says-style minigame.

177
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,581
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nothing that awesome.

178
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:07,183
[SPEAKER_13]: It's free, but it's free.

179
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, might I remind everybody, you don't pay for home.

180
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:17,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Considering it's a free thing, granted, they microtransaction a lot of these clubs and things, but I have yet to pay a dollar.

181
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not in home, you're homeless.

182
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,506
[SPEAKER_13]: And nobody wants to be homeless.

183
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:26,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft in chat says, Home is second life without the crazy antics.

184
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,088
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru says, The big picture of home is make money.

185
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:32,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see where the more nickel and diming comes in a little later.

186
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,249
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I don't know.

187
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:34,169
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

188
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

189
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,190
[SPEAKER_13]: What else?

190
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,090
[SPEAKER_13]: In my gaming week.

191
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Really not a whole lot else that I can think of.

192
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:45,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox 360.

193
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:47,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Just playing some of the old arcade titles.

194
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Pagle and so forth.

195
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,733
[SPEAKER_13]: But not a lot of new stuff.

196
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I did forget one game I played.

197
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:52,636
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

198
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:54,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the game that we're playing right now.

199
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:59,379
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ninja Blade, I played during the week, actually, because I haven't really gotten a chance to play it since I got it.

200
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

201
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not too... Sorry, if you heard an echo there, it's because I was checking JustinTV where we do have audio, thank God.

202
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because you unplugged something from your splitter coming out of your computer.

203
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you had it hooked up there would have been fine, but they wouldn't have been able to hear the music that we played during the little break.

204
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

205
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:21,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, give us a quick walkthrough.

206
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:27,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is radio, and we'll try to keep the references to the video minimum, but kind of walk us through this game a little bit.

207
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:31,432
[SPEAKER_13]: You were talking about, I know, earlier before we started, this big epic cutscene at the beginning of Ninja Boy.

208
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:33,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so over the top that it's hilarious.

209
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:39,415
[SPEAKER_02]: The main character looks like he's the spirit, you know, Sans crappy movie.

210
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually very God of War-esque.

211
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically...

212
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

213
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,344
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the flippin' point?

214
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:15,868
[SPEAKER_13]: You say it's kind of God of War-esque?

215
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the point is you're this team of ninjas that...

216
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:21,669
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

217
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:50,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much the game.

218
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: But you like these over the top.

219
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:56,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, it's awesome.

220
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, but it's actually, you know, a lot of the games that are put out from software and stuff like that, they're not that great.

221
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is actually pretty good.

222
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:07,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been pretty entertaining so far.

223
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:13,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually looks like it's going to start me from the beginning because apparently I didn't get far enough to save.

224
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:19,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the more exciting because I'm going to show you that whole skydiving part.

225
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:24,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is a little cutscene that shows what happens when some old man sees some chick that's been infected.

226
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to see that.

227
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Skip that.

228
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:29,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

229
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:34,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me go to Casper, sorry, the doctor, and we'll ask the doctor about his gaming week and we'll come back to you.

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully you're a little bit into Ninja Blade at that point.

231
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:37,743
[SPEAKER_13]: You can tell us a little bit about the gameplay.

232
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:39,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, uh,

233
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,554
[SPEAKER_13]: The Doctor, how was your gaming week?

234
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you guys ever played that, but there's lots of crazy minigames.

235
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we have played that, or at least I watched Loki play it at PAX.

236
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,613
[SPEAKER_12]: The best minigame has to be the dancing.

237
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,094
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like DDR, but where you have to move your whole body.

238
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Watching my friend get into this was hilarious.

239
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:14,018
[SPEAKER_12]: We were cracking up.

240
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:15,859
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm with you.

241
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,781
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot of new stuff on any system that I'm like, woo!

242
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:20,548
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,970
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what does that even do?

244
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:52,912
[SPEAKER_12]: That's no point to me.

245
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it takes pictures, Doctor.

246
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, I have a camera, and I don't need another one.

247
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:00,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

248
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:03,822
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well.

249
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:07,926
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, but we're also watching Loki here.

250
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:11,569
[SPEAKER_12]: There are monsters and blood and swords and ridiculousness.

251
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Rawr!

252
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,992
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

253
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just, you know, basically right now they're just, you know, kind of teaching you the basics of the game.

254
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:42,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can do jump attacks.

255
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:45,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can do, like, heavy attacks and yada, yada, yada.

256
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:45,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill these guys.

257
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:53,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but it gets ridiculous because, like, your, like, sensei or whatever is kind of helping you out through the game and he gives you, like, these different weapons to use.

258
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, like, he's, like, flipping around and, you know, throwing people.

259
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's a quick time event where I gotta jump and I dodge that thing.

260
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:05,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's all Dragon's Lair where you just press a button.

261
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:06,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit a button.

262
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

263
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of interactive cut scenes and quick time events and a lot of stuff that I miss because it's hard to read them on this TV.

264
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:16,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.

265
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:16,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

266
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, and I'm looking at a comment in chat.

267
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:22,695
[SPEAKER_13]: For some reason, the JustinTV chat is borked tonight.

268
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I'm not seeing anything in the JustinTV chat.

269
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:26,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you guys are trying to yell at us there, don't even bother.

270
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:27,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to go to our main room.

271
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,001
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do see Misty saying, whoop blood.

272
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So, very bloody game.

273
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:33,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I get a whoop blood?

274
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:34,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoop blood.

275
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:39,708
[SPEAKER_13]: That game you were playing the other week on the GameCube, Mad World, that was way worse on the blood.

276
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:41,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost brought that again.

277
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:55,815
[SPEAKER_13]: I like this setup for the show where we have the game that we'll be running during the show and then someday we'll have the switcher so we'll go back to having the camera in studio when something exciting actually happens here in studio which is not that often.

278
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Interactive Cutscenes

279
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:21,074
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw in chat says basically OLR wants to copy FNG which is Friday Night Gaming Bobby's show here on All Games Radio.

280
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:21,975
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

281
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:24,457
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to copy Friday Night Gaming.

282
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:25,277
[SPEAKER_13]: They did their own thing.

283
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,680
[SPEAKER_13]: They fix stuff on air and we don't really get into that kind of stuff.

284
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:39,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus they have that whole gaming center thing where people like that All Games Interactive used to have back in the day where people could like walk in and out as they want to and seeing as we tape this show at my house that's not exactly going to be happening.

285
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:41,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Although we have had Perfect Strangers show up here before.

286
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember Moe?

287
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:43,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember?

288
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:49,241
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't even know her before we sent her an email on YouTube and she came here and sung the show, or sung the song on the show, so.

289
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,584
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we didn't do it.

290
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:55,199
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we've done the same shit for, what, seven years now?

291
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,980
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just slightly evolving a little bit as time goes on.

292
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,260
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

293
00:19:58,961 --> 00:19:59,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get in.

294
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:03,002
[SPEAKER_13]: The entire class says, OLR could turn into a gaming center if more guests show up.

295
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:03,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope not.

296
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is my house.

297
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:08,324
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, at 10, 10, 1030, I want everyone to get that out.

298
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I just walked in, so I'm another guest.

299
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:11,286
[SPEAKER_12]: What about me?

300
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:12,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but you're different because I know you.

301
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,727
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean the doctor and me.

302
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:16,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shut up.

303
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:16,948
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm different.

304
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:21,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, housekeeping tonight before we get into the gaming news.

305
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,310
[SPEAKER_13]: We're like 20 minutes into the show, we need to get into the gaming news.

306
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick warning, kind of a disclaimer tonight.

307
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:34,939
[SPEAKER_13]: It was April Fool's Week this week, and while we think we've done a pretty good job of weeding the actual news stories from the bullshit, there might have been some bullshit that snuck through, but I don't think tonight.

308
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got pretty much everything cleared.

309
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:48,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, don't forget to follow us on Twitter at UsernameOLR or follow us on Facebook, OLArmy, or follow us on LiveJournal at UsernameOrangeLounge.

310
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:53,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I want to make a mention of Orange Lounge Radio March Madness.

311
00:20:53,443 --> 00:21:00,587
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the thing that Bress Lowell really heads up, kind of spears it up for the Saturday night program here under Station Live.

312
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:03,029
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we kind of give our commentary running on it.

313
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:04,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It finally ended this last week.

314
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Seems like it went on for a while, but considering you had like 64 games that had to get narrowed down to one.

315
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:17,856
[SPEAKER_13]: there were no ties this year there was one clear winner in the final no ties that we have to break Super Mario Bros.

316
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:30,501
[SPEAKER_13]: 3 is your ultimate video game of all time per OLR March Madness this year which once again beat Chrono Trigger Chrono Trigger was the runner up for the second year in a row

317
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:32,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Mario Bros.

318
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:33,109
[SPEAKER_12]: 3 Super Mario Bros. 3

319
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:56,808
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not knocking on Chrono Trigger.

320
00:21:56,828 --> 00:21:59,770
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fabulous game, definitely worthy of the runner-up prize.

321
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,913
[SPEAKER_13]: However, you can't get mad that a game like Super Mario Bros.

322
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:04,634
[SPEAKER_13]: 3 beat it.

323
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,136
[SPEAKER_13]: If Rock Band had ultimately won...

324
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:25,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I could see you, because that was in the final four I could see you getting mad if Rock Band won I would have stopped playing video games forever I would have joined you And I love me Rock Band But like a fine wine, it needs to age a little bit It needs to age a little bit before it can truly be the ultimate video game of all time Alright

325
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:28,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Necessity Vampire in chat says, it's just a poll.

326
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,481
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a damn poll.

327
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:30,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cry.

328
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:32,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cry.

329
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,604
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

330
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:38,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're going to have to pause your game so you can start us off with some gaming news tonight about Sony.

331
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Big press conference, right?

332
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:41,203
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

333
00:22:57,093 --> 00:23:11,040
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is supposed to spike sales and allow the PlayStation brand to grow even more or it's just another way for them to say, hey look, look how many people we have on the PlayStation platform.

334
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:22,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the PlayStation 3 because the PlayStation 3 is in third place as far as the new consoles go but the PlayStation platform is number one because the PlayStation 2 is so popular.

335
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:24,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

336
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:27,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about time that they drop the price of it.

337
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's old.

338
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:29,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over 10 years old now.

339
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not a big surprise.

340
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:37,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, also, other than the U.S.

341
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:42,435
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the price drop, of course, we're going to see a price drop in Europe as well to 99 euros.

342
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And, unfortunately, no price drop for the U.K.

343
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

344
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:48,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

345
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:50,233
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

346
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:17,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is going to make any difference night and day

347
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that, and they're like, oh, it can impact sales of the Wii.

348
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:46,528
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't think it will, because... Well, because that's the market they're going for.

349
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:58,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of trying to... They're trying to make the price of the PlayStation 2 so lucrative that people will want to buy it instead of the Wii, because I think... I do think the PS2 is competing with the Wii for that sort of kids' bedroom toy.

350
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,090
[SPEAKER_13]: You know?

351
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,951
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Wii is not having the mass shortages that it used to have.

352
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:08,772
[SPEAKER_13]: That was kind of what was keeping the PlayStation 2 in some ways afloat, was that there was... Sometimes the Wii was gone, so people would opt for...

353
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:10,012
[SPEAKER_13]: PlayStation 2.

354
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't say PlayStation 2 is a bad system.

355
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:17,395
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't say there's no games available for the PlayStation 2.

356
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:21,096
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to drop the new price and the used price.

357
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it had to come eventually.

358
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:34,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious to see what the sales are going to be on the Wii in the next few months because they have met the demand and because of that I've had a lot less people buying them.

359
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:38,682
[SPEAKER_02]: When it meets the demand it's usually a time when the colors come.

360
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a matter of time.

361
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:50,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't be surprised if the colors come during E3 because that's when they're going to announce stupid, superfluous shit like this.

362
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:51,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Comments from chat, comments from chat.

363
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:56,368
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw says, It's amazing that Sony still supports the PS2 given its enormous library.

364
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,369
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta give it to them.

365
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:08,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Unlike Microsoft or Nintendo that screw their fans by discontinuing their consoles, the fact that Sony still supports the PS2 shows that there are still a large contingent of people that still own their PS2s.

366
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:09,433
[SPEAKER_13]: All that from TigerClaw.

367
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:13,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Or because there's no backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 2 anymore on the PlayStation 3.

368
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's exactly what Brad from PodCulture says.

369
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:22,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, folks will pick one up, especially if your PS3 is not backwards compatible and your old, chunky PS2 is acting odd.

370
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:31,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I want to say for Misty, kind of a dissenting voice here, it annoys me because I just replaced my PS2 since the beginning of the year and now it dropped to $99.

371
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Slanted angry face.

372
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,395
[SPEAKER_12]: And Nintendo still will repair the old systems.

373
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,050
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura,

374
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:53,330
[SPEAKER_13]: PSP, Rock Band Unplugged

375
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,854
[SPEAKER_13]: This news came out March 31st, which in a certain time zone might have been April 1st.

376
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:28,297
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I can see this happening because... This is legit.

377
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:31,660
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very legit because a lot of these songs cross over into the actual Rock Band games.

378
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:32,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see this.

379
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,063
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a way for me to check.

380
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:47,332
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, Blink-182, What's My Age Again, Billy Idol, White Wedding, Boston, More Than a Feelin', Foo Fighters, Everlong, Modest Mouse, Float On, Jackson 5, ABC, The Police, Message in a Bottle, The Who, Pinball Wizard, etc.

381
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:03,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Now also, the box apparently also confirms that there will be download content.

382
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:04,539
[SPEAKER_13]: There's going to be a music store.

383
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, there will be no multiplayer at all in the game.

384
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:13,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They had also some screenshots from it on the back of the box as well.

385
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:21,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember seeing the screenshots elsewhere on the internet, and it definitely looks like it's going to be an amplitude frequency type of game.

386
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, hey, fine by me.

387
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:42,719
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just saying on Bobby's show earlier, Bobby Blackwolf, the guy who does the show before us here on All Games Radio on Sunday nights, was talking about the DS and DSi, and how Guitar Hero on Tour, one of the biggest selling third-party DS games, is kind of screwed by the DSi because the Game Boy Advance slot's now gone.

388
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:43,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

389
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:48,721
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was kind of, you know, we joked when we called on the show, like, well, who the fuck should be playing Guitar Hero on the DS anyway?

390
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,442
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if they're trying to, like, emulate the whole... It doesn't matter.

391
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:52,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Play the actual Guitar Hero.

392
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:54,143
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter anyways.

393
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new system on top of the DS.

394
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still selling four colors of the DS.

395
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still that many millions of DSs out there.

396
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:03,706
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to suffer one bit.

397
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:13,390
[SPEAKER_13]: But see, I give that a hard time, yet I allow Rock Band, this whole Rock Band on tour, because they're making a different game out of it that is really a throwback to something a lot of people have been salivating from.

398
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,591
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have any peripherals.

399
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:15,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That too.

400
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:21,654
[SPEAKER_02]: They could easily... I wouldn't be surprised if they port this to the PlayStation 2.

401
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:24,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the song store and stuff like that.

402
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:25,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

403
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:25,776
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

404
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:35,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, anyhow, we will continue to watch Rock Band Unplugged and let you know more on it as soon as we know, which I'm sure will be E3.

405
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:40,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure that game's going to be playable on the show floor, and I know that will be one of the first things I check out.

406
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:41,199
[SPEAKER_13]: What about you, DarkSakura?

407
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you interested in Rock Band Unplugged?

408
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not particularly.

409
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:45,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

410
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,681
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were a big amplitude frequency type fan.

411
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it, but I'm... There's other things you're more interested in.

412
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:53,222
[SPEAKER_07]: They make me motion sick.

413
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:54,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can see that.

414
00:29:55,856 --> 00:30:01,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is going to be a new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP and the PS2.

415
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:02,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

416
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:03,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

417
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is.

418
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:10,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to basically pick up from where the last game left off.

419
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:13,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you are in the last frontier.

420
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:14,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're...

421
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to help someone become a sage.

422
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:18,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Kira, I think is the name.

423
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:23,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's an adventure up in the mountains.

424
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Or in the air.

425
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Or with pirates of the sky.

426
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:32,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, this series obviously still has its fans.

427
00:30:32,335 --> 00:30:35,957
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this goes right in line with the whole PlayStation 2 price drop.

428
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:40,640
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting to see, wow, they are still making freaking games for the PlayStation 2.

429
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,601
[SPEAKER_13]: And this isn't like a...

430
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:44,987
[SPEAKER_13]: D-List title.

431
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,208
[SPEAKER_13]: This is at least the B-List.

432
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:54,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it actually is being developed by High Impact Games.

433
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're the ones that did Size Matters.

434
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:06,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like it's going to be fairly less depressing than the second one was.

435
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:07,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

436
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Any interest in Jak and Dexter for you?

437
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:13,144
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't been interested in that ever.

438
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,885
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more of a kids franchise, right?

439
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

440
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have listeners that are fans.

441
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:21,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily a kids franchise.

442
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really saying that.

443
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:24,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Ratchet and Clank.

444
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to get into Ratchet and Clank because I had never really been a fan of it on the PlayStation 2 with the PlayStation 3 version.

445
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:31,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Tools of Destruction.

446
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it for a little bit and then I ended up selling it to my friend because I just...

447
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:38,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Tales of Vesperia

448
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:08,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not really a big surprise since Tales of Vesperia came out on the 360.

449
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,476
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a similar thing with Eternal Sonata.

450
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:20,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, after the wait, not only do you get a game that is on par with the 360 version, but they've also added in new stuff.

451
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:28,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Including some new characters you'll get to play as that were kind of hinted in the Xbox 360 version.

452
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:31,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they are playable, which is kind of cool.

453
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: and on another game they also announced Tales of Versus which is going to be a PSP title and it's kind of like the Tales version of Dissidia which is neat.

454
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:46,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got all the Tales characters fighting each other.

455
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still part of the Tales series, yeah.

456
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,165
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit different, but they're putting out a lot of Tales games, that's for sure.

457
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:58,487
[SPEAKER_13]: It's selling like crazy in Japan, right?

458
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:01,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't the Xbox 360 get a huge boost from this period?

459
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that and Eternal Sonata, I think, did pretty good.

460
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

461
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really noticed the Tales franchise that much.

462
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really played any of them, so I kind of feel bad in that sense, but I don't want to play any of them.

463
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Tales for Fantasia on Game Boy Advance is actually pretty good.

464
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Like for an old school, like 16-bit.

465
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, Tales definitely has a very cult following to it.

466
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:29,724
[SPEAKER_13]: There's lots of fans of this series.

467
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not surprised this game is showing up on PlayStation 3.

468
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:40,453
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a little bit late to the party, but I think over in Japan it's going to mean more than it will here.

469
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:44,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in Japan, the PlayStation 3 has penetrated a bigger slice of the market.

470
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:46,979
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's going to be a bigger deal over there.

471
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say put it out this year if you can because come the end of this year and possibly next spring, Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out and no one's going to care about anything else as far as the RPGs go.

472
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether it's good or bad, I mean, just no one's going to care.

473
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:09,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, remember, we're only like a couple weeks away and I'll be getting my copy of the demo.

474
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, that's right.

475
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:13,065
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

476
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:41,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, you can send, apparently, files to your friends as big as three megabytes now.

477
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:47,870
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can sort friends in your friends list now alphabetically or by online status and last login time.

478
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is good, because it seemed like there was no rhyme or reason to the friends list sorting before, so that was a feature that was needed.

479
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, there's some other features.

480
00:34:56,412 --> 00:35:01,376
[SPEAKER_13]: a dynamic normalizer that will prevent sudden increases in volume between music tracks.

481
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,598
[SPEAKER_13]: For those games that don't know how to normalize their volume, that's pretty good.

482
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,000
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have a sound system, it'll do that as well.

483
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:14,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, the ability to cut and paste text, which I guess if you're a huge chatter in home might be useful or something.

484
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:20,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't think of a lot of chatty things I do on the PlayStation 3, but I guess cut and paste is needed.

485
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the dawn of the age of text spamming in...

486
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:24,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Out now!

487
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:26,059
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually upgraded earlier today before I went into home.

488
00:35:51,013 --> 00:36:13,020
[SPEAKER_07]: but unfortunately those really aren't a lot of features I use very often except the friends list that will probably be the biggest thing for me well there's a particular series that I hate hate hate hate hate hate I won't see any of it I hate this whole series of movies the concept of it is disgusting and just repugnant to me what movie series is that Rob?

489
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I would have to say Pokemon.

490
00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:18,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

491
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:21,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really hate Saw.

492
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:22,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Pokemon and Saw?

493
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

494
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you watch that if the Pokemon started in the next Saw movie?

495
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:29,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck no.

496
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Pikachu!

497
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:33,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Pikachu!

498
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:35,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway.

499
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:36,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

500
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:43,013
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying, Konami has the Saw license.

501
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:48,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They pried it out of the dead fingers of Brash Entertainment.

502
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:50,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God.

503
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then it might actually be a decent game.

504
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, they were actually drawing comparisons between that and Silent Hill.

505
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I thought was more funny.

506
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:03,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Funnier!

507
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:05,203
[SPEAKER_07]: There's my grammar today.

508
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:05,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

509
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:10,796
[SPEAKER_07]: The marketer David Daniels was telling what?

510
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:13,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I'm laughing at the chat room.

511
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, we got DJ Tyrant.

512
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:15,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Ash.

513
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to play a battle with you.

514
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:21,923
[SPEAKER_13]: And Gold Anthro says, gotta saw them all.

515
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear chat room, they make Ritalin for a reason.

516
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:30,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

517
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

518
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:36,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But the marketer David Daniels is quoted saying...

519
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:47,219
[SPEAKER_07]: that Silent Hill is more about psychological terror but Saw for Us is more about graphic intense horror that overwhelms you.

520
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,642
[SPEAKER_07]: We want players to turn away from the screen for just a moment because of the visual intensity.

521
00:37:52,832 --> 00:38:10,806
[SPEAKER_13]: or because the graphics really really suck in other words it's going to be blood pornography these games are going to be just they're already preparing us for the fact that these games are going to be blood pornography well it's supposed to be out in the fall it actually has Tobin Bell doing the voice of Jigsaw

522
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

523
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:33,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's going to be out on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, and guess who's not going to buy it?

524
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:34,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Me!

525
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:38,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to let it come into my house.

526
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't you worried this might have an impact on the Silent Hill series?

527
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:42,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope not.

528
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:43,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It better fucking not.

529
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I do like that he has the distinction.

530
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:46,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean it's going to get worse?

531
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that they've made the clear distinction.

532
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:51,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Silent Hill, psychological thriller.

533
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:56,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Because when I think psychological thriller, I think of great scary movies like The Silence of the Lambs.

534
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:59,485
[SPEAKER_13]: These types of classic psychological thrillers.

535
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: More in a suspense sense.

536
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but that's what Silent Hill is, right?

537
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:05,889
[SPEAKER_13]: More of like a suspense, mindfuck kind of movie, right?

538
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:09,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But it has the gross... It has the gore attached to it.

539
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It has... But it's not... The gore is not the focus.

540
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:13,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

541
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:17,413
[SPEAKER_07]: The gore is part of driving in the psychological part.

542
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:21,555
[SPEAKER_07]: This is... You are walking through a personal nightmare for your character.

543
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:21,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's...

544
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:24,416
[SPEAKER_07]: In essence, that is Silent Hill.

545
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You are walking through their nightmare.

546
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything in the game has some aspect of their personality or their guilt or something having to do with them that's going back to that person.

547
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires more thought than just splattering blood everywhere.

548
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,300
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know there are going to be people that are all about the blood orgy of Saw.

549
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,081
[SPEAKER_13]: It will sell.

550
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:42,861
[SPEAKER_13]: It will sell.

551
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:46,802
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll sell, but... Loki, you're a big blood fan.

552
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:49,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to be purchasing the blood orgy that is Saw?

553
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,243
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because it's not going to be any good.

554
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:58,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, even if they could promise... Now, what they should have called it is Blood Orgy of the Game, but, you know... I'd buy a game called Blood Orgy.

555
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,007
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but seriously, though... I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

556
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:07,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but, you know, not to knock Konami or anything, it's not going to be any good.

557
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's made by Konami.

558
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to knock them or anything, but it's... God damn, your game's going to suck.

559
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:14,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

560
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:15,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, though.

561
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,838
[SPEAKER_13]: To be fair, none of you have touched the game.

562
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:21,721
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're basing your review of the game off the movie, which isn't completely fair.

563
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:25,464
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm basing my review off of the screenshot that I saw, okay?

564
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:30,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the fact that Saw cannot be made into a game very well.

565
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:32,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Because how are you going to do that?

566
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, I'm sorry, Konami's not clever enough to figure that out.

567
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Point and click.

568
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:48,360
[SPEAKER_07]: How about I have read enough about Saw to know that I have zero interest in playing the game or seeing the movies or anything remotely related to it, and I don't even watch the damn trailers.

569
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, I don't watch TV, but still, I have zero interest in nothing but loathing for the franchise.

570
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:09,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I noticed the consensus amongst chat, and I'm not going to read a lot of the individual quotes from chat here, because it seems like there's a consensus that Saw 1, decent, the rest, blood orgy, stupid porn movies, blood porn.

571
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:14,620
[SPEAKER_13]: The Leo Shannon chat, I will read this comment, blood orgy and titties would be the best selling game ever.

572
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,321
[SPEAKER_13]: It just might, it just might.

573
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:22,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

574
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:42,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'll have to do that.

575
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:08,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft is telling me to give the first movie a try, but I'm going to go ahead and explain this right now.

576
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:18,617
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept of that kind of thing, about putting people in that position, disgusts me like you have no idea how much it disgusts me.

577
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:19,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

578
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:25,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so reprehensible of an idea that thinking about it makes me want to vomit.

579
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:27,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So no, I won't see it.

580
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:32,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see the first Saw movie, and it's one of those things where it's like, it's not that great.

581
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,944
[SPEAKER_13]: You can live your life and not see it.

582
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:37,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, there's a hundred other movies I would say a person has to see before they see Saw.

583
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:39,837
[SPEAKER_07]: C-Saw

584
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:11,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue the series without a new bad person and they've kind of done, they've made it as confusing as possible unless you've watched like the other movies and you're just like, oh, that's that dude from that other movie and wait, what?

585
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,783
[SPEAKER_13]: But next Silent Hill game, I am so there.

586
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:15,945
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought Homecoming.

587
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:16,446
[SPEAKER_13]: It was fun.

588
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:17,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Good game.

589
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to actually go back and beat it.

590
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:19,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

591
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it going to be?

592
00:43:38,664 --> 00:43:40,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like an adventure game?

593
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:41,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't make any sense.

594
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:47,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I would bet money this Saw game is going to sell even though we all hate it because there's an audience out there for it.

595
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,750
[SPEAKER_13]: There really is.

596
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:51,192
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be a Saw 2 video game.

597
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably come out in October and it's going to be coming out at the same time as a bunch of other bigger games and I'm sorry.

598
00:43:58,257 --> 00:44:07,203
[SPEAKER_02]: When this comes out there will be people that pick it up because it's Saw but think of the last really good movie title that's come out on consoles.

599
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:11,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, because most of them aren't that good.

600
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:17,626
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

601
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:46,453
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just going to give ammunition to those people that say that video games are poisoning the minds of people everywhere.

602
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:52,661
[SPEAKER_13]: And those people that say Manhunt 2 is corrupting America and Grand Theft Auto is poisoning our children, etc.

603
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:59,308
[SPEAKER_13]: These saw games, especially if people's predictions that you are going to be the puppet in these games is correct...

604
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,991
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're the little puppet creature, that'd be awesome.

605
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:03,612
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

606
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:14,359
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a bad feeling that this game is going to be one of those things that certain lawyers, who I wish would stay out of the goddamn news, are going to use to propel their case into the next decade.

607
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be more offended by the movies because the movies are actually graphic and stuff, whereas this game, I don't think enough people are going to buy it to even care that it's violent.

608
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:27,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go ahead and say, by the way, it is not the gore that bothers me.

609
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the concept of what the people in the movie... Torture porn.

610
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:32,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Torture porn bothers you.

611
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:32,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, that's it.

612
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:38,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not... I can't stand torture of people who really haven't done anything wrong.

613
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:39,370
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

614
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

615
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:42,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so done with Saw.

616
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,632
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people have done stuff that's wrong.

617
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,893
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point of why they're being tortured.

618
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:48,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean.

619
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:48,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

620
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, something that's not wrong in any way whatsoever would be Saints Row 2.

621
00:45:54,495 --> 00:46:01,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's brand new download content coming out for it on April 16th, which makes me pretty excited because now I have a new reason to play that game again.

622
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:12,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The new download content will be called Ultor Exposed, which makes sense because there's areas of the map that you can't conquer yet, and they're all owned by Ultor.

623
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It will give you a few new things, including a co-op metagame.

624
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:21,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to use porn star Tara Patrick as one of your homies.

625
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:30,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and new vehicles, new weapons, and some new multiplayer maps are also coming out along with that.

626
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:37,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

627
00:46:38,605 --> 00:46:41,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to checking that out.

628
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:48,338
[SPEAKER_13]: All righty, let's move on to some release dates and let's travel the world and check out what's coming out in some other countries this week.

629
00:46:48,398 --> 00:46:53,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm looking over at Japan and in the next-gen systems, there's really not a whole lot.

630
00:46:53,721 --> 00:47:00,984
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a price reduction on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 on PlayStation 3, but not a lot of new stuff.

631
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:05,445
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm wondering if that's because you got the whole Advent Children coming out next week over in Japan.

632
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:05,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

633
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:11,547
[SPEAKER_13]: On the Nintendo Wii, you do have Oboro Muramasa comes out this week.

634
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:15,208
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not sure what this game really is, but it does look kind of stylized.

635
00:47:15,228 --> 00:47:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It is awesome.

636
00:47:15,729 --> 00:47:18,309
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is by the developers of Odin Sphere.

637
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all hand-drawn.

638
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very stylized.

639
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:23,591
[SPEAKER_13]: This looks kind of neat, actually.

640
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:25,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a side-scroll action game.

641
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:27,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out in June here in the U.S.

642
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be called here Muramasa the Demon Blade.

643
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:31,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

644
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Arcana Heart 2

645
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,932
[SPEAKER_13]: A party-stylized concept game on the DS?

646
00:48:20,972 --> 00:48:21,052
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

647
00:48:40,738 --> 00:49:06,094
[SPEAKER_13]: and then lastly in Japan looking at the Sony Playstation Portable I don't believe I see a whole lot on the PSP where is my list here we do have another Evangelion game it's a Neon Genesis Evangelion called Setsu no Girlfriend Tokubetsu Hen Portable so you know what that means dating Evangelion Sim on the PSP again enjoy that

648
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:14,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes is a big title coming out on the PSP I think that one is something you get a little more excited about

649
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:18,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, looks like this game's got some pretty sweet graphics too.

650
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:20,599
[SPEAKER_13]: It's another Dynasty Warriors game?

651
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks kind of, a little bit.

652
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's like zero English in this game whatsoever.

653
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably Shingoku Basara.

654
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:30,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, oh, I can't.

655
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:31,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle Heroes.

656
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:35,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking what it's called over here.

657
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:36,724
[SPEAKER_02]: They've only released one game.

658
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have that for the Wii, and I haven't actually played it yet.

659
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:39,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

660
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:42,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky wants a guy version game that's Arcana Hearts style.

661
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, that's most other fighting games.

662
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:10,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Leo Shen says, Arcana Heart 2, get it, they have a freaking loli fighter modeled after Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz.

663
00:50:11,482 --> 00:50:14,245
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no place like home, there's no place like home, punch!

664
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Does she roundhouse kick people with her ruby slippers?

665
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:19,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess so, let's see.

666
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:21,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Devil Kings over here, that's what it was.

667
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:22,193
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

668
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:23,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Devil something.

669
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:26,198
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

670
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to ask.

671
00:50:56,335 --> 00:50:57,800
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 10th, we have The Godfather 2.

672
00:50:59,043 --> 00:50:59,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

673
00:51:01,443 --> 00:51:03,404
[SPEAKER_02]: DSi Systems Rhythm Heaven Gravity

674
00:51:27,935 --> 00:51:35,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Air Conflicts, Aces of World War 2 coming to the PSP because I don't think the PSP's had a World War 2 flight sim game yet.

675
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:36,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

676
00:51:36,957 --> 00:51:38,378
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chronicles of Riddick, Dark Athena.

677
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:39,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about time they got one.

678
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:41,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about time.

679
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:44,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Every system needs their World War 2 flight sim fighting game.

680
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, definitely.

681
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:52,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Chronicles of Riddick, Assault on Dark Athena coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 this week.

682
00:51:53,683 --> 00:52:02,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah Montana the movie, the game everyone's been waiting for, coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

683
00:52:03,646 --> 00:52:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

684
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:04,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, awesome.

685
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:12,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're not interested in Hannah Montana, you might be interested in Godfather 2, coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

686
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:19,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Those two, you'd be surprised how the fans... And if you're interested in both of those games, I think something might be wrong.

687
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I think most people would be interested in one or the other.

688
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:32,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really see somebody saying, yeah, GameStop employee, I'm here to pick up my copy of Godfather 2 and Miley Cyrus.

689
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:33,444
[SPEAKER_13]: It's for my daughter.

690
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:36,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Miley Cyrus is going to get an offer that she can't refuse.

691
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:41,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Miley Cyrus stars in the Godfather 4.

692
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:43,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody knows this.

693
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Her and Sofia Coppola.

694
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:49,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the Godfather becomes hip and sassy.

695
00:52:53,277 --> 00:52:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

696
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Some actual serious... Where RuPaul is the godfather.

697
00:52:58,163 --> 00:52:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

698
00:53:00,186 --> 00:53:00,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make you offer.

699
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,669
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't refuse, okay?

700
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, you better work.

701
00:53:05,757 --> 00:53:13,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on PlayStation 2 and PSP this week, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus coming out if you're looking for a good 2D fighting game.

702
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:16,662
[SPEAKER_02]: On PC, DCS, Black Shark.

703
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like some flight sim game.

704
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:24,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer Drive is getting a re-release from Zoo Games.

705
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:27,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game where you drive your jeep and kill deer.

706
00:53:28,547 --> 00:53:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

707
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:49,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and this is awesome.

708
00:53:49,662 --> 00:54:03,851
[SPEAKER_02]: On PC, apparently if you like crappy games or you're a girl, OMG High School Triple Play Pack featuring, I believe it's like the Cheetah Girls, Mean Girls, and... Oh, I'm sorry.

709
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:06,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean Girls, Clueless, and Pretty in Pink.

710
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:08,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they had games for those.

711
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all of those movies.

712
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:12,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I think something's wrong with me.

713
00:54:13,256 --> 00:54:14,597
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something wrong with you.

714
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor coming out on PC.

715
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Elven Legacy on PC as well.

716
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of cool, an Atlus PSP game, Hammer and Hero coming out.

717
00:54:31,153 --> 00:54:34,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And another crappy Wii game, Escape the Museum.

718
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:38,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, you get a twofer here.

719
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:44,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do you get a crappy movie this week, but a crappy game based on said crappy movie that's based off of

720
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:56,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Ball Evolution The Game, The Movie, The Myth, The Failure Don't you think they need to make a video game out of that?

721
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:14,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, point and click.

722
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:20,433
[SPEAKER_12]: You dress the guys, you get them into their tucking panties.

723
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:23,376
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a Wii game, because it would be a party game.

724
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,798
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be heel clubbing.

725
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And you gotta do the dance, but it would be like Spice Girls the game, too.

726
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:32,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I am all over this game.

727
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:34,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's put another girl through our paces.

728
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:36,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

729
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:37,223
[SPEAKER_13]: RuPaul's Drag Races.

730
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:39,084
[SPEAKER_13]: I like SSJ100 Matt.

731
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:40,225
[SPEAKER_13]: RuPaul GPS.

732
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:41,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Work.

733
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:42,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn to the left.

734
00:55:42,346 --> 00:55:42,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Work.

735
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn to the right.

736
00:55:44,147 --> 00:55:47,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Any game where you replace the main character with RuPaul would be hilarious.

737
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I love RuPaul.

738
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,731
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn.

739
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:49,991
[SPEAKER_12]: RuPaul.

740
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:50,912
[SPEAKER_12]: RuPaul means her own game.

741
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I love RuPaul, but I think that'd be great.

742
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:54,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I think RuPaul would think that'd be funny.

743
00:55:56,348 --> 00:55:58,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, is there a game developer out there listening?

744
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:00,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, call them and make this happen.

745
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,812
[SPEAKER_13]: There is an audience for that game.

746
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:03,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Super Mario Bros.

747
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:08,416
[SPEAKER_12]: 3, RuPaul edition, but instead of the raccoon suit, it's the sparkly suit.

748
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:17,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, if you want to put in a little bit of money into this game, you're not going to sell a million, you're probably not even going to sell 100,000, but you'll sell like 25,000.

749
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:22,765
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I still think there should have been a gay X-Men where RuPaul was Storm.

750
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:23,346
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

751
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:34,588
[SPEAKER_13]: that would be a great game here's something RuPaul should be in Oni Chambara

752
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,281
[SPEAKER_13]: No, seriously, I'm trying to tie this into the next story.

753
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you know there was actually a movie based off of Chambara?

754
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:42,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did.

755
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,885
[SPEAKER_13]: It's out here as well.

756
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:45,306
[SPEAKER_13]: It's localized here in the U.S.

757
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:47,068
[SPEAKER_13]: called Chambara Beauty, apparently.

758
00:56:47,128 --> 00:56:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I got it.

759
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't got a chance to watch it yet.

760
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you better hurry.

761
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:51,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I will.

762
00:56:51,811 --> 00:56:52,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what?

763
00:56:52,872 --> 00:57:05,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, even though this movie got negative reviews across the board, who would have thought, for some reason, bikini-clad women slaying zombies with swords apparently had an audience for it.

764
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:06,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Chambara Beauty Vortex

765
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:37,408
[SPEAKER_13]: and I guess there is a game called Vortex as well that's going to be coming out as well.

766
00:57:37,448 --> 00:57:45,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazingly enough though, for a Wii game, blood splattering on the screen, you get too much blood on your sword and it sticks into the zombies.

767
00:57:45,814 --> 00:57:49,016
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like a terrible blood fest, but it was a blood fest.

768
00:57:49,237 --> 00:57:55,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Now something you should know, the star of the first film, Starlet Eri Otogoro, is not coming back for the second movie.

769
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:58,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So you know it's going to be a winner.

770
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:02,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a live action Japanese movie.

771
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you're saying?

772
00:58:21,016 --> 00:58:21,696
[SPEAKER_13]: No RuPaul game.

773
00:58:21,937 --> 00:58:22,457
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

774
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:24,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Such injustice in this world.

775
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:25,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Such injustice.

776
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:30,081
[SPEAKER_13]: You would like Sky... I think I need to start one of those petition online things.

777
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:31,521
[SPEAKER_13]: You know those things that don't mean anything?

778
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:35,083
[SPEAKER_13]: But we need to start collecting signatures for a RuPaul video game.

779
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:38,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll email fucking RuPaul somehow.

780
00:58:38,945 --> 00:58:40,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to live action really quick.

781
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:44,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Akoge is a live action Japanese film about fag hags.

782
00:58:44,548 --> 00:58:44,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Check it out.

783
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:46,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Akoge.

784
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:47,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

785
00:58:48,031 --> 00:58:51,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yeah, because I dated a Japanese guy for a little bit and he showed it to me.

786
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:52,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

787
00:58:52,273 --> 00:58:52,814
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome.

788
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:53,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

789
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:56,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Because basically this chick likes to watch guys make out in the park.

790
00:58:57,297 --> 00:59:00,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Gee, you know... I have no problem with that.

791
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:03,721
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of straight guys like to watch girls make out in the park.

792
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:03,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

793
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, hello, Cruel Intentions.

794
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:05,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

795
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:07,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

796
00:59:08,464 --> 00:59:10,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Some girls like to watch girls make out in the park.

797
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:13,687
[SPEAKER_07]: La, la, la, la.

798
00:59:13,807 --> 00:59:14,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Innocent, innocent.

799
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:16,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway...

800
00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:19,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Different stuff.

801
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:20,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, how about different stuff?

802
00:59:22,787 --> 00:59:25,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a game that's called Beyond Good and Evil.

803
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's getting a sequel.

804
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:36,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's inspired by the Trade Center airplane bombing thing.

805
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:54,795
[SPEAKER_07]: and I refuse to refer to the event by the date because I think that's fucking retarded so you can just refer to it as Loki's 21st birthday okay it happened on Loki's 21st birthday so when Loki was getting what liquor or something eating steak at a steakhouse that was empty okay

806
00:59:56,548 --> 01:00:02,692
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, the game is supposed to be based off of that.

807
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:17,122
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that that day's events actually gave across the same type of element of fear that he was looking for in the game.

808
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:25,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he's going to incorporate that same emotional sense into the sequel.

809
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:32,369
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... He also, though, tried to compare it to Zelda.

810
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:35,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Saying that... Oh, come on.

811
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Saying that they're good games, but out of time.

812
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:45,051
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, um... Is that like Majora's Mask?

813
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:54,453
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it just means that there's people who like happy, and some people who like to play fucking depressing stuff.

814
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:00,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I had... Braid in a way was depressing to me.

815
01:01:01,535 --> 01:01:03,096
[SPEAKER_13]: There's definitely depressing games out there.

816
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,118
[SPEAKER_13]: All the Silent Hill games are pretty depressing too.

817
01:01:05,138 --> 01:01:06,198
[SPEAKER_07]: God, they're fantastic.

818
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually think that the UFO endings on Silent Hill are more depressing.

819
01:01:11,442 --> 01:01:16,125
[SPEAKER_13]: I have really yet to play that game that makes me want to eat an entire canister of ice cream though.

820
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:17,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting that depressed.

821
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:24,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Watching a Lifetime movie or Steel Magnolias or something.

822
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I have yet to really see the video game equivalent of that.

823
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:40,236
[SPEAKER_12]: The only problem I have with games like that that'll be about an actual horrifying event like that, or even the World War II games, is the people who, when they play those games, are like, because I'm showing respect to the event and I'm remembering it.

824
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:40,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Nah.

825
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:44,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, because you're sitting on your ass in your living room on a couch pressing buttons.

826
01:01:45,518 --> 01:01:48,359
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm like, that's the only – but it could be a good game.

827
01:01:48,379 --> 01:01:48,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

828
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:50,730
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

829
01:01:51,271 --> 01:02:01,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, and I'm just going to leave it here, and yes, it was incredibly awful, but making a big to-do about that is actually just perpetuating fear.

830
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,621
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need to go back to business as usual.

831
01:02:03,822 --> 01:02:07,745
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of seems like this person's reaching for buzzwords that are going to catch people's attention.

832
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:09,687
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the impression I get.

833
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:16,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand trying to evoke an emotion, and I understand that was a very particularly...

834
01:02:20,676 --> 01:02:25,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for lack of a better description, that was definitely a unique sort of feeling, you know?

835
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:32,361
[SPEAKER_07]: The combination of gutted and really numb, I would think.

836
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:42,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can understand someone trying to evoke an emotion that is that unique, but at the same time, don't drag that into it, just fucking drop it.

837
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:44,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Klonoa

838
01:03:05,242 --> 01:03:05,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

839
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:06,967
[SPEAKER_13]: I never played that to completion.

840
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:12,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all, the game as you start it off, it's all cutesy happy, cutesy happy, get towards the end of the game.

841
01:03:12,682 --> 01:03:13,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god!

842
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:17,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Wind Waker also said.

843
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:17,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

844
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really play enough of it.

845
01:03:19,371 --> 01:03:20,072
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I thought it was.

846
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:23,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, I've been playing this game for 15 years and then this is what happens to the kingdom?

847
01:03:23,714 --> 01:03:27,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I don't want to get a depressing show so let's go back to Lowell RuPaul for a minute here, okay?

848
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:34,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently we have a friend at Sony that listens to the show and they're going to email some people about the RuPaul game and making it happen.

849
01:03:34,802 --> 01:03:36,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So, God bless you.

850
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:39,104
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a public servant of the people.

851
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:40,886
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a brave man.

852
01:03:41,046 --> 01:03:42,867
[SPEAKER_13]: It better have the word fierce in the title.

853
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:43,187
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

854
01:03:45,468 --> 01:03:48,009
[SPEAKER_12]: God bless you, sir.

855
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:48,970
[SPEAKER_12]: God bless you.

856
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:49,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope it happens.

857
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:54,352
[SPEAKER_13]: If they need input of any sort, please give them my email.

858
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:56,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I want to point this out.

859
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:58,614
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100Matt made a good point.

860
01:03:58,694 --> 01:04:02,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, seriously, keep wishing because last time you did that, they made SingStar Abba.

861
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:04,816
[SPEAKER_13]: This is true.

862
01:04:04,836 --> 01:04:06,477
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they did SingStar RuPaul?

863
01:04:07,437 --> 01:04:08,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that would work as much.

864
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:14,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You could sing Back to My Root, which is actually... Okay, that song is a guilty pleasure for me.

865
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:17,723
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't think I'd want an entire SingStar game out of RuPaul.

866
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:20,905
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they could make a party game out of drag races.

867
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:22,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be totally great.

868
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:23,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they could.

869
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:24,427
[SPEAKER_13]: RuPaul's Fierce Drag Race.

870
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:25,468
[SPEAKER_13]: ZakuPilot256.

871
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:26,728
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the name right there.

872
01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to have fierce in the title.

873
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,010
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

874
01:04:31,091 --> 01:04:32,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Most fiercest.

875
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:34,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It just has to be fierce.

876
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:36,793
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is fierce!

877
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:37,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Just buy it.

878
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:38,554
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

879
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:41,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The title should just be This Game is Fierce.

880
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:44,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Lord Almighty, let's get past the RuPaul thing.

881
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,499
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry to our listeners.

882
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:46,900
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the one who took us back to RuPaul.

883
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it's my fault, but I neglected the chat.

884
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy!

885
01:04:50,222 --> 01:04:55,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I was laughing so hard I couldn't see the chat, so I just went back and caught up on it and wanted to mention that.

886
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:55,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

887
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:56,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so...

888
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rumor going around that Mortal Kombat, the team that's working at least on Mortal Kombat, is trying to leave Midway.

889
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:07,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of like rats escaping a sinking ship.

890
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:12,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're looking for new developers.

891
01:05:13,314 --> 01:05:13,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

892
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:16,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going to buy them up.

893
01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:17,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I could totally see that happening.

894
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:22,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be hilarious if Capcom bought them up.

895
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:23,819
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be cool.

896
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:34,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, that would be all kinds of strange, because you know there would be that inevitable Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat game, and that's just gonna really weird a lot of people out.

897
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:35,611
[SPEAKER_13]: That's gonna be creepy.

898
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:38,433
[SPEAKER_13]: That's gonna be like when Sonic and Mario started showing up in the same place.

899
01:05:38,453 --> 01:05:48,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling if they were ever gonna leave Midway, which I doubt that they will, but if they were, EA would probably buy them up, because EA likes to snatch up properties like that, and...

900
01:05:49,124 --> 01:05:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got enough money to throw around.

901
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:54,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that.

902
01:05:54,306 --> 01:05:57,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, EA needs a good fighting game franchise.

903
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:02,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that Marvel game that they put out sucked.

904
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't they do DC and Marvel?

905
01:06:06,471 --> 01:06:08,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Midway did.

906
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:08,592
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

907
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:09,992
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was Marvel vs. DC.

908
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:10,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind, I'm stupid.

909
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:12,033
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't.

910
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:15,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, yeah.

911
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:16,975
[SPEAKER_07]: EA did Marvel Ultimate Alliance, right?

912
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:18,808
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was Activision.

913
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:19,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Activision.

914
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:24,010
[SPEAKER_02]: No, EA did that, was it Rise of the Imperfects or something like that?

915
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer?

916
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't Silver Surfer.

917
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:28,191
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Silver Surfer was also Activision.

918
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did the Rise of the Imperfects game, which, so ironic that they had Imperfect in the title, but yes, it was not very good.

919
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:42,776
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

920
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:04,599
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I don't know.

921
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:05,700
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

922
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:14,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm going to pull up a video here in studio, and I apologize you guys can't see this on the radio, but what's interesting about this, this is an unreal... Whoa, hello.

923
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:20,776
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Unreal Tournament, but it's a Sonic the Hedgehog level using the Unreal Engine.

924
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:20,916
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

925
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,710
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize for the volume, good lord.

926
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:29,571
[SPEAKER_13]: See if I can turn that down, there we go.

927
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:31,612
[SPEAKER_13]: This is kind of interesting.

928
01:07:31,932 --> 01:07:33,252
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks a little bit like Smash Bros.

929
01:07:33,312 --> 01:07:33,712
[SPEAKER_13]: at most.

930
01:07:34,332 --> 01:07:36,233
[SPEAKER_13]: It does kind of look like Smash Bros.

931
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:37,073
[SPEAKER_13]: doesn't it?

932
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting level.

933
01:07:40,034 --> 01:07:41,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody spent a lot of time on that, that's for sure.

934
01:07:43,874 --> 01:07:45,195
[SPEAKER_02]: They did something similar with...

935
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:52,355
[SPEAKER_02]: with Legos and stuff before they had Lego maps and stuff, mods.

936
01:07:52,856 --> 01:07:59,998
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cool about stuff like this is, remember the PC mods do work on the PlayStation 3 versions, so you can actually get this for the PlayStation 3 as well.

937
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:03,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, enough of that background noise there from the game.

938
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:08,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Question for you though, which types of mods have you really been into for that?

939
01:08:09,901 --> 01:08:11,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not an Unreal Tournament player, so I can tell you.

940
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what about, you know how they did with Quake?

941
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: The Cube Mod

942
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:38,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the movie?

943
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like the movie.

944
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:40,494
[SPEAKER_13]: For Quake?

945
01:08:40,894 --> 01:08:41,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

946
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:41,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

947
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:43,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Quake's kind of old.

948
01:08:43,235 --> 01:08:45,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not for Quake, but for one of the later... Oh, okay.

949
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

950
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:53,881
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a cube mod, and someone tried to do a hypercube one where it would randomly regenerate the room.

951
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:55,936
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

952
01:09:20,183 --> 01:09:35,436
[SPEAKER_07]: My whole point between that is that I don't really want to see people put into situations where they are forced to kill slash maim themselves or each other to get out of the situation because of something someone else perceives they did or they might have done.

953
01:09:36,116 --> 01:09:46,925
[SPEAKER_07]: The cube, I think, is that you're putting the people together and they can either work together or they can kill each other and hypercube, they can just go crazy because time is freaking out.

954
01:09:47,626 --> 01:09:50,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally, I just want to, I support you on the, I cannot stand the Saw movies.

955
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:56,195
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, because I saw part of one of them, and the guy basically thinks he's helping them out by doing this, and I'm like, dude, no.

956
01:09:56,496 --> 01:10:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually just went on Wikipedia to read the premise again, and while I, and for me, I'm always the type of person that tries to get my brain into the character, and that's something that just gives me a headache thinking about it.

957
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I'm sorry.

958
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:12,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean to open a can of worms.

959
01:10:12,172 --> 01:10:13,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to mention that real quick.

960
01:10:13,353 --> 01:10:14,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I will also say another defense.

961
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:15,715
[SPEAKER_12]: How about those dolphins?

962
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:21,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say another defense about that versus Cube is that Cube, you don't technically have an antagonist.

963
01:10:22,782 --> 01:10:23,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically.

964
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:26,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the situation as your antagonist.

965
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:27,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's move on.

966
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:28,267
[SPEAKER_13]: More gaming news.

967
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:28,687
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

968
01:10:29,648 --> 01:10:30,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, gotta...

969
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:32,478
[SPEAKER_13]: What the DSI most needed in it to get me to buy one?

970
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:33,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Feature that the DSI needed the most to get me to buy one.

971
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:01,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

972
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:02,485
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be a good one.

973
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:03,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Very topical.

974
01:11:03,766 --> 01:11:04,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about it.

975
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:06,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it topical like an ointment?

976
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:07,507
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

977
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:08,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the chat room has some better ideas.

978
01:11:08,747 --> 01:11:10,528
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have an idea for tonight's list, let's send it over.

979
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I got your joke.

980
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:13,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it.

981
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:14,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't laugh.

982
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:16,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Love ya.

983
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess who I think is awesome?

984
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:20,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Me.

985
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:22,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Er.

986
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:25,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve Wiebe.

987
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,629
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

988
01:11:48,456 --> 01:12:07,288
[SPEAKER_07]: and it turns out Billy Mitchell's a cock and sent in a videotape instead of coming in and doing it himself of him topping over a million points on Donkey Kong so Steve Weeby's going to be at E3 and that is reason enough for me to go I want to witness this

989
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's what's interesting, though.

990
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:12,119
[SPEAKER_13]: They did the same thing at E4ALL.

991
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And to be fair to our, I guess you could say, you know, I don't know what to call it.

992
01:12:16,401 --> 01:12:18,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not really parent company because we own ourselves.

993
01:12:18,962 --> 01:12:26,084
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, the company that enables us to do this live for you all every Sunday night, All Games had a ginormous booth at E4ALL.

994
01:12:26,244 --> 01:12:29,285
[SPEAKER_13]: They had Steve Wiebe there trying to break the score for Donkey Kong.

995
01:12:29,325 --> 01:12:31,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of been there, done that.

996
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:34,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just interesting that now people seem to care about

997
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:37,809
[SPEAKER_13]: because it's E3 and not E4ALL, which, you know, I get.

998
01:12:38,389 --> 01:12:39,730
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going to have far more people.

999
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:43,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I also, nothing would have gotten me to go to E4ALL, I think.

1000
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:45,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

1001
01:12:45,913 --> 01:12:57,438
[SPEAKER_07]: E4ALL, to me, was just a ginormous waste of time and I could have slept or done my laundry or, you know, washed dirty dishes with my tongue.

1002
01:12:57,518 --> 01:13:00,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It just looked better on paper, I think.

1003
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It was one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper.

1004
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:31,049
[SPEAKER_07]: at any rate um and this is funny because even the guys at Twin Galaxies were just saying that it was completely awful of uh Billy Mitchell and he's just such a dick oh my god he's such a dick I don't like him anyway um the other cool thing though is that with the two of them I think that I don't exactly agree with how my source says it because there have been other people who have hit the Donkey Kong kill screen but I think that those two are the only ones who have done it in a live event

1005
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But the kill screen is basically after you pay so many levels of Donkey Kong, it'll just stop.

1006
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:39,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't work anymore.

1007
01:13:40,052 --> 01:13:41,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be game over.

1008
01:13:41,612 --> 01:13:45,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't care how many extra lives you have or what your score is or anything.

1009
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, dead.

1010
01:13:48,654 --> 01:13:49,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1011
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:52,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario will be running around, freeze.

1012
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't they show it in the movie?

1013
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they show it.

1014
01:13:55,856 --> 01:13:57,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've seen someone do it.

1015
01:14:00,296 --> 01:14:00,596
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

1016
01:14:01,636 --> 01:14:02,437
[SPEAKER_07]: A long time ago.

1017
01:14:03,057 --> 01:14:05,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to have been like 11.

1018
01:14:06,078 --> 01:14:06,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1019
01:14:06,898 --> 01:14:08,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently it was at a Godfather's Pizza.

1020
01:14:09,138 --> 01:14:11,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And citizens must be one of those people who just didn't care.

1021
01:14:12,419 --> 01:14:14,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we also had, I don't think I was that young.

1022
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I was a little older than that.

1023
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:22,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we had one of the Mario machines, the Nintendo arcade machines.

1024
01:14:22,102 --> 01:14:25,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet there are a lot of people out there that could do it and just don't want to get in the scene.

1025
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:26,606
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1026
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:27,847
[SPEAKER_13]: They do it for themselves.

1027
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:29,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask him if it broke.

1028
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,371
[SPEAKER_07]: If he broke the machine, he's like, yeah, I broke the machine.

1029
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:35,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all I remember until I saw the movie.

1030
01:14:37,036 --> 01:14:44,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I really, really would like to see him do it.

1031
01:14:44,222 --> 01:14:45,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would love to be there when it happens.

1032
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:49,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be fantastic.

1033
01:14:49,506 --> 01:14:58,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to see what Billy Mitchell does about it just because he's a dick and I'm kind of enjoying the drama a little bit even though it's kind of stupid.

1034
01:14:58,509 --> 01:15:01,170
[SPEAKER_12]: If he does, I will self-fornicate into my trousers.

1035
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we put it on the internet?

1036
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we broadcast that live on G4?

1037
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:07,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

1038
01:15:07,027 --> 01:15:09,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

1039
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:11,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Immediately following.

1040
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:12,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Immediately following.

1041
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:15,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve, we'll be breaking the record live on G4.

1042
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,450
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be live on G4.

1043
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,591
[SPEAKER_13]: The doctor self-hornicating into his pants.

1044
01:15:20,371 --> 01:15:20,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Trousers.

1045
01:15:21,112 --> 01:15:21,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1046
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:22,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Into his trousers.

1047
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:24,333
[SPEAKER_01]: He might not be wearing pants.

1048
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,334
[SPEAKER_01]: He might just be wearing the trousers.

1049
01:15:28,883 --> 01:15:32,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Ascetic Vampire in chat says, I'd go to see Billy's flowing hair.

1050
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:34,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think he's going to be there at E3.

1051
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,187
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, look, let's move on.

1052
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:37,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe he will.

1053
01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:37,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1054
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:39,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little over the drive.

1055
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:40,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a movie, people.

1056
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:41,930
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a movie.

1057
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,352
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 makes the best point.

1058
01:15:45,152 --> 01:15:47,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And immediately thereafter, Billy Mitchell posts his new record on YouTube.

1059
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:51,796
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, a couple more news stories and we're going to take a break.

1060
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:52,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1061
01:15:53,537 --> 01:15:54,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of funny.

1062
01:15:55,057 --> 01:15:55,197
[SPEAKER_02]: For...

1063
01:15:57,324 --> 01:16:06,747
[SPEAKER_02]: April Fool's Day, Bethesda decided that they're going to go ahead and kind of do a half price sale on all the download content for Oblivion, which is pretty cool.

1064
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:08,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Except there's a catch.

1065
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse Armor, they decided, you know what?

1066
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse Armor's awesome.

1067
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to double the price of that.

1068
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:15,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be funny.

1069
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:17,630
[SPEAKER_13]: To which I say, nay.

1070
01:16:18,811 --> 01:16:19,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I say nay.

1071
01:16:21,992 --> 01:16:23,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, he goes, hey.

1072
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:26,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I had to throw that in.

1073
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:31,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is their form of an April Fool's joke.

1074
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, not that it's a joke.

1075
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:33,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it actually happened.

1076
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:34,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it actually happened.

1077
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:36,877
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's like an April Fool's joke still.

1078
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:37,377
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1079
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:40,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it was what they did in celebration of April Fool's Day.

1080
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:44,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everyone realizes that, you know, including them, that horse armor is ridiculous.

1081
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:48,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think even Bethesda realized, okay, you got us.

1082
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:49,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Horse armor was pretty dumb.

1083
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,420
[SPEAKER_13]: But people still buy it.

1084
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Feature Net Guaranteed

1085
01:17:19,441 --> 01:17:20,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, look.

1086
01:17:20,521 --> 01:17:28,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week we brought you a story about a man who was suing Microsoft and Lionhead over reports that he was being harassed because he was gay.

1087
01:17:28,704 --> 01:17:29,624
[SPEAKER_13]: You might remember about this.

1088
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:35,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, we're not going to get to see the drama unfold in the courtroom because there has been a settlement.

1089
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:40,350
[SPEAKER_13]: The case has been settled out of court.

1090
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:44,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft has released a very brief statement, and guess what?

1091
01:17:44,754 --> 01:17:48,317
[SPEAKER_13]: This is all you're going to hear on it, because usually with these settlements come gag orders.

1092
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:53,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft says, We are pleased to have reached a makeable resolution to this matter with Mr. Durant.

1093
01:17:54,403 --> 01:18:01,029
[SPEAKER_13]: The terms of the settlement are confidential, but we can confirm that Mr. Durant will not continue his employment at Lionhead as part of the agreement.

1094
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:07,402
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably what he got for taking his case to the media, but hey, it sounds like everybody got what they wanted.

1095
01:18:07,802 --> 01:18:08,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't Bill Gates gay?

1096
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:11,225
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he has a wife, dummy!

1097
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:12,085
[SPEAKER_13]: He can still be gay.

1098
01:18:12,305 --> 01:18:14,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, get my stuff!

1099
01:18:14,407 --> 01:18:14,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shut.

1100
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:17,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so there you go.

1101
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Follow up to last week, to be fair.

1102
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:21,726
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to follow up on that.

1103
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:27,271
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll never know the real answer because of the settlement, but that's life.

1104
01:18:28,132 --> 01:18:31,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get into a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1105
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,877
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the Classic Video Game of the Week.

1106
01:18:34,983 --> 01:18:42,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And as part of this segment, DarkSakura will dig into her archive of classic gaming and find a title that she believes you all should be checking out.

1107
01:18:42,586 --> 01:18:43,727
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been doing this quite a while now.

1108
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:56,832
[SPEAKER_13]: We have like over a year's worth of games that they're tracking on the OLR Wikipedia, which you can get to at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and go to that little thing that says, the little box in the corner with all the pictures that has the big W in it.

1109
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:58,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how you get to the Wiki on Wikia.

1110
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:01,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the name of the box.

1111
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:01,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Extended Play.

1112
01:19:02,094 --> 01:19:02,454
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1113
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:03,595
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a brain fart.

1114
01:19:04,415 --> 01:19:07,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, what is the classic game of the week this week, DarkSakura?

1115
01:19:07,797 --> 01:19:10,399
[SPEAKER_07]: The classic game of the week is Incredible Crisis.

1116
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is crack.

1117
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:15,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And by crack, I mean crack.

1118
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:18,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to Incredible Crisis.

1119
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,546
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game that came out on the PlayStation.

1120
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:27,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Incredible Crisis with puppies.

1121
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:43,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the game is about playing in a day in these family members' lives, the main character being Taneo, and they're trying to get everyone home early today for Grandmother Haruko's birthday.

1122
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:49,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And this game very much is a parody of daily Japanese life.

1123
01:19:50,214 --> 01:19:52,975
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is incredibly what the fuck.

1124
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:54,035
[SPEAKER_13]: For real.

1125
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:54,716
[SPEAKER_13]: For real.

1126
01:19:54,816 --> 01:19:58,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I can't think of many more WTF games that have ever been made.

1127
01:19:58,157 --> 01:20:01,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, like, when you... Well, I'll let Jamie explain.

1128
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:02,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I'll give my comment.

1129
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:04,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the music in the game, if you'll listen to a little bit of it.

1130
01:20:10,301 --> 01:20:12,402
[SPEAKER_13]: They're dancing, by the way, in the office in this song.

1131
01:20:15,688 --> 01:20:20,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done by the Tokyo Sky Paradise Orchestra, so it's good music.

1132
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:23,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I love them.

1133
01:20:23,594 --> 01:20:30,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically the way that this goes is you have a bunch of mini-games where you're playing through people's lives, and it's sort of sequential.

1134
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:37,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Taneo, like, for example, this scene is him at work, and they are dancing to relieve stress.

1135
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:41,847
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you've got this head-meter, and just the...

1136
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The Redder and More Full That It Gets

1137
01:21:03,789 --> 01:21:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

1138
01:21:04,289 --> 01:21:04,589
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.

1139
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:04,709
[SPEAKER_07]: There.

1140
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:34,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1141
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,631
[SPEAKER_07]: She tells you how to position yourself for the major boink action.

1142
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:40,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, technically, the translation says he's giving an erotic back massage.

1143
01:21:40,373 --> 01:21:40,413
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1144
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:09,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, they're doing it on a Ferris wheel.

1145
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:10,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1146
01:22:10,607 --> 01:22:11,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's fireworks.

1147
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:14,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's a back massage because that's not how we roll.

1148
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:17,460
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Terrence says, I jizzed in my pantsu.

1149
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:34,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll see you play as Etsuko, who is the mother, and she's out trying to buy stuff for Haruko's birthday, and she has to go to the bank, and it's being robbed, and just all this crap is happening to this family.

1150
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:36,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

1151
01:22:38,097 --> 01:22:43,142
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and the last one is about the little boy, Tsuyoshi, and more weird stuff.

1152
01:22:43,162 --> 01:22:46,324
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like turned into an ant or something, or shrunk to ant size.

1153
01:22:46,865 --> 01:22:49,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, the game's just freaking bizarre.

1154
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:59,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much weird crap this family has to go through, all for the sake of getting home early to, you know, have a birthday party.

1155
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:04,277
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 24 minigames.

1156
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:06,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them do repeat.

1157
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:14,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And it only is a one-player game, but it can still count as a party because really it's better to pass it around.

1158
01:23:14,144 --> 01:23:14,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun.

1159
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:16,286
[SPEAKER_13]: This game looks amazing.

1160
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:17,387
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck was I thinking?

1161
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:20,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember renting this game years ago and not liking it.

1162
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:21,169
[SPEAKER_13]: FF7 and Puzzle Fighter

1163
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:44,769
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1164
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,366
[SPEAKER_07]: to actually translate the play of the game into it because of the way it involved the kanji.

1165
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:18,938
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of them involved the daughter in the family singing karaoke, which I think would have been fun.

1166
01:24:26,392 --> 01:24:30,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Deathwishing in chat says, Seriously man, I wanted to break a brick over my head after I played this.

1167
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:31,839
[SPEAKER_13]: It freaked me the fuck out.

1168
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:35,604
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like taking acid, smoking crackpot, and then spinning around in a wash cycle.

1169
01:24:36,084 --> 01:25:03,424
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually if you want to know I'll link this in the chat room but if you want to know a little bit about part of the problem that went into translating the game or just stuff that goes into translating and localizing games there's an article and it's from last April actually that's called The Art of Translating Video Games and I will link that in the chat room for people to see if they're interested in it

1170
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the game.

1171
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think it's crazy, crazy crack.

1172
01:25:26,598 --> 01:25:28,519
[SPEAKER_13]: This is exactly what the classic game of the week should be.

1173
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:33,083
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those games that you kind of forget about, but you need to go back and say, wow, that game was like fucking nuts.

1174
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:33,843
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1175
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:37,506
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1176
01:25:37,526 --> 01:25:38,346
[SPEAKER_13]: But stay tuned, guys.

1177
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,448
[SPEAKER_13]: We have plenty more to come here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1178
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:42,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight's part B. We're going to do a listless game.

1179
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:49,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see a lot of topics submitted in chat, although to be honest, I kind of missed a bunch of stuff when they were doing Incredible Crisis.

1180
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:50,075
[SPEAKER_13]: So what do you want to do?

1181
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:52,497
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to do the Excitebots thing or you want to do the DSi thing?

1182
01:25:52,517 --> 01:25:52,897
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

1183
01:25:53,718 --> 01:25:54,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I have zero preference.

1184
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:55,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Zero preference?

1185
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,059
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1186
01:25:57,079 --> 01:25:59,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to do What Kind of Flavor Does Jamie Want for Pie?

1187
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's going to work.

1188
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:06,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see how creative we can get making up a trick.

1189
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:08,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you want to do the Excitebots one?

1190
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:09,971
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I want to do the DSi one.

1191
01:26:09,991 --> 01:26:10,731
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to do the DSi one.

1192
01:26:10,751 --> 01:26:10,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1193
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:14,073
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the DSi one is a little more open and topical.

1194
01:26:14,093 --> 01:26:14,834
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll do the DSi.

1195
01:26:14,854 --> 01:26:16,895
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do the Sightbot when Sightbot comes out.

1196
01:26:17,316 --> 01:26:17,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1197
01:26:17,796 --> 01:26:21,419
[SPEAKER_13]: So DSi, feature we most want to – or wish – no.

1198
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:22,439
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we phrase this?

1199
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it yesterday or today.

1200
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:27,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1201
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:31,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it today because none of us bought it, right?

1202
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:31,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1203
01:26:32,006 --> 01:26:33,747
[SPEAKER_13]: But if it had this feature, I would have.

1204
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:34,768
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

1205
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:45,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we're going to answer that question and do plenty more here on Orange Lounge Radio such as talking about Blizzard Entertainment and a possible interesting franchise they could be doing as well as a Silent Hill game on the Wii.

1206
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:50,454
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to talk all about that when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1207
01:26:56,727 --> 01:27:00,388
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, April the 5th of 2009.

1208
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:06,790
[SPEAKER_13]: We're taping live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

1209
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:11,872
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night.

1210
01:27:12,652 --> 01:27:14,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Join us for live taping, why don't you?

1211
01:27:15,077 --> 01:27:15,798
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura is with us as well

1212
01:27:30,131 --> 01:27:30,551
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1213
01:27:46,229 --> 01:27:47,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1214
01:28:14,602 --> 01:28:14,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1215
01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:19,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why you need it to be supported.

1216
01:28:19,283 --> 01:28:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would think if people, you know, have Guitar and Metallica, most people probably already have World Tour.

1217
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:27,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't know.

1218
01:28:28,325 --> 01:28:30,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, support for stuff is always good.

1219
01:28:31,146 --> 01:28:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, plus the lips mark is sparkly, you know, and all that.

1220
01:28:34,127 --> 01:28:35,787
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, who doesn't like sparkles?

1221
01:28:37,057 --> 01:28:37,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Me.

1222
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:39,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, good point.

1223
01:28:40,019 --> 01:28:42,621
[SPEAKER_13]: The lips mics are also wireless, says Actdeft in chat.

1224
01:28:42,641 --> 01:28:42,881
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1225
01:28:43,021 --> 01:28:43,781
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty good.

1226
01:28:44,502 --> 01:28:46,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't there a third-party wireless mic, too, though?

1227
01:28:47,507 --> 01:28:48,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't know.

1228
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:50,891
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I've never played the Lips games.

1229
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:52,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kind of burned out on the karaoke games.

1230
01:28:52,612 --> 01:29:00,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Between the Rock Band, between SingStar, ABBA, and the other SingStar stuff that's available on PS3, I kind of didn't want to get Lips because I don't need another one.

1231
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:05,084
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, SingStar's, as far as karaoke games go, SingStar's rock solid enough, you know?

1232
01:29:05,204 --> 01:29:07,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Lips kind of was late to the party, if that makes sense.

1233
01:29:08,387 --> 01:29:08,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hmm.

1234
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:14,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, possibly late to the party, a revival of Redneck Rampage?

1235
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:23,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, here's one of those things I look at and I go, surely this is an April Fool's joke, but I... I don't know, I mean, I'm looking at the... Redneck Rampage is pretty freaking funny.

1236
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:25,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a game about my hometown?

1237
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:25,967
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's stupid.

1238
01:29:26,067 --> 01:29:28,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's like one of the stupidest video games I've ever seen.

1239
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:32,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I realize it's supposed to be a parody, but WTF, but okay, wait, I'm not done yet.

1240
01:29:32,692 --> 01:29:35,794
[SPEAKER_13]: But apparently this story broke on like the 4th of April or whatever, but here we go.

1241
01:29:37,155 --> 01:29:42,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Blizzard, apparently there's a rumor that Blizzard Entertainment actually has the Redneck Rampage brand right now.

1242
01:29:42,538 --> 01:29:45,820
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently this is some research done by a website called INC Gamers.

1243
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:48,983
[SPEAKER_13]: They were doing some trademark following or what have you.

1244
01:29:49,423 --> 01:29:54,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently Redneck Rampage was originally trademarked in 97, then Redneck Rampage rides again.

1245
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:57,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Redneck Rampage sucking grits on Route 66.

1246
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:01,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that was really the name of apparently the third game that was made.

1247
01:30:01,971 --> 01:30:04,713
[SPEAKER_13]: They're apparently all now under Blizzard's control.

1248
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:10,715
[SPEAKER_13]: So Blizzard apparently owns the rights to these games.

1249
01:30:10,876 --> 01:30:12,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that through acquisitions and things like that?

1250
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:13,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

1251
01:30:15,377 --> 01:30:18,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently Activision actually acquired the Redneck Rampage thing.

1252
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,439
[SPEAKER_13]: But why would it then be given to Blizzard and not Activision?

1253
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:22,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't know.

1254
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:27,581
[SPEAKER_13]: But apparently there are some Blizzard folks on staff who actually worked on the original Redneck Rampage.

1255
01:30:27,921 --> 01:30:29,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope to hell this doesn't mean they're making a new one.

1256
01:30:29,901 --> 01:30:31,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, talk about unnecessary.

1257
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:32,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Unnecessaries.

1258
01:30:34,384 --> 01:30:36,865
[SPEAKER_13]: X-Link in chat suggests redneck for the iPhone.

1259
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:38,887
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1260
01:30:39,027 --> 01:30:40,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I would rather it be something like that.

1261
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:43,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And DJ Tyrant said, Blizzard isn't this stupid, are they?

1262
01:30:43,769 --> 01:30:45,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully not.

1263
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:49,192
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Tyrant, maybe it's something that's a nod to those employees who were there that worked on the game.

1264
01:30:49,312 --> 01:30:49,913
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1265
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:55,035
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's just hope it's just an interesting observation and nothing more.

1266
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:58,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, DarkSakura, would you buy a new redneck rampage?

1267
01:30:59,576 --> 01:31:00,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Would I buy it?

1268
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:00,437
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1269
01:31:01,057 --> 01:31:01,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Would I buy it?

1270
01:31:01,818 --> 01:31:02,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1271
01:31:02,718 --> 01:31:03,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.

1272
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:05,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what I'd buy.

1273
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,200
[SPEAKER_13]: A new Hexic.

1274
01:31:06,741 --> 01:31:07,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Hexen.

1275
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:07,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Hexen!

1276
01:31:08,121 --> 01:31:09,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Those games were pretty awesome.

1277
01:31:09,102 --> 01:31:10,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah, I love Hexen.

1278
01:31:11,103 --> 01:31:11,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1279
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was awesome, though.

1280
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:15,706
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Redneck Rampage?

1281
01:31:15,786 --> 01:31:16,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1282
01:31:17,047 --> 01:31:21,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It was using the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D, but it had more features for it.

1283
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:23,171
[SPEAKER_00]: How about they just bring us Duke Nukem forever?

1284
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:26,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't Hexen use the same engine as Quake, right?

1285
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:27,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1286
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:28,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and it was awesome.

1287
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:33,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like turning people into chickens.

1288
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:40,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as we covered on our last show, we're supposed to be getting...

1289
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:49,743
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually supposed to be getting those arcade games coming out for the Wii service.

1290
01:31:50,403 --> 01:32:00,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Sega is also taking a step to put actual arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade a lot more than what we've been seeing lately.

1291
01:32:01,407 --> 01:32:08,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting, and this makes my heart soar, Virtualon or Tario Tangram.

1292
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to bake out my Dreamcast to play it, except...

1293
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:18,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I have twin sticks, so it's better to play it on the Dreamcast, but I digress.

1294
01:32:18,855 --> 01:32:27,764
[SPEAKER_07]: There's release ratings for Shinobi and Altered Beast, so that means System 16 will be getting some of those.

1295
01:32:28,245 --> 01:32:28,685
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1296
01:32:29,887 --> 01:32:44,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there is one that's rumored as a Sega Vintage Collection Volume 2, and there's also other Genesis titles listed as Comic Zone, Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.

1297
01:32:44,962 --> 01:32:49,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Gunstar Heroes, of course, being one of the best Sega games ever.

1298
01:32:49,895 --> 01:32:51,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Comic Zone was already on the virtual console, though.

1299
01:32:52,536 --> 01:32:53,096
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is the arcade.

1300
01:32:53,116 --> 01:32:53,876
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the virtual console.

1301
01:32:53,896 --> 01:32:54,676
[SPEAKER_07]: This is live arcade.

1302
01:32:54,896 --> 01:32:56,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but I thought you said for the Wii.

1303
01:32:56,897 --> 01:33:01,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I started off with the Wii because we had talked about Sega arcade games coming out on Wii.

1304
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:01,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

1305
01:33:02,898 --> 01:33:03,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1306
01:33:03,498 --> 01:33:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: To recap, last week on Orange Downs Radio, Rob ate a live frog.

1307
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:11,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki's head exploded.

1308
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaving Jamie as the victor in Battle Royale Orange Downs Edition.

1309
01:33:16,921 --> 01:33:17,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um...

1310
01:33:19,281 --> 01:33:20,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan got to meet him At E3 One year

1311
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I got my hug on with, um, uh, not Koji Kondo, the other, Igarashi.

1312
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:54,752
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1313
01:34:14,412 --> 01:34:39,447
[SPEAKER_13]: but I think a good game you have to have a passion for video games and you have to have your obvious favors and things like that so I I completely justify my you know screaming like a little 12 year old girl when I saw Akira Yamaoka okay so there you go that he's also it doesn't hurt that he's really good looking oh Black Wolf and DJ Tyrant both in chat said I met Rob Roberts at E3 yeah no we said celebrities

1314
01:34:40,501 --> 01:35:06,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Internet Celebrities Black Wolf said I totally squeed with fanboy delight when I met Rob Roberts He did actually I have yet to meet Rob Roberts Just so you guys know Oh my god, oh my god I totally blushed with embarrassment after running into Hideo Kojima Like three E3s in a row I don't know how this happens If it happens again this year I'm gonna just go off and cry Or tell him to give me a job

1315
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:10,473
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's move on with more gaming news.

1316
01:35:10,493 --> 01:35:13,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's stop talking about E3 and who we may or may not see at E3 this year.

1317
01:35:16,695 --> 01:35:19,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of weird, I guess.

1318
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:24,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week we talked about how Filefront was going away and, you know, oh darn.

1319
01:35:25,418 --> 01:35:27,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently it's back.

1320
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says Filefront has been acquired by the original founders of the site and will not be suspended as previously announced.

1321
01:35:36,101 --> 01:35:37,502
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not an April Fool's joke.

1322
01:35:39,498 --> 01:35:41,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's funny.

1323
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,382
[SPEAKER_13]: So what once was dead is now back.

1324
01:35:46,443 --> 01:35:50,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, congratulations to the folks at Filefront for inserting a coin to continue.

1325
01:35:50,826 --> 01:35:51,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

1326
01:35:52,948 --> 01:35:54,109
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all it took, right?

1327
01:35:54,289 --> 01:35:56,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And in other news, EGM is coming back.

1328
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:57,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, no, that's not true.

1329
01:35:58,312 --> 01:35:59,132
[SPEAKER_13]: April fools.

1330
01:36:00,013 --> 01:36:00,293
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1331
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:04,353
[SPEAKER_13]: That would have been a great EGM yearly joke, right?

1332
01:36:04,373 --> 01:36:06,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year.

1333
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:11,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, Ermac in Mortal Kombat was born of an EGM April Fool's joke.

1334
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,880
[SPEAKER_13]: That could have been their epic joke this year, that they're coming back.

1335
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,482
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, oh, April Fool's.

1336
01:36:15,602 --> 01:36:16,202
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a joke.

1337
01:36:16,823 --> 01:36:17,983
[SPEAKER_13]: That would have been too soon.

1338
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:19,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Insulting for their fan base, yes.

1339
01:36:20,385 --> 01:36:20,626
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1340
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:23,741
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1341
01:36:39,617 --> 01:36:44,441
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a remake, sort of, of the first game, but they don't want you to call it a remake of the first game.

1342
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:46,542
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a reimagining of the first game.

1343
01:36:46,863 --> 01:36:50,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, you know, means Boohoo, no Pyramid Head, but at the same time... The first game didn't have Pyramid Head.

1344
01:36:50,966 --> 01:36:52,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, Boohoo, no Pyramid Head.

1345
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:55,529
[SPEAKER_13]: But the first game was pretty fucking phenomenal.

1346
01:36:55,549 --> 01:36:58,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of people still say it was probably the best game in the series.

1347
01:36:58,391 --> 01:37:03,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, definitely going to be a must-have for Silent Hill fans.

1348
01:37:03,856 --> 01:37:07,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And a quote from the magazine where this originally appeared, Nintendo Power...

1349
01:37:08,379 --> 01:37:31,077
[SPEAKER_13]: The characters play different roles Things don't necessarily happen in the same order And the story is taken in lots of new directions You still play as Harry Mason You're still looking for your daughter And you'll see familiar elements But they're all twisted to betray your expectations So this is kind of cool Because it sounds like maybe it's going to be fucking with what people are expecting in the game Because they think it's going to be a remake That's going to be kind of cool So um

1350
01:37:32,873 --> 01:37:36,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently though, yes, they are going to exploit the Wii thing a little bit.

1351
01:37:36,635 --> 01:37:39,136
[SPEAKER_13]: They are going to use some of the Wii remote action.

1352
01:37:39,637 --> 01:37:41,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the in-game puzzles will use Waggle in it.

1353
01:37:42,118 --> 01:37:54,945
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I heard, maybe I'm not supposed to repeat this, but I heard a long time ago rumors that there were some tests being done in Konami of a Silent Hill type game where you would use the Wii mode as the flashlight as you were moving around.

1354
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:56,325
[SPEAKER_13]: And doesn't that sound scary?

1355
01:37:56,405 --> 01:37:59,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that concept made it into this game somehow.

1356
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:01,028
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that could be super creepy.

1357
01:38:01,348 --> 01:38:01,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

1358
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:02,589
[SPEAKER_13]: And pretty cool.

1359
01:38:02,849 --> 01:38:03,830
[SPEAKER_13]: If executed correctly.

1360
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it could also be kind of dumb.

1361
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:09,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank God, because they should have been doing this kind of stuff on the Wii since the beginning.

1362
01:38:09,435 --> 01:38:10,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they start doing that, great.

1363
01:38:11,596 --> 01:38:20,183
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, also, fans, you should know, part of the thing that bugged about the first Silent Hill game, that locked doors were everywhere.

1364
01:38:20,724 --> 01:38:23,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there will be a way through every locked door.

1365
01:38:24,126 --> 01:38:27,629
[SPEAKER_13]: You will no longer have to find that most of the doors in the game are permanently shut.

1366
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:30,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like it's going to be pretty awesome.

1367
01:38:31,383 --> 01:38:34,765
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm definitely looking forward to this.

1368
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:35,985
[SPEAKER_13]: More information, at least.

1369
01:38:36,005 --> 01:38:38,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet this is going to be one of the big things we're going to see at E3.

1370
01:38:38,667 --> 01:38:42,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, Konami's having an event, if I remember right, this next week.

1371
01:38:42,169 --> 01:38:46,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we weren't invited, but they're doing the Saw thing, and I know they're showing that.

1372
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:51,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up as well, along with your mandatory DDR and Yu-Gi-Oh for the year.

1373
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:51,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we'll see.

1374
01:38:52,934 --> 01:38:54,275
[SPEAKER_13]: And, oh yeah, don't forget Winning Eleven.

1375
01:38:54,635 --> 01:38:56,896
[SPEAKER_13]: All those games, you've got to get your mandatory entries for the year in there.

1376
01:38:57,276 --> 01:38:58,717
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we'll see.

1377
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:00,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you excited about the Silent Hill remake?

1378
01:39:03,997 --> 01:39:04,957
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a clever one.

1379
01:39:06,959 --> 01:39:08,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Robbie me go he.

1380
01:39:10,182 --> 01:39:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: For a game on the Wii.

1381
01:39:13,305 --> 01:39:13,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good.

1382
01:39:13,726 --> 01:39:16,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hope there's more Wii going Wii games later on.

1383
01:39:17,009 --> 01:39:19,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think you might have one in this next story, DarkSakura?

1384
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:22,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Project Ringo

1385
01:39:37,757 --> 01:39:39,238
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been talk going around about it.

1386
01:39:39,278 --> 01:39:49,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It turns out that Project Ringo is a new Puyo Puyo game that's going to be on DS, Wii, and PSP.

1387
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, we get it as Puyo Pop.

1388
01:39:53,890 --> 01:40:00,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be, technically, it's just Puyo Puyo 7, which is more Puyo Puyo.

1389
01:40:01,756 --> 01:40:14,266
[SPEAKER_07]: But you also will have a transformation mode which will let you actually deflect attacks instead of, I guess, just preventing them from happening and have larger chain combos.

1390
01:40:15,246 --> 01:40:16,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be pretty cool.

1391
01:40:16,587 --> 01:40:19,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But there should be some...

1392
01:40:21,607 --> 01:40:24,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a big enough fan to pronounce it correctly.

1393
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:51,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1394
01:40:52,361 --> 01:40:52,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1395
01:40:53,582 --> 01:41:05,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um... I don't know, we kind of talked a little bit in Part A about the new... Well, not really a new game, but Tales of Vesperia coming to the PS3.

1396
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:09,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is a new Tales game coming to the Wii as well.

1397
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Tales of Graces.

1398
01:41:13,016 --> 01:41:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been announced for the Wii, thanks to Fumitsu Magazine.

1399
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:18,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...

1400
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1401
01:41:38,429 --> 01:41:40,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just waggle, waggle, waggle?

1402
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1403
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:43,231
[SPEAKER_02]: The last Tales game that they put out was okay on the Wii.

1404
01:41:43,491 --> 01:41:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is supposed to be coming out in Japan in the winter.

1405
01:41:47,913 --> 01:41:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we'll see more about this later on.

1406
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:55,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, some rumors are going around about upcoming Wii titles.

1407
01:41:55,160 --> 01:42:04,003
[SPEAKER_13]: There's apparently a list that was leaked to the internet this week showing an upcoming release date list of some various games coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

1408
01:42:04,063 --> 01:42:05,004
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's the interesting thing.

1409
01:42:05,344 --> 01:42:10,506
[SPEAKER_13]: It dates Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort on July 10th.

1410
01:42:10,906 --> 01:42:15,768
[SPEAKER_13]: It also dates, here's the other interesting thing, Wii Fit Plus on November 19th.

1411
01:42:16,668 --> 01:42:20,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo, repackaging something and slapping Plus in front of it?

1412
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:21,591
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you don't say.

1413
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:24,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now, here's something you should take, though, from this.

1414
01:42:24,253 --> 01:42:25,933
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, yes, chatters, I am aware.

1415
01:42:26,294 --> 01:42:28,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, this list came out of the Netherlands.

1416
01:42:29,075 --> 01:42:30,536
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't actually from the U.S.

1417
01:42:31,156 --> 01:42:33,378
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

1418
01:42:33,418 --> 01:42:36,099
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think most of us are looking at this going, Wii Fit Plus?

1419
01:42:36,379 --> 01:42:37,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can see that.

1420
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:37,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1421
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see that happening.

1422
01:42:39,181 --> 01:42:40,782
[SPEAKER_13]: That's innovation for you.

1423
01:42:40,962 --> 01:42:41,983
[SPEAKER_12]: That's innovation for you.

1424
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:46,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but why, you know, why the, uh, Nintendo should be leaking their release dates?

1425
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:49,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what this secrecism is, it's like, my god, like, we're not gonna tell you.

1426
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,331
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, good god.

1427
01:42:52,092 --> 01:42:55,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody might steal the idea to repackage something and add plus to it.

1428
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:58,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait a second, Guilty Gear did it first!

1429
01:42:58,558 --> 01:43:06,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, doesn't, I mean, Loki, you kind of have an insider perspective on this, don't sometimes the retailers and the folks on the inside have to know this a little sooner before the consumer?

1430
01:43:06,445 --> 01:43:07,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1431
01:43:20,934 --> 01:43:21,335
[SPEAKER_02]: WEEFIT

1432
01:43:43,192 --> 01:43:46,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, you'd be surprised, it's still hard to get from Nintendo.

1433
01:43:47,614 --> 01:43:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Mario Kart.

1434
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is up with Mario Kart?

1435
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:50,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that either.

1436
01:43:51,315 --> 01:43:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But, for whatever reason, I could totally see this happening.

1437
01:43:56,357 --> 01:43:59,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be something stupid.

1438
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:03,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's going to now support Wii Motion Plus for something, but...

1439
01:44:04,887 --> 01:44:06,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not buying it, that's for sure.

1440
01:44:06,068 --> 01:44:07,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably more crappy minigames.

1441
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:09,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, well, I shouldn't say that.

1442
01:44:09,269 --> 01:44:12,190
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Wii Fit isn't bad, per se.

1443
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:13,771
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not for the hardcore gamer.

1444
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:15,352
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's definitely an audience for it.

1445
01:44:15,432 --> 01:44:18,973
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a bad piece of software.

1446
01:44:19,313 --> 01:44:19,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's put it that way.

1447
01:44:21,514 --> 01:44:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me put it this way.

1448
01:44:23,982 --> 01:44:31,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this what they're going to basically load their guns with for their E3 press conference?

1449
01:44:31,129 --> 01:44:38,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're like, and you thought we forgot you, Core Gamer, we fit plus.

1450
01:44:39,236 --> 01:44:42,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because right now it's looking like more of the same and that's scary.

1451
01:44:42,139 --> 01:44:45,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, I actually think that the Motion Plus is going to be the big thing.

1452
01:44:45,101 --> 01:44:54,830
[SPEAKER_12]: But my concern is because Nintendo is such a bitch about revealing things to people or telling them stuff, I'm just afraid that they're going to alienate the developers and nobody's going to develop anything.

1453
01:44:55,551 --> 01:45:00,355
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think number one, they should have developed, I mean, the Wiimote should have had this extra sensor in it anyway.

1454
01:45:00,755 --> 01:45:05,119
[SPEAKER_12]: But then I just think they're going to alienate the producers again and nobody's going to make good games for it.

1455
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what's going to happen.

1456
01:45:19,346 --> 01:45:21,227
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1457
01:45:37,213 --> 01:45:38,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do Wii Sports Resort.

1458
01:45:38,654 --> 01:45:41,136
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to throw in something that people need to buy.

1459
01:45:41,436 --> 01:45:45,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only is it the Wii Sports angle, but it's also the Wii Play angle at the same time.

1460
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:48,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and now we're going to do the same thing with Wii Fit.

1461
01:45:48,562 --> 01:45:49,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do Wii Fit Plus.

1462
01:45:49,843 --> 01:45:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to add some other new thing that people probably don't need.

1463
01:45:53,225 --> 01:45:58,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to try to resell it again because people eat up Wii Fit and they want to buy a Wii system for Wii Fit.

1464
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:00,591
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the Core Gamer?

1465
01:46:01,693 --> 01:46:03,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, you get some ported GameCube games.

1466
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:04,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1467
01:46:04,494 --> 01:46:10,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get a version of Excite Truck, which has really been toned down kid-wise.

1468
01:46:10,955 --> 01:46:14,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear they removed the whole custom soundtrack thing, which sucks.

1469
01:46:15,156 --> 01:46:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1470
01:46:15,456 --> 01:46:17,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go step backwards as far as innovation goes.

1471
01:46:18,357 --> 01:46:22,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will bet you anything there will be multiple colored Wiimotes and people will piss themselves over it.

1472
01:46:23,758 --> 01:46:24,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know why.

1473
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:26,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I gotta own a red remote now.

1474
01:46:28,696 --> 01:46:35,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have to disagree on the Motion Plus because for a lot of us that bought the Wii, we thought it was going to have one-to-one control from the beginning.

1475
01:46:35,658 --> 01:46:36,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And I still think it should have.

1476
01:46:37,019 --> 01:46:45,201
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand why they didn't just make the Wiimote with this extra... And I've heard people, I've heard things online that say that it does add that one-to-one control and the possibilities are great.

1477
01:46:45,361 --> 01:46:55,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I'm going to be pissed if Nintendo alienates all the producers again and doesn't actually... You know, like I heard that LucasArts was upset because they weren't aware of this before they came out with their...

1478
01:46:57,825 --> 01:47:00,087
[SPEAKER_12]: LightSaber Games, so I'm very upset.

1479
01:47:24,123 --> 01:47:27,245
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, maybe we'll get knocked completely on our ass.

1480
01:47:27,385 --> 01:47:29,606
[SPEAKER_13]: That they're going to reveal that game for the core gamer.

1481
01:47:30,127 --> 01:47:37,130
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to, you know, Reggie's going to whip it out and say, you know, here it is, Kid Icarus, the game you've all been waiting for, something like that.

1482
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:38,411
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and it's going to rock.

1483
01:47:38,511 --> 01:47:39,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope.

1484
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and Konami's going to put out a good music game again.

1485
01:47:41,993 --> 01:47:42,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1486
01:47:42,793 --> 01:47:43,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1487
01:47:44,414 --> 01:47:45,734
[SPEAKER_02]: There are patterns for a reason.

1488
01:47:46,275 --> 01:47:48,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what they're going to announce, what?

1489
01:47:48,836 --> 01:47:49,737
[SPEAKER_02]: A new Pikmin game.

1490
01:47:49,977 --> 01:47:50,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Big...

1491
01:47:50,936 --> 01:47:52,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopin' shit, okay?

1492
01:47:53,037 --> 01:47:54,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, big deal, okay?

1493
01:47:54,298 --> 01:47:55,139
[SPEAKER_02]: New Pikmin game.

1494
01:47:55,499 --> 01:47:57,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, the fans have been crying for it.

1495
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:58,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yada, yada, yada.

1496
01:47:58,701 --> 01:47:59,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a new Zelda game.

1497
01:48:00,342 --> 01:48:05,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, are we really gonna get down to the point where we're just re-releasing the same franchise games over and over?

1498
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do something new, okay?

1499
01:48:07,646 --> 01:48:10,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Wii Sports stuff is okay, but let's create a new character.

1500
01:48:10,948 --> 01:48:12,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do something different.

1501
01:48:12,449 --> 01:48:14,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make, you know, something really epic.

1502
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:17,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, we're gonna, you know, now, you see...

1503
01:48:18,092 --> 01:48:18,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1504
01:48:40,258 --> 01:48:41,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally agree with you.

1505
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:56,572
[SPEAKER_12]: My thing with the Wii Motion Plus is that this would open up the possibility for that true new style of gaming that we were all expecting with the Wii, where it's like your virtual reality, but I'm just afraid that the third-party producers are not going to feel like they're supported by Nintendo.

1506
01:48:56,812 --> 01:48:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that is.

1507
01:48:57,733 --> 01:48:59,575
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen is you're going to see a bunch of these games.

1508
01:48:59,775 --> 01:49:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it supports Wii Motion Plus.

1509
01:49:01,337 --> 01:49:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sequel.

1510
01:49:01,898 --> 01:49:02,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel 2.

1511
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:05,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but the controls still suck.

1512
01:49:05,202 --> 01:49:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to help anything.

1513
01:49:06,703 --> 01:49:09,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good as a new tool and stuff, but it's not anything innovative.

1514
01:49:09,847 --> 01:49:10,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not...

1515
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:14,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fixing a problem, that's all it is.

1516
01:49:14,972 --> 01:49:24,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's another peripheral that they can sell for $10, bundle it with a game, and then they're going to include the remotes, they're going to have it built into it now, and then it's going to be something else.

1517
01:49:24,336 --> 01:49:27,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be always something to fix the flaws of what the system was.

1518
01:49:28,658 --> 01:49:29,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Not new.

1519
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:37,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won't be damn surprised if there's anything from this press conference that surprises me, but last year it was just like, yep, huh.

1520
01:49:37,521 --> 01:49:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid peripheral, huh?

1521
01:49:39,043 --> 01:49:39,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Really funny.

1522
01:49:39,744 --> 01:49:41,006
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with the whole Wii Zapper.

1523
01:49:41,326 --> 01:49:42,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be awesome.

1524
01:49:42,488 --> 01:49:44,791
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Wii Zapper was really kick-ass.

1525
01:49:45,131 --> 01:49:48,956
[SPEAKER_02]: What they first showed off, you know, the prototype and all that stuff, they should have stuck with that.

1526
01:49:49,096 --> 01:49:51,440
[SPEAKER_02]: No, now it's a plastic shell that I don't even use anymore.

1527
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:54,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The third-party peripherals are better than the goddamn Wii Zapper.

1528
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:55,613
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1529
01:49:55,893 --> 01:49:56,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll see.

1530
01:49:56,414 --> 01:50:00,475
[SPEAKER_13]: We are two months away from E3, and a lot of these questions will be answered.

1531
01:50:00,515 --> 01:50:06,958
[SPEAKER_13]: But in the meantime, we're going to answer some of your questions by going to a segment we like to do every week known as the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

1532
01:50:06,998 --> 01:50:11,480
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, I do want to remind everybody in studio and in our chat live that we are doing listless tonight.

1533
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:17,262
[SPEAKER_13]: And the topic tonight for listless, which we'll get to a little later in the show, but everybody should be thinking about their lists, right, for listless.

1534
01:50:17,282 --> 01:50:17,882
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a little while.

1535
01:50:18,663 --> 01:50:23,305
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be the feature that the DSI should have had to get me to buy one today.

1536
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:25,023
[SPEAKER_13]: So be thinking about that.

1537
01:50:25,444 --> 01:50:28,690
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, let's open up the mailbag.

1538
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and read some of your emails right now.

1539
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:32,717
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

1540
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:34,750
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one from Deathwishing.

1541
01:50:35,571 --> 01:50:38,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, remember how I called and ranted about how Microsoft stole my $20?

1542
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:40,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I do remember that.

1543
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:41,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, patience paid off.

1544
01:50:41,972 --> 01:50:46,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only did I get my original points of $1,600 back, but I threw in an extra $1,600.

1545
01:50:47,033 --> 01:50:51,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this shows you that being polite and waiting gets you a reward better than bitching 24-7.

1546
01:50:52,055 --> 01:50:53,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I'm gonna sleep now.

1547
01:50:53,355 --> 01:50:53,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks, bye.

1548
01:50:56,016 --> 01:50:57,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad to hear all was resolved.

1549
01:50:58,596 --> 01:51:00,957
[SPEAKER_07]: This is... The next one is from Isabelle.

1550
01:51:02,594 --> 01:51:05,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, I want to start off by saying hi, how's it going?

1551
01:51:05,275 --> 01:51:08,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long while now, and I hope all of it is great for you guys.

1552
01:51:09,557 --> 01:51:16,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Now to get to the point of my email, I finally got to play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom after what seems like a million years, and all I have to say about that game is wow.

1553
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:22,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard how you guys said it was well done and really awesome, but I didn't expect it to be this awesome.

1554
01:51:22,402 --> 01:51:24,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I played its arcade version, and for the arcade...

1555
01:51:25,063 --> 01:51:26,644
[SPEAKER_07]: and for an arcade game, it's really good.

1556
01:51:27,044 --> 01:51:28,784
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, have you gotten to play the arcade version?

1557
01:51:29,304 --> 01:51:32,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Another arcade game I got to play was Tekken 6.

1558
01:51:32,846 --> 01:51:37,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Just from the arcade version, I can tell that once it hits homes, no one will leave their couches.

1559
01:51:37,627 --> 01:51:38,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it really was that good.

1560
01:51:39,368 --> 01:51:42,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wish you all the best and thanks for taking time for reading this email.

1561
01:51:43,329 --> 01:51:45,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually haven't played the arcade version yet.

1562
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:50,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got a chance to go check it out at any of the local places, well, state local places that have it.

1563
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:52,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I had no idea there was an arcade version of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1564
01:51:52,513 --> 01:51:52,953
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty rad.

1565
01:51:52,973 --> 01:51:54,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it originally was the arcade version.

1566
01:51:54,694 --> 01:51:55,935
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I should have known that.

1567
01:51:56,896 --> 01:51:57,557
[SPEAKER_13]: But yet I didn't.

1568
01:51:57,597 --> 01:51:58,057
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.

1569
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:04,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I have played the Wii version, and I played with Jun and Ken as my team, and I was very happy with it.

1570
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:08,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I still need to get out and play Tekken 6, because I love Tekken everything.

1571
01:52:09,993 --> 01:52:17,879
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't really say anything else, more about any arcade versions of them, just that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is super cool.

1572
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:22,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last email, this comes from Spirit of Radio.

1573
01:52:24,884 --> 01:52:29,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing video games since I was little and never been scared in any game.

1574
01:52:29,527 --> 01:52:32,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry but Silent Hill 2-3 are boring and controls like garbage.

1575
01:52:32,649 --> 01:52:34,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I will agree with some of the control issues.

1576
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:39,654
[SPEAKER_07]: The only game that honestly gave me a hard time going to sleep was the original Manhunt.

1577
01:52:40,014 --> 01:52:44,097
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept of someone forcing you to do snuff films is the stuff of nightmares.

1578
01:52:44,577 --> 01:52:47,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool first time sending you guys an email.

1579
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, keep up the great podcast you guys.

1580
01:52:50,941 --> 01:52:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Manhunt is something that I find repugnant.

1581
01:52:53,923 --> 01:52:55,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care for the game at all.

1582
01:52:56,865 --> 01:52:59,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the psychological type of edge.

1583
01:52:59,826 --> 01:53:03,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The stuff that requires intelligence and not, you know, ooh, blood!

1584
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:09,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yay for first-time emailers, if nothing else.

1585
01:53:09,572 --> 01:53:11,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks for emailing.

1586
01:53:11,073 --> 01:53:11,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it up.

1587
01:53:13,658 --> 01:53:13,938
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1588
01:53:14,259 --> 01:53:14,579
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1589
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:15,560
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it for the emails.

1590
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:15,900
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1591
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.

1592
01:53:16,861 --> 01:53:21,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for reading in a future show.

1593
01:53:22,385 --> 01:53:22,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1594
01:53:23,166 --> 01:53:24,707
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, let's get back to some gaming news.

1595
01:53:24,747 --> 01:53:31,512
[SPEAKER_13]: We just have a few more stories, and then we're going to get into tonight's list list, and we're going to respond to some of the tweets we got on Twitter this week.

1596
01:53:31,532 --> 01:53:33,794
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to respond to those in just a little bit.

1597
01:53:33,834 --> 01:53:36,056
[SPEAKER_13]: We got one more round of stories, though, starting off with Loki.

1598
01:53:36,456 --> 01:53:36,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1599
01:53:36,797 --> 01:53:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting how April Fool's jokes can now become reality again.

1600
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1601
01:54:01,971 --> 01:54:05,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, it actually made it into the game.

1602
01:54:05,533 --> 01:54:10,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that the company behind it, Volition, also puts out Saints Row.

1603
01:54:11,637 --> 01:54:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are, of course, very used to quirky, weird shit.

1604
01:54:16,119 --> 01:54:17,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Ostrich Hammer.

1605
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:20,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That almost sounds like something that should be in Team Fortress 2.

1606
01:54:20,261 --> 01:54:23,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like the name of a real good metal band.

1607
01:54:24,264 --> 01:54:25,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Ostrich Hammer!

1608
01:54:27,385 --> 01:54:29,667
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, so you'll be able to hit people with an ostrich.

1609
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,421
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1610
01:54:54,844 --> 01:55:01,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, he was really, really famous in the 1980s because he could actually press a button 16 times in one second.

1611
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,501
[SPEAKER_13]: 16 times in one second, if you can believe that.

1612
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:14,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, they made this little device back in the 80s to kind of cash in on this whole button mashing thing called the Shooting Watch.

1613
01:55:15,165 --> 01:55:19,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And you could use this to try and match, beat, or try and tie this guy's score.

1614
01:55:20,127 --> 01:55:23,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Shooting Watch has now been ported to the iPhone.

1615
01:55:23,889 --> 01:55:27,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can try and mash buttons as fast as you want.

1616
01:55:27,351 --> 01:55:28,031
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's the thing.

1617
01:55:28,511 --> 01:55:30,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think this thing's going to be that...

1618
01:55:31,957 --> 01:55:34,139
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna cost you 99 cents.

1619
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:39,023
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not gonna be as real as the real deal because I don't think the iPhone screen is good enough.

1620
01:55:39,123 --> 01:55:42,546
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not gonna match the electronics of an actual button.

1621
01:55:42,946 --> 01:55:47,669
[SPEAKER_13]: But look, if you just want a stupid app, pointless thing...

1622
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:48,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun.

1623
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:14,199
[SPEAKER_13]: 16 times in one second.

1624
01:56:14,499 --> 01:56:15,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, imagine 16 times.

1625
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:15,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Ready?

1626
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,440
[SPEAKER_13]: One one thousand.

1627
01:56:17,781 --> 01:56:18,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

1628
01:56:18,501 --> 01:56:18,761
[SPEAKER_13]: 16 times.

1629
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:19,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Right in that.

1630
01:56:20,362 --> 01:56:20,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Crazy.

1631
01:56:21,522 --> 01:56:22,603
[SPEAKER_13]: One more story, then listless.

1632
01:56:22,923 --> 01:56:25,204
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes my brain hurt to think about.

1633
01:56:26,524 --> 01:56:31,526
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have come in really freaking handy doing the drinking minigame in Chrono Trigger.

1634
01:56:35,168 --> 01:56:39,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, speaking of for iPhone, there is actually a good game coming out.

1635
01:56:41,124 --> 01:56:42,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking Mama is a good game.

1636
01:56:42,264 --> 01:56:43,065
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good game.

1637
01:56:44,145 --> 01:56:58,809
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a version of Galaga that is coming out, which was... You could actually play this particular version in... I do believe that it came out in 1981?

1638
01:56:58,869 --> 01:57:01,290
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1639
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:07,632
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the 1995 one that was the Galaga remix.

1640
01:57:08,512 --> 01:57:10,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But Galaga remix is coming out on iPhone.

1641
01:57:11,348 --> 01:57:11,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that.

1642
01:57:11,789 --> 01:57:13,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't that packaged with Pac-Man and Dig Dug remixes?

1643
01:57:14,255 --> 01:57:14,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe so.

1644
01:57:14,897 --> 01:57:15,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

1645
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,643
[SPEAKER_13]: They have that at a local arcade around here.

1646
01:57:17,704 --> 01:57:18,125
[SPEAKER_13]: It's closed down.

1647
01:57:19,728 --> 01:57:28,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, as far as I was always aware, the Galaga remix was based off of the Galaga 90 and Galaga 88.

1648
01:57:29,673 --> 01:57:31,414
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was just in my observation.

1649
01:57:31,854 --> 01:57:34,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's supposed to be coming out on the iPhone.

1650
01:57:34,976 --> 01:57:36,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be $5.99.

1651
01:57:38,598 --> 01:57:45,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can use directional buttons, but there's also a sliding method and there is a tilt method.

1652
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:49,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm going to use the buttons, I swear, because...

1653
01:57:50,367 --> 01:57:52,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to play Pole Position and Tilt Mode is not fun.

1654
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:56,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's going to be pretty good.

1655
01:57:56,512 --> 01:57:57,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be good.

1656
01:57:57,733 --> 01:57:58,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching a video about it.

1657
01:57:58,634 --> 01:57:59,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty good.

1658
01:57:59,735 --> 01:58:03,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's have an interesting round table on this point here before we get into the list list tonight.

1659
01:58:03,078 --> 01:58:05,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Because an interesting comment was said in chat.

1660
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think everybody might want to have to say something to this.

1661
01:58:08,082 --> 01:58:13,087
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru in chat says, I don't see how you love the iPhone and hate on the DSi.

1662
01:58:13,647 --> 01:58:15,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Apple's worse with updating hardware.

1663
01:58:15,369 --> 01:58:18,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say I hate... No, you as in all of us.

1664
01:58:19,204 --> 01:58:20,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't hate the DSi.

1665
01:58:20,904 --> 01:58:25,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I just haven't... I have other things to spend my money on right now, like Disneyland.

1666
01:58:26,066 --> 01:58:27,646
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as... For me, here it is.

1667
01:58:27,906 --> 01:58:29,487
[SPEAKER_13]: I already have a Nintendo DS.

1668
01:58:29,787 --> 01:58:33,448
[SPEAKER_13]: What does the DSi add to it that the DS didn't already have?

1669
01:58:33,788 --> 01:58:36,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, I'm not saying the DS is a bad gaming system.

1670
01:58:36,488 --> 01:58:36,928
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not.

1671
01:58:37,269 --> 01:58:42,010
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you don't have a DS yet, the DSi is probably a pretty good purchase for you.

1672
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:46,851
[SPEAKER_13]: I would actually recommend it over the DS at this point because you know there's going to be those games later on.

1673
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,032
[SPEAKER_13]: and so on and so forth.

1674
01:59:09,513 --> 01:59:10,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Updating the software.

1675
01:59:10,855 --> 01:59:11,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about it.

1676
01:59:11,295 --> 01:59:18,541
[SPEAKER_13]: The iPhones, when they first launched, didn't have the App Store and the user-made apps and those things built into it.

1677
01:59:18,582 --> 01:59:21,704
[SPEAKER_13]: That was something that Apple added for everybody.

1678
01:59:21,764 --> 01:59:26,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas I feel like with the DSi, there was nothing being given to current DS users.

1679
01:59:26,689 --> 01:59:29,852
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't update the firmware on the DS.

1680
01:59:30,452 --> 01:59:30,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1681
01:59:30,792 --> 01:59:32,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I think for me, there's kind of the difference in...

1682
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:34,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Those two things.

1683
01:59:35,496 --> 01:59:37,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And the iPhone's not perfect.

1684
01:59:37,759 --> 01:59:44,787
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, yeah, Apple is a huge abuser of this whole let's upgrade the whole thing in a year and watch everybody buy it all over again.

1685
01:59:45,107 --> 01:59:47,991
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, we give them crap for that, too, and it's deserved.

1686
01:59:48,892 --> 01:59:52,997
[SPEAKER_13]: So, anyway, speaking of that, let's get to tonight's list list.

1687
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,796
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1688
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:23,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we're going to go around the room and each one of us is going to take something off of the list, leaving a list of eight.

1689
02:00:23,527 --> 02:00:28,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you guys in chat will vote on that list of eight and make our top three using your votes.

1690
02:00:28,971 --> 02:00:31,033
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we will have the definitive top three list.

1691
02:00:31,494 --> 02:00:32,695
[SPEAKER_13]: No arguments, no debates.

1692
02:00:33,395 --> 02:00:34,536
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the official list.

1693
02:00:35,057 --> 02:00:35,337
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1694
02:00:36,879 --> 02:00:39,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I say that, but of course there's always room for debate.

1695
02:00:39,481 --> 02:00:41,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so that being said, tonight's topic...

1696
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:45,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Feature that should have been on the DSi that would have got me to buy one today.

1697
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Who wants to start us off tonight?

1698
02:00:46,481 --> 02:00:47,021
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Loki?

1699
02:00:47,622 --> 02:00:49,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's always got some evil answers for us.

1700
02:00:49,703 --> 02:00:52,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, what is your number three answer of the feature the DSi should have had?

1701
02:00:52,464 --> 02:00:55,345
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I was thinking a bunch of different things.

1702
02:00:56,125 --> 02:00:56,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me say this.

1703
02:00:56,586 --> 02:00:56,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1704
02:00:56,886 --> 02:00:57,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Real quick.

1705
02:00:57,506 --> 02:01:06,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Chatters, if you have ideas, put them in our chat room because if one of us gets an answer stolen, like somebody else says the same answer we were going to use, usually we take backup answers from chat.

1706
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:07,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to get that out there.

1707
02:01:08,591 --> 02:01:25,163
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be kind of neat I mean I don't really use this on the Wii but like the DSI message board you know basically allowing you to send emails and attachments and stuff like that to each other really you know DSI should have a lot of stuff that the Wii has but you know that's what I'm going to start with

1708
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:30,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Doctor, what is the number three feature the DSi should have had to get you to buy one today?

1709
02:01:30,272 --> 02:01:30,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Voice recognition.

1710
02:01:30,852 --> 02:01:31,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Software.

1711
02:01:46,138 --> 02:01:47,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be an awesome feature in games.

1712
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:49,420
[SPEAKER_12]: You speak and then it responds.

1713
02:01:49,460 --> 02:02:01,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now, I think about brain training and you have the blue and, you know, some of those things, but what would be... It's so rudimentary, like actual practical where you could say, you know, you cast a spell in a fantasy game and they do it, you know.

1714
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:03,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Go in and cast magic missiles!

1715
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:06,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, really fully developed voice recognition software.

1716
02:02:06,413 --> 02:02:08,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Improved voice... Okay, I can go with that.

1717
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:08,514
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1718
02:02:08,714 --> 02:02:08,935
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1719
02:02:08,975 --> 02:02:09,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

1720
02:02:09,095 --> 02:02:09,675
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1721
02:02:09,715 --> 02:02:10,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go next.

1722
02:02:10,316 --> 02:02:18,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And my number three answer I'm going to use tonight is open app development like the iPhone that they should open up because they're going to have this DSI downloadable stuff.

1723
02:02:18,502 --> 02:02:19,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they should open it up.

1724
02:02:20,063 --> 02:02:26,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I think open app development is going to be my number three answer that anybody should be able to make a DS game.

1725
02:02:27,088 --> 02:02:30,651
[SPEAKER_13]: because the community, I think, could come up with some good stuff and maybe like a message board.

1726
02:02:30,951 --> 02:02:32,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's been very good for the iPhone.

1727
02:02:32,472 --> 02:02:34,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we're going to make that comparison, then there you go.

1728
02:02:35,274 --> 02:02:36,215
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, you're number three.

1729
02:02:37,656 --> 02:02:40,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Me.

1730
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:41,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1731
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:50,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think having your me being able to travel, you know, from your Wii to your DSi to go visit other people's memes, you know.

1732
02:02:51,665 --> 02:02:53,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, they can already do that.

1733
02:02:53,807 --> 02:02:56,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're going to have support for it, but yeah, they should.

1734
02:02:56,188 --> 02:03:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Have it integrated into the actual OS of the system.

1735
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:06,974
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's kind of forgotten that you can put those things on the Wiimote, too, because there's not a lot of practical use for it.

1736
02:03:07,414 --> 02:03:07,894
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1737
02:03:08,314 --> 02:03:10,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I've brought mine over to your house before that way.

1738
02:03:10,115 --> 02:03:11,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that.

1739
02:03:11,096 --> 02:03:12,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so Mii integration, I guess we could say.

1740
02:03:12,997 --> 02:03:14,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Better use of the Miis on DS.

1741
02:03:14,318 --> 02:03:14,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that idea.

1742
02:03:15,618 --> 02:03:16,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Loki.

1743
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:18,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1744
02:03:20,751 --> 02:03:22,011
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would be kind of cool?

1745
02:03:22,212 --> 02:03:22,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluetooth.

1746
02:03:24,312 --> 02:03:25,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1747
02:03:25,813 --> 02:03:27,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think of it as you will.

1748
02:03:27,453 --> 02:03:30,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use your Wii Remote for motion sensitive games.

1749
02:03:31,035 --> 02:03:35,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily obviously waggling your Wii Remote around, but like racing games or something like that.

1750
02:03:35,636 --> 02:03:37,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use it for wireless headsets.

1751
02:03:40,198 --> 02:03:40,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1752
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:43,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Communication with other devices.

1753
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:44,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1754
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:47,000
[SPEAKER_12]: The Doctor.

1755
02:03:47,441 --> 02:03:48,101
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your number two?

1756
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:51,747
[SPEAKER_12]: The tilt feature, the motion feature like the iPhone has.

1757
02:03:54,929 --> 02:03:56,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you guys wanting to turn the DSi into an iPhone?

1758
02:03:56,710 --> 02:03:57,750
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on here?

1759
02:03:57,850 --> 02:03:58,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I did one too.

1760
02:03:59,371 --> 02:04:01,472
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think the tilt feature would add to the DSi?

1761
02:04:04,013 --> 02:04:10,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, gimmicks, but it seems like that would not have been a useless feature like the camera.

1762
02:04:10,336 --> 02:04:10,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1763
02:04:12,998 --> 02:04:15,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, my number two answer I'm going to say is...

1764
02:04:17,112 --> 02:04:19,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm going to give the first smart-ass answer of the night.

1765
02:04:19,432 --> 02:04:21,933
[SPEAKER_13]: A Virtual Boy slot would have been something too.

1766
02:04:22,433 --> 02:04:32,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Since they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, give me a Virtual Boy slot to give me a use for those games that are just collecting dust from the great red headache machine of death.

1767
02:04:32,195 --> 02:04:33,215
[SPEAKER_13]: So a Virtual Boy slot.

1768
02:04:36,976 --> 02:04:42,557
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, your number two pick for feature that you most would want to see in the DSi that would have gotten you to buy one.

1769
02:04:42,817 --> 02:04:43,357
[SPEAKER_00]: TV Tuner.

1770
02:04:45,575 --> 02:04:47,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I like, I like that.

1771
02:04:47,175 --> 02:04:48,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, TV tuner.

1772
02:04:48,596 --> 02:04:55,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if the freaking Turbo Express, the handheld TurboGrafx could have a TV tuner.

1773
02:04:56,059 --> 02:04:58,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And NEC didn't really, well, they kind of did.

1774
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:01,782
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, why can't, yeah, the Lynx had one too.

1775
02:05:01,862 --> 02:05:02,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?

1776
02:05:02,902 --> 02:05:03,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the heck not?

1777
02:05:04,683 --> 02:05:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll tell you why not.

1778
02:05:06,004 --> 02:05:06,644
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nomad.

1779
02:05:06,804 --> 02:05:07,485
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm kidding.

1780
02:05:07,505 --> 02:05:10,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're getting rid of analog TV signals soon.

1781
02:05:10,646 --> 02:05:12,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter, have a digital TV tuner.

1782
02:05:12,067 --> 02:05:12,347
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1783
02:05:12,367 --> 02:05:12,407
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1784
02:05:13,187 --> 02:05:13,888
[SPEAKER_13]: That's impossible.

1785
02:05:13,928 --> 02:05:14,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes!

1786
02:05:15,709 --> 02:05:16,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Unpossible.

1787
02:05:17,369 --> 02:05:17,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1788
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:20,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're getting to the number one answers.

1789
02:05:20,151 --> 02:05:25,254
[SPEAKER_13]: The number one feature you want to see in the DSi that would get you to buy the system right now.

1790
02:05:25,874 --> 02:05:27,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, what is your number one answer?

1791
02:05:28,255 --> 02:05:32,438
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one answer is... There's nothing they can do.

1792
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:39,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, they would have to... It's made out of bacon.

1793
02:05:39,482 --> 02:05:39,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1794
02:05:40,202 --> 02:05:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1795
02:05:45,859 --> 02:05:47,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no number one answer.

1796
02:05:52,062 --> 02:05:53,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Made out of bacon.

1797
02:05:54,383 --> 02:05:56,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least scratch and sniff bacon smell.

1798
02:05:56,944 --> 02:05:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1799
02:05:57,404 --> 02:05:57,905
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

1800
02:05:58,325 --> 02:05:58,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Made out of bacon.

1801
02:05:58,865 --> 02:05:59,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacon integration.

1802
02:06:00,706 --> 02:06:01,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I like made out of bacon.

1803
02:06:02,067 --> 02:06:07,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, the DSI would sell, you would have bought one today and it was made out of bacon.

1804
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:14,727
[SPEAKER_13]: The Doctor, your number one answer for what would have got you to buy the DSi today.

1805
02:06:14,807 --> 02:06:16,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I guess the theme is crazy stuff now.

1806
02:06:16,929 --> 02:06:19,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, you can interact with it.

1807
02:06:19,312 --> 02:06:20,513
[SPEAKER_12]: It can interact with you back.

1808
02:06:20,533 --> 02:06:23,115
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like, an energy hand will come out and, like, slap you in the face.

1809
02:06:25,717 --> 02:06:26,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that your real answer?

1810
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,080
[SPEAKER_12]: That is.

1811
02:06:29,161 --> 02:06:29,901
[SPEAKER_12]: And my final answer.

1812
02:06:29,961 --> 02:06:31,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Energy hands.

1813
02:06:34,989 --> 02:06:36,271
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's so many apps for that.

1814
02:06:36,311 --> 02:06:37,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Slap in the face.

1815
02:06:37,733 --> 02:06:38,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1816
02:06:38,514 --> 02:06:40,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Helps with self-trouser fornication.

1817
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:42,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Hands made out of pure energy.

1818
02:06:49,181 --> 02:06:54,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, my number one answer... It's a little bit long, but this is a true answer, by the way.

1819
02:06:54,405 --> 02:06:55,906
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a smart-ass answer.

1820
02:06:57,087 --> 02:07:05,793
[SPEAKER_13]: My number one answer for the thing that would have most got me to buy a DSi today... Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

1821
02:07:06,314 --> 02:07:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: My runner-up answer would have been a multi-touch touchscreen, but, you know... Like anything with a multi-touch touchscreen.

1822
02:07:16,121 --> 02:07:17,542
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not just limiting it to the iPhone.

1823
02:07:17,562 --> 02:07:18,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you molest it some more?

1824
02:07:19,301 --> 02:07:20,181
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, enough about you.

1825
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:21,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about me and my answer some more.

1826
02:07:22,562 --> 02:07:26,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

1827
02:07:26,524 --> 02:07:28,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that speaks for itself.

1828
02:07:28,584 --> 02:07:30,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought these games for five damn dollars.

1829
02:07:31,085 --> 02:07:32,486
[SPEAKER_13]: I ought to have the right to download it.

1830
02:07:33,106 --> 02:07:34,006
[SPEAKER_13]: PS3 does it.

1831
02:07:34,586 --> 02:07:35,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't Nintendo do it?

1832
02:07:36,687 --> 02:07:37,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't you do it?

1833
02:07:37,687 --> 02:07:42,529
[SPEAKER_13]: You got rid of the Advance slot, so don't give me that argument you released on the Game Boy Advance, because now I can't play them anymore.

1834
02:07:42,589 --> 02:07:44,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So he does when Nintendo...

1835
02:07:47,319 --> 02:07:47,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll.

1836
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, DarkSakura, your number one answer.

1837
02:07:51,983 --> 02:08:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine would be to take PictoChat and make it truly networking as in you can hop on the Wi-Fi and you don't have to be just in the general vicinity of somebody else with one.

1838
02:08:04,513 --> 02:08:11,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You can draw penises on full-blown PNOR on people's DSIs in Malaysia.

1839
02:08:11,559 --> 02:08:15,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Or an enhancement of that, it could be like there's a camera on it, like video chat.

1840
02:08:16,746 --> 02:08:19,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just say PictoChat across the internets?

1841
02:08:19,627 --> 02:08:20,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cool.

1842
02:08:20,607 --> 02:08:21,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, there you go.

1843
02:08:22,608 --> 02:08:29,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Although my bullshit answer could either be a jelly belly dispenser or gay porn.

1844
02:08:30,232 --> 02:08:31,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Gay porn, alright.

1845
02:08:31,293 --> 02:08:33,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Gay porn always sells.

1846
02:08:33,274 --> 02:08:35,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see what the chatroom had to say, some answers there.

1847
02:08:36,295 --> 02:08:39,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, we had a DDR pad.

1848
02:08:40,157 --> 02:08:51,644
[SPEAKER_13]: was one answer, Airport Tuner, Shortwave Tuner, Legend of Zelda Ghost Camera, a Vibrator, I think I saw different forms of Vibrator, a Trans Vibrator was one that came up as well.

1849
02:08:54,837 --> 02:08:56,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, what do we have as well?

1850
02:08:56,158 --> 02:08:58,581
[SPEAKER_13]: LaserCat's DSi game at launch would have made it better.

1851
02:08:58,621 --> 02:09:00,462
[SPEAKER_13]: That's from S2100, Matt.

1852
02:09:00,522 --> 02:09:01,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Virtual Handheld from Actdeft.

1853
02:09:01,984 --> 02:09:02,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of like my answer.

1854
02:09:03,385 --> 02:09:06,528
[SPEAKER_13]: How about a fart sound maker or a swear button from Dark Knight?

1855
02:09:06,628 --> 02:09:07,228
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, there you go.

1856
02:09:07,248 --> 02:09:08,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the answers we have from chat.

1857
02:09:08,229 --> 02:09:11,052
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they did make a DDR pad for the Game Boy back in the day.

1858
02:09:11,372 --> 02:09:12,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Way back in the day.

1859
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:12,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one.

1860
02:09:13,594 --> 02:09:15,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they brought out the Super MIDI version of the DDR.

1861
02:09:15,976 --> 02:09:17,177
[SPEAKER_13]: They were kind of shit.

1862
02:09:17,597 --> 02:09:18,298
[SPEAKER_07]: They were funny.

1863
02:09:18,718 --> 02:09:19,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it for your fingers, though?

1864
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:20,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1865
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:20,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1866
02:09:21,892 --> 02:09:23,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft wins a RuPaul game for the DSiWare.

1867
02:09:23,873 --> 02:09:27,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here's the list so far, but now we're going to get to the elimination round.

1868
02:09:27,054 --> 02:09:27,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1869
02:09:27,514 --> 02:09:46,280
[SPEAKER_13]: DSiMessageBoard, voice recognition software, open app development, Miis, Bluetooth integration, tilt feature like the iPhone, virtual voice slot, TV tuner, made out of bacon, energy hands, virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit, and PictoChat across the internets.

1870
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1871
02:09:51,828 --> 02:09:56,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh... Energy Hands, I'm sorry.

1872
02:09:57,333 --> 02:09:58,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Energy Hands.

1873
02:09:58,774 --> 02:10:01,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe just a little too soon for Energy Hands.

1874
02:10:01,577 --> 02:10:02,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, The Doctor.

1875
02:10:03,499 --> 02:10:05,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1876
02:10:06,182 --> 02:10:07,103
[SPEAKER_13]: The Virtual Boy Slot.

1877
02:10:07,823 --> 02:10:08,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you bastard.

1878
02:10:08,764 --> 02:10:10,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Virtual Boy Slot comes off the list.

1879
02:10:11,969 --> 02:10:18,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I am going to say, I have to be honest, the one I've got to take out is voice recognition software.

1880
02:10:18,796 --> 02:10:27,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, doctor, that's not a retaliation thing, but I just think that would be whored to the extreme and would just make the thing crap.

1881
02:10:27,967 --> 02:10:29,688
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura is going to be the last one to eliminate.

1882
02:10:29,769 --> 02:10:31,711
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1883
02:10:33,374 --> 02:10:34,255
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1884
02:10:56,428 --> 02:10:56,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out.

1885
02:10:56,788 --> 02:10:57,908
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like bacon, too.

1886
02:10:57,948 --> 02:10:58,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Bacon.

1887
02:10:59,209 --> 02:10:59,889
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously.

1888
02:11:00,109 --> 02:11:00,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1889
02:11:00,569 --> 02:11:04,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Every Friday after typography class, now I have to go have bacon because bacon is meat candy.

1890
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:05,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

1891
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:05,410
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1892
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:06,851
[SPEAKER_13]: So here we go.

1893
02:11:07,411 --> 02:11:09,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Now here's the list you guys will vote on.

1894
02:11:09,211 --> 02:11:20,934
[SPEAKER_13]: DSI Message Board, Open App Development, Mies, Bluetooth Integration, TV Tuner, Made Out of Bacon, Virtual Console Games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

1895
02:11:21,494 --> 02:11:23,616
[SPEAKER_13]: and Pictochats across the internet.

1896
02:11:24,016 --> 02:11:25,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Place vote now.

1897
02:11:25,297 --> 02:11:28,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Send a private message with your number one and number two answer.

1898
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:32,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure both are labeled or I will assume the first is your number one.

1899
02:11:32,904 --> 02:11:36,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Send those over private message to Rob Roberts in chat room.

1900
02:11:37,168 --> 02:11:41,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you don't know how to do that, ask somebody or maybe somebody will mention it in chat how to do that right now.

1901
02:11:41,972 --> 02:11:45,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Place those votes within the next 120 seconds you have to vote.

1902
02:11:46,015 --> 02:11:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will tally it up and reveal for you who won

1903
02:11:49,578 --> 02:11:51,279
[SPEAKER_13]: A little later on in the show.

1904
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:57,180
[SPEAKER_13]: For now, while those votes are coming in, let's take a trip over to our Twitter.

1905
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:02,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're actually going to look at... We put a call out on Twitter today saying, you know, we're a little short on stories this week.

1906
02:12:02,941 --> 02:12:04,722
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you guys want to see us talk about?

1907
02:12:04,962 --> 02:12:06,262
[SPEAKER_13]: And we put the call out on Twitter.

1908
02:12:06,722 --> 02:12:11,564
[SPEAKER_13]: And we did get some replies, some various tweets in our response here.

1909
02:12:12,004 --> 02:12:14,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to read some of those for you guys right now.

1910
02:12:14,264 --> 02:12:16,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Although right now I'm seeing a lot of gaming weeks.

1911
02:12:16,645 --> 02:12:16,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1912
02:12:18,072 --> 02:12:18,712
[SPEAKER_13]: DSI, is it worth the upgrade?

1913
02:12:18,732 --> 02:12:21,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I get a side of handheld console wars as well, please?

1914
02:12:40,653 --> 02:13:09,038
[SPEAKER_13]: there hasn't been a lot of PSP bashing tonight I don't know is there is is is the DSI I mean okay let me back up the PSP is kind of a little bit behind in the console wars right now but the DSI is kind of out there to increase the lead so to speak I know what we could talk about did you hear about that news story where Sony apparently put out a press release saying that basically saying the DSI was a kiddie system and then touted that it had a Miley Cyrus game in the exact same press release did you hear about that

1915
02:13:10,865 --> 02:13:11,165
[SPEAKER_02]: DS, PSP

1916
02:13:31,122 --> 02:13:32,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, I gotta disagree with that a little.

1917
02:13:33,044 --> 02:13:36,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like all these uber-violent, uber-serious games.

1918
02:13:36,266 --> 02:13:38,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, I fall asleep watching COD.

1919
02:13:38,188 --> 02:13:38,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1920
02:13:39,089 --> 02:13:43,513
[SPEAKER_12]: So I like the more down-to-earth or the more silly games myself.

1921
02:13:44,943 --> 02:13:52,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but here's the thing, and I still feel this way, and you know, maybe, okay, the PSP is still like games and more.

1922
02:13:52,345 --> 02:14:02,167
[SPEAKER_13]: It might not be the best system at games, even though it still has, you know, it does have Dissida, it does have some games that are pretty awesome, but the PSP is still, you know, for that college kid.

1923
02:14:02,187 --> 02:14:11,989
[SPEAKER_13]: This is like the great college system, because you've got your MP3 player, you've got your little internet browser you can use at Starbucks, you've got your gaming system, you know, it's all right there.

1924
02:14:12,089 --> 02:14:14,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the DSi was trying to

1925
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:18,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Compete with that a little bit, but it didn't work because, you know, where's the internet?

1926
02:14:18,832 --> 02:14:20,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is the MP3 player built in?

1927
02:14:20,953 --> 02:14:21,673
[SPEAKER_13]: None of that is here.

1928
02:14:22,333 --> 02:14:28,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So I still think the PSP excels at being more than a gaming, but if all you want is handheld games, I think the DS still wins.

1929
02:14:28,556 --> 02:14:39,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the DSi, though, I mean, their music player's kind of crap because it's only the AAC format or whatever, which I understand, you know, iTunes and stuff, that's fine, but really I think it should have been MP3.

1930
02:14:39,401 --> 02:14:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, man, give it the times.

1931
02:14:41,802 --> 02:14:41,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1932
02:14:42,162 --> 02:14:47,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you know, there's the internet browser, which apparently is not very good anyways.

1933
02:14:47,726 --> 02:14:50,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, ugh, you know, okay, whatever.

1934
02:14:50,688 --> 02:14:54,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, what, the photo manipulation stuff?

1935
02:14:54,490 --> 02:14:54,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1936
02:14:55,491 --> 02:14:56,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're going to do?

1937
02:14:56,672 --> 02:14:57,652
[SPEAKER_02]: A photo manipulation?

1938
02:14:58,033 --> 02:14:59,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really that important?

1939
02:14:59,213 --> 02:15:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to, like, throw those around the internet now and take pictures and manipulate them with silly faces like you couldn't do that in Microsoft Paint or something?

1940
02:15:06,638 --> 02:15:07,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1941
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:13,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got potential, but they're never going to utilize it, and that's sad.

1942
02:15:14,203 --> 02:15:16,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Acidic Vampire's response in chat.

1943
02:15:17,085 --> 02:15:19,386
[SPEAKER_13]: In the PSP's defense, the games look saucier.

1944
02:15:20,647 --> 02:15:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that word, saucier.

1945
02:15:21,527 --> 02:15:29,572
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have had MP3 support if Nintendo had paid a license, just like the Wii could have played DVDs if they had paid the license for the use of DVD codecs.

1946
02:15:30,852 --> 02:15:31,673
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1947
02:15:31,853 --> 02:15:33,354
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's more important than Nintendo?

1948
02:15:33,654 --> 02:15:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Money in their pocket.

1949
02:15:34,915 --> 02:15:35,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1950
02:15:37,027 --> 02:15:37,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So much for that.

1951
02:15:38,788 --> 02:15:41,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the consumer loses because Nintendo needs to make a buck.

1952
02:15:42,109 --> 02:15:46,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but nobody uses their consoles to play movies anymore, I don't think, anyway.

1953
02:15:47,611 --> 02:15:49,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my consoles to play movies all the time.

1954
02:15:49,652 --> 02:15:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my primary DVD player.

1955
02:15:52,914 --> 02:15:54,474
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 is my primary movie player.

1956
02:15:54,594 --> 02:15:58,316
[SPEAKER_07]: We do use it for Blu-ray and our HD DVD player is our Xbox 360.

1957
02:16:01,296 --> 02:16:03,797
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatever I happen to have hooked up at the time.

1958
02:16:03,857 --> 02:16:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be kind of cool to have a DVD player for the Wii.

1959
02:16:08,539 --> 02:16:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be surprised if that's not something that they're going to start selling too.

1960
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:14,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just... I don't know.

1961
02:16:15,042 --> 02:16:18,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I know most people already have DVD players, but you know what?

1962
02:16:18,683 --> 02:16:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: People also have TVs too, but yet still buy tons of TVs out there.

1963
02:16:22,945 --> 02:16:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And who cares?

1964
02:16:23,685 --> 02:16:25,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another DVD player.

1965
02:16:25,066 --> 02:16:25,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point.

1966
02:16:25,946 --> 02:16:28,027
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii may be in the kids' room or something like that.

1967
02:16:28,127 --> 02:16:28,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, boom!

1968
02:16:28,687 --> 02:16:30,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a DVD player in the kids' room.

1969
02:16:30,228 --> 02:16:30,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1970
02:16:33,262 --> 02:16:33,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1971
02:16:34,244 --> 02:16:37,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Minor cost for another bullet point.

1972
02:16:39,071 --> 02:16:39,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever.

1973
02:16:41,222 --> 02:16:43,803
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still trying to tally the votes, so let's move on to another topic here.

1974
02:16:44,644 --> 02:16:49,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Crows asked on Twitter, maybe talk about some April Fool's jokes that spread on the internet that were actually entertaining.

1975
02:16:49,806 --> 02:17:03,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like April Fool's Day at all, although I think, you know, for hating April Fool's Day, I think Dark Tetsuya did a pretty funny one on our site where he did for I Heart that song, he did Let Them Move from DD, which is like a total throwback to the old school days of Orange Lounge Radio.

1976
02:17:03,973 --> 02:17:06,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So, like, I like dumb shit like that.

1977
02:17:08,229 --> 02:17:08,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1978
02:17:08,649 --> 02:17:10,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, DarkSakura, did you guys see anything funny on the internet?

1979
02:17:11,011 --> 02:17:13,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of turn off the internet on April Fool's Day.

1980
02:17:13,633 --> 02:17:16,435
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, a lot of the sites that would normally do April Fool's jokes didn't.

1981
02:17:16,995 --> 02:17:19,677
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, I'm too busy with stuff, so forget it.

1982
02:17:21,178 --> 02:17:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I saw a few in the hacking communities.

1983
02:17:25,641 --> 02:17:33,066
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, oh yeah, look, we're releasing a tool to hack the PSP-3000 or a new one to hack the Wii or something.

1984
02:17:33,206 --> 02:17:35,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, whatever.

1985
02:17:35,207 --> 02:17:36,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Those we kind of figured were fake.

1986
02:17:41,311 --> 02:17:42,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think here.

1987
02:17:42,091 --> 02:17:45,533
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the other April Fool's jokes that were just very obvious?

1988
02:17:46,073 --> 02:17:47,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Metal Gear Solid game.

1989
02:17:48,514 --> 02:17:52,316
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced what the new character was going to be, which is kind of retarded.

1990
02:17:52,936 --> 02:17:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think here.

1991
02:17:56,428 --> 02:17:57,109
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind of lame.

1992
02:17:57,149 --> 02:18:01,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was, you know, the World of Warcraft thing that they did was kind of cool.

1993
02:18:02,092 --> 02:18:12,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was another one with IGN, you know, trying to do this Wii Extend or Wii Expand or something like that, which was supposed to be download content for, like, Wii games.

1994
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:15,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one was Super Smash Bros.

1995
02:18:16,263 --> 02:18:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl Extreme, where they were going to have, like, blood and stuff like that.

1996
02:18:20,306 --> 02:18:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just looked so fake and...

1997
02:18:22,667 --> 02:18:25,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Mario getting decapitated and stuff like that.

1998
02:18:25,288 --> 02:18:33,210
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, despite all the shit we give the mainstream press sometimes on this show and all that stuff, I think their Zelda trailer will never be topped.

1999
02:18:33,330 --> 02:18:35,691
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fool's prank.

2000
02:18:35,711 --> 02:18:36,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

2001
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:38,232
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fool's prank.

2002
02:18:38,292 --> 02:18:44,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Not for the fact that I don't think anyone really fell for it, but just like, god damn, they went all out with that shit that year.

2003
02:18:44,974 --> 02:18:48,855
[SPEAKER_13]: And Doctor, you're a big Zelda fanboy.

2004
02:18:49,175 --> 02:18:52,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you not get a huge boner, April's Fools or not, at that trailer?

2005
02:18:52,156 --> 02:19:01,037
[SPEAKER_12]: No, and obviously it was fake, but yeah, I mean, if you've ever seen the fan-made Zelda movies, I mean, this was like a bazillion, the production value was pretty good.

2006
02:19:02,728 --> 02:19:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly enough, it will never come to fruition, which is, you know, I don't think it would cost that much, you know, for something like that.

2007
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:20,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this wasn't even an April Fool's thing, but have you seen, there's a trailer for a movie that someone made, a short movie, called Turbo, which is a little bit of a cross between, like, Street Fighter and Tron and, you know, the Karate Kid.

2008
02:19:21,294 --> 02:19:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it looks pretty cool, and that's also made, you know, with a really low budget and stuff, so, you know, nowadays, you can do pretty amazing stuff.

2009
02:19:28,836 --> 02:19:31,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, I mean, look at that, what is it, the Half-Life, um...

2010
02:19:32,777 --> 02:19:34,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2011
02:19:55,149 --> 02:19:55,629
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2012
02:19:55,929 --> 02:19:58,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And then one other thing on Twitter I thought was pretty interesting.

2013
02:19:58,230 --> 02:20:05,334
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, our good friend Marin, or Tiara, whatever you want to say, kind of likes to pimp her own stuff.

2014
02:20:06,134 --> 02:20:06,734
[SPEAKER_13]: But I liked it.

2015
02:20:06,794 --> 02:20:12,177
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually a piece that she wrote on her own blog, which I've jokingly referred to as the Giggling Girls blog.

2016
02:20:12,517 --> 02:20:15,138
[SPEAKER_13]: But, no, it's what, AvengersTower.com?

2017
02:20:15,418 --> 02:20:15,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

2018
02:20:16,038 --> 02:20:18,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember if it's Avenger Tower or Avengers Tower.

2019
02:20:18,219 --> 02:20:18,960
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Avengers Tower.

2020
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:19,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Avengers Tower.

2021
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the old...

2022
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:25,332
[SPEAKER_00]: The Avengers Tower and the comic books

2023
02:20:51,786 --> 02:20:52,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Extra Microphones

2024
02:21:03,419 --> 02:21:05,800
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe you could have more than one person singing?

2025
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:08,681
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd have two people singing at once?

2026
02:21:09,022 --> 02:21:21,387
[SPEAKER_02]: To kind of go with the keyboard thing, their site, I don't know if it's viral or what, but their actual The Beatles site, they've been having instruments slowly being added to their studio recording room, and one of the instruments was a keyboard.

2027
02:21:23,488 --> 02:21:23,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

2028
02:21:24,969 --> 02:21:32,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Rumor number three, drums with cymbals, that maybe they're actually going to put actual cymbals or whatever on the drum kit for the rock band.

2029
02:21:32,906 --> 02:21:43,222
[SPEAKER_02]: well they did say that later on it's potential that they can have like say Rock Band 3 or something like that where the cymbals would be their own notes which is kind of cool another rumor two guitars instead of one

2030
02:21:44,818 --> 02:21:49,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more of that is what's going to be why it's more expensive.

2031
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:51,421
[SPEAKER_02]: The second guitar, I think, is going to be in there.

2032
02:21:51,721 --> 02:21:52,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to model the bass.

2033
02:21:52,962 --> 02:21:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to have an actual bass and then a guitar.

2034
02:21:55,483 --> 02:21:57,864
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last rumor, just milking the damn cash cow.

2035
02:21:58,805 --> 02:22:00,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Milking the damn cash cow.

2036
02:22:00,445 --> 02:22:07,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I really hope it's the keyboard one, but I think it's going to be one of their bass guitars with the regular guitar.

2037
02:22:07,809 --> 02:22:09,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially because you have the...

2038
02:22:10,630 --> 02:22:20,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And she goes into talking about the whole Hoffner violin bass, which, you know, it seems likely that, you know, with the Beatles and everything, they would have like a special Beatles bass.

2039
02:22:21,332 --> 02:22:22,032
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems likely.

2040
02:22:24,313 --> 02:22:26,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Some folks in chat are saying, you know, what about like a strobe light?

2041
02:22:27,953 --> 02:22:28,973
[SPEAKER_13]: You can already buy that.

2042
02:22:29,473 --> 02:22:32,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, they're talking about Nine Inch Nails.

2043
02:22:32,334 --> 02:22:37,815
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess their April Fool's joke or something like that has something to do with... Oh, it was the album.

2044
02:22:40,351 --> 02:22:44,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that Nine Inch Nails was putting out a new album that was produced by Timbaland called Strobelight.

2045
02:22:44,834 --> 02:22:46,836
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a good April Fool's joke that was out on the internet.

2046
02:22:47,876 --> 02:22:50,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get into the listless results.

2047
02:22:54,161 --> 02:22:59,585
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can get to your calls, last minute stories, and the end of the show pretty soon.

2048
02:22:59,665 --> 02:23:05,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Believe it or not, for being a slower news week, we sure seem to fill a couple of hours and then some here on the show.

2049
02:23:05,919 --> 02:23:14,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here are your top three tonight, the definitive list as you guys in chat have voted for the feature that they should have put on the DSi that would have made me buy one today.

2050
02:23:15,325 --> 02:23:22,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, open app development, just like the iPhone, let anybody make an app, there you go, open app development.

2051
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:31,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two feature that would have got me to buy a DSi today, made out of bacon, made out of bacon was the number two feature, there you go.

2052
02:23:32,216 --> 02:23:33,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Where there's bacon, there's profit.

2053
02:23:33,858 --> 02:23:39,283
[SPEAKER_13]: And the number one feature that would have gotten people to buy the DSi today?

2054
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:45,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

2055
02:23:45,228 --> 02:23:45,748
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is.

2056
02:23:46,729 --> 02:23:49,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Your number one answer on the list.

2057
02:23:49,852 --> 02:23:50,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Lists.

2058
02:23:50,453 --> 02:23:51,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2059
02:23:53,553 --> 02:23:53,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2060
02:23:54,853 --> 02:23:55,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2061
02:23:55,834 --> 02:23:58,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of votes spread around amongst all the choices, though.

2062
02:23:58,774 --> 02:24:03,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody got a little love, but I think those three struck a particular nerve.

2063
02:24:03,676 --> 02:24:05,816
[SPEAKER_13]: People just love their bacon and virtual console.

2064
02:24:06,617 --> 02:24:07,377
[SPEAKER_13]: And open app development.

2065
02:24:07,877 --> 02:24:08,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2066
02:24:09,437 --> 02:24:10,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft makes a good point.

2067
02:24:10,738 --> 02:24:14,779
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody can make an app, you know who will make his game a reality.

2068
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:17,300
[SPEAKER_13]: That individual who has a game named after himself.

2069
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:21,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know whose game sucks balls, because I've actually played the demo, and it

2070
02:24:22,867 --> 02:24:24,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as crappy as it looks.

2071
02:24:26,128 --> 02:24:26,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2072
02:24:26,648 --> 02:24:29,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's one person developing it.

2073
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:32,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not good.

2074
02:24:32,851 --> 02:24:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: If I paid retail for that, I'd have to kick myself in the junk.

2075
02:24:37,555 --> 02:24:43,840
[SPEAKER_13]: BlackWolf asks in chat, what if Bobby BlackWolf made a game, would you talk about it if I called it Bobby's Game?

2076
02:24:44,601 --> 02:24:45,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I would talk about it every week.

2077
02:24:46,262 --> 02:24:46,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week, Bobby.

2078
02:24:47,603 --> 02:24:47,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week.

2079
02:24:48,424 --> 02:24:49,124
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as it didn't suck.

2080
02:24:49,144 --> 02:24:53,407
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I think you should beat him to the market because I would laugh my ass off at that.

2081
02:24:53,427 --> 02:24:53,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it now.

2082
02:24:54,108 --> 02:24:58,912
[SPEAKER_12]: But only if the theme song to the game is la la la la la la la la Bobby's World.

2083
02:24:59,770 --> 02:25:03,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

2084
02:25:03,952 --> 02:25:04,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2085
02:25:06,292 --> 02:25:14,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, before we get to the Skype line and so forth, we have one segment we always do here on the show that we don't want to miss, but we just haven't had any really angsty stories.

2086
02:25:14,095 --> 02:25:26,600
[SPEAKER_13]: But perhaps the invoking of said name of said band individual from said show and just even thinking about his game should invoke anger and rage in a certain segment we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2087
02:25:42,302 --> 02:25:42,762
[SPEAKER_09]: FU's of the week

2088
02:26:06,676 --> 02:26:11,079
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to this glass of wine I'm drinking for being so yummy and making me a little tipsy during the show.

2089
02:26:11,159 --> 02:26:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

2090
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freaking delicious.

2091
02:26:13,621 --> 02:26:15,502
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Moscato.

2092
02:26:15,662 --> 02:26:16,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Moscato.

2093
02:26:17,363 --> 02:26:18,023
[SPEAKER_13]: It's delicious.

2094
02:26:18,204 --> 02:26:19,104
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a sweet wine.

2095
02:26:19,124 --> 02:26:19,985
[SPEAKER_13]: It tastes like candy.

2096
02:26:21,065 --> 02:26:23,847
[SPEAKER_13]: It tastes like champagne without the bubbles, as my friend put it.

2097
02:26:24,448 --> 02:26:24,908
[SPEAKER_13]: It's delish.

2098
02:26:26,445 --> 02:26:27,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey there, Doctor!

2099
02:26:27,206 --> 02:26:29,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any FUs of the week, even though Loki's holding the mic?

2100
02:26:30,270 --> 02:26:33,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, even though this is a little old news, I had a lady confirm me about this the other day.

2101
02:26:33,633 --> 02:26:35,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you to anyone who doesn't support gay marriage.

2102
02:26:35,876 --> 02:26:37,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you are fucking assholes.

2103
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:39,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Props to Iowa, though.

2104
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Props to Iowa.

2105
02:26:41,181 --> 02:27:01,850
[SPEAKER_13]: of all places props to them although I have heard those comparisons about well isn't Iowa just doing what California did like five years ago or however long ago it was like three years ago which ended up getting turned around by Prop 8 anyway maybe but I hear it's harder to pass a constitutional amendment in that state so if you live in Iowa please don't screw this up please don't screw this up

2106
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:07,991
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, hey, I think some person in Iowa is probably really concerned.

2107
02:27:08,631 --> 02:27:22,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually read about this somewhere, that they are concerned, the conservative moral majority, let's say, in Iowa, that there's just going to be this outbreak of gayness throughout the state.

2108
02:27:22,774 --> 02:27:24,114
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to become a gay mecca.

2109
02:27:24,334 --> 02:27:29,175
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just going to be a sodomy outbreak within the state of Iowa because of this law passing.

2110
02:27:30,922 --> 02:27:31,442
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2111
02:27:32,363 --> 02:27:33,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that a bad thing?

2112
02:27:34,424 --> 02:27:38,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, maybe people can come clean the place up.

2113
02:27:40,207 --> 02:27:42,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Throw a party in Des Moines that people want to come to.

2114
02:27:43,269 --> 02:27:43,910
[SPEAKER_13]: And make it fierce.

2115
02:27:44,130 --> 02:27:46,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Quick, when I say Des Moines, what do you think of?

2116
02:27:47,312 --> 02:27:48,352
[SPEAKER_13]: My crappy customer.

2117
02:27:49,273 --> 02:27:51,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Silent S. Corn.

2118
02:27:51,794 --> 02:27:53,175
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not a lot else I can think of.

2119
02:27:53,995 --> 02:27:54,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, anyway.

2120
02:27:55,636 --> 02:27:59,959
[SPEAKER_13]: ZakuPilot256 in chat says, If gay people want to ruin their life with marriage, let them.

2121
02:28:00,982 --> 02:28:01,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen to that.

2122
02:28:01,643 --> 02:28:02,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, anyhow.

2123
02:28:02,644 --> 02:28:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't I say it in my little rant that I put in my blog?

2124
02:28:06,307 --> 02:28:11,112
[SPEAKER_07]: That everyone should have as much right to mess it up like anyone else?

2125
02:28:11,592 --> 02:28:12,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like Britney Spears.

2126
02:28:12,593 --> 02:28:14,395
[SPEAKER_13]: We have every right to fuck it up like Britney Spears did.

2127
02:28:14,435 --> 02:28:19,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, look, I don't want to turn this into a political show, but obviously it's an issue important to myself and the doctor.

2128
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:21,001
[SPEAKER_13]: So yay, Iowa.

2129
02:28:22,402 --> 02:28:23,463
[SPEAKER_13]: F you, everybody else.

2130
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:26,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Loki, please, your FU of the week.

2131
02:28:27,062 --> 02:28:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to some of my airsoft guns not working correctly, so... Did your airsoft thing, did you get to have that?

2132
02:28:33,987 --> 02:28:37,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I saw, like, multiple please on live, and we were like, pretty please, come play airsoft with me.

2133
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:39,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And I felt bad, I wanted to go, but I had plans.

2134
02:28:39,692 --> 02:28:42,914
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we had, like, three people, including myself, and that's it.

2135
02:28:42,934 --> 02:28:44,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was alright, we had fun with the small group.

2136
02:28:45,116 --> 02:28:47,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise I will go airsoft with you in a future week.

2137
02:28:47,518 --> 02:28:48,779
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine, I just, I have...

2138
02:28:50,578 --> 02:28:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, Bad Loki, what will the wife say?

2139
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't know.

2140
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:20,385
[SPEAKER_13]: And thankfully she doesn't listen to this show.

2141
02:29:20,485 --> 02:29:20,805
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2142
02:29:23,487 --> 02:29:23,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.

2143
02:29:23,927 --> 02:29:24,267
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2144
02:29:24,467 --> 02:29:24,968
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

2145
02:29:25,088 --> 02:29:27,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's open up the Skype line if we can here.

2146
02:29:27,669 --> 02:29:29,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to do not disturb.

2147
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:31,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me open it up there.

2148
02:29:31,411 --> 02:29:34,273
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2149
02:29:34,293 --> 02:29:40,776
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call and interact with us, talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight, or as long as it's gaming related, we'll talk about anything pretty much.

2150
02:29:40,876 --> 02:29:42,717
[SPEAKER_13]: So go ahead and call us right now.

2151
02:29:42,737 --> 02:29:46,960
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2152
02:29:47,580 --> 02:29:50,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for these calls to come in?

2153
02:29:50,742 --> 02:29:53,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sorry, I'm fighting a giant slug thing.

2154
02:29:53,563 --> 02:29:54,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, you're getting saved.

2155
02:29:54,684 --> 02:29:55,565
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a call right now.

2156
02:29:55,645 --> 02:29:56,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2157
02:29:57,005 --> 02:29:57,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2158
02:29:58,546 --> 02:30:00,587
[SPEAKER_10]: This is DSMaster26.

2159
02:30:00,647 --> 02:30:02,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, DSMaster26, what is on your mind?

2160
02:30:02,889 --> 02:30:04,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm going to ask you.

2161
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:06,371
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the DSI?

2162
02:30:09,332 --> 02:30:13,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I've seen, actually, one of my friends has one.

2163
02:30:13,475 --> 02:30:15,676
[SPEAKER_10]: She gets imports from Japan a whole bunch of times.

2164
02:30:16,291 --> 02:30:16,731
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP vs. DSi

2165
02:30:44,278 --> 02:30:45,559
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like on the Nintendo Wii.

2166
02:30:45,619 --> 02:30:46,859
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very, very slow.

2167
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:51,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, same thing with the DSi, but slower.

2168
02:30:53,062 --> 02:30:56,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And seriously, the music player is crap.

2169
02:30:56,183 --> 02:30:59,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, besides, I already got that feature with my R4 card.

2170
02:31:00,625 --> 02:31:02,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, didn't they actually put a music player in the DSi?

2171
02:31:02,806 --> 02:31:03,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't even realize that was there.

2172
02:31:04,247 --> 02:31:04,887
[SPEAKER_13]: It's built in now?

2173
02:31:06,522 --> 02:31:10,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you use your SD card and it always takes AAC.

2174
02:31:12,024 --> 02:31:16,986
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I already have a PSP or more importantly, you know, an iPod and iPhone that will do it as well.

2175
02:31:17,086 --> 02:31:19,066
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I do use my PSP pretty much every day.

2176
02:31:19,086 --> 02:31:20,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, same here.

2177
02:31:20,407 --> 02:31:26,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I use my PSP, like, but R4 does do videos, as I found out.

2178
02:31:27,809 --> 02:31:29,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, that's the reason why I called in.

2179
02:31:30,447 --> 02:31:34,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm giving a review on Silent Hill, which I just saw last night.

2180
02:31:34,929 --> 02:31:35,409
[SPEAKER_10]: The movie?

2181
02:31:35,449 --> 02:31:36,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking awesome.

2182
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2183
02:31:37,550 --> 02:31:37,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2184
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:39,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it amazing?

2185
02:31:39,130 --> 02:31:41,071
[SPEAKER_13]: You're only about three years late, but go ahead.

2186
02:31:42,252 --> 02:31:42,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just messing.

2187
02:31:43,852 --> 02:31:45,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, it came out three years ago?

2188
02:31:45,953 --> 02:31:46,633
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a while ago.

2189
02:31:46,693 --> 02:31:47,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just messing with you.

2190
02:31:47,353 --> 02:31:48,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember when, but it was a while ago.

2191
02:31:50,415 --> 02:31:50,915
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think?

2192
02:31:51,015 --> 02:31:58,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyways, out of all the movie, out of the game movies I've seen, this is like probably the best ever.

2193
02:31:59,747 --> 02:32:08,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And plus on the fact you're seeing witch burnings and then the massive blood splatter in the awesome epic Pyramid Head, which I'm thinking of being for Halloween.

2194
02:32:10,057 --> 02:32:10,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome flick.

2195
02:32:11,958 --> 02:32:15,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you know why we fangasm over Pyramid Head all the time on this show.

2196
02:32:15,481 --> 02:32:16,122
[SPEAKER_13]: He has sex.

2197
02:32:16,402 --> 02:32:17,383
[SPEAKER_13]: He just, he really is.

2198
02:32:17,824 --> 02:32:19,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And he has a lot of it.

2199
02:32:19,645 --> 02:32:20,466
[SPEAKER_07]: With the nurses.

2200
02:32:22,222 --> 02:32:29,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And plus not to mention, if you guys ever... Okay, have any of you played the DDR Extreme for the US version on the PS2?

2201
02:32:30,023 --> 02:32:31,564
[SPEAKER_13]: On the PS2, yes.

2202
02:32:31,664 --> 02:32:33,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Extreme 1, yes.

2203
02:32:34,924 --> 02:32:42,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the ending song, the Silent Hill for the ending credits, very reminiscent to the soundtrack.

2204
02:32:42,946 --> 02:32:48,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's like the last song you'll lock in Extreme, but it was very similar to me.

2205
02:32:48,306 --> 02:32:51,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I couldn't remember the first few times until the chorus came in.

2206
02:32:51,207 --> 02:32:51,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like...

2207
02:32:52,335 --> 02:32:53,375
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was...

2208
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:16,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, have you ever noticed there's a pump-it-up game for the PSP?

2209
02:33:45,609 --> 02:33:47,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I had heard there was a Pump It Up game on PSP.

2210
02:33:50,213 --> 02:33:55,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out on PlayAsia, and I'm like, what the heck?

2211
02:33:55,677 --> 02:34:01,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I can understand DDR on this thing, but not Pump It Up, because it takes five icons.

2212
02:34:02,122 --> 02:34:05,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got the four external sort of square, I don't know what I'm supposed to use.

2213
02:34:05,825 --> 02:34:08,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what about the shoulder buttons?

2214
02:34:08,287 --> 02:34:09,588
[SPEAKER_13]: I just assumed it was the shoulder button.

2215
02:34:09,728 --> 02:34:12,851
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you're going to play DDR on a handheld, Pump It Up makes sense to me.

2216
02:34:14,346 --> 02:34:14,686
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Max DJ Max

2217
02:34:49,379 --> 02:35:00,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love that, but unfortunately, I think because of how Beatmania 2 did, or I'm sorry, not Beatmania 2, Beatmania on the PS2 did, I don't think they're in any hurry to put out a new Beatmania game.

2218
02:35:00,185 --> 02:35:01,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it sold well enough for them.

2219
02:35:01,586 --> 02:35:05,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I had heard it exceeded expectations, but I could have always heard wrong.

2220
02:35:05,788 --> 02:35:22,913
[SPEAKER_13]: because they never did do a second one if it sold that well they would have done a second one I mean as far as I know DDR Universe 2 did not sell that great compared to older DDR titles but they still made a 3 and you know it wasn't just a reskinned version of the other ones because 2 was kind of just a reskinned Universe 1

2221
02:35:24,662 --> 02:35:29,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Just thinking of DDR, haven't you noticed there hasn't been a single one out for the PS3?

2222
02:35:29,785 --> 02:35:32,086
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still rehashing on the PS2.

2223
02:35:32,887 --> 02:35:40,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It is interesting there hasn't been one on the PS3, and I'm wondering if that's not going to be one of the things Konami pulls out of their hat at E3 this year, because you're right.

2224
02:35:40,691 --> 02:35:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: The PS3 is one of those platforms that hasn't seen a DDR game on it yet.

2225
02:35:46,054 --> 02:35:49,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that will be where we start to see the download content and all that stuff.

2226
02:35:49,096 --> 02:35:49,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

2227
02:35:49,856 --> 02:35:50,336
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

2228
02:35:50,456 --> 02:35:51,697
[SPEAKER_13]: At the same time, I'm not going to hold my breath.

2229
02:35:53,476 --> 02:35:57,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania Guitar Hero Control 5 Keys Scratches the Strum Bar

2230
02:36:09,414 --> 02:36:11,274
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of it?

2231
02:36:39,625 --> 02:36:46,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually bought the Guitar Hero DS, and, you know, it's pretty darn interesting, pretty good for what it is.

2232
02:36:46,828 --> 02:36:53,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I was surprised at the graphics for it, for a DS game, for Guitar Hero-wise, and the sound quality was pretty darn good.

2233
02:36:55,372 --> 02:36:59,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the style that they're going with the PSP version of Rock Band, though, is pretty darn interesting.

2234
02:37:00,013 --> 02:37:08,577
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd think they would try to mod, like, redo the guitar grip, and then try to do some little quirky little drum sets.

2235
02:37:09,622 --> 02:37:12,244
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that you plug on top and then you just hit with your fingers.

2236
02:37:13,025 --> 02:37:14,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think that'd be kind of fun.

2237
02:37:15,007 --> 02:37:21,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but at the same time, I like the idea that they're just doing like an amplitude type game that you're not going to need any of these stupid peripherals for.

2238
02:37:21,313 --> 02:37:22,113
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of like that idea.

2239
02:37:22,474 --> 02:37:28,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's also the same control scheme for DJ Max on the PSP, which I kind of suck at.

2240
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:35,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I try it with the two-hand configuration like you would for Beatmania, and I still suck.

2241
02:37:35,871 --> 02:37:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't do it.

2242
02:37:36,171 --> 02:37:37,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, by the way, one more thing before I go.

2243
02:37:37,271 --> 02:37:41,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully EA and the whole gaming industry of America does not call for a bailout from Barack Obama.

2244
02:37:41,413 --> 02:37:41,713
[SPEAKER_13]: That would suck.

2245
02:37:41,733 --> 02:37:42,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they need one?

2246
02:37:42,573 --> 02:37:42,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

2247
02:37:42,733 --> 02:37:43,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Would they be eligible?

2248
02:37:43,313 --> 02:37:44,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably midway.

2249
02:38:06,223 --> 02:38:09,185
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, you seem like you're dying to comment on the bailout message.

2250
02:38:09,225 --> 02:38:09,465
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2251
02:38:09,885 --> 02:38:10,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2252
02:38:25,672 --> 02:38:31,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys talking about the... I think I was just saying, Am I seeing a glitch in Ninja Blade here?

2253
02:38:32,014 --> 02:38:35,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the monster has no health left and I keep hitting it and it's not dying.

2254
02:38:36,595 --> 02:38:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you just suck.

2255
02:38:37,316 --> 02:38:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the call.

2256
02:38:39,156 --> 02:38:40,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2257
02:38:40,257 --> 02:38:40,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2258
02:38:42,117 --> 02:38:43,098
[SPEAKER_00]: It did the Mega Man 3 trick.

2259
02:38:43,238 --> 02:38:44,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh, did it cut off?

2260
02:38:45,658 --> 02:38:48,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, whoever... I have to explain this trick.

2261
02:38:48,679 --> 02:38:48,879
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2262
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:50,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Hurry, because we've got a call on the line.

2263
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll call her going.

2264
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:53,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2265
02:38:53,541 --> 02:38:53,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2266
02:38:54,895 --> 02:38:55,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

2267
02:38:56,056 --> 02:38:57,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, DJ Tyrant.

2268
02:38:57,036 --> 02:38:58,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard you on the show in a long time.

2269
02:38:58,217 --> 02:38:58,517
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?

2270
02:38:59,397 --> 02:39:00,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, not much.

2271
02:39:00,338 --> 02:39:02,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying out the Skype for iPhone app.

2272
02:39:02,279 --> 02:39:03,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to work pretty well.

2273
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, you're calling us from iPhone right now?

2274
02:39:06,181 --> 02:39:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2275
02:39:06,621 --> 02:39:08,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, not too shabby.

2276
02:39:08,202 --> 02:39:08,462
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2277
02:39:08,742 --> 02:39:10,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot that that's available now.

2278
02:39:10,263 --> 02:39:13,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So those of you with iPhones, you can Skype us during the show on your iPhones.

2279
02:39:13,385 --> 02:39:14,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for reminding us of that.

2280
02:39:14,505 --> 02:39:15,366
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to check that out.

2281
02:39:15,406 --> 02:39:16,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It only works on Wi-Fi, though.

2282
02:39:16,806 --> 02:39:17,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that.

2283
02:39:17,767 --> 02:39:18,147
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

2284
02:39:18,167 --> 02:39:22,669
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, your regular Skype will only work with an internet connection, too.

2285
02:39:23,069 --> 02:39:23,590
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

2286
02:39:23,610 --> 02:39:23,890
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

2287
02:39:25,104 --> 02:39:44,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just, I know it's all the talk of today, but DSi, I really enjoy mine personally, um, I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade, I got to play it last week, um, at an event I got invited to, and I don't know, I think it's pretty, a pretty good upgrade, but I can see, it's not for everyone, definitely, so.

2288
02:39:45,926 --> 02:39:47,428
[SPEAKER_13]: What about it makes it such a great upgrade?

2289
02:39:50,006 --> 02:39:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the screens.

2290
02:39:52,008 --> 02:39:53,450
[SPEAKER_05]: The controls are much better.

2291
02:39:53,470 --> 02:39:57,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The D-pad and the buttons just in general feel a lot better and more sturdy.

2292
02:39:58,815 --> 02:40:01,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the D-pad was really floaty on the Lite, I thought.

2293
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:07,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes I keep forgetting this is actually the third DS now we've gotten between DS Fat and DS Lite.

2294
02:40:07,964 --> 02:40:09,085
[SPEAKER_13]: I sometimes forget that.

2295
02:40:09,566 --> 02:40:11,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, do you still work in games retail?

2296
02:40:12,979 --> 02:40:13,520
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't.

2297
02:40:13,700 --> 02:40:14,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard too much.

2298
02:40:27,052 --> 02:40:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't really heard anything.

2299
02:40:29,534 --> 02:40:29,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry.

2300
02:40:30,414 --> 02:40:31,195
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad for asking.

2301
02:40:31,976 --> 02:40:33,437
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no worries.

2302
02:40:34,297 --> 02:40:38,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So, okay, well, so you're more of a fan of the DSi then.

2303
02:40:38,380 --> 02:40:39,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anything that you're looking forward to?

2304
02:40:40,141 --> 02:40:43,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, we've seen some announcements recently of the Zelda Spirit Tracks and so on.

2305
02:40:43,744 --> 02:40:45,785
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you looking forward to from Nintendo on DS?

2306
02:40:46,485 --> 02:40:48,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely the Zelda game.

2307
02:40:48,287 --> 02:40:54,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of, I honestly am looking forward to these new play control games because I missed out on them on the GameCube, so...

2308
02:40:56,314 --> 02:41:00,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of looking forward to them, and they're not too badly priced either, which is a good thing.

2309
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:01,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheap is good.

2310
02:41:01,861 --> 02:41:02,202
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

2311
02:41:02,222 --> 02:41:03,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheap is always a good thing.

2312
02:41:03,183 --> 02:41:03,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't mind that.

2313
02:41:04,264 --> 02:41:05,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, the DSiWare.

2314
02:41:05,987 --> 02:41:09,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that that takes off like the App Store has on the iPhone.

2315
02:41:10,312 --> 02:41:11,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not open, though.

2316
02:41:11,574 --> 02:41:14,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really going to, I think, hurt it in the long run, though.

2317
02:41:16,389 --> 02:41:28,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I tend to agree, but at the same time, it is a double-edged sword, and I could see the other side of the argument where, well, look at all the shit that's on the iPhone store, because there's some real crap apps on the iPhone.

2318
02:41:28,052 --> 02:41:31,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so hard to comb through there and find some decent games sometimes.

2319
02:41:31,673 --> 02:41:35,893
[SPEAKER_13]: And you think there's supposed to be some quality control out there, but it's not much.

2320
02:41:35,914 --> 02:41:37,134
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not much.

2321
02:41:37,174 --> 02:41:37,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2322
02:41:38,354 --> 02:41:48,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess maybe by closing it off, Nintendo will release quote-unquote quality apps on the DSi, but at the same time, some of these games don't sound that quality.

2323
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:51,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

2324
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:52,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anything on WiiWare you enjoy?

2325
02:41:52,482 --> 02:41:57,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we really enjoy the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

2326
02:41:58,203 --> 02:41:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: My Life as a King

2327
02:42:13,038 --> 02:42:16,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I agree with you that I really hope they have some sort of support like the PS3 and the PSP.

2328
02:42:40,631 --> 02:42:41,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a bad feeling.

2329
02:42:41,612 --> 02:42:42,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just dreaming with that.

2330
02:42:42,913 --> 02:42:44,755
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know it can be done.

2331
02:42:44,835 --> 02:42:48,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the Nintendo channel that streams DS demos to your DS.

2332
02:42:48,298 --> 02:42:49,018
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be done.

2333
02:42:49,058 --> 02:42:50,440
[SPEAKER_13]: They just don't want to do it.

2334
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:54,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Or they're leaving it in their hat to unveil at a later conference.

2335
02:42:54,503 --> 02:43:00,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that got me to buy Rhythm Heaven because they released a demo the day they gave it out at GDC.

2336
02:43:00,808 --> 02:43:01,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried and I was like, well,

2337
02:43:02,384 --> 02:43:03,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me on.

2338
02:43:27,419 --> 02:43:29,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of anything right now.

2339
02:43:49,694 --> 02:44:02,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, well, first of all, I'm... I'm burnt out on my 360, and second of all, I'm rejecting that, again, that, because, uh, for one month, because Operation Flashpoint, the new one's coming out, I think, next month.

2340
02:44:02,243 --> 02:44:03,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hold on, back up.

2341
02:44:03,404 --> 02:44:05,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't you the same guy that was having the points problems earlier?

2342
02:44:06,466 --> 02:44:06,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2343
02:44:06,846 --> 02:44:12,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so, obviously that's all fixed, and Nintendo, Xbox was very kind to you and all that.

2344
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:14,411
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you end up running out and buying with those points?

2345
02:44:15,952 --> 02:44:16,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I bought...

2346
02:44:18,075 --> 02:44:34,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Some rock band songs, my Call of Duty maps, and then with the extra points, I bought one rock band song and a pack of Burnout Cars that came with a Legendary Cars pack, which has like a DeLorean.

2347
02:44:34,509 --> 02:44:34,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2348
02:44:35,367 --> 02:44:35,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't Stop Believin'

2349
02:44:52,362 --> 02:44:53,023
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I didn't buy that.

2350
02:44:53,203 --> 02:44:53,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Fail.

2351
02:44:54,103 --> 02:45:09,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought Trash Unreal from Against Me, Come On, Come On from the Von Bondys, The Joker from Steve Miller, Sick, Sick, Sick from Queens of the Stone Age, and My Curse from Killswitch Engage.

2352
02:45:09,531 --> 02:45:13,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Now look, those songs are all fine and dandy, but it needs more epic classic rock.

2353
02:45:15,655 --> 02:45:19,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Thing is, I would buy classic rock, but there's no Led Zeppelin.

2354
02:45:21,791 --> 02:45:26,935
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of those bands that could put out their own game, like Aerosmith and Metallica.

2355
02:45:27,115 --> 02:45:28,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like Aerosmith.

2356
02:45:28,716 --> 02:45:29,837
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I hate Aerosmith.

2357
02:45:30,237 --> 02:45:33,079
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying, though, they were able to put out their own game.

2358
02:45:33,740 --> 02:45:35,721
[SPEAKER_13]: We can all argue about the success of that game.

2359
02:45:35,861 --> 02:45:37,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Leitzinger looks like a beat chick.

2360
02:45:37,642 --> 02:45:38,303
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, look.

2361
02:45:39,943 --> 02:45:42,185
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you really want to call in and talk about tonight?

2362
02:45:42,205 --> 02:45:44,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Operation Flashpoint.

2363
02:45:45,168 --> 02:45:46,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Dragon Rise or something.

2364
02:45:47,210 --> 02:45:48,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember the old Operation Flashpoint?

2365
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:50,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever play it?

2366
02:45:50,254 --> 02:45:51,435
[SPEAKER_11]: What system was it on?

2367
02:45:51,535 --> 02:45:52,456
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a PC game.

2368
02:45:52,796 --> 02:45:54,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was Xbox, I think.

2369
02:45:54,899 --> 02:45:55,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And Xbox, I mean.

2370
02:45:56,400 --> 02:45:59,021
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't recall this game, but I'm going to look up and see if I get screenshots.

2371
02:45:59,441 --> 02:46:01,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a very visual person, so sometimes that jogs my memory.

2372
02:46:02,082 --> 02:46:02,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I doubt it.

2373
02:46:02,602 --> 02:46:04,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Call of Duty type of game.

2374
02:46:04,482 --> 02:46:06,303
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a military simulator, actually.

2375
02:46:06,443 --> 02:46:11,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, from what I remember, it was one shot, pretty much.

2376
02:46:11,364 --> 02:46:12,005
[SPEAKER_11]: You were dead.

2377
02:46:16,086 --> 02:46:19,107
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, surprisingly enough, I think I saw this game once.

2378
02:46:20,717 --> 02:46:22,780
[SPEAKER_13]: So what about... Are they making a new one or what's up?

2379
02:46:23,761 --> 02:46:24,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sequel's coming out.

2380
02:46:25,002 --> 02:46:25,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's next month.

2381
02:46:26,344 --> 02:46:27,025
[SPEAKER_11]: End of next month?

2382
02:46:28,547 --> 02:46:30,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure though, but it's end of next month.

2383
02:46:30,809 --> 02:46:32,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising.

2384
02:46:33,313 --> 02:46:34,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and it's just like...

2385
02:46:36,075 --> 02:46:36,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like what I like.

2386
02:46:37,956 --> 02:46:45,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm this guy who wants these shooters that aren't, like, I'm tired of kind of seeing these really Call of Duty-esque Super Arcadia.

2387
02:46:45,979 --> 02:46:49,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I get shot, oh look, I sit in the corner, suck my thumb, I'm okay.

2388
02:46:51,021 --> 02:46:56,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this because it's like you get shot, you bleed out while moving around, or you're downed.

2389
02:46:56,783 --> 02:46:59,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love games because it has a medic system, that's simply it.

2390
02:47:02,079 --> 02:47:07,602
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a fan of shooters, and something that caught my eye this week was some of the screens from the new Wolfenstein game.

2391
02:47:07,882 --> 02:47:08,743
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think of that?

2392
02:47:10,003 --> 02:47:13,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a good... Oh, was that like... Jizz in my pants.

2393
02:47:13,385 --> 02:47:13,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2394
02:47:13,745 --> 02:47:16,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't going to say that, but there you go.

2395
02:47:16,827 --> 02:47:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks like crap.

2396
02:47:18,928 --> 02:47:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

2397
02:47:19,768 --> 02:47:23,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, can you play a gag in his mouth?

2398
02:47:23,370 --> 02:47:24,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, he's playing a game.

2399
02:47:25,751 --> 02:47:28,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Wolfenstein Enemy Territory was so great, and it was free, too.

2400
02:47:29,973 --> 02:47:31,154
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think of this new one?

2401
02:47:31,194 --> 02:47:32,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's Enemy Territory.

2402
02:47:33,055 --> 02:47:33,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

2403
02:47:33,715 --> 02:47:36,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it going to make everybody talk Wolfenstein again or what?

2404
02:47:36,977 --> 02:47:39,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like an updated version of Wolfenstein.

2405
02:47:39,118 --> 02:47:41,599
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like Wolfenstein to today's standards.

2406
02:47:41,739 --> 02:47:43,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironsight, sprinting, you know.

2407
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:46,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all I notice is they better keep it class-based.

2408
02:47:46,101 --> 02:47:57,487
[SPEAKER_11]: They better keep it class-based and they better keep in that objective online campaign stuff that I saw in Enemy Territory where I will go to a school, go up to the principal, hit him in the balls, and then laugh.

2409
02:47:58,741 --> 02:48:00,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And then go home and make yourself a sandwich.

2410
02:48:18,928 --> 02:48:20,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Wolfstein 3D.

2411
02:48:20,509 --> 02:48:22,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Wolfstein 3D or Wolfstein 2D?

2412
02:48:22,890 --> 02:48:24,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, not that old school.

2413
02:48:24,310 --> 02:48:26,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Wolfstein 3D.

2414
02:48:26,972 --> 02:48:28,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes and no.

2415
02:48:28,372 --> 02:48:35,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I do remember there being a robot, but maybe I just couldn't tell if it was Hitler because I was too stupid to know it was Hitler yet.

2416
02:48:35,355 --> 02:48:36,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, you know what?

2417
02:48:36,636 --> 02:48:39,037
[SPEAKER_13]: He wasn't the boss in the shareware one that most people played.

2418
02:48:39,077 --> 02:48:41,318
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to have the full one to see that.

2419
02:48:42,846 --> 02:48:43,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Hitler, Robot

2420
02:49:02,956 --> 02:49:11,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well we're going to need you to call back when that game comes out because I need to hear it from a shooter fan because I don't follow a lot of the shooters so I need to know if the game is worth crossing over for.

2421
02:49:12,238 --> 02:49:14,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Deathwishing, any final thoughts before we let you go?

2422
02:49:16,139 --> 02:49:17,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I still play Street Fighter 4.

2423
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:18,340
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still awesome.

2424
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:20,080
[SPEAKER_13]: It is still awesome.

2425
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:23,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Think they'll unveil any secret characters downloadable?

2426
02:49:23,481 --> 02:49:26,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they need to get that tournament mode out quicker.

2427
02:49:28,681 --> 02:49:40,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Deathwishing, we gotta let you go be careful when you threaten violence on the radio don't do it see you Deathwishing, take care buddy allegedly, bye hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2428
02:49:53,255 --> 02:50:02,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to get your input on the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate.

2429
02:50:03,782 --> 02:50:12,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, compared to Rock Band, do you think they're kind of whoring out Guitar Hero a little bit?

2430
02:50:12,607 --> 02:50:13,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just a bit.

2431
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:25,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're whoring it out a lot, but at the same time, they can kind of get away with it right now because, you know, Best Buys and all these stores have sections upon sections dedicated to these games because they sell.

2432
02:50:26,071 --> 02:50:28,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a big fan of the artist-based games.

2433
02:50:28,694 --> 02:50:29,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I am not a big fan of them.

2434
02:50:29,935 --> 02:50:32,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they need the big fanfare they're getting.

2435
02:50:32,678 --> 02:50:34,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was thinking more or less the same thing.

2436
02:50:34,858 --> 02:50:34,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean...

2437
02:51:02,293 --> 02:51:09,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's kind of a different genre altogether, you kind of saw the same thing with the Tony Hawk games.

2438
02:51:09,896 --> 02:51:18,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they were releasing iteration after iteration with that series, and basically look what happened to that series.

2439
02:51:18,759 --> 02:51:22,860
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people kind of gave up on that series in favor of skates.

2440
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, you can almost draw a few parallels between the Tony Hawk series and your Dark Hero almost.

2441
02:51:32,833 --> 02:51:33,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say this, though.

2442
02:51:34,033 --> 02:51:38,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Rock Band 2 has really succeeded with the store.

2443
02:51:38,634 --> 02:51:41,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's succeeded in a place where Guitar Hero hasn't.

2444
02:51:41,135 --> 02:51:50,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Granted, Guitar Hero has released a lot of downloadable content and songs, but the place where Rock Band 2 has got them is that they've done it consistently.

2445
02:51:50,457 --> 02:51:53,557
[SPEAKER_13]: They've consistently put out a lot of songs on their store.

2446
02:51:54,338 --> 02:52:00,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Very few games can I say that six months after release, I'm still playing it at least once a week.

2447
02:52:00,339 --> 02:52:01,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Very few games can I say that.

2448
02:52:03,211 --> 02:52:03,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2449
02:52:04,152 --> 02:52:12,938
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm checking the rock band store constantly, and to some degree, I even do the same with Guitar Hero.

2450
02:52:13,639 --> 02:52:30,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And occasionally, I do see some songs at the Guitar Hero store that I do like, like Black Melon's No Rain and whatnot, but compared to rock bands, Guitar Hero really doesn't have a whole lot of

2451
02:52:31,348 --> 02:52:35,029
[SPEAKER_04]: that I would consider going out and getting compared to Rockbean, you know?

2452
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:41,272
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, that's just me.

2453
02:52:41,512 --> 02:52:47,434
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in my opinion, it seems like Rockbean has a better selection of music, though.

2454
02:52:48,764 --> 02:53:10,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I think rock band's got the better music too, but I do understand that Guitar Hero has to lean towards more guitar-driven songs, and sometimes, you know, that might not necessarily be the same stuff I listen to, but I like rock band because you do more band-based songs, you know, and some have guitar solos, but some have drum solos, some have vocal, like Don't Stop Believin', not a song really notable for its good, well, it does have a pretty bitchin' guitar solo.

2455
02:53:11,013 --> 02:53:13,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really fucking hard on Rock Band Expert, by the way.

2456
02:53:13,815 --> 02:53:15,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't do that do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do part.

2457
02:53:16,176 --> 02:53:19,298
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, most people don't stop believing for the vocals.

2458
02:53:19,898 --> 02:53:22,820
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you don't really get songs like that in Rock Band.

2459
02:53:23,220 --> 02:53:25,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, in Guitar Hero.

2460
02:53:28,123 --> 02:53:36,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, now, with me, one thing I noticed is, well, kind of like you, I can't really do the expert level stuff yet.

2461
02:53:36,928 --> 02:53:39,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still just getting started on the

2462
02:53:39,602 --> 02:53:43,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The medium level, because I'm kind of new to the whole music-y thing.

2463
02:53:44,225 --> 02:54:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, at least with Guitar Hero, since they're more or less emulating rock band sets, you know, you would think that even though the name is Guitar Hero, they would encompass some other varieties of music, you know, guitar-heavy stuff, you know?

2464
02:54:09,116 --> 02:54:10,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know, though.

2465
02:54:10,758 --> 02:54:21,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero just... Guitar Hero feels like a bit of a scattered mess right now, and I hope if they're going to do another big Guitar Hero, what, five this year as their big game, I hope they find some focus.

2466
02:54:22,332 --> 02:54:24,694
[SPEAKER_13]: But Spaznir, we've got to let you go because we're running out of time.

2467
02:54:24,715 --> 02:54:26,857
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to end tonight so we can get to our afterbirth and so on.

2468
02:54:26,877 --> 02:54:29,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any quick final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

2469
02:54:30,504 --> 02:54:58,523
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, yeah, Final Fantasy, you know, Eleven Rules, Wild Sox, no, just kidding, just kidding, yeah, yeah, alright, get off the show, alright, see you Spazinator, thanks for the call, alright, have a good one, alright, bye, uh, by the way, I didn't mention during my gaming week this week, um, I actually went back to, um, World of Warcraft this week, because I'm a big fat addict, but I haven't been playing that much, look, we got one more call coming in, I want to take it, because I noticed it was a name I haven't heard from in a while, I want to let him on the show, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2470
02:54:59,252 --> 02:55:00,512
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Brad from PodCulture.

2471
02:55:27,572 --> 02:55:28,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe so, yeah.

2472
02:55:28,233 --> 02:55:29,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, then I'm going to have to go check that out.

2473
02:55:29,514 --> 02:55:32,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, look, I know you didn't call to talk about Dollhouse, although you probably would anyway.

2474
02:55:32,798 --> 02:55:34,460
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you call in to talk about tonight, Brad?

2475
02:55:35,781 --> 02:55:45,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I don't know if you'd mentioned it on the show before, but I've got an iPhone game that is just great.

2476
02:55:45,732 --> 02:55:46,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, what's that?

2477
02:55:47,116 --> 02:55:48,676
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Zombieville, USA.

2478
02:55:49,617 --> 02:55:50,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm interested already.

2479
02:55:50,997 --> 02:55:52,298
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in Zombieville, USA?

2480
02:55:52,858 --> 02:55:58,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just this little side-scroller cartoony shooting zombies game.

2481
02:55:58,499 --> 02:56:01,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Three simple controls, right, left, and you tap in the middle and you shoot.

2482
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a bloody game?

2483
02:56:03,281 --> 02:56:05,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get decapitated zombies and all that fun stuff?

2484
02:56:06,222 --> 02:56:07,402
[SPEAKER_09]: You do, but it's kind of cartoony.

2485
02:56:08,617 --> 02:56:10,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I can deal with cartoon violence.

2486
02:56:10,598 --> 02:56:11,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like blood orgy.

2487
02:56:11,578 --> 02:56:13,439
[SPEAKER_13]: We already had the blood orgy discussion earlier in the show.

2488
02:56:13,479 --> 02:56:15,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Cartoony violence, especially with zombies, is okay.

2489
02:56:16,360 --> 02:56:16,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's great.

2490
02:56:17,741 --> 02:56:24,364
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much the same level over and over, but at the NH level, you can find cash, you upgrade your weapons.

2491
02:56:25,284 --> 02:56:26,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a cost with said game?

2492
02:56:27,505 --> 02:56:28,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like two or three bucks.

2493
02:56:28,825 --> 02:56:29,426
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not that bad.

2494
02:56:29,606 --> 02:56:32,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a demo or a movie or anything I can see online to get a taste for it?

2495
02:56:34,665 --> 02:56:36,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not 100% certain.

2496
02:56:36,126 --> 02:56:36,967
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not the developer.

2497
02:56:36,987 --> 02:56:38,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I shouldn't grill you on this stuff.

2498
02:56:38,188 --> 02:56:40,450
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious how you found it.

2499
02:56:40,470 --> 02:56:40,870
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

2500
02:56:42,191 --> 02:56:45,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Check that out if you're interested in some zombie killing.

2501
02:56:45,714 --> 02:56:50,618
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to hear about some good iPhone games, especially when we're talking about all the crap that's out there on the marketplace as well.

2502
02:56:52,199 --> 02:56:55,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good way to waste a lot of time.

2503
02:56:55,951 --> 02:57:01,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I've wasted a lot of time with some of those games like WordFu and some of those iPhone games they have.

2504
02:57:01,956 --> 02:57:05,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Great time wasters, especially when I'm lying in bed but I don't want to go to sleep just yet.

2505
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:09,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll reach over and grab my phone and play a couple games and it'll make me tired.

2506
02:57:10,824 --> 02:57:12,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Brad, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up.

2507
02:57:12,285 --> 02:57:13,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Any quick final thoughts for our listeners?

2508
02:57:14,327 --> 02:57:14,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Later on.

2509
02:57:15,488 --> 02:57:16,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Any final thoughts?

2510
02:57:17,990 --> 02:57:18,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

2511
02:57:19,071 --> 02:57:20,772
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll take care and have a good one, buddy.

2512
02:57:22,389 --> 02:57:22,649
[SPEAKER_13]: PodCulture

2513
02:57:53,926 --> 02:57:57,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Design Lessons Learned From Rock Band

2514
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:34,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting though because he then released a PDF version or they released a PDF version of the session and all the slides are on there and it had an earlier version of the slide that had been omitted from the actual show and it reveals Lego Rock Band.

2515
02:58:36,601 --> 02:58:37,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about this.

2516
02:58:38,618 --> 02:58:42,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Tigerclaw sent me a link to this, and I neglected to get to it in the Twitter part, but okay.

2517
02:58:43,321 --> 02:58:44,242
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting, though.

2518
02:58:44,262 --> 02:58:49,765
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also mentioning that the PSP rock band is on there as well, the Beatles rock band.

2519
02:58:50,526 --> 02:58:54,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's a ton of Guitar Hero stuff, which really horned that stuff out.

2520
02:58:55,709 --> 02:59:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have Guitar Hero Modern Hits, Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits, Guitar Hero Arcade,

2521
02:59:05,996 --> 02:59:09,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero Band Hero Guitar Hero Mobile 2 and Mystery Game

2522
02:59:32,287 --> 02:59:40,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's not exactly the way they go, but the way I look at it, it's a way to introduce Rock Band to younger kids, and you don't have to buy it.

2523
02:59:40,469 --> 02:59:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's going to have songs in there that you're really probably going to need to buy, just that are only going to be available in LEGO Rock Band.

2524
02:59:48,732 --> 02:59:51,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the Guitar Hero games, you can't port that shit over.

2525
02:59:51,973 --> 02:59:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy Metallica, well, those Metallica songs are stuck on Metallica Games, so you can't really bring that over.

2526
02:59:59,284 --> 03:00:23,986
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is where the developers kind of differ the most you know that's why I kind of respect Rock Band a little bit more because at least if you're going to put out you know a song or and they do do their track packs obviously though those are also optional since they're all available online it's an option you don't have to buy it but if you do buy it you can import it into your game and it all seamlessly works whereas Guitar Hero I gotta have a stack of discs

2527
03:00:26,155 --> 03:00:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2528
03:00:27,175 --> 03:00:28,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's it for that story, at least.

2529
03:00:30,097 --> 03:00:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: We also talked a little bit about Unreal Tournament 3 and how they had a mod for that to play in another video game, like Sonic the Hedgehog.

2530
03:00:37,460 --> 03:00:43,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Team Fortress 2, someone's made a map that's sort of like a Mario Kart track, which is kind of neat.

2531
03:00:43,363 --> 03:00:46,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's definitely not based on a real Mario Kart track.

2532
03:00:46,364 --> 03:00:47,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of has the graphics of it.

2533
03:00:48,245 --> 03:00:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

2534
03:00:51,146 --> 03:00:52,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see here.

2535
03:00:55,225 --> 03:00:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another website, I guess, WeOperaSDK.com.

2536
03:01:00,230 --> 03:01:13,061
[SPEAKER_02]: They've released a tweeter, which is a Wii rapid blogging... I don't know if it's... I'm assuming it's like Twitter, but it's their own website that's formatted for the Wii.

2537
03:01:14,462 --> 03:01:14,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

2538
03:01:16,184 --> 03:01:18,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Could have been that DSi message board, right?

2539
03:01:19,086 --> 03:01:19,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Could have been.

2540
03:01:20,189 --> 03:01:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I guess they're going to have different things that they've incorporated to this.

2541
03:01:25,575 --> 03:01:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: IRC style commands, smileys, possible integration with the WeMessage board, I guess email updates or something like that, web skinning, that sort of stuff.

2542
03:01:36,806 --> 03:01:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That's neat.

2543
03:01:39,508 --> 03:01:39,909
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

2544
03:01:42,305 --> 03:01:46,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well we need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up the show tonight.

2545
03:01:46,268 --> 03:01:51,911
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, you've been awfully quiet over there in the corner, poking away, talking to some of our AIM listeners and so on.

2546
03:01:52,271 --> 03:01:53,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Any final thoughts tonight?

2547
03:01:54,533 --> 03:01:54,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Yawn?

2548
03:01:54,953 --> 03:01:55,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Nap?

2549
03:01:56,774 --> 03:01:57,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think you're going to nap.

2550
03:01:57,694 --> 03:01:59,836
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go and lie down, you're going to go to sleep.

2551
03:02:00,623 --> 03:02:01,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty tired.

2552
03:02:01,984 --> 03:02:03,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent three and a half hours in Ikea.

2553
03:02:04,185 --> 03:02:04,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

2554
03:02:04,845 --> 03:02:06,966
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to eat and the intention was to spend two.

2555
03:02:07,487 --> 03:02:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we ran into some people that Becky knew because I went with Becky.

2556
03:02:12,549 --> 03:02:14,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And I sort of know one of them.

2557
03:02:14,891 --> 03:02:17,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But Swedish meatballs.

2558
03:02:17,912 --> 03:02:18,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And shiny.

2559
03:02:18,532 --> 03:02:19,233
[SPEAKER_13]: And Swedish meatballs.

2560
03:02:19,473 --> 03:02:20,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what I had.

2561
03:02:20,774 --> 03:02:21,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was shiny.

2562
03:02:21,554 --> 03:02:22,575
[SPEAKER_07]: There was so much shiny.

2563
03:02:22,635 --> 03:02:23,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I kept going, ooh, shiny.

2564
03:02:24,115 --> 03:02:24,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, shiny.

2565
03:02:24,856 --> 03:02:26,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And then staring at stuff.

2566
03:02:26,196 --> 03:02:27,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ikea, evil.

2567
03:02:28,838 --> 03:02:29,078
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2568
03:02:30,730 --> 03:02:38,336
[SPEAKER_13]: TheDokta, thank you so much for being here tonight and you definitely joined in on the conversation and we always appreciate having you here on the show.

2569
03:02:38,376 --> 03:02:39,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Please come back again.

2570
03:02:39,858 --> 03:02:41,979
[SPEAKER_13]: And thanks for participating in tonight's listless and all that fun stuff.

2571
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:43,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

2572
03:02:44,862 --> 03:02:45,983
[SPEAKER_13]: In honor of Rice Princess.

2573
03:02:46,663 --> 03:02:47,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Poop.

2574
03:02:48,339 --> 03:02:49,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is she here tonight?

2575
03:02:49,640 --> 03:02:50,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Shame on her.

2576
03:02:50,080 --> 03:02:50,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2577
03:02:50,380 --> 03:02:51,881
[SPEAKER_13]: She didn't get my text.

2578
03:02:51,981 --> 03:02:52,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get your text either.

2579
03:02:52,922 --> 03:02:54,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you need to check your cell phone company.

2580
03:02:54,883 --> 03:02:55,944
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to call them and yell at them.

2581
03:02:57,164 --> 03:03:00,426
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is I need food.

2582
03:03:00,526 --> 03:03:01,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very hungry.

2583
03:03:01,547 --> 03:03:03,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm dying of hunger pains.

2584
03:03:04,569 --> 03:03:05,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your final thought.

2585
03:03:06,610 --> 03:03:06,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2586
03:03:07,010 --> 03:03:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything.

2587
03:03:08,871 --> 03:03:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, aren't you boring.

2588
03:03:10,194 --> 03:03:10,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am.

2589
03:03:11,175 --> 03:03:11,936
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Ninja Blade?

2590
03:03:11,956 --> 03:03:13,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been playing that for like three hours now during the show.

2591
03:03:14,117 --> 03:03:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frustrating because you die pretty easy in it, so it's hard.

2592
03:03:18,942 --> 03:03:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm playing on normal difficulty in it.

2593
03:03:21,344 --> 03:03:34,495
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, as you probably saw, there was a glitch, a level ending glitch where I couldn't defeat the boss because he ran out of life and I just sat there slashing at the dead corpse and it wouldn't trigger the event that I needed it to trigger.

2594
03:03:35,055 --> 03:03:36,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to restart there, but...

2595
03:03:38,362 --> 03:03:39,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's alright.

2596
03:03:40,106 --> 03:03:40,527
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

2597
03:03:40,627 --> 03:03:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a lot of really over-the-top stuff going on, but it's a neat game.

2598
03:03:46,120 --> 03:03:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably finish it.

2599
03:03:48,662 --> 03:03:49,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2600
03:03:50,242 --> 03:03:50,482
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2601
03:03:50,602 --> 03:03:53,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2602
03:03:53,103 --> 03:03:57,144

[SPEAKER_13]: Or hey, there's other ways you can do that too.

2606
03:04:03,245 --> 03:04:06,945
[SPEAKER_13]: You can post a kind review, a five-star review on iTunes.

2607
03:04:06,985 --> 03:04:09,226
[SPEAKER_13]: That helps sell the show and bumps up our ranking a little bit.

2608
03:04:09,586 --> 03:04:11,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Or mention us on your Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff.

2609
03:04:12,006 --> 03:04:14,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at Twitter right now and looking at some of the at OLR messages.

2610
03:04:15,427 --> 03:04:18,188
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ratchet says, I'm listening to OLR and laughing my butt off.

2611
03:04:18,248 --> 03:04:20,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I laughed a lot tonight too, so thank you.

2612
03:04:20,709 --> 03:04:22,990
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Tyrant is pimping his appearance on the show tonight.

2613
03:04:23,010 --> 03:04:23,851
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate that.

[SPEAKER_13]: We do it for you guys for free every week.

2617
03:04:31,654 --> 03:04:33,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll do it all again next week.

2618
03:04:33,074 --> 03:04:33,875
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that sound?

2619
03:04:35,171 --> 03:04:36,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

2620
03:04:37,234 --> 03:04:37,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

2621
03:04:38,014 --> 03:04:38,755
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Easter.

2622
03:04:38,956 --> 03:04:39,456
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just tired.

2623
03:04:39,476 --> 03:04:39,917
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2624
03:04:40,197 --> 03:04:42,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll see you in one week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2625

[SPEAKER_13]: She's DarkSakura.

2627
03:04:45,163 --> 03:04:45,824
[SPEAKER_13]: He's Loki.

2628
03:04:45,924 --> 03:04:46,905
[SPEAKER_13]: He's the Dokta.

2629
03:04:46,925 --> 03:04:47,486
