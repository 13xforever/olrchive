00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco, here!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, April 26, 2009.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could a popular MMO be coming to the iPhone?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Microsoft promises a barrage of games for Japan.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And the first details are announced for PAX 2009.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Leading in through the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, welcome back, DarkSakura.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How are you?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I left my lungs at Disneyland.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, how was Disneyland?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh my god!

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
It was Disneyland, right?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Oh, it was fun, and they have a new game, which I will touch on in my gaming week.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I think I might know what you're talking about, so I won't talk about it too, but it's the same one I remember.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh my god!

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Alright, and also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
He was picking off pickles off of his double cheeseburger.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Why, are you not a pickle fan? Did you specifically ask no pickles and they gave you a different one?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, I never do, because then that means they have to take longer.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, I see. So you just pick them off?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yes.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Interesting. I kind of do the same thing with tomatoes, actually.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Alright, and hello to you. How was your week? Everything good?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
It was busy.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Alright, and joining us in the studio tonight, we have some special guests with us tonight.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Say hello to the doctor.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm the doctor.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
How are you? How have you been? You've been a little while since you've been here.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
It's been like a couple weeks, but yeah, I'm doing really good.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Woo!

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
A couple weeks is a long time, and Rice Princess is here too.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I don't think I can get the mic all the way over there, but say hello to Rice Princess is here.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hi.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I don't know if you can hear that at all.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
They are controlling the game that's playing right now on our Justin TV feed.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
We don't have a new game, which is a little erratic tonight.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I apologize, guys. It's running off of Wi-Fi, so it's a little bit eh.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
But they are playing right now Rescue Rangers on the 8-bit Nintendo.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Since we didn't have anything new to show tonight, we decided to have an old school night.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
They are not. They're playing it on the Dreamcast.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, yeah, they're playing it so that they can switch to other games if they want to play something else really easy.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Loki was not able to bring Excitebots tonight, which we were hoping to look at.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
What happened, Loki?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, I knew. I wasn't going to take it away from my wife.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
She's been playing it constantly, so, you know, she'd be pissed off.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So it's past the wife test?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, it's past the wife test.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
All right, well, we'll hear a little more about your gaming week in just a little bit.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But let's get into it. How was your gaming week?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
We'll start off with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I actually didn't play much of anything because of, you know, school.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
But I did go to Disneyland, and I played, I'm going to call this a video game,

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
because really it's sort of like a midway game meets a video game,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
was the new Toy Story ride over at California Adventure.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
It's so much fun. I went on that one. I went March, yes.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Okay, now I have to lead up to this.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
I was convinced, well, I had said the next time I go to Disneyland,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I was going to go on Tower of Terror.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
And I sat between Tiara and Marissa,

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
and Marissa kept saying that I would like, that I would be okay on the drops

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
and that the part that would scare me would be the lead up.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, the lead up was the fun part, and the drop freaked me the hell out,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
to the point that the only thing I could say on the entire ride was,

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm not doing this again, or I hate this, or something like that.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And then I didn't make any more noise until I was off of it

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and almost throwing up when I got outside.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Because I will tell everybody right now, my fear is falling.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Not high places, not motion, it's falling.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
The Tower of Terror is really freaking scary.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I have been in an elevator when it fell two feet before,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
so no, Jamie doesn't do this.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So I was actually so freaked out that I was actually going to go on

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
California Screamin', and I was actually relieved when the line was closed.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And, by the way, I want to give a shout out to Pete and Jasmine,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
who hung out with us and were really awesome while we were there.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But, okay, back now to the story.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
So they're like, let's go on Toy Story.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
They're like, okay, let's go on Toy Story.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
So Toy Story, it's like you wear 3D glasses,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
like the same kinds you wear at the Muppet Show thing.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And then you stop in front of these screens, and you have these guns

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
that are the pop gun that you pull the big string on over and over again,

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
and you fire out 3D ammunition at targets on the screen.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
You're basically having to flick your wrist back and forth

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
as fast as possible to pull the string.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
So men are better at it.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, men have a distinct advantage at this game.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I made a good score.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Actually, I've got my score because I wrote it.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I took a picture of my score.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Are you really good at flicking your wrist back and forth real quick?

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, you know, I am married.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
But what kind of games are you playing with?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Like I remember there was like a ring toss game and a pop-up balloon.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I love the army men game where you have to shoot down the army men

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
as they jump out.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
But there's also the pie toss.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
There's just shooting plates.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The plate one was fun, except the ride stopped,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
so we were shooting plates for zero points.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I was practicing my aim.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And it was just really cool.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There were all sorts of little mini games to do on it.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
But my score for the first time playing it was 114,400.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And on top of that, you know what my animal was?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
It was a beaver.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And as Game Guru says in the chat,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
they're putting it out on the Wii as a Wii game.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Are they?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yes.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
And it will be in 3D.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Dude, yes.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
That's kind of awesome, I have to say.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
But I have to tell you, Rob,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
did you notice this when you came out of the ride?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
What is it?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
When you walk out of the ride, if you look to the left

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
where the little desk and everything is and the room setting,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
it shows the cutout box.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
That's the ride that you're on.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It's like a paper box you set up in Inside Midway.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And if you look at the wallpaper that's inside the ride,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
it's got little tabs and stuff

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
and instructions for where you stick everything,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
like old paper doll houses.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
It's an old Midway ride, like a child's Midway ride.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It's pretty cool.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, it was a great ride.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
So real-life gaming, basically, this week.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
So it was a lot of fun.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
And then I came back and real-life intruded itself.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Loki did mention the chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
if you want to join us live for this chat.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And of course, there was that comment from Game Guru earlier.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Also, DarkTetsuya,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I still want that Mr. Toad's Wild Ride racing game.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That would be pretty awesome.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Only if you go to hell.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
SSJ100Matt says...

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I mean, in the game, not you go to hell.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
How dare you tell our listeners to go to hell, DarkSakura?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You're gone for a week and you think you run the world.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I do.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
SSJ100Matt says they need to have a Rad Racer remake that's 3D.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Just like the first one.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Alright, so DarkSakura played Disneyland for a gaming week.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I played lots of Excitebots trick racing.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
In fact, I finished the Excite race mode,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and now I'm in Super Excite race mode.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And it's really...

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, it's about as hard as the first game.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Now, the game is really awesome itself,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
but I don't care for some of their changes that they made.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Like, they have these stunt bars, basically,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
that you have to grab and you can swing around.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
They're gold ones that you swing around a few times

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
and then you just launch off and you get stars.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And then every track has a red bar

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
that you have to swing around and spin ten times.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And I guess they're kind of neat,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
you know, to keep with the whole trick racing thing,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
but I think it should be optional because

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
the red bar kind of breaks up the whole race.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You're going really fast, really fast,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
and then you go swing around this stupid bar ten times

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
and then you boost off of it again.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't know, it's just a minor annoyance.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But other than that, the game's pretty fun.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
If you're a fan of Excite Truck, you're going to love this game.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Definitely the way to go.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
They have all the original tracks, actually,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
from the old Excite Truck game in this one,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
except they're kind of tweaked a little bit.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
But all the original tracks are in there,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
and plus they have a bunch of new ones.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
And also, what was I going to say,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
no support, unfortunately, for custom music,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
which kind of sucks, but the music that's in the game

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
is not as annoying as the last game.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
And I don't know, it's pretty hard,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
but most of the Excite Truck games,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
if you're going to try to actually S-rank the courses,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
then yeah, you're going to have to play it a few times

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
to actually be able to do it perfectly.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
But it's fun, lots of air.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, I remember another gripe I had about that.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
There's an icon that you can get that looks like a wrench

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
that puts you into leg mode, as they put it.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And in order to run in leg mode,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
you have to shake the controller back and forth.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You kind of have to tilt it like a seesaw.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, that's great, except for the fact that you have to

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
actually use the controller to steer,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
so you're kind of going all over the place.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So I don't really agree with the decision to control it that way.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Maybe even tapping A or just shaking the controller

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
like normal would be cool, but whatever.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
That's the way they did it and kind of get over it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
But yeah, the game's really weird.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I made a Super Sandwich, so it's awesome.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Other than that, I played Rhythm Heaven on the DS,

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
which is definitely a fun music microgame collection,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
very similar to the WarioWare stuff

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
because it's made by the same people.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
The thing is, though, is it's very strict on accuracy.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So if you're not accurate in that,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
or if you're just a little bit off,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
it's going to penalize you big time.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
So that kind of sucked, but fun game overall.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
The other thing that I played, more Grand Theft Auto,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I was actually messing around with the PC version again,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
editing some stuff, and I got cars to bounce into the sky

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
really far and come down and explode,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
so that was kind of fun.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And I downloaded the new download content for Saints Row 2,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
so hopefully I can get to play that this week.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
And yeah, that's pretty much it, I think, for my gaming week.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
All right, sounds pretty good.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Nothing else? Anything you're looking forward to in this next week, Logie?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Nope, not this week.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Nothing coming out really worthwhile, at least.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Basically, yeah, it's just X-Men Origins,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
which doesn't look bad.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
It's just not something I'd plan on picking up unless I get it for free.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And the other game I was waiting for, unfortunately,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I delayed to the end of next month, so I had to have Fuel,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
which was originally supposed to be coming out in two weeks,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
but now it's not until four weeks.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
All right.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's see, we'll get to the Doctor and the Rice Princess

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
and their gaming weeks momentarily,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
except now they're playing what?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
You switched guides. You guys have been switching games.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I saw Contra flash by for a minute,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
but now you're on, what, Double Dragon 2?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
All right, fine.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
It's pretty easy.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I haven't been playing a whole lot this week besides World of Warcraft,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
because they had the new patch not that long ago,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
so I had to check out Ulduar.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I finally got to check out this week,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
although we didn't get very far.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We wiped on Razor Scale,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
which is the second boss in there after a couple of attempts,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
but I thought the Flame Leviathan fight was a lot of fun.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
They've really incorporated vehicles now into the raids,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
which is kind of interesting

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
because the first fight you actually do on the vehicles,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
and it's kind of cool because I was driving around on a motorcycle,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
and having to pick up the people that were getting launched from the cannons,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
yes, you can launch yourself from a cannon onto the back of the boss to fight it,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
and then the boss throws you off,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
and you have to get picked up in a motorcycle

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
and get carried back to the cannon.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
So it's really intricate.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It's kind of neat what they've done in Warcraft with this,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
although I can say that, but at the same time say,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't know, I wish this boss wasn't a mandatory boss

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
because the lead up to it with the vehicle stuff

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
that takes about 20, 30 minutes to get through is kind of annoying.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I would only want to do that once.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I would want to have to do the clear every time to get to Flame Leviathan.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I think that's going to get annoying, but okay, whatevs.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I've also been leveling an alt, so it's been a pretty wildtastic week.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I haven't really been touching the consoles that much.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I played a little bit of Outrun,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
but not enough for me to say a whole lot about it besides,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
thankfully there's a cartoon arcade-style racing game on Xbox 360

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I enjoy right now because pretty much all we've had otherwise

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
is more realistic type of racing games, and that's really it.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
There hasn't been a whole lot otherwise.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Rock Band 2, I've been playing a lot of Rock Band still.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That game's getting a lot of value even today.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So that's really it for my gaming week.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
The Doctor, Rice Princess,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
anything you guys have been playing in your gaming week

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
besides what you're doing right now? The Doctor?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
No, not really. I've been making movies.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You've been making movies, dirty movies?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Of course dirty movies.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So nothing that you've been really playing lately.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I know you're a big Nintendo fanboy.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Is there anything you're looking forward to on the Wii?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Definitely the Wii Motion Plus.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
All right. Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
What have you been up to?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Playing well.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
How's your Warcraft week going?

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
It's Noble Garden, so that's it.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
That's right, there's a new holiday.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
This is a new holiday in World of Warcraft, right?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
What do you do in the Noble Garden event?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Explain to our listeners Rice Princess.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Put the damn game on pause.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
It's the Easter stuff that they couldn't update in time

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
or something, I don't remember.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
All right, she's busy playing Double Dragon.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
All right, you go around and you hunt for eggs.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I kind of thought it was stupid.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I played it for about five minutes.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I thought it was stupid.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You're full of crap.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Why are you saying I'm full of crap?

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
All right, Rice Princess is screaming at me.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
She has no microphone.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
There you go.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here in just a moment.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Again, if you want to join us live, chat.orangeontrader.com

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
is the place to be.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You can also follow us on Twitter at OLR,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
and we're looking at your tweets during the show.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And thanks to you guys who have been saying stuff

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
to kind of help plug the show.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I saw some retweets from Act Deaf and Gold Anthro.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Thank you guys very much over on Twitter.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Also, housekeeping, housekeeping.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
We have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm very excited.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
In a couple weeks, I will be in Chicago.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
I am going to Anime Central, ASEN for short.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm going to this convention,

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
and I will be doing a panel Friday at 4.30 in panel room 7?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Consult your program.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
So You Think You Can Podcast is the name of the panel,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
and I'll be talking about my seven years of experience

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
that I have in internet broadcasting

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
and talking about how Orange Launch Radio started as a podcast

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
and what you can do if you're curious about starting a podcast

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
or maintaining a podcast or selling your podcast, et cetera, et cetera.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So I'm really excited to be there.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I know we have a lot of listeners in that kind of area around Chicago

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
and the Midwest that go to this convention,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
so I'm excited to finally meet a lot of you.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
So please come to the panel if you're going to be there Friday at 4.30,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Anime Central.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Also, next week on the program,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
you heard us tease this a little bit last week,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
but next week on the program,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
we're very excited because we're going to be giving away...

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
That's right, that's Smile DK.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
We have an autographed copy

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
of one of the Dance Dance Revolution games on,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I believe it's Supernova 2,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Dance Dance Revolution, autographed by Smile DK

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
that we're giving away on the show next week.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So that should be pretty awesome.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Live or podcast, either way.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
So you can listen to that and win it live.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It was signed at SakuraCon.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Thanks to the awesome breast lol for getting that for us.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
So next week on the show, if you want to tune in live or in podcast form,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and I'll give you more details next week,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
you'll have two weeks to do it.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Question from chat.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Will you be recording the panel at ASEN?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
If I can.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
It's not really about Orange Lounge Radio, though,

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
so I don't know if we'll put it on the podcast feed if we can do it,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
but maybe like a bonus thing.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I would love to tape it if we can.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
If nothing else, I'll have someone videotape it,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
and I can dump the audio or something.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
We'll figure something out.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Also, I want to say this.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
This is very, very, very, very, very, very, very important.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I want to say a huge thank you to all the listeners.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't know if everybody in studio saw,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
but there is a bunch of boxes sitting in the house.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
There's a new used computer.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
What do I mean by new used?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
It's a refurbed computer.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
The listeners pulled together money.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I don't know if you remember our meltdown on air two weeks ago

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
when everything broke, but the listeners pulled together

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and got us a new computer that we can use for the show.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Sweet.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's very, very exciting.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
We weren't able to put it all together for tonight.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Thank you, guys.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah, I mean, obviously, huge, huge amounts of thanks.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Obviously, with us having probably a little break in a couple weeks

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
with me being off in the Midwest,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
we'll probably have a lot of time to put that together

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
and get it up and running

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and hopefully have some fun new stuff for the show.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
So thank you, guys, so much for that.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
That's very exciting, very, very exciting.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, now I feel like I have to get naked or something.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
No, I'm kidding.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
All right.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Thank you for everyone.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Let's see.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Actually, they say it's all new parts in chat.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I'm going to be honest.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I haven't cracked open the boxes.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I've just got them all,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
so I don't really know what we do and we don't have yet.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I just know it's computer bits, and the whole computer is there,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
so I want to say thanks again, everybody.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
All right.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't think there's anything else, really.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You follow us on Facebook, MySpace.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Does anyone use MySpace anymore?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Anyone?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I don't think so.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Stalkers.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, if you're there, you can get us on Orange Lounge Radio there.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
But we're not on Craigslist because that's where the murderers are.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
That's the one social site that we're not on is Craigslist.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't know.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Maybe we should have an O.L. Army on Craigslist.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
I bought my first Xbox 360 in Craigslist.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
But didn't you have to pay a huge markup for that?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Yes.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Nice.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Also, one other announcement I know that needs to be made

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
before we get into tonight's gaming news.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Loki mentioned something on his Twitter this week,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
and I'm not sure if all the listeners got an opportunity to see this

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
because not all the listeners are on Twitter.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Why don't you share what your announcement is, Loki?

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Well, my announcement is that my wife is pregnant with twins.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Congratulations.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Wow, that's pretty amazing.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
So, December.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
We're on Hanukkah.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Well, actually, because it's twins.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Twins are usually delivered earlier, so Hanukkah, Thanksgiving-ish.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Wow.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, congratulations.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
That's so awesome.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And obviously the show will continue.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Get her a doula.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The show will continue, you guys.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Even if Loki's going to be out for a little while, we'll figure something out.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
No, I was thinking Skyping it or something,

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
because obviously I'm not going to leave my wife home alone with two kids

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
by herself for the first few weeks or so.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
We will figure something out.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We've got plenty of time to figure it out.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm going to leave my husband alone with my kid.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It's not even a worry right now.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And the other thing, too, is we're going to be getting a house, actually.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Oh, my gosh.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
We've already had our offer accepted.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
We did the walk-through on yesterday, and it looked good.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
So we're assuming.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't think anything's going to go wrong,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
because we know what condition the roof is in, basically.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
So probably, yeah, we'll be probably moving into a house by the end of next month.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, my gosh, I didn't know the house was that far along.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, that's great, especially with twins on the way.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yes, definitely.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And I've never known anyone that had twins, so that's kind of fun.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
That's fertility drugs for you.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Small word of advice, check your pipes in the house.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, we have an inspector.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
And Nellie should check her lady pipes, too, for the twins.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Comments, of course, lots and lots of congrats in our chat room.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
You're in there, Loki.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I won't read them all for you, but some of the funnier ones.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Amaze Satsuma says, Loki is about to have eight crazy nights.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I think there's going to be more than eight of those.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Frisbee says you should try and make it happen on the 20th of November.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Lol.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Can I say the names?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The babies will come out when they come out.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I don't know.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Nellie doesn't want to do the one anymore.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Originally, she was really fond of the name Max.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And I was like, OK, that's cool.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm all, how about naming the other one Sam?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
And she's like, OK.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I was like, Sam, Max, sweet.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
If you name your twins Sam and Max, I'm going to laugh for a week.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
I might literally die of laughter if you name the twins Sam and Max.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
She doesn't want to name the one Max because she doesn't want to name the baby.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Actually, Max has to be the longer version of the name.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And Maximilian, you know, that would be kind of...

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You don't know if they're going to be boys or girls yet, do you?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
No, we don't know.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
So it could be Maxine and Samantha.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That would be cool.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
We don't know.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah, we're not going to know what the sex of the babies are for a few months.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Because she's only like eight weeks along right now.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Right, right.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
We know early because...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Actually, we didn't know it was going to be twins until last week.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Because we had to go in because she had cramping in her side or whatever.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And so she wanted to make sure everything was OK.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
And so they did ultrasounds and stuff.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
And they saw...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
First, you know, the woman didn't see any heartbeats at all.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And then they found one.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And then we went to radiology.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
And then they found a second one.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
They're like, OK, there's two.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
So, yeah, I mean, it's still a ways off.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
We actually have our first real doctor's visit in two weeks.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
So we get to see them slightly more growing up, I guess.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
But, yeah, not until...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
But remember, there's still tadpoles.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Not until, like, you know, August or so.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
We know the sex of them.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
We're going to find out for sure.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room says,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Sam and Max would be better than Ratchet and Clank as names.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
So there you go.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
That's true.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
And, chat, he is not really going to name them Sam and Max

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
just to get a goddamn gift from the makers of the game, OK?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I wonder, though, if I...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
These are children you're talking about.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
When I have mine, if I name it Richter or Annette,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
if Konami would give me a present.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah, she really will name the damn kid Richter.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Konami will give you a present, all right.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
They'll sue you.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Dan and I decided, like, ten years ago,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
before I ever even thought of wanting children,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
that if we had a boy, his name was Richter.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
No, she, OK, she keeps...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
My wife keeps suggesting the name Mason.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And I'm like, Mason is a stupid name.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I have a friend named Mason.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Mason's my little brother-in-law's name.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
God, everybody names their kids Mason.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Wait a minute, he might actually listen to this show, you ass.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm sorry, it's a horrible name.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And no, Mario doesn't work because we're not Italian, so...

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
All right.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
We'll figure out names later.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
You know what's funny is that I have toyed around

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
the idea of naming a boy Strider,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
but it has nothing to do with the game, I swear to God.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's just a name I like.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Not from, oh, forget it.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
All right, we need to stop naming children after video games.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Let's get on to the gaming news.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
God, we're like 20 minutes into the show,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I haven't touched on a lick of gaming news.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Yes, there's more drama going on with the whole

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Scratch the Ultimate DJ game.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
First, Scratch actually was awarded their restraining order

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
against Seven Studios, and Seven Studios was basically

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
told to give back the controllers that they had been

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
holding hostage, I guess, and also all the development

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
materials and that kind of stuff.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
So that's kind of cool victory for Genius there.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And then a weird chain event also led to Seven Studios

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
now countersuing, saying that it was actually Genius's fault

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
that they were behind schedule, and it was a...

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't know, they had put them back several months

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
because they couldn't get licensed music,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
or they couldn't provide licensed music for the game

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
and not obtain publishing approval.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
So, I don't know, and apparently the game is still not

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
cleared for launch on the PS3 according to them.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
So we'll find out what happens there.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm sure this is not going to be going away anytime soon,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
which is very disappointing because I have a feeling

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
this is going to delay the release of this game

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
if it even comes out anymore now.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
And I'm sure DJ Hero will not be affected by this at all.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh well.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Yes, because DJ Hero is being put out by the bigger company,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
so regardless of quality, it will come out regardless.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
And regardless of whether they find Activision accountable

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
for any wrongdoing whatsoever, it's still...

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
They have oodles of money to pay off any lawsuits

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
that could possibly happen.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
They basically get what they're hinting at

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
they're trying to get.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Because at least I figured, hey, Scratch might not be

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
the more popular game, but at least if it's out first,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
it has a fair chance.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
But now it's like, I don't know.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I still think it'll do okay, but I'm wondering if we see

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
anything called DJ Revolution or something coming out.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
That's going to be crap.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Come on, Konami, don't disappoint me.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Alright, well, I guess we'll see what further develops of this.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I'm sure to be continued, there's plenty more to have

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
on counter suits, appeals, et cetera, et cetera.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I've seen the controller, it looks awesome.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Of course, it's not done, but it looks awesome.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Alright, well, kind of going on a completely different note,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
obviously we were talking about Warcraft a little bit

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
in the opening of the show tonight.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
This is interesting, there's rumors going around the internet

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
about a World of Warcraft app on the iPhone.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Apparently, somebody had ported Second Life to iPhone

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
a little while ago, and now apparently there's this little movie

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
circulating around the internet that actually shows

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
a jailbroken iPhone that is running World of Warcraft.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Kind of interesting.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And there's kind of this no comment going on

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
when asked if it's officially or whatever,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
that the company is apparently negotiating with Activision,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
et cetera, et cetera, to try and get this going.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I think this is kind of a load of crap.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't think Warcraft, I mean,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I think people are kind of jumping to conclusions.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
They see this and they assume,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
oh, Warcraft must be on its way for the iPhone.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Come on, how stupid would Warcraft be on the iPhone?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
You can't take a game like World of Warcraft

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
and put it on the small scale of the iPhone.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
You can't.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
You could.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Okay, but you could in the same way,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
you could install Linux on a toaster to say you did it.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
That's it, but why?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Not necessarily.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Basically what you'd do is you'd create a specific version

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
of the game for the iPhone.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
It would still be the same game,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
but the models would be a lot lower res.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
So when it shows a model for whatever,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Dark Elf or something, it's going to look different.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Here's what I think they should do.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
If they're going to have to do anything with this,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
what they should do is they should go,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
you got to go all the way back to,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I don't know if you remember,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Final Fantasy VIII on the PlayStation.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
If you had that little thing that was only out in Japan,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
and I forget the name of it,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
but they had, that's it, PocketStation,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
you could link with the PlayStation.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
You could raise your chocobo on the PocketStation,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
and then that would affect some chocobos that you had in game.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Maybe something like that where you have a spinoff game

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
where, I don't know, you do something in it

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and it affects your character.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You can get loot that you can actually use in the game,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
or enchantments or something that you can actually use in the game.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Something to enhance the World of Warcraft game

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
without throwing off the balance.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
It wouldn't work because someone would hack it to be able to do that,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
to automatically give them a lot of whatever it is.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Then they wouldn't necessarily be like,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
maybe like new pets or new mounts

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and things that are not going to throw off the balance of World of Warcraft.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
The best part about the chocobo game and Final Fantasy VIII on the PocketStation,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
because I actually owned a PocketStation for a while,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I still have it somewhere. I don't even know where it is.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Rice Princess and the Doctor right now are playing 8-bit Nintendo

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
through a Dreamcast emulator.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Dreamcast, the VMUs, that was huge.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
They had little games that you could do on the VMUs exclusively.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
With the PocketStation though, the best part about it was

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
is the game would play itself.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
If you turned on a PlayStation and just let it sit there for five days or whatever,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
just let it plug in so that it wouldn't turn off,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
you'd come back and you'd have all this loot. It'd just be there. Done.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
So I don't know. They'd have to be very careful with the balance of the game,

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
but it's not like Blizzard's never made major changes to their game.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Second Life, I mean...

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I could see something with vehicular combat, like on the iPhone,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
like a little side game, but I don't know.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know. I believe it's not like a hoax or anything, I don't think,

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
because they're not showing that it's awesome framerate or anything like that.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
But I could see if they could port it to the iPhone, I think it'd be pretty big,

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
because definitely portable World of Warcraft would be awesome for somebody, I'm sure.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
I think there's no point, you know what I mean?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
You can't party, you can't group.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
It would just be slow, it would be clunky.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I think it would devalue Warcraft.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
I think it would devalue World of Warcraft to put out a subpar game on the iPhone.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
But that's why you would have to not necessarily make it look worse,

28:51.000 --> 28:59.000
but dumb down the textures a bit so that you can cram what was in the actual PC game onto this platform.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
That way you wouldn't have all the massive lag and that kind of stuff that you would experience.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
It's just basically more stripped down.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I just think it's devaluing Warcraft.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
If I were to show somebody, like, oh, here's World of Warcraft on my iPhone,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
somebody's going to look at that and go, this looks like crap, I don't want to play this game.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Okay, well the other option is, and I'm not sure if they've actually installed Second Life on there,

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
if it's just streaming it from a PC or something like that and then using this interface to control it.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Maybe that's what this is.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
Or maybe they should just stick with the mobile authenticator and that's it.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
That's a good use of the iPhone, the mobile authenticator.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
I heard they don't even sell the keychain authenticators anymore in favor of the mobile authenticators.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
So what I have here on my keychain from BlizzCon that my friends brought me back

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
is going to be a collector's item that I actually use.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
So, pretty cool.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
The question being asked, what is an authenticator?

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
It's like, what do they call those, VPNs?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Like a lot of companies use them, you have a little thing on your keychain.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
You press this button, it generates a number based on the seed that's on the sticker on the back of your card.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And so when you want to log, and that number changes every minute.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
So it basically uses the seed and the time to generate a number.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And if you want to log into WoW, you have to have the keychain with the number.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Or somebody can't log in. It helps protect your account from hackers, basically.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So, there you go.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Looking at comments from chat, Brad from Pod Culture says,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Sky, you could have an iPhone app for WoW.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Here you do your single player quests and gather loot and or items for your character.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I still think it would be a lesser game than what you have on the PC.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
I mean, I don't know. I mean, granted, okay, you have a lot of iPhone games that are lesser versions.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
But I mean, Blizzard has resisted porting this game to consoles because they don't want a lesser version of the game.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
I cannot see that they're going to bend the rule for the freaking iPhone.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Let's take a lesser game and put it onto the iPhone.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
Let's take Ultima Online or something like that and put it on there.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I mean, iPhone should be able to handle Ultima Online.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Or like, I don't know, Fancy Star Online would be kind of cool.

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
I think there's other things you could do. I just don't think THE World of Warcraft game is going to fit on an iPhone.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Let's move on. I think we have more Warcraft news, right, Darksacra?

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh, yes. You addicts. You've been thrown another boom by PopCap.

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
Now, there's a new command in World of Warcraft that I'm sure Rob has used.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It's slash peggle.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Yes, yes, yes, more yes. This is amazing what has happened this week.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It's freaking peggle.

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, you type it in and you can play peggle, challenge each other, and have peggle duels.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
You can have your friends do an enormous battle.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
You can have a time limit, not a time limit.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Also, you can do peggle loot.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
So you can decide who takes the loot instead of doing the roll command.

31:49.000 --> 31:58.000
But you also have World of Warcraft themed backgrounds and points for using a special peggle talent tree.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
And it's fucking peggle and fucking World of Warcraft.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
And honestly, just reading about it or hearing about it right now does not do this justice.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Like, just how awesome this marriage is.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
My soul cries.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
No, I mean, really, you have to see it.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
I mean, it's like, they really have adapted the game Peggle for free, put it into Warcraft,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
and they have these all new stages that are based off the WoW levels.

32:22.000 --> 32:28.000
They've made this talent tree, which is a WoW thing, but they made it about Peggle.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
You can do duels through the game.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
I mean, it's pretty odd.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Rice Princess, I know you've been playing the hell out of this.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I kicked your ass at a duel the other day.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
No, you didn't.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Yes, I did.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Nuh-uh.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
It wasn't me.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
I have the screen cap to prove it.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No, it wasn't me.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Well, all right, tell them about Peggle.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
It's great.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
It's really awesome.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What do you want me to say?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Ew, you're eating clove gum? That's gross.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Talk about the game, Rice Princess.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
No, it's really fun.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I love it.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Like, I love how the levels are based on...

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
What?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
What?

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
I love how the levels are based on actual places in WoW.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Like, they have the pictures in the background, and all the Peggles are arranged, like, kind

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
of like in the regular Peggle.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
And by the way, for those that have never played Peggle before, it's like Plinko as

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
a game.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Kind of.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
From The Price is Right, kind of.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
You have to, like, shoot at these little pegs and make them go away, and they bounce on

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
each other and stuff like that.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
And it sounds like the most mediocre boring game ever, but it's so fun.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
It's very addicting.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
You'll spend, like, hours playing it.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Trust me.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
So, yeah.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
It's really awesome.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
So, good times.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Very good times with this.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Totally good times.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean, just the marriage of two crack games.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
But what I like about it, like, I'm not going to sign into WoW just to play Peggle, but

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
it's really great, because sometimes, especially, like, I'm leveling an alt right now, so I

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
don't have a mount.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't have a flying mount or anything like that, so when I'm using the flying taxi system,

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
it takes four minutes to go from one place to another.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Peggle's a great distraction to pass the time.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
And it's integrated into the game.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Four whole minutes, Bob.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
It's great.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
I know.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It takes a long time to fly in WoW when you're low level.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
It does.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Four whole minutes.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
I know.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
At least it's not Final Fantasy XI, Christ, where it would take you, like, you didn't

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
even have, like, you had to wait ten minutes for the airship to show up, then you get on

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
the airship, take a ten minute ride, and then it might be remotely near where you're trying

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
to go.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, that's why Final Fantasy XI's ridiculous.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
I'm sure it's gotten a lot better.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
It's more realistic, though.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I think they have more, uh, yeah, it is more realistic, but I think they have more teleport

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
spells and stuff now to help ease that up.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't give a crap it's still a crappy game.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Alright, shut up.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
Alright, anyhow, so yes, Peggle is in WoW, and it's, uh, the amazing part is it's free.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
But what a great thing for PopCap's brand.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I mean, everybody's talking about it this week.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Everybody's talking about Peg Crack.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
We got sucked right in just like everybody else.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So, there you go.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Um, yes.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
So, something not Peggle-related.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Um, but actually, oddly enough, it's something related to what's going on on Justin.TV.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
The Dreamcast!

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Yes, uh, Sega isn't making Dreamcasts anymore.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
However, you can still purchase them.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
In fact, ThinkGeek is now offering, um, brand new Dreamcasts for $100.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
$99.99.

35:04.000 --> 35:13.000
And, um, yes, and it includes, of course, uh, it's a version 2.0, um, with the web browser version 2.0,

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
including Sega Swirl and a demo disc.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
And, um, yeah, awesome.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Brand new Dreamcast.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
I remember when I got my Dreamcast, I wanted it at an all-nighter at QZAR.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I was like, Dreamcast? I don't want this.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
But then I got, I got games for it, and I'm like, sweet, it has Power Stone.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
That's awesome.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
I didn't even think new Dreamcasts existed anymore.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
That's the crazy part to me. Like, where did they find new Dreamcasts?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Where did they find these?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
I don't know.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Maybe in a warehouse?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
I guess so. Like, just collecting dust somewhere.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
I do have to say, though, the article on this is amazing for, uh,

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
showing the last Sega to Sanchiro commercial when the Dreamcast came out.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
I would really recommend picking up a Dreamcast.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
If you have some extra money and you want a great system

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
with a lot of homebrew available out there,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
you know, I realize the legality of some of this stuff is questionable,

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
but, I mean, the Dreamcast is a great, great system.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
I mean, it has good games anyway.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
And make yourself a boot disk and you can play in the import.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
No problem. I mean, they're easy.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
There's some real classics on Dreamcast.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm sure many classic games of the week that Dark Soccer has picked

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
have come from there.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
Uh, Space Channel 5, Sonic Adventure, you know,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
there's just great, great games on Dreamcast.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
So, check it out if you don't already have one of these.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Um, speaking of old stuff...

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Oh, they're sold out.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Are they all gone?

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Probably because the blogs all picked up the stories. It's gone.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Maybe they'll...

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Console sold out.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Maybe they'll get more in the future.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Um, speaking of old retro stuff,

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
old Sierra games, and I'm talking, like, Leisure Suit Larry 1,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Police Quest 1, Space Quest 1,

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
apparently there's a new website where you can actually play these games

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
in your browser, but it's kind of cool because the games run in Flash,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
but there's this weird, like, multiplayer element

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
where you can watch other people solve puzzles,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
and there's a new right-click menu system in the game.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
If you want to check this out, the website is called sarian.net.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
S-A-R-I-E-N dot net.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
And so it's just kind of like a walkthrough of these classic old school Sierra games.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
So if you were a Sierra game fan like I was back in the day,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
then you definitely want to check that out.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
They only have those three games right now,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
the Leisure Suit Larry 1, Police Quest 1, and Space Quest 1.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
No word when my favorite of the old Sierra games,

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
which would be King's Quest 4, is going to make the list.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
So check that out.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
Moving on with some more gaming news, over to Dark Sakura.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
Well, I'm sure some of our regular listeners remember me talking about

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
getting a FC Mobile, which is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
Now there is a new one, which I am going to be getting and selling my old one.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
It's the FC Mobile 2, and it comes with stuff and things.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
As in, it comes with controllers,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
wireless controllers, and a light gun.

38:19.000 --> 38:26.000
A wireless light gun that's pretty good in relation to the old NES Zapper.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
So when you have it basically using the TV tuner mode and using it as your Nintendo,

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
you have actual controllers. You do not have to use the system.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
So it's going to be out in May.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
It will be $60, and it will have a black version and a white version.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
And I'm going to have one.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Mine will go up for sale. My old one.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
The end.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
This is so interesting how the old school Nintendo stuff is making such a comeback,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
thanks to, in part, this whole FC Mobile stuff.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So it's kind of cool.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
How much money do you think you're going to end up spending on all this crap?

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Not much. It's only $60. It should be cheaper elsewhere.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Hitstun in our chat room right now says,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, this week I bought an FC Mobile, tried it, realized the fucking A and B buttons were backwards,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and returned it for a refund.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Yeah, they're fixing that.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
All in about a half hour's time.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
They're fixing that.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
They've reversed the A and B buttons to where they should be on the new version.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
Does that have anything to do with the fact that in Japan, most games do have it flipped?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Or is that just, no, it really was messed up?

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
I think that they based the old FC Mobile off of the Famicom Mobile.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
The U.S. one was based off of the Japanese one,

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
but I think that the U.S. release one is going to actually,

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
they were saying that the button should be corrected for American audiences.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Alrighty.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
And I got a hug in chat for mentioning King's Quest IV.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
That's like the quintessential Sierra game. I'm sorry.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That is the best.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
If anybody were to ask me what old school Sierra game should I play

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
to check out why these games were so awesome,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
because there's like 20 of them out there in all these different series,

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
I would say King's Quest IV is the one you should check out first.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I like King's Quest better than Space Quest IV.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I like Space Quest IV.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Oh yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Really?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah, I do. I like Legion Suit Larry too,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
but I think King's Quest is more accessible for everybody.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
You have to have a certain sense of humor to like Legion Suit Larry.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
So there you go.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Alright, well, more news.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
We've got release dates coming up.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Yes.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Well, this ought to make Jamie happy.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
It's been confirmed that next week on the, or not virtual console,

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
on Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual On will be coming out.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
Yes, on April 29th, you can expect Virtual On out on Xbox Live Arcade.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
Apparently, though, it is going to be priced at 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
So?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That is so for me.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
It's Virtual On.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm totally getting it.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Once wins six.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Because there's Virtual On.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Or an adapter.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
An outrun.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
Adapter, so I can use my Dreamcast twin sticks.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Random Xbox Live Arcade.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
One thing I did play actually this week as well was Lode Runner.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
I did check that out because I have fond memories of that game on the Commodore 64.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Personally, I don't think that game has aged very well.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
They've tried to make it look nicer,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
but I think the core game itself has not aged very well.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
I think it's a game that's better left in my memory on the Commodore 64.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't want to base the review off the demo,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
but as I was checking it out, I was kind of going,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
this is one of those things that I remember a lot more fondly when I was younger.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
They have nice new graphics.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
It's like they put the same old game in this nice new packaging,

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
but it's still the same old game that I think is better left in the 80s.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So there you go.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
All right.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Let's go to some release dates.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
Over to Japan first.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
We'll start tonight with some of the releases on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
Coming out on, I believe, what is their release date?

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I think April 30th.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
X-Blades is coming out on the Xbox 360.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
That's really the only big game coming out this week.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, you also have X-Blades from Ubisoft,

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
as well as versions of NHL 2009 coming out there as well.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
you have GQO Powerful Major League 2009

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
and Mahjong Kakuto Club Wii come out as well.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
It's kind of a slow release week, if you can imagine.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
That's cool.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
PlayStation 2 has a game called NHL 2009,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
as well as Tiernanog is coming out as well.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Wasn't that a song in DDR?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
No.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Oh, it is. It is.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It's a game based off the Mystic Knights of Tiernanog.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
That's what it is. Huh?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I was going to say it's Celtic mythology.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
That's what it is.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
It's a role-playing game.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
This actually looks kind of cool.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That neato.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
That's on PlayStation 2 of all systems.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
So that's coming out from SystemSoft this week in Japan.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
That looks to be the most exciting thing I've seen yet.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Going to the handhelds,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
we'll see if there's any big handheld stuff coming out this week.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
That might explain why the lineup is kind of weak on the consoles.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
We do have a Dragon Ball Z game coming out,

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
as well as WarioWare Myself comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

43:26.000 --> 43:32.000
And Shinobi Retsuden 3 comes out as well.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
And let's see.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
That's all on the DS.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
And on the Sony PSP.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Oh, there you go.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Persona comes out this week on the PSP.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That must be the big game that's coming out this week.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
As well as a version of Tiernanog on Sony PSP.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
You fail at Blaster Master.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
That's kind of cool.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
All right.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
So they're playing Blaster Master on Justin TV right now,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
but having a hard time with the Dreamcast controller.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
There you go.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
All right.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Let's move on with more release dates.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
I have two.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
We have on the 1st of May, which is May Day,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
which is a fertility holiday.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Ooh.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
We have Gardening Mama on the DS.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
We have Marbles Balance Challenge on the Wii.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's it.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
This is a slow week.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
I think the Marbles Balance Challenge I think is a WiiWare game.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
They're too busy practicing fertility, right?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Dancing the maypole.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
This week there's not a whole lot coming out as well in the U.S.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Starting off Backyard Baseball 2010 coming out on the PlayStation 2,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
but you might as well skip that game because it sucks.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
The Aquarium World, which is apparently a port of the DS Aquarium game,

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
also sucks.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Please avoid that one.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Horrible game.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
Elite Forces Unit 77 coming out on the DS.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Still horrible, but okay.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Velvet Assassin coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That one's supposed to be okay.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Dynasty Warriors Strike Force on PSP.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Maybe here, I think this is the wrong date,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
but Klonoa on the Wii is supposed to be coming out.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Yay!

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
I think it's the week after, but we'll go with that I guess.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Super Robot Tyson OG Saga Endless Frontier,

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
which actually looks pretty cool.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
That's coming out on the DS.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Tournament Pool coming out from Destiny Air,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
which means that must suck.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
That's on the Wii.

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming out on the DS.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Okay.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Is it like Imagine Fuego?

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
No, not quite Imagine Fuego.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And then finally, probably the bigger game of the week,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
and this is sad, but X-Men Origins Wolverine.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
And if you happen to be buying it on the 360,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
and on the PlayStation 3, the Uncaged Edition,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
which means it's slightly more violent,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
will be coming out in pretty much every system out there.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
And then also some more crap from Destiny Air.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Party Pigs Farmyard Games on the Wii.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And that is it.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
That is your week in games.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Why is it such a crap week for games?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
I guess we're just...

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
April's usually light, that's why.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
We're all busy doing it.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I guess everybody's prepped for the summer or something.

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
Alright, well, at least online looks to be a little more exciting

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
if you look at the stuff that's available on Virtual Console

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
and those types of places.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
One thing that's coming out in Japan anyway,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
sadly it's not here yet, but maybe someday,

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
the Wii Video Service is going to be launching in Japan on May 1st.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Here's the cool thing about it.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
You will be able to connect with your DSi.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Notice how it doesn't say your DS, but your DSi.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
It's called the Wii No Ma Channel,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
and it's coming out from May 1st.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
It's being launched by Nintendo,

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
and Dentsu is their publisher partner.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, it makes sense that you couldn't do the DS

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
because you can't download anything to the DS.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Well, you can't download programs.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Oh, to the regular DS, yeah.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Couldn't you download a movie to the regular DS,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
close it, and have it later? I don't know.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
As long as you don't turn it off.

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
I believe it uses flash memory for the demos.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Let me tell you a little bit more about how it works.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Basically, when you go into this app,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
it looks like a little family room,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
and eight of your Miis will show up gathering in this room.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
If you go into the TV in the room,

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
you'll get to do the download service.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
There will be both free and paid content.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
They haven't announced what's going to be in it yet.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
One of the demo videos uses this nature footage,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
so I don't know if they just have some stock video

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
to kind of show the program off or what have you.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
If you go on a house plant, you go to the sponsor area,

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
and you get some free trials of stuff from advertisers,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
so I don't know, like a sponsor area.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I don't know how that ties into videos, but there you go.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
You will also be able to use this on the DSi.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
There's going to be a free app called Doko Demo Wii No Ma.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
It's called Anywhere, translate what's it to, Anywhere Wii No Ma,

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
and you'll be able to download the video from the Wii to your DS,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
as well as redeem coupons.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And apparently in one of the demo videos,

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
you get a fast food restaurant coupon that you get from this channel.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
You'd get it to your DSi, and then they scan it on your DSi

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
at the restaurant to redeem it.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Kind of neat. A little different.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
There's a trailer out there on the internet if you want to check that out,

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
but it isn't Japanese, so there you go.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Do you think they'll have something like this out here soon?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Too much trouble for us lazy Americans.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I don't think you'll have quite that cool functionality

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
like the fast food restaurant thing I was describing,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
but why not the video service?

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Because then that would mean that they actually are going to embrace online

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
for the U.S., and that's never going to happen.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
But wasn't Japan always kind of holding them back?

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Well, no.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Look at the one company that's braced online better than anybody else

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
is an American company, Microsoft.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Yes.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
And Nintendo is a Japanese-run company.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
I know, and Sony has been always having to run to catch up

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
with the online stuff.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
At least they're willing to give it a shot.

49:11.000 --> 49:18.000
After all, their systems did have support for online network games.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Granted, the GameCube did as well,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
but honestly, how many games really used it?

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Like, two.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I don't know. I don't think we'll see this.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I mean, after all, they haven't even brought the normal video download service

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
to the Wii yet, so why the video streaming?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I just don't see this as something they're just going to do,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
because it doesn't really...

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I mean, it adds, I guess, functionality to the Wii,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
but really they don't need it,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
because people want to buy Wii Sports,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
and hopefully Wii Sports 2 or Wii Sports Resort.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
All right. Well, we'll see if they give this a shot in the U.S. or not.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Probably not.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Anyway, moving on. More news.

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
Well, in other news, this is actually a statement made by American McGee,

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
and I fully endorse this, you know.

50:09.000 --> 50:17.000
They're asked about the trend of using user-made content,

50:17.000 --> 50:24.000
and American McGee was saying that it's actually extortion of the users

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
to make the content.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You know, they're basically using the users to make the game.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
They just make the properties to go with it.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
He thinks that there should be some kind of reward out there

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
for gamers who make the content, which I agree with.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I think that would be a good idea.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
You know, or at least contests and things like that.

50:46.000 --> 50:54.000
But it's really just, you know, partially laziness on part of the programs.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
I think it actually, there's the immersive element of having people,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
you know, the players provide content,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but at the same time, yeah, they should be rewarded for it.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
When I was first hearing this story,

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
I couldn't help but think maybe it was a dig on LittleBigPlanet,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
because that's a game that relies so much on the user-created content.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
That's the big sell of the game.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
You know what I mean?

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
LittleBigPlanet is the best game I played last year completely.

51:17.000 --> 51:26.000
Certainly better than those American McGee, you know, the Grim Fairy Tales games they have out right now.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
No, I don't agree with, you know, his statements at all,

51:29.000 --> 51:34.000
because if you think about it, that's like saying if I buy a pencil and I do a drawing,

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
should the company that provided me with the pencil, you know,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
they have to pay me for the drawing they made, because...

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
But are you going to go back and use the drawing afterwards?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
What do you mean if I'm going to use the drawing?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Or let other people...

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Is the pencil company going to sell your drawing, basically?

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Are you going to...

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Yeah, but they're not selling their online content.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
Are you going to be drawing up for common use so that anybody else on the internet can use your piece?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Then don't make anything for it.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
I mean, that's the thing.

51:57.000 --> 52:03.000
It's like if you're going to be all butthurt about people using your, you know, stuff that you made,

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
then don't make anything.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
The point is that the games rely on user-created content.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
No, they don't, because they actually have their own standby levels,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
and if you never touched online, it wouldn't matter anyways,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
because you still got a full game's worth of stuff.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
To be fair, I'm using LittleBigPlanet as an example.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
We don't know exactly what kind of game he had in mind either.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Oh, he's full of crap.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I mean, his game, Grim, is...

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I'm sorry, it's not that great.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
But, whatever, you know, he thinks he's an expert because he's developed, you know, two game series.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Ooh, let's bow down to you.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Oh, wait, how was your Bad Day L.A. game?

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
Oh, that's right, it wasn't very good.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
I mean, maybe if he had some user-created content, it would have made that game worth buying,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
but, I don't know, it's just...

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
I'm kind of in the middle here.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Like, I kind of understand what he...

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
I do agree that if companies are going to use your stuff,

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
you should get rewards for that, you know what I mean?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You should be able to...

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
They could even go as far as compensation, you know what I mean?

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
I think that there should actually be contests.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
You know, content contests.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
And Sony does kind of reward, like, they give the crowns in Little Big Planet if you're super popular.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
The trophies are based off the popularity of your levels.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Little perks, nothing big.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
They should have, like, real prizes.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Real stuff.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Yeah, that's what I think.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Alright.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
If you guys have a comment, chat.orangelandrader.com is the place you can leave us a comment on this.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Or you can always send us a tweet.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
At OLR is the place you can go as well.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Some comments from chat right now over at chat.orangelandrader.com.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Leo Shen says, hopefully that new Alice game will be good.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
I keep forgetting, they are working on a new Alice game, aren't they?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
They're working on an Alice movie, too.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Well, Alice in Wonderland.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
He was supposed to be working on an Alice movie as well, but...

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
I don't know.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
It's just...

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It's just because he...

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
For whatever reason, we hold these game developers up really high, and then they start getting a big head.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
And thinking that they can comment on everything.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
And granted, yes, they can make comments on everything, but then people...

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
We comment on everything.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
It's just people don't give a shit what we say.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
They don't get posts everywhere.

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
No one goes and posts our comments in a blog, and they'll present it as gospel on the industry.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
I mean, it's just one person's opinion.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Just like his opinion.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
He thinks that people should be compensated.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Well, great!

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
If he ever creates a game that has user-created content, then I want him to see him compensating everybody.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Since he's made such a fuss over it.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
So...

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Whatever.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Loki?

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
Advent Children Complete, the brand new Blu-Ray box set that came out in Japan last week,

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
has actually been doing very well.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
In fact, it's sold over 274,000 copies.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
And the demo itself has actually pushed the PS3 to the top of the charts.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
Because, yes, people do actually want to buy this box set for the game.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And, yeah, that's fine.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
The movie's awesome, too.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
But I think it's definitely...

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
I mean, they must be pretty confident in it.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
After all, they did release a special edition PS3 in Japan with this box set.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
So, you know, people love their Final Fantasy VII.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
Even though it's really probably the Final Fantasy XIII demo that's driving all of this?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Yes.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I mean, how many of those came to America?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
I mean, I haven't heard of people importing a game as much as I've heard of this.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Like, I seriously know.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
I know you imported it.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
One of my friends on LiveJournal imported it.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I know Bobby imported it.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
And I don't...

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Like, I haven't heard of that many people importing anything else.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
You know what I mean?

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Like, maybe one of you would import another game from Japan.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
But, like, all of you guys got that Final Fantasy XIII demo.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
You know, I think that you import...

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
You know, and it's probably maybe only, like, a thousand or two thousand of that is imports.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
You can't say the whole bit is.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
But that's still...

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
It just kind of shows you the popularity of it, if that makes sense.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Yes, it does make sense.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
So, it's pretty popular.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And I'm sure, like, if, you know...

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII actually comes out over there on PS3 and stuff,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
people will be importing that bitch.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Oh, yeah, because it'll be region-free.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Yeah, it'll be region-free.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
It'll be a few months early.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
And then they'll buy it again in the U.S. because we're all consumer whores, right?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Yep.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
That's right.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Already thinking about it.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
There you go.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
I'm kind of curious.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Chat room.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
What kind of game...

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Because I see Act Def Comments has imported three games.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
What are some games, chat room, you've imported in the past year?

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Because, you know, when you...

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
And the reason why I ask is because it costs a lot more money when you order import games from Japan.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So, I'm kind of curious, those of you in chat.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Give me some ideas.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
What kind of games have you imported in the past year?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
We'll say year or two.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Within this current console cycle, you know, what kind of stuff have you imported?

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Is that the only thing you've imported during this cycle?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Nope.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I imported Smash Brothers Brawl.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
I also imported...

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
I don't know why I imported this, but I imported Wangen Midnight on the PS3.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Oh, yeah.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Because it was not like the arcade one, for sure.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
No, it was not, unfortunately.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
There's some other games.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
I thought about importing Africa, never got around to it.

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
Just because it can't run over the animals, and that's just not fun for me.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
There's another RPG that came out over there.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I think it's Dark Souls or something like that.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
That's actually all in English that I thought about importing.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
But I haven't even played the PS3 games I have now.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Like, I have Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 that I still haven't played anything.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
You know, I haven't even gotten past, like, the first level in...

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Well, I passed the first level, but not the second level in Resistance 2.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I don't know.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
I thought about getting a Japanese Xbox 360,

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
because I haven't figured out a good way to region-free my 360,

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
since most of the games that come out in Japan aren't region-free on the 360.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
But that's pretty much it.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Yeah, just those three games.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Let me read some comments from our chat room about the imports,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
the games that have been imported.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
Act F says he's imported Happy Sky, Gya Kuten Saiban 2, and Street Fighter's Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Why can't I talk tonight?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Dark Knight says 2DX Red.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Liu Shen says 2DX Poppin' and Oz.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
GS68 says kitsui Death Label, Poppin' Music 13 Carnival,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
DJ Max Portable Black Square.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Jason says, current console cycle, I haven't.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Gold Anthro says, I've never really imported a game ever.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I don't have the extra money.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
There you go.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
Some of the comments from things that have been imported in the current cycle.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Funny enough, none of them said the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
And the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
All right.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
Hey, PlayStation Home, another popular destination on the PlayStation 3.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
There is an update coming for PlayStation Home.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
There's going to be a new Disgaea Lounge,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
and apparently in this new Disgaea area, you'll be able to play like a Disgaea test.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
There'll be a card game, some type of block game available as well.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
And of course, prettys.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
Little pretty penguin people that you can see in this area.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Also, some other stuff coming to home this month.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Street Fighter IV Avatar items.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
You can start Street Fighter IV within Home.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And Uncharted Waters Online.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Cruz del Sur is supposed to come out as well,

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
which offers some new home items within Home.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
So there you go.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
That's all coming to PlayStation Home.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Haven't been home in a while.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Neither, but, well, I guess only a couple weeks when I say a while.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
So, you know, there you go.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
That's all coming to PlayStation Home this month.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Well, that's special.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Very, very special.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Well, how about some different PlayStation 3 news?

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
This is definitely a reason that is if you

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Sorry, the mics died for a minute.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It was my fault.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Live radio, boys and girls.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Did that work? Did you hear that microphone?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Yes, sorry.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Roar!

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Okay.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
If you have a problem, you can take it up with me.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
Anyway.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
So for fans of the PlayStation 3,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
there is a very good reason to have

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Arkham Asylum on that system,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
because you get to play the Joker.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
The Joker is cool.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Reviews so far of the game have been pretty positive,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
so I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But there's really, though, no comment on

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
if you're going to be able to use him at all

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
on Xbox 360 or PC.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
You, basically, though, the way it's going to work

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
is that you'll go on to the PlayStation Store

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
to purchase him, but he's only playable on the challenge maps.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Mr. J.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Huh.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I wonder if Xbox 360 will have their own little special character.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
If it's Catwoman, I gotta go with 360.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I gotta say.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I don't know, because Joker is Joker.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I want Harley.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, you don't know.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Like, maybe there's still going to be a special character on the 360

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
that's going to be, you know, everybody's going to want that, too.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I mean, obviously, the Joker's the big-ass deal with the movie and everything,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
but, you know, I don't know.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Me, personally, I love Batman for years and years.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
This will probably come out on the 360

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
after a certain amount of time.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It's just, you know, sweeten the deal,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
because you've got to sell some PS3 units since there's not as many systems.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Only if one of the Joker's attacks is the magic trick.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
This is Mark Hamill, Joker, so probably not.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's right. X-Link is reminding us in chat that Mark Hamill is doing the voice.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Oh, my God.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Mark Hamill is the best voice actor ever for Joker The End.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It's also the guy with the same guy that's doing the voice

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
from the animated series for Batman as well,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and I think they have the writer doing the actual story of the game, too.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That's nice.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Too bad they can't get Eartha Kitt for Catwoman,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
because she's, you know, dead, but that would have been great.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
For what I've seen in the video trailer for it,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I think they have the same voice actor for Harley Quinn, too.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Yay! God, I love Harley.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I just think that she's great because she was totally made for the animated series,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
and fans loved her so much that she made it into the comic universe.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Well, I hope the game's as good as the hype,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
because everybody's getting excited about it.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Nobody's played the game yet.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Actually, some people have had their hands on early copies to review it,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and it did get some pretty good reviews.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Eurogamer really, really liked it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
They were just excited because they had early copies.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Well, Sony was teasing an electrifying announcement

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that they were going to make on April 27th

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
regarding Uncharted Drake's Fortune 2 and also Infamous.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
However, like any other secret announcement that they have,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
it got ruined by Best Buy.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
So apparently part of the announcement,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
at least we can assume it's part, if not all, of the announcement,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
if you buy your copy of Infamous,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
you will get a downloadable demo,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
as well as access to Uncharted 2 among thieves,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
the multiplayer beta, one that launches in June.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So much like Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
you'll get to do a similar type of thing with Uncharted 2.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And of course, everyone's thought was,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
hey, not only will you probably be able to play the Uncharted 2 beta,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
but maybe the Infamous character is going to be an unlockable in Uncharted 2.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So that might be another theory as well.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But we'll hear the official announcement on the 27th,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and everybody act surprised.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Sorry the surprise got ruined by Best Buy, Sony.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
This sad trombone's for you.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I know. We love sad trombone here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
We should make that official thing, that when this type of stuff happens,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
we give them a sad trombone, and that's whatever.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The sad trombone of the week.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
That's right, the sad trombone of the week.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
All right, we got one more story for you that won't be a sad trombone,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
for some people are going to be very excited to hear this,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
but apparently Kojima is swearing there's not going to be another Metal Gear for a while.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But one of the other games he's looking at possibly revisiting,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Zone of the Enders.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That's right. Apparently they are interested in making a Zone of the Enders 3,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and this came up during one of the Metal Gear Solid 4 podcasts.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It's been six years since Zone of the Enders, the second runner.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
But apparently Kojima is interested.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
He wants gamers to email them if they're interested in seeing it happen.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
So if you want to add to the email barrage I'm sure they're getting right now,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
go check that out, the MGS4 podcast, and you can send them an email.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
So I'm sure they're getting bombarded with them because since this hit the internet,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
everybody's probably emailing saying, yes, Zone of the Enders.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And we have some folks in chat room that are getting very excited about hearing

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the Zone of the Enders stuff as well.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So I don't know, are you guys interested in Zone of the Enders 3?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yes.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Sure, why not?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
As long as Sana sings the song.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
All right, well let's get here to the end of part A,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
we're going to get into part B in just a minute here,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
but before we end part A we have to get to a segment we always do here

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Every week we like to dig through the old dusty gaming archive of video games

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and pick out a classic video game that you kids should be revisiting.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
We're revisiting a lot on Justin TV tonight actually.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It looks like Rice Princess is playing Willow right now.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Good times, that's a good pick.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That's a previous classic game of the week, that's already been done.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
We have a brand new classic game of the week tonight,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
and Dark Soccer is back, I picked one last week,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
but Dark Soccer is back to pick one for you guys.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
We did Spy vs. Spy, an old Commodore 64 game that they ended up on the NES,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and it had two sequels that a lot of people don't know about

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
because they were only on Commodore 64,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
but one of the very first games ever to have same screen multiplayer.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That's what makes it unique.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
All right, anyhow, that's so last week though.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Let's get into this week and the classic game of the week this week.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The game of the week is Klonoa, because Klonoa is great.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Let's have some music, Rob.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yes, this is from the PlayStation 1 version of Klonoa.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let's check it out.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Explosions.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I love music in this game.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'm going to choke on the cue.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
This is not the best music ever.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You can still just see how nauseously cued this game is from music.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
There you go.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Well, it starts off nauseously cute, but how many people has actually played the damn game?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Basically, you start off in a world called Phantomile.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Klonoa lives in this little village called Breezegale.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
He lives with his grandfather.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:18.000
He goes and visits Dreamworld, where he has to go and save different people.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Basically, he meets up with his buddy named Q-Pal,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
who lives in a ring that Klonoa found in the forest.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000
That's where Klonoa gets his power from.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
He basically has to go and rescue this girl named Lola,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:53.000
who is a...well, actually, wrong one, because he has to...no, I think it's Lola that he has to...was he rescued?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Anyway, he has to rescue some chick.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I thought it was either Lola or Lirina, one of those two.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:13.000
He has to go through and actually rescue this priestess who was captured by Gaudius, who is the main bad guy.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:23.000
He thinks that dark remotions should reign and that you should accept it as much as you do the light.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
However, he's just doing this to do it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.000
As you go through the game, you're having to...I really don't want to spoil things too much,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
but as it goes through, you have to go through the different stages and fight the different bosses.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The game plays sort of pseudo-3D.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It plays on a 2D platform, but you've got some three-dimensional elements thrown in,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
like hitting stuff that goes into the background to pop eggs to get more jewels to power your stuff up with,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
or you can also rescue these different people that live in different places.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
You've got these people that look like Klonoa in the first level,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and you have these people that look like moon things in the next level,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
but you have to go through and actually rescue people as you go along and fight the enemies

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
by picking up the smaller enemies and throwing them at the bigger ones

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
or using the different properties.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
There's ones that fly, and you have to grab them, and they'll fly you upwards a little bit.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It's a ton of fun. We actually did get a sequel over here in the U.S.,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
which was Klonoa 2, Limitee's Veil.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It used a cel shading for the game.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Actually, this is where those other characters came in.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I'll be perfectly honest. I haven't played the first Klonoa in a long, long time,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
so I don't really remember all the people's names except for Joka and Gaudius,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and I remember his grandfather, which was very sad, and I guess that happens to him.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Joka, though, sucks. Sucks a lot.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:18.000
But Klonoa 2 had the platformer levels and different types of boss battles

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and time attack challenges and water parks and things like that, too.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But the thing about this game, about actually both of the games, I'd say,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
is that for as cute and light as they look, and, you know,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
it'd be a game that a little kid could play and not really understand the darker elements to,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
it does have a ton of darker elements.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I mean, really, this game gets downright freaking depressing.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Just depressing. I mean, the further you get on in the game, you're like,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
oh my god, can this get any more screwed up? And then it gets more screwed up.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Now, did you happen to pick this game this week because there's that Wii version coming out very soon,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
or just coincidence?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Well, I was thinking about it, and what I did now when I pick a classic game

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
is I looked at my own collection, which usually takes me quite a while.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
But I happened to see Klonoa there. I was like, oh, Klonoa's coming out this week, so I might as well pick it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
But there's also other versions of the game, too.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000
There's a Klonoa 2 Dream Champ tournament that came out in Game Boy Advance in Japan.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And it actually did come out over here quite a bit later.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
There's also Klonoa Moonlight Museum, which came out in Japan on WonderSwan,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
which I might have.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But there's also Klonoa Empire of Dreams that also came out for Game Boy Advance.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And there's actually in 2002, there was Klonoa Heroes Legend of the Star Metal,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
which is an action RPG.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So you can actually play through the game as an RPG.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000
For other things, Klonoa had a cameo in MotoGP in Alpine Racer 3.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Klonoa and another character, Goonps, were a playable pair in Namco X Capcom, or VS Capcom, or whatever.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And they had their moves from Klonoa Heroes.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You can also see Joka, Janga, and the moves as enemies, and also Lolo and Lalakusha,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
who was another priestess, as non-playable characters.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And in Tales of Symphonia, you could put Priscia in a Klonoa costume.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:54.000
There's also Shipputen Goku Kaze no Klonoa, which was a really just comedic manga about Klonoa,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
who was a kid who wanted to be a superhero.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And really, that's it.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I mean, it's just a fun, fun, fun game.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It's really, really... it can get difficult, because you have to think ahead with the puzzles.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You have to always be keeping your eyes open.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But it does build up in such a way that the learning curve really is a bit more kind.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
In fact, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the website I used to have a long time ago.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It was called the Anime and Video Game Alliance.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Yes, this was a long, long time ago.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000
But one of my banner characters was the picture of Klonoa.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I've liked this game for a very long time.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Definitely a classic, one that I know some of our listeners love.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
They love that you picked this tonight.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So there you have it, Klonoa, your classic video game of the week.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Oh, wait, did you play the conversation track?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Yeah, I played it in the background already.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, sorry. Well, if we can go back to the beginning of that one.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I will try, yes.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The other thing I wanted to bring up is that they have sort of a made-up language,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
which I tried to see if they were speaking Japanese or something.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And, of course, given the voice actors, it borrows a lot of elements from Japanese, but it's not quite.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
It actually reminds me of La La Naya.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Here, watch this.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Gotta go that way.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Boo-rah, jerk.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I got that back, daddy.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Cute.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
All right.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But I don't know if I've ever talked about La La Naya before,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
but for anyone who was a little kid in the 80s who watched The Great Space Coaster,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
it was this walking line that would walk along, and it was done by an Italian illustrator.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And the line drawing would talk to the illustrator and interact with him,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
but he spoke sort of a pidgin Italian, and that's what this reminds me of.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So, obscure reference there.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
All right.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Klonoa.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Klonoa, your classic game of the week.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
We also did Dan and I used to walk around going, wa-roop, just because.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
All right.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
That's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
but we will be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
We've got more stories to talk about in Part B, some Xbox 360,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
some Penny Arcade Expo news we have as well, and plenty more.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
April the 26th of 2009.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and then we put out the podcast at some point.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
All right.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining you for this lovely Part B here of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Dark Soccer is here as well, Loki, special guests tonight, The Doctor and Rice Princess,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and we've been joined by somebody else.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I thought she was Fart Princess.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Is she Fart?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
No, I think she went back to me.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Are you Ice Princess or Fart Princess?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Are you Fart Princess or Rice Princess?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Or are you Great Princess?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
She's Rice Princess again.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
She's Drunk Princess.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
She took some gas acts, so she's now.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yeah, right now she's Drunk Princess, actually.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
We're taking wine tonight.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
A lovely, lovely Zinfandel.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It's wine candy.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yes.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It's wine and belly flop night.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
All right.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So we have another guest who joined us part way.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
A challenger has arrived.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
A new challenger has arrived.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Who is our new person never been on the show before?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
This is Mellie Wellie.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Mellie Wellie.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Hello.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Hi, Mellie Wellie.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
How are you?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I am good.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I'm not loud enough.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That's all right.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It takes a little getting used to.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
You have to practically scream in the microphone to be heard around here, but that's all right.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Quickly, Mellie Wellie, what kind of video games do you enjoy?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I actually enjoy Flash games.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
The reason that it took me a while to get here is because I was playing the new Gemcraft

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
prequel.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Oh, what's Gemcraft?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I've not heard of this.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
It's like a tower defense game, but you use gems in the towers, and it's actually really

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
nerdy, but it's a lot of fun.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Those tower defense games are pretty crazy awesome, though.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
There's a big Final Fantasy one right now that's new.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So there you go.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Very cool.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Have you played, what is that, Don't Shit Your Pants?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
That's my favorite Flash game as of late.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
No.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That's the one I like.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I think I heard you guys talking about it a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had a chance

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
to play it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
That's the one I reckon it is.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Is that why you're not wearing any right now?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
No, there's a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
What's this, Rice Princess?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You play this every day?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Yes, I play the Don't Shit My Pants game every day, because I successfully don't shit my

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
pants every day.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I'm talking about the Flash game, Rice Princess.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Not real life.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Oh.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
There you go.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
All right.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Anyhow, all right.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So yeah, that's a great Flash game.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I recommend that.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And then of course we talked about in part A, you probably missed it because you were

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
on your way over here, but we were actually talking about some of the old school Sierra

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
games, like the very first Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry are now Flash games available

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
on the internet that you can play somewhere.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I might have to find Leisure Suit Larry.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
They have that.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Leisure Suit Larry 1 is playable, so check that out.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
All right.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Anyhow, also the chat room is always joining us every week.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Chat.orangelaundry.com.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Dan Shadow in chat.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I just barely beat the first level of the FF Tower defense game.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Yeah, that game's kind of hard, actually.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Let's see.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I Like Old People asks, is Rob actually not wearing any pants?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
That's the name.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Why are you laughing?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yes, it's true.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Rob is not wearing any pants.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
No, I am too, wearing pants.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Well, no, you see, because he just got some new Hello Kitty undies, and he's got to show

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
them off.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Shut up.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Rob is dancing in his panties.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Shut up, all of you.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That's a good chat name.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I like that name.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I like Old People.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Oh, then we still have to get Rob some panties.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I like Old People, too.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
In fact, I was very saddened, by the way.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I do want to mention at some point that I'm very saddened to hear about Bea Arthur.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Though, I mean, really, like, really ruined my day yesterday.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I was having a great day, and then I heard, I did a charity walk yesterday morning.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
It was great.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I was slightly amused that she was mentioned on the Deadpool bugle, because Deadpool is

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
obsessed with Bea Arthur.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Too soon.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Too soon.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
She was 86.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I know, but she just died.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Show a little respect.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
All right.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Anyhow.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I'll tell you what's funny, though.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
What?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You missed, because you missed class.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Anyway.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm sorry.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
She's in my typography class with me.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We were doing brainstorming about doing our play on words thing project that we have coming

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
up.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And one of the words that came up just by accident was mod, and we started talking about

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
the TV show just a little bit, and then the next day, dead.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
OMG, dead.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
That happened with Ricardo Montalban.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:49.440
We were listening to Montalban, which is our cage match winning song, the night before

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.500
and watching the Rich Corinthian leather commercial, and then he died the next day.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.000
Also, that looks like a penis.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Okay.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.160
I think what you're listening to is that secretly Dark Sakura is the grim reaper.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.360
I could very well be.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.120
Are you the grim reaper?

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.320
Do you want to find out?

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.680
I will reap you with my grim reaping equipment.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.320
I was trying to find the intro to mod on YouTube somewhere so I could actually play it, but

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.800
the best thing I could find was I found this here.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.880
No, I found something different.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:31.960
The family guy one is on there, but I found Rosie O'Donnell singing it.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:39.960
All right, that's enough.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.600
I'll tell you what, though, here's your B. Arthur trivia for the night.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.600
Oh, God.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.680
The show mod was a spinoff of all in the family.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.680
Yes, it was.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.280
The show Good Times was a spinoff of mod.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280
There's your trivia.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280
Really?

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280
Yes.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280
Now you know.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280
And knowing is half the battle.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280
Now I know that...

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.540
What was the show with Urkel?

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.960
Family Matters was a spinoff of Perfect Strangers.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960
No.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960
Full House.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960
No.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960
Full House.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960
No, the mother and...

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960
God damn it.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960
I will go throw down on this.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.600
Family Matters was the elevator person on Perfect Strangers.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.080
Yeah, and then the Full House baby was on the other show, so shut up.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080
You shut up.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080
Maybe they were all related.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.080
All right, anyway.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080
Hi.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080
We actually talk about video games, not just ABC Friday Night Lineup.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.080
Hey, we're not talking about food.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.080
That's right, and...

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.360
But Rob, it's Friday night, and the mood is right.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.360
Shut up.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360
I hate you.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.680
Gonna have some fun, show you how it's done.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.680
T-G-I-F.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.480
Okay, what the fuck, Alpha Kinanagram.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.200
Why do you...

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.920
Why don't I have a Jamaican accent?

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.160
Why do you ask this weird question?

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.160
All right, I want to point this out, though.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.600
But this Cleo is not the Reaper.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.600
It's...

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.120
But she's not Jamaican.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.340
I have something very important I need to point out, though.

01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:12.240
It is not actually T-G-I-F without...

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.400
Everybody sing along if you know it.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.400
I only know the chorus.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.400
We have a fast forward.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.400
I don't know this part.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.400
Yes, I want everyone at home to sing it.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.400
Step by step was amazing.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.400
Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.720
Dude, Suzanne Somers, the makers of the summer-sized diet.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.640
They did tell the baby what lesbians were.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.640
That was pretty cool.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.960
Step by step, day by day.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960
God, these intros were epic.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960
This is a two-minute-long intro for the show.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.400
This is the writers had to put in less...

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.240
Oddly enough, that's two minutes longer than my interest in the show.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.080
So, Loki, how about you say...

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.320
Loki, video games, so we get sick of TV and we turn on a video game.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.720
Loki, goddamn, save this show, please.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.160
And what would be called the complete opposite of step by step?

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.080
There was a new Fallout game announced.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:12.800
This one will be taking place in New Vegas, or I guess post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, which

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.260
we can only expect to be awesome.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:19.440
And it's apparently not a sequel to Fallout 3, but it's just another game in the Fallout

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.680
universe.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.920
In this one, do you start out as a fetus?

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.120
Maybe.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.000
I think it's actually going to go through the whole chain of evolution.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.280
You start off as an amoeba.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.160
It's half spore, half Fallout.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.160
Yeah, you have to make your way to the grand.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160
Well, I mean...

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160
You start out as a baby.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.160
What?

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.160
What?

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.160
Doctor, we can't hear you if you're not saying it in a mic.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:47.040
No, it's just because Melanie was shaking her hand, and I was like, oh, but no, but I was

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.880
like, no, but you started out as a baby, which I thought was dumb.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.760
A lot of people like the intro to Fallout, that you're a baby, because you can press

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.080
a button to make a baby noise over and over.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.120
I wonder if you can press a button to shit.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.120
Shut up.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.120
All right.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.200
For the record, this is the shit show, not the fuck show.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200
All right, look.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.200
What was I saying?

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.480
I don't remember what I was saying, because I'm drinking wine.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.680
Yeah, a new Fallout game.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680
Obvious.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680
Hello, hello, Obvious.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.680
Of course this is going to make me fall again.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.520
Sequel, the successive selling game?

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520
Just old.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520
Yeah.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.560
Is that Final Fantasy XIV coming out some day?

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.640
Oh, how about a new Mario game on the Wii?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.400
Oh, maybe a new Zelda game in the works?

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.520
I think they're all happening.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.480
Metroid Prime 4, you betcha.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.480
So anyhow.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:37.800
They need to do Metroid Primal, where Samus is a cat woman.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.180
This is going to be an interesting show, because I haven't eaten much today, so only a little

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:43.960
bit of wine that I'm drinking so far is kind of having an effect.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960
I had cake.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960
I want cake.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960
The cake was not a lie.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.560
It was made deliciously.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.040
Doctor, you keep asking me to take my pants off.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040
I'm going to do it.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040
Just you wait.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040
No!

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.520
For the love of God and all that is holy, keep your pants on!

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.160
Which in Jamie speak means, please take your pants off right now!

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160
Take off your pants and hide them on your head.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.320
Everyone on the internet, on the entirety of the internet, should be thankful that A,

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.320
this is a radio show, and B, that Justin.tv only shows video of our games now.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320
Aren't you glad you came tonight?

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.960
We're in slideshow mode tonight anyway.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.960
Yes it does.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960
Anyhow.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960
Oh, Microsoft.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960
Hi, Microsoft.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.520
Microsoft, with their pants on, had a press conference in Japan this week, and they were

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.720
saying, hey, Japan, we didn't forget about you, in fact, we've got 31 games that are

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.800
on their way for the Xbox 360 out here, including some big games that you guys are excited about.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:43.220
Magna Carta 2 in August, End of Eternity, which is a new RPG from Tri-Ace, also Mass

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:47.840
Effect is going to be making its way to Japan on May 21st, and I know that's a long time

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.200
since our release of it, but they've translated it apparently for Japan.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:58.440
Also virtual on Mega Man 9 for Japan in June, Space Invaders Extreme, King of Fighters 2002,

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.120
just lots and lots of new games coming out in Japan.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:08.240
They also added Pachinko to Mass Effect, which is pretty cool, because every game needs Pachinko.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.240
That's a complete lie.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.560
A little Pachinko mini-game.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.360
I thought that was the Wii that had that, Pachinko mini-games.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360
Alright.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:20.240
Anyway, so there you go, 31 new games coming to Japan, and with that, 31 more Xboxes sold

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240
in Japan.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240
That's it.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.240
31?

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240
Mm-hmm.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.240
In a row?

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.240
31 flavors, and then some.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240
Oooh.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240
Alright.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240
More news, please.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.760
How about GTA IV?

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760
How about it?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.040
It's, I mean, it's getting...

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.880
It stinks!

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.000
The peasants are revolting, yeah, they stink on ice.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Anyway.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
GTA IV is getting an Xbox 360 Elite bundle.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Get that off my foot.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Sorry.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It's where it landed.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Pass on down.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
New cup!

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Move down!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Anyway.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And no, we didn't go with the teacups, Rob.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.200
Did I mention Jamie's been drinking, too, so if this show gets really, really random,

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.200
I apologize in advance.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200
And it'll be just me.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200
The alcohol's gonna be burned off in about five seconds.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200
True.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.200
It is wine.

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:18.040
Anyway, there is going to be, later this year, a Grand Theft Auto IV bundle that is going

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:25.400
to be for $399, and we have no idea what it's gonna look like.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.160
It's basically just like how there's a new bundle that's been announced this week that's

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
coming out.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160
It's got a picture of the games on it.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.800
With, well, that's mocked up, but with Fallout, or not Fallout 3.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.240
Fallout 2 and Halo 3 that's gonna be coming out, they're gonna be doing this kind of every

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.400
few weeks.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.620
This one, they're speculating, is gonna come out maybe around the time of the new expansion

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:48.080
for Grand Theft Auto IV, sometime in the fall.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.480
That's actually what I was going to be saying.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.440
Well, you stopped talking, so I didn't know.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.440
My turn.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.440
Go.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.440
I'm done.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.440
All right.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440
Let me finish!

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440
Let me finish!

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440
Are you finished?

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440
Yeah, I'm finished.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:07.200
All right, well, something else that's coming out, and this can't be good in any way, because

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.240
it's Driver.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:17.580
Ubisoft has trademarked a new Driver game, and, you know, I'm just, I guess it can't

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:25.880
get worse than, you know, it is already, but it's apparently Driver 5, they recruit, and

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.680
assuming that it's coming to the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we are recruiting you to play

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.680
our shit game.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.800
I hope it's not as bad as all the other Driver games, except for the first one.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.820
The first game was awesome, second one was okay, third just went down into the pooper,

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.680
and then the rest just sucked from there on out.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.040
Oh well.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.680
But then again, I kind of want to play it, because I liked how crappy they were.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:58.360
All right, well, yeah, you liked how crappy the Driver games were, right?

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.240
Yes, I actually thought about picking up Driver 3 again, just to play, because it's just that

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.240
bad.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.240
How crappy it is.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.800
Yes, I have to remind myself.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.800
All right, sounds good.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.440
Lego Rock Band, we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago that it was rumored, but

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:21.040
fuck, we all knew it was true, and it was finally officially announced, Lego Rock Band

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.840
is happening.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.960
It's happening holiday of this year, as it was announced.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:29.440
Lego Rock Band is going to be coming out on the Playstation 3, the 360, the Wii and the

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.120
DS, and there's screenshots to prove it, and yes, it's Lego people in a rock band.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.680
Mid-November.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.960
By the way, some of the songs that will be included in the game, Song 2 by Blur, Carl

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.880
Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting, Europe with The Final Countdown, Good Charlotte with Boys

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.800
and Girls, and Pink with So What.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.320
So these are kind of like, I guess they're saying more kid-friendly songs, although I

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320
don't know.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320
Blur.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.680
Pink isn't the most kid-friendly artist in the world, she has some pretty nasty songs,

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680
you know what I mean?

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.680
Blur.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.680
You and Your Hand, hello, have you ever heard that song?

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680
Blur.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.760
I know you like Blur, but we don't know yet if you're going to be able to import these

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.280
songs into the other games, probably not, if they're trying to keep a kid safe, they're

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.620
probably going to keep the game segregated, don't you think?

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:17.560
It's also being published by Warner Brothers, Warner Games, and not EA, so there's another

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.280
problem with that too.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.480
I would hope that you'd be able to import them because I would like a little bit of

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.880
Kung Fu Fighting or Final Countdown in Rock Band 2, but I don't know.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.960
It doesn't sound bad, if the song list is good, I'd pick it up.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.140
By the way, in this game as well, apparently you're going to be able to collect pieces

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:38.840
in the regular mode where you build cooler vehicles and go to new venues by building

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.100
the pieces.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:44.680
There's an extra easy setting for children, I'm assuming, and apparently there will now

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:48.640
be challenges in this game, you'll be able to destroy a giant robot, summon a storm,

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:53.760
and demolish a skyscraper, all with your drums and guitar and vocals.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760
Awesome.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:58.120
It means you battle with the power of rocking out?

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:03.000
Still no word, however, on whether or not it's going to be able, you're going to be

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.120
able to do the whole exporting of the songs and all that.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120
So there you go.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.120
That's it.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.720
I could save the world for the power of my walking out.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720
Can you now?

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720
Yes.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720
You want to see?

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720
No, that's okay.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.240
Actually, I can't show anyone because then they'll have to kill you all.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.260
This makes me happy.

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:28.640
This makes my insides quiver with delight.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.640
What am I?

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.640
Ew.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.440
I was talking about my liver.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440
I was talking about my liver.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.720
I think I just burped.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.840
You made my liver quiver.

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.840
Hey, Justin TV's complaining it's boring because there's no games going on.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
Play something.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840
Is anyone going to play a video game?

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.840
Damn it.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840
Stop complaining.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840
Jesus Christ.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.560
Play a goddamn game, Rice Princess.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.560
Play something easy.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.560
It'll keep them entertained.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.560
I can't.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.560
It's all hard.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.560
Irene.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.880
I can try to play a game, but I'm doing the show.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.360
I'm drunk too, so I don't know if...

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360
No, I'm not drunk.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360
Dr. Mario.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360
Little buzz.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360
Just play.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.360
Rob's Wiener.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.480
Don't play Rob's Wiener.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.480
Don't do that.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.480
Hug what?

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.480
In lap?

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.480
Phone?

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.480
What?

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.480
Oh my word.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:11.480
We're translating.

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.480
Okay.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.960
Xbox Live Arcade.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:19.760
Well, SNK people are doing drugs and they're doing happy drugs that make me happy and want

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.760
to do drugs...

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.760
Wait.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.760
Wrong way.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.760
Anyway.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.400
A game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, which is called King of Fighters Sky Stage.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.400
Aw.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.200
What are you doing to me?

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200
Stop it.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.200
He's doing a shoulder.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.060
I'm being raped during the show, I want to point out.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.060
Shoulder rape.

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.720
I was just raped live on air.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.920
Because you took your pants off.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.120
I did not take my pants off.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.120
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.600
How many of us are not wearing socks and shoes?

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.480
Myself, you and Loki.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.160
Mississippi or G.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.160
Shut up and read your story.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.120
Anyway.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.520
The game is coming out called King of Fighters Sky Stage, which is your King of Fighters

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:07.440
characters flying around and shooting stuff out of their hands.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.680
They're bullets.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.160
They're shooting people.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.940
This article is actually really freaking wrong because this has been done before in a game

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:20.360
called Psychic Storm that I actually have on Turbo Duo.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.960
But yeah, you're flying around and you're shooting shit with the power of your psychoticness.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.040
Or if you're Kyo, then it's fire.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.120
Are we going to see Mai's tits or not?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120
That's the big question we want to know about this game.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:37.920
The only characters that I'm seeing in the screenshots here are Kyo and Athena.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.720
And Athena's shooting, it looks like eggs out of her head, like pink and white eggs.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.520
Wow.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.440
She's shooting dots, Dippin' Dots at people.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:53.800
Kyo is shooting fire.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.280
And as we all know, fire makes everything better.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.920
What are you playing, Rygar?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.680
Out of all the games she could play, she's playing Rygar?

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.680
Really?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.680
Really?

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.040
Dan was playing Rygar the other day on MAME.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:10.520
Yeah, that was the cool Rygar was the arcade one.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520
This one's the...

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520
The tickle monster...

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.880
Yeah, you need to be playing Karnov.

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.880
No, I'm just kidding.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.880
I actually really like Rygar.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880
I'm just kidding.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.400
Hey, just stop tickling me on air!

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.400
It's not funny!

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.400
Leave me alone.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.400
Rob.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.400
Alright, what?

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.400
Rob.

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.400
What?

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.400
Rob.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.400
Rob.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.400
What?

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.400
Rob.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.400
Stop it.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.400
Bob.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400
Bob.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.400
What?

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.040
Do you know what a crappy show this is tonight?

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.040
Because you holler not to get on top of it.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040
This is an awesome show!

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040
This is a poopy show.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.280
It's only poopy if you take off your pants.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.960
I swear to God, one more time and the pants are coming off.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.520
Irene is not shitting her pants.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.520
Rob.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.520
Rob.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.520
Rob.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.520
Rob.

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.520
Rob.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.520
Rob.

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.520
Rob.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.520
Rob.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.520
Rob.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.520
Rob.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.520
Rob.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.520
Rob.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.520
Rob.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.520
Rob.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.520
Rob.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520
Rob.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520
Well, that's my sort of stupid story.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520
Do you have one?

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.520
I know.

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.520
Loki, please save the show.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.520
Yes.

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.960
Muramasa Demon Blade lost its publisher earlier this week.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.440
Which is not good.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.760
But at least it picked up a new one.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.700
And that new publisher would be Ignition Entertainment.

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:27.840
However, because the publisher changed, the game will now be coming out in September instead

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.840
of June.

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.180
But hey, at least it's still coming out.

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.280
And it's actually kind of fun.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:37.280
I wish I knew what was going on. So English might help with that.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.280
English is useful. It is useful.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.280
Is this the same game you had here a couple weeks ago?

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.280
Yes. And I thought it was like coming out like next week

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.280
or something. It already had to get pushed back because of that? No, it wasn't coming out like next week

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.280
it was coming out in June originally.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.280
But yeah. So it came out in Japan already.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.280
Alright. A game that has not come out yet is Street Fighter 4.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.280
On the PC, not the consoles obviously, but

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.280
Street Fighter 4 has not made its way to the PC just yet. Apparently there is a PC version

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.280
in the works. You've probably heard about it before. Apparently the game is actually

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.280
going to be bundled with fighting sticks. Maybe. They haven't said one way or the other if it will

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.280
for sure or not yet. However, it has been announced on the official Japanese

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.280
Street Fighter 4 blog that they will be announcing the PC version's release

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.280
date on May 1st. So yes, I am reporting

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.280
an announcement of an announcement of a game that's already out.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.280
I mean really. Really. I'm blinking audibly

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:45.280
but the mic can't be picked up.

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.280
Is it really worth this much hype for the PC version of the game?

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.280
Don't get me wrong. I understand there are some PC gamers. Street Fighter 4 is a great game.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:57.280
There is an audience of people very happy about this. But really, we need a release date

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.280
for a release date. Come on. Get off your high horse

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.280
Capcom. Just tell us the date. Just tell us the date.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.280
Stop making people wait.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.280
Articles like this make me angry and when I get angry, naughty music plays

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.280
and it brings on a segment called The Effies of the Week.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:31.280
Music plays

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.280
I do want to point out Leo Shannon in the chat makes a good point. If Street Fighter 4 is out

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.280
on the PC, nude mods. That might be worth it. Alright, DarkSakura

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.280
your Effies of the Week.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.280
I'm attracted to being way too much from Disney. I have way too much shit to do.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.280
Fair enough. Way too much shit to do. All before Friday.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.280
Uh, Loki. I'm Fe2, the squirrel

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.280
that is bothering my cat because the squirrel has figured out

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.280
that we have bird seed on the porch and so I decided to try

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.280
to dig out all the sunflower seeds that are in there and my cat

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.280
can't get to it so it frustrates the hell out of her.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.280
I put more bird seed on the porch. But it's still funny.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.280
But yeah, since she can't give an F.U. because she's a cat

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.280
F.U. bird seed. Meow meow meow meow meow meow. Exactly. Meow meow

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.280
Meow. Uh, my F.U. of the week goes to

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.280
this program. Belly Belly, what's your

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.280
F.U. of the week? My F.U. of the week goes to going to a celebration

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.280
party, getting really stupid and doing something really stupid.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.280
That's never fun when we wake up in the morning and go, that was

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.280
stupid. Uh, Rice Princess

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.280
the doctor, do you have any F.U.s? Come over here and say them on the mic.

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280
F.U. Rob for not being pantless.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.280
Uh, yes Rice Princess. F.U.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.280
is shitting in your pants. That can be

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.280
a day ruiner right there. Alright. Good lord.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.280
Let's try to change the tune of the show a little bit

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.280
by going on into a classier segment, I hope. Because it's the part

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.280
where we let the listeners take over for a little bit and direct the show with their emails.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.280
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.280
Dark Soccer is going to open up the mailbag and jump on in and

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.280
hear from you guys, the listeners. Then I'll need a ton

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.280
of sanitizer. Oh my god. Anyway, first email.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.280
This comes from Rini.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:43.280
This is to chime in briefly on the recent feature they should have put

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.280
on the DSI that would have made Rob buy a DSI. Loki commented

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.280
that the music player sucks because it only supports AAC. In reality

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:55.280
AAC is superior to MP3. AAC's main strength is that it

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.280
can achieve the same quality of sound that MP3 would have at higher bit rates and

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.280
smaller file sizes. The whole albums in MP3 will decrease in megabytes when

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.280
they're converted to AAC. If there's something to bitch about

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.280
DSI sound, it's that it really

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.280
accepts M4A, MP4, and 3GP files

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.280
because they're the container for the AAC audio. For what it does

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.280
the DSI music player is actually competent feature-wise for a basic music player.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:27.280
There's no real playlist function, but who uses those on a portable

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.280
device? I have an iPhone. Just to

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.280
put this out there and not really make a big deal out of it, for anyone undecided on purchasing

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.280
a DSI, take it from someone who owns one. You're buying into potential.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.280
I'm sure there's tons of things that Nintendo can do and I'm hoping they'll

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.280
go through with some of the nearly 40 trademarks that were discovered

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.280
shortly after the Japanese unveiling. I'll link that later.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.280
But if you need a GBA slot

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.280
and don't want the fancy crap, get a light. The camera is shit. The browser is a

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.280
last resort, but the DSI shop sounds great and

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.280
I want to see what developers can do with the upgraded processor, larger memory,

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.280
and the camera for gamers.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.280
There's also more. There's a PS.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.280
I apologize. I'm still not sold. I mean, we need to see more.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.280
PS. Warriorware snapped is an insult both as a game and to the series.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:27.280
Don't spend 500 points free or bought on a game. You'll only play once.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.280
I didn't. PPS. Skye, when the next class

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.280
update for Team Fortress 2 comes out, you're getting my invite for a free weekend.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.280
Team Fortress 2 has classes attuned to your play style, can't aim for shit,

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.280
or maybe you've bought the orange box for $10 from Steam's weekend sale. And it's today.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.280
I wish I had. No, I already have Portal. That was the game I wanted most in there.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.280
I suck at Team Fortress.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:55.280
That's why you get the special classes. We'll see.

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:59.280
I'm just really horrible at first-person shooters. Words do not do my

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.280
suckage justice, if that makes sense.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.280
Unless you don't want to throw up every time you play one. That would be me.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.280
Or even watch someone play one shoot. More email.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.280
Hi, LLR! Hi, happy listener.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.280
I just thought I'd mention a few things. First off, there was a glaring error in the email

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.280
I sent you last week, specifically in regards to some of the Capcom games

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.280
with PSN. I had mistakenly said SNK vs. Capcom 2

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.280
instead of Marvel vs. Capcom. To my credit,

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.280
once I did catch the error, I left you a voice message, but I guess the message was overlooked accidentally.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.280
I don't do the voicemail, so whatever.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.280
I just want to correct that bit of news

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.280
for a fellow listener's sake more than anything else.

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.280
By the way, if you three haven't already, try picking up Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection.

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.280
Yes, I have it. I picked it up a few weeks ago, partially due to Bobby Blackwell's recommendation.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.280
In a nutshell, it's 40 games for 30 bucks. You really can't get much better than that

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.280
unless Sega pays us to take their games. Sarcasm.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.280
If I had to recommend one version

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.280
over another, I'd have to pick the PS3 version, although fundamentally the same.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.280
The 360 already has many of the games within the collection on the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:19.280
Nods are most of us have at least some of them.

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.280
How about multiple copies of each?

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.280
Really, there's no sense in getting two copies of the game for the same system.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.280
Yeah, there is. As with the PS3 version, this marks the first time

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.280
some of these games make an appearance, plus they have trophy support.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.280
Let's face it, Sony really needs to ramp up trophy support.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.280
I'm sorry, typos are...

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.280
Only downside to either version is that neither would have online co-op.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.280
It's not a deal breaker by any means, but it would have been a nice feature nonetheless.

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.280
Sorry this email ran so long, I'll try to keep future ones a tad shorter.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.280
This email was brought to you by your local 7-11, home of the Street Date Broken Games,

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.280
20 year old hot dogs, Slurpees, back galley crack dealers, and hookers.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.280
Who is this from? It's from Spazinator. Hi, Spazinator.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:11.280
Dude, I don't want a hooker. 7-11 is pretty awesome, actually.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.280
Just so I can smack one. Slurpees are amazing. Just so I can smack a bitch.

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:19.280
Anyway, last email. This is from

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.280
Jacob.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:27.280
Hey, OLR. I have not been in chat or called in before, but I have been

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.280
a regular podcast listener for a couple of years now. The show gives me some laughs

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.280
and a decent update on the gaming world. I wish I could game more like I used to,

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.280
but life demands a great deal of time. Oh fuck, yes it does. Preach. Truth.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.280
But I do try to keep up with some games that interest me.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:47.280
Mirror's Edge was a great concept, but way too short. I'm sick and tired of

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.280
shooters and have been playing Street Fighter IV. Dead Space was

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.280
made precisely for me, and

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.280
I fell in love with it instantly. Do you guys think EA will let the

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.280
team give it a sequel? I really like Gears and constantly wonder why the

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.280
OLR team bashes it. I don't think I've bashed it. I just don't care about it.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.280
I would say I bashed it. I respect the game, but I am terrible

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.280
at first person shooters, so that's why you don't hear me talk about it much. I think

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:19.280
I might have said something on a previous show where I just didn't get that into it, and I think the reason

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.280
why is just, you know, I was not a big fan of the whole cover, because

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:27.280
I'm only decent at first person shooters like Quake Live or Quake 3, where

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.280
I can just run out there like a crazy motherfucker and just blow away everybody.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.280
But Gears of War is all about the stealth and hiding and cover, and I get that

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.280
if you're a shooting game fan. I get why that's alluring. I get the strategy

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.280
involved in that. I get where the game is there. It's just not for me, because I suck

01:45:43.280 --> 01:46:11.280
at first person shooters really bad.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.280
Thank you, Jacob.

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:21.280
I'm gonna make the same recommendation I do to a lot of people at 360.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.280
Rez. Rez. Rez, especially if you're like a, you know,

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.280
kind of like a motion game that's always moving. I think Rez is, like, you know, you want

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.280
an outside the box type of game, I think Rez is a good start. If you don't already have it.

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.280
There's also plenty to download. Like, I mean, if you want to go old school, you do have Castlevania

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.280
Symphony of the Night, and you've also got,

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.280
I haven't played it, but I know a lot of people recommend Braid.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.280
I like Braid a lot. I definitely recommend Braid. But, you know, that's kind of, like, if he hasn't already got that,

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.280
if he's been listening to this show any amount of time or following the game blogs, as he probably does,

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.280
I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have that. Well, just to follow up, did you actually read the list

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.280
of, to the earlier email, did you read the list of

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:05.280
DSI

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.280
patents? Not the full list, no. Oh, lord.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.280
There's quite a number of these. There's actually a trademark for 3D Picross.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.280
You already have that.

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.280
That's already out. Is it? DS Navi, DS Phone, DS Plus,

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.280
DS Point, DS School, DS Speak, DS Shop, DS Shopping, DS Trainer,

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:29.280
DS Time, DS Walk. That doesn't mean they're making all these things. I know, but I just think it's funny.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.280
Protecting their rights, you know what I mean? I think it's funny.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.280
Just what they, it's gotta be that they have some ideas for it.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.280
One of them is DSI Sushine, which is DSI communication.

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:45.280
So, I think it'd be cool.

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.280
Alright, well if you want to send us a mail, email, sorry, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.280
us our mail. Mailbag, Orangelaunchradio.com. I hope we hear from you next week.

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.280
But please stop sending spam. Christ, we have to clean up so much

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.280
spam out of that box. In my personal box. I have so much spam.

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.280
Spam needs to die in a fire. I love Shadowgate, by the way, which is the game that's

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.280
I don't even know if Justin.TV's working anymore. I kind of suck at Shadowgate.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.280
This is the game that Eddie's playing right now. Good times. Do you have to go in the door and everything's on fire?

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.280
Alright. Well,

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.280
there's some interesting, we knew this was coming, but

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.280
it's getting more official day by day. The court has approved the Square Enix

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.280
bio of Eidos. So, assume we'll have

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.280
Square, Square Enix, or

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.280
I don't know how to, too many companies to combine together.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.280
Squito, Squinodos.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.280
Squitodox, there we go.

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.280
But anyway, so that's actually supposed to be happening pretty soon here.

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.280
That's neat, I guess.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.280
Maybe we'll see some better games come out from them.

01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.280
Maybe Tomb Raider. What has Eidos done for us lately? I

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:05.280
say, fuck them. Tomb Raider.

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.280
What has Eidos done for us lately? I say, fuck them.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.280
We need a new cute name for them, though. Squinixdos.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:17.280
Squinodos. Squinodos.

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.280
Okay. Well, they also own Taito, so. Squinodos Taito.

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.280
I don't, this is getting too... Taito!

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.280
Squitox. Just call it Square. Square Idots. Square and Friends.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.280
I like that. Square and Friends. I like that.

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.280
This Square is a lie. Well, alright, I don't know if, you might have to think of a name for this merger,

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.280
but apparently, Warner Brothers Interactive is contemplating

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.280
a purchase of Midway, which as you know, has just been hemorrhaging money

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:49.280
and they're in the news every week about how just, you know, in crappy shape the company is

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.280
in. We'll call that a clusterfuck. Those poor guys. Warner, by the way, lost

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.280
the Eidos bid to Squinix, so Warner apparently is

01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.280
now looking at possibly picking up Midway. It's an anonymous source, it's tipping

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.280
that's leaked to all these blogs. Warner is pretty confident that they will get Midway.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.280
They are ready to put the money on the table. Possibly the whole

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.280
30 million bucks to pick up Mortal Kombat and stuff,

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.280
I guess. I don't know what else Midway's got, besides

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.280
their pretty cool collections and things.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.280
That's what they get. They could be making, you know,

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.280
instead of, well, not pinball tables because Williams abandoned us, the bastards,

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:33.280
but they could be making, you know, tons of slot machines, but no.

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:37.280
What if that means we'll have a

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.280
Mortal Kombat vs. DC 2? Ooh. Because doesn't Warner

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.280
and DC kind of have a thingy? Yeah, Warner Brothers. There you go.

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:49.280
We'll see. Moving on, a little more news, then we're going to get to the

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.280
Skype line in just a little bit. Well, how about

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.280
something that should make everyone happy?

01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:01.280
PAX details! And everyone said yay!

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.280
Yay, I hope I can afford it this year. September 4th,

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.280
in Seattle, we will be having PAX, and they are going

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.280
to have over 60 exhibitors. That means, again, Microsoft,

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.280
Nintendo, Valve, Blizzard. Sony isn't on the list,

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:21.280
and who cares? They weren't there last year. Oh no, they were there last year.

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.280
That's right, that was the first time we played LittleBigPlanet. That's interesting, they're not on the list

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.280
yet. Also, they're going to

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.280
have Freezepop, Jonathan Colton, yay!

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:37.280
Would you have to do another MySpace photo? So we're all the same shit as last year?

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.280
Well, some different people. There's MC Frontalot, of course.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.280
Anamanaguchi, who was there last year, Metroid Metal, and

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.280
Paul and Storm. So not everyone there is listed, but...

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:53.280
Like, four of those bands were all there last year, which is fine. They're all great.

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:57.280
Don't get me wrong, it's all great bands. This time, I'm going to go see Jonathan Colton, and none of you can

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.280
stop me. Alright, you go on with your bad self.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.280
Because he's awesome!

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.280
He has cool hair. I hope we can afford to go to PAX, we'll see though. E3 is coming up

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.280
though. By the way, OLR will be at E3. At least myself

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:17.280
and Loki, DarkSakuras, and maybe at this point, but we're all confirmed. I'm broke, so if someone was to pay, then I'll go.

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.280
Well, good luck. We're all broke.

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.280
But E3... I already got my confirmation and my tickets

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:29.280
and my stuff, all booked. You got your ticket? Oh, like flight tickets?

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:33.280
I have my flight, I've got my Disneyland, shit, I'm ready to go.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.280
You're good to go. Ready to rock.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.280
So, let's see. There's some interesting stuff going down with

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:45.280
Gamefly. Apparently, they are filing suit

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:49.280
against the United States Postal Service over breakage rates

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.280
and preferential treatment. Their complaint is that

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.280
basically the USPS has adapted a new practice

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.280
of manually pulling out the DVD mailers of both

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.280
Netflix and Blockbuster online for special processing.

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.280
However, Gamefly has tried to get the same kind of treatment, but it has been denied.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:13.280
And also, they've noticed that there's

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.280
quite a bit of in-transit breakage and also theft.

01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:21.280
And they're not too happy about that. And they've actually tried to take some

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.280
measures to fix that. I wonder if the Postal Service is hiring.

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:29.280
Change the color of their mailers and stuff like that, but

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.280
it's still a problem. What color are their

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.280
mailers? Are they bright neon green and orange? They used to be orange, and now they're white.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:41.280
No wonder they stick out, you know? Well, they're probably trying to save money

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.280
on the ink. I'm surprised Netflix doesn't have the same problems with those

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:49.280
very distinctive red envelopes. I'm sure they do, but games are more valuable than

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.280
movies. Would you steal games if you worked for the Postal Service?

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.280
If I wanted to be fired and arrested, yeah.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:01.280
Just curious. I didn't know you should. No, I probably wouldn't, because

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.280
you know, it's too easy to find them online.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.280
Alright, hey, we've talked a little bit about DJ Games coming out later this year.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.280
Of course, with the whole dispute going on with Scratch and DJ Hero. There's a

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.280
DS game, actually, that's going to be incorporating DJing that's come out.

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.280
It's coming from a French developer called Game Life. They have just announced a game this week called

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.280
DJ Star, and it's coming out this year for the Nintendo DS.

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.280
It's going to be published by Deep Silver in Europe and Australia, and in this game you're going to start

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.280
as a DJ, and you gain experience, and you start as a lowly club DJ, and

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.280
finally you go stadiums with tons and tons of people. You are going to mix

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.280
over 40 famous tracks in different genres, and you can actually save

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.280
your creations on the DS card, and you can trade your creations with

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.280
your friends on wireless communications. It's also coming out over here also

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.280
by Deep Silver in July. It was supposed to be coming out in two weeks,

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.280
which sucks, but, you know, now, later on.

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.280
Interesting. I'd be curious to check this out. I want to hear more about it

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:05.280
and what the game is in it, because I didn't hear a lot about what the game is. It's just that you can

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:09.280
mix stuff. Well, what's the game? That's what I kind of want to know right now.

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.280
It's hard to tell. We'll see.

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:17.280
Anyway, a few more stories, then we're going to get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.280
our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. XLink would like to point out

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.280
that the penalty for stealing mail is up to five years in jail and a $250,000

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:29.280
fine. I didn't say you should steal mail. I was just curious if, you know,

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.280
people apparently are getting away with it. So, yep.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:37.280
Let's move on. DarkSakura. Um, do you want a gun?

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.280
Not really, because I'm one of those people that I'm afraid if I had a gun in my house, I'd shoot myself with it

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:45.280
somehow. Like, I'm seriously deathly afraid that if a gun is in my house

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:49.280
I will be killed with it. That's why you need to take gun safety courses. No, but I don't,

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:53.280
that doesn't necessarily mean I will be the one killing myself with the gun. I would like to think I'm not

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:57.280
that stupid, where I'm like, oh, gee, I need to get out my gun and dust it.

01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:01.280
La la la, dust the gun. Ooh, fuck, I just shot myself in the face. Dust it with live ammo in it.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.280
That's kinda retarded. I just feel like I'm, I'm, I'm the stupid

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:09.280
person that would do that. Or that I'm also paranoid if I had a gun in my house and somebody would break into my house

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.280
know where my gun is and shoot me with it. Like, I'm just, I know it's my, probably an irrational fear

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.280
I have a fear of a gun in my house. I was actually just trying to say that as a lead into the story.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:21.280
Sorry, I'm buzzed.

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.280
Anyway, um, a, uh, a middle school kid

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.280
brought in a gun and caused, um, the

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.280
school to be locked down, but you know what he brought it for? He brought it to trade

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.280
for PSP. Sure, trade for PSP, rob for

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.280
PSP, it's all the same. He swiped it out of his, um, dad's collection, the gun

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:45.280
was unloaded, but he did bring ammo with him, and he was gonna trade it.

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.280
Um, so, also his dad said a second gun was missing

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.280
and the kid's locked up in juvie right now, so, stupid child.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.280
Um, how did he get the gun? Stupid father. I was gonna say,

01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:01.280
is it just, I mean, the parent's slightly depraved in your shoes. You leave this shit locked up!

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.280
First, okay, first of all, if you're going to have

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.280
a gun in your house, if you're going to have multiple guns, that's why you have a gun locker.

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.280
That's why you make sure they are always unloaded,

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.280
clean, with the safety on, and locked up in your damn gun locker, and if you

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.280
keep a loaded gun by your desk, you make sure the safety's on. And I just wanna say,

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.280
even though I have my rant that I will not have a gun in my house, that doesn't mean

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.280
that somebody else can't have a gun in their house. There is a, like, this thing called the

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.280
Tonsitution that allows you to have a gun in your house if you want.

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.280
The Tonsitution? The Tonsitution, is that what I call it? Shut up!

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.280
Look, my point is, you can have a gun in your house if you want,

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.280
I choose to not have one in mine, and I'm allowed that choice.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.280
By the Tonsitution. I, by the way, do still think

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.280
that Penn and Teller said it best, that you take every woman in America

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.280
and give them each a pink gun, and it's pink because they said so,

01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.280
and then it doesn't matter if they keep it, give it away, whatever, no one's gonna know

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:05.280
who has the gun, and it'll make a safer society.

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.280
Make guns that match handbags, yeah,

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.280
perfect. Actually, I wanna have a gun. I really want a gun, but I would,

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.280
but because you can't have a concealed weapon, I would wear it on a holster.

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.280
Just everywhere you go, don't bring it here.

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:25.280
I'd leave it in my car. Oh yeah, you can leave it in the car, there's no money in my house.

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.280
Because I would be afraid, I would be shot with it. Like during a break or something, like you'd trip and fall and the gun would go off

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.280
and shoot me in the foot, like I just, I have these horrible, hey Rob,

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.280
look at me juggle these guns! Exactly!

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:41.280
Like, Loki would be like, can I touch your gun, Dark Sakura?

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:45.280
Bang! Shoot me in the face. Let me throw the gun at Rob, and hopefully it'll go off

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.280
and shoot him. First of all, if I had a gun, I would not

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.280
just... Ooh, look at my gun! Ooh!

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.280
Look at this, it's loaded and everything, I'm gonna look down the barrel, rah!

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:01.280
Why don't you put it in your mouth? My gun would be pink, my gun would be black and

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:05.280
hot rod red. Ho ho, I'm Kurt Cobain.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.280
Like, I think I should, like, you know how some people are afraid of water, some people

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:13.280
are afraid of heights? People are seriously

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:17.280
afraid of water! People with green skin named Alfalo. We all have a friend that's

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:21.280
afraid of water, like, swimming type water, and that type of stuff.

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:25.280
No, but I mean, like, being surrounded by water, not drinking water,

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:29.280
bodies of water, oh god, you guys are jerks. Alright, no, I'm talking about, I think I

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:33.280
seriously have a fear of guns, being pointed at me.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:37.280
That's probably a rational fear, but it's actually

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:41.280
a rational fear. No, I think it's irrational, I think

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:45.280
that it's paranoid. It is! First of all, I'll tell you this right now, Rob, if you've

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:49.280
got someone who has a gun, who is, who

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.280
knows how to use it, and knows how to take care of it, you are not in any

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:57.280
danger. I don't even want a chocolate gun, like that's...

01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:01.280
God, you're a baby!

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:05.280
You're just now learning this? No, but I like saying it.

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:09.280
I'll bring a chocolate gun into your house and it'll shoot you.

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.280
It'll shoot you with yummy! You'll get shot with tastiness.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:17.280
I don't even like water guns.

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:21.280
I'm not joking, I don't even like water guns. Rob, you would have, you would have hated

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:25.280
you would have hated my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil.

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.280
I had the Resident Evil one and I carried around two very

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.280
realistic looking uzis. SH2100Matt says, so wait,

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.280
was Rob freaked out when Loki brought his airsofts to the studio? Um...

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.280
Ah! Ah! Kinda, actually, like, when he

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:45.280
raises them up, I do get a little nervous. Yes, I don't want to get shot in the ass.

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.280
Why do you think I don't go out to play? It doesn't hurt that bad!

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.280
I don't like, why do you think I haven't gone out to play? I'm just gonna come in and shoot

02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:57.280
him one of these days so he can see, he can see how not bad it is. Why would you do that?

02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:01.280
That's it. Don't shoot Rob!

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.280
Remember kids, don't shoot Rob. Rob is food. Shoot me in a

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:09.280
video game all you want, because I know the difference. That's it, that's it. Next week, Nerf battle.

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:13.280
This is not Nerf battle. This is not Nerf battle. Get Rob

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.280
over the gun thing by shooting him with everything you can find.

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.280
That is just gonna make it worse. For the

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.280
record. Okay, no,

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.280
I say I'll bring a Nerf gatling gun and shoot Rob

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.280
in the ass. They have those. I know, I saw it, I wanted one.

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.280
I have a Nerf revolver.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:41.280
Okay, I have to ask, I'm sorry, chat room, I haven't read from chat in a while and of course they're all

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.280
teasing me right now, but what I want to know, am I,

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:49.280
somebody in chat has to understand what I'm saying about guns.

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.280
Like is somebody in chat willing to admit that they have a gun fear as well?

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.280
Please, somebody. Just make it up so I don't feel so bad.

02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:01.280
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what my thing about the gun safety

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.280
hysteria is, is that I think that the gun safety

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:09.280
hysteria is bullshit, plain out bullshit.

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.280
I think that

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:17.280
people, if you were in an area where

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.280
it is listed in big labels that no one there is gonna be able

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:25.280
to protect themselves, we know what that says to a criminal mind,

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.280
fair fucking game. If you were in a place where you

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:33.280
know that anyone could be armed, are you gonna really try something

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:37.280
unless you're phenomenally stupid? That's what I have to,

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.280
people are phenomenally stupid, and if someone breaks into my house

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.280
they deserve to get their ass shot. End of story.

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.280
Maybe it's not guns I have a problem with, because like Cuzar is a lot of fun.

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:53.280
It's projectiles I have a problem with, I don't like projectiles.

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.280
I would not like that either, no. What if I had rocks?

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:03.280
Can I read some comments from chat?

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.280
Xlink says I have a gun fear, that is why I have a gun.

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:11.280
Digital says everyone fears guns, sir.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.280
Brad says I don't owe one because I'm too damn hot headed.

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.280
I like old people says yes Rob you are a pussy, well meow meow meow.

02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.280
Decipher says I hate guns.

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.280
Reisman says you gotta say this over here, because we can't hear you otherwise.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.280
Someone's afraid of guns

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.280
so he has a gun? If you're afraid of being shot with one you shoot

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:39.280
before you get shot. That could be it, I could see that. I mean, but I'll tell you what

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:43.280
the whole rationale, and see honestly, if you don't feel comfortable

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.280
with a gun, don't have one. You live in America, that's your fucking right.

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.280
Shake your hand ma'am, I'm with you on that, yes.

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:55.280
At the same time, if you feel that you either want a gun

02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:59.280
or feel like you need to protect yourself, say that you live in a dangerous neighborhood,

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.280
but say you've been living there for, like those older people who live in what was once a nice neighborhood

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.280
that's gone downhill, who want to have some means of protecting

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.280
themselves, then you can protect yourself.

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.280
For example, I know a lot of women who carry a gun

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:19.280
because, I mean let's face it, on a general level

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.280
physically, men for the most part are stronger

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.280
physically again than a woman, unless she's a

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.280
black belt and can kick him in the face. But still, you have to deal

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.280
with, it's the great equalizer.

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:39.280
I think that as long as

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.280
you, as long as you feel

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:47.280
that you want to

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.280
have a gun, you know, and of course live in America,

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:55.280
get a gun, but make damn sure you know how to use it, make damn

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.280
sure you know how to keep it safe, and make really sure that your kids can't

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.280
get to it. I'm going to get a phaser. Dude, phasers are awesome.

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:07.280
Always set on stun, and a light saber, but that

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.280
wait, that can kill people, no just a phaser. And by the way,

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:15.280
act deft, that's the second amendment, well first amendment is, yeah

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:19.280
you have a voice to use it, second amendment is, god damn it, we can have guns if we fucking want them.

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:23.280
S.S.A. I want to hear Matt ask, what about a marshmallow gun?

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.280
Act deft says the OLR constitution second amendment

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:31.280
don't shoot wrong. Yeah don't, I like that, that should actually be rule number

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:35.280
one. Here's the thing, even the marshmallow gun, like it depends on what

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:39.280
speed the marshmallows are traveling at, like if it's very slow speed, I'm okay with that because

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.280
they're going to open my mouth, but if they're flying really fast, it could actually like, you know,

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:47.280
kind of spank my butt a little bit if they hit me in the ass, I don't think I'd

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.280
like that. You can spank my butt all you want, just

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:55.280
don't do it with a fucking gun. Rob

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:59.280
does not want to get pistol whipped in the ass. Okay, okay,

02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:03.280
we really are though. What happened to video games? I don't know, we were talking about

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:07.280
we were talking about why the, I think it was because it was talking

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:11.280
about why the butt head dad didn't have his guns locked up.

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.280
So let's get back to video games, but

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:19.280
speaking of the PSP,

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:23.280
which we were talking about a while ago, they've added a new

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.280
firmware to the PSP, 5.5, other than

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:31.280
breaking homebrew stuff if you, you know, want to upgrade or whatever,

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:35.280
it will also allow you to have a few other things, including the

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.280
information board, which is already available right now on the Playstation 3 cross-media bar,

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:43.280
and also they're going to add some internet security, if you happen to

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:47.280
be a little kid, you can use the Trend micro security

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.280
to block certain websites, and also filter out other

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:55.280
things as well, including all that nasty porno, because

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:59.280
the PSP is a gateway to porn. What if I want all that nasty porno? Well then

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:03.280
don't enable the optional security. Oh, okay.

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.280
So, and then also you'll be able to do an internet search for games directly

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:11.280
from the cross-media bar as well, and they've included some memory stick improvements, including

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:15.280
your ability to be able to create and access sub-folders

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.280
on your Memory Stick Pro Duo for music, videos, and photos, which is awesome.

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:23.280
Because, you know, folders

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.280
make things nice and neat for all that porn that's on there.

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.280
Is this what you're using your PSP for, is porn?

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.280
Porn and RiftTrax audio samples.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.280
Nice. Oh, I'm so sad I missed the last little RiftTrax thing.

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.280
Oh, it was awesome. Are you doing it again this week? Maybe I'll come. Uh, probably not this week, but we'll

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:47.280
find a new one. Sad. Alright, well anyhow. Yes, Twilight is

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.280
made much better with people making fun of it. I have not yet seen Twilight.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:55.280
Line. Anyhow, one more story for you guys,

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:59.280
and then we are going to open up the Skype line. I'm almost a little afraid to open it up tonight,

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:03.280
but we are going to open it up at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:07.280
Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with something else that's kind of related to the PlayStation Portable.

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:11.280
It's about Skype, because you guys are going to be calling us on Skype soon. But it actually is not about

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:15.280
the PSP. It's about the DS.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:19.280
You see, a Skype representative was recently speaking to the blog

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:23.280
TechRadar. I almost said TechRadar, but it's TechRadar. Apparently,

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:27.280
the technical possibility to have Skype on the DS is there.

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:31.280
It's just not planned. The exact comment, quote, whilst we can't comment on

02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:35.280
any future plans to bring Skype. Oh my.

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:39.280
Oh my god. We have had butts

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.280
black. Wow, we just had a huge accident in studio.

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.280
What the fuck? The doctor

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.280
just got shot. What the fuck? He fell on his tailbone, shoving

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.280
his spine through his trachea. Who brought the gun into my house?

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.280
All over Irene. Alright, no. Oddly enough,

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:03.280
his blood is rainbow colored. Doctor, could you please explain what just happened to cause

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.280
such chaos? No, I just thought... Did I forget where the chair

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:11.280
was? She moved the chair when he got up. Did she really do that old

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.280
prank where the doctor went to sit down and Rice Princess pulled the chair back?

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.280
Yes. Oh my god.

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.280
It's because you unplugged your

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:27.280
controller.

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:31.280
I just... Can we just...

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:35.280
Awesome.

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.280
I know. I'm so done with this show. Alright.

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:43.280
What was I gonna say about... Oh yeah.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:47.280
Quote, whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype to

02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.280
Nintendo's DSi, it would technically be possible. There it is.

02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:55.280
It's not gonna happen. Yeah, it's not gonna happen because Nintendo wants to do

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.280
their own proprietary thing, I bet. They were already showing it... Shut up.

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.280
They were already showing it a couple years ago at E3.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.280
Which means they'll never... Well, that was the whole... They have voice chat in other games.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.280
You know, this is a tech demo, but I don't think they're gonna ever do Skype.

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:15.280
Well, if you feel so terrible, why did you

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.280
pull the chair away?

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.280
If I had a gun, I would shoot you in the foot right now.

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:27.280
That's what I would do. No, you're right. I was scared of the gun.

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.280
I'd be afraid that the gun would suddenly point at me while I'm trying to pull the chair. I'll shoot you in the face of the marshmallow

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.280
spade gray.

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.280
Alright. I'm... Fuck it.

02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:43.280
We're opening the Skype line. 1877 game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.280
OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.280
Hi, Legend of Zaku. Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind? Planet Chaos, may you help us?

02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.280
Nothing much, just chilling tonight, just trying to bear the stifling

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:59.280
heat in New York City. We've had a weird weather week in California

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.280
as well. It was like super duper hot one day, and then it was rainy and cold the next, and now it's

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.280
hot again. Go figure. I don't get it. Yeah, apparently it was like 90 degrees.

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:11.280
But yeah, just trying to snag some

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.280
other deals, like the orange box for 10 bucks. Finally, I got that shit.

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.280
What an awesome deal that was. Hold on. I have to read this comment in chat real quick, because it's

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.280
funny. SSJ100Matt says, Irene is now Jerk Princess.

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:27.280
There we go. Yay, Jerk Princess. Alright, I'm sorry, Zaku. So, yes,

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:31.280
orange box is $10. It's the deal everyone's been talking about this weekend.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.280
Did you pick it up? I just picked it up

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.280
like, what, 15, 20, like half an hour ago. I've

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.280
yet to download it yet, but hopefully I'll be doing that tonight or tomorrow.

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.280
Just waiting to see whether or not the SS's job of mine will actually extend.

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.280
Well, so you've been working recently. Good for you. Congrats.

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.280
Well, working temporarily, but you know, working for Uncle Sam for that time being.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:59.280
But yeah, besides buying orange box, I just indulged in

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:03.280
DJ Max Technica location test today up in

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.280
New Rochelle, not far from the Bronx. Tell us a little bit about DJ Max

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:11.280
and the arcade for those that don't know much about it. Let's just put it this way.

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.280
It's really hard to pick up, especially if you've been playing a lot of rhythm

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.280
games. Unless you have a lead beat agents experience,

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:23.280
it's going to be really hard to match the touching and everything.

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:27.280
The whole aspect of the game is quickly forward.

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:31.280
It took me a while to just pick it up, but then most of the time it was just

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.280
failing the harder songs, because then when you touch certain things, you have to

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.280
make sure you either touch it on that

02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:43.280
note right there on the screen, or you've just got to tap it

02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.280
a few times to the beat, follow the curse around.

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.280
It's basically a bigger,

02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:55.280
it's a larger version of a lead beat agents. Put it that way.

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:59.280
Interesting. I know you're a big fan of the Beatmania series

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.280
and Beatmania 2DS. How does it compare to Beatmania for you?

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:07.280
It's kind of different. I don't think it compares. It's just more like instead of using keys,

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.280
actually hard keys, it's more using a lot more fingers.

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.280
The fact that you have to touch

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.280
every part of the screen wherever you have to.

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.280
It's kind of like how Konami is doing with that game.

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.280
The fact that you have to touch the screen

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.280
to hit the notes, instead of having to hit a particular key on the screen.

02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:35.280
I know it's completely foreign, as I said.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.280
It takes a while for certain players to pick it up. I know I basically

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.280
pissed away six bucks on that game at $1.50 a game.

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:47.280
It was as much as I could today.

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:51.280
I got to do it again, seriously.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.280
Anything else you want to share with our listeners before we move on to another call?

02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.280
Dynasty Warriors, Gundam 2, get it. I don't care what they say, just get it now.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.280
It's a lot better than the first one, multiplayer.

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.280
Thank you so much, Zaku, for the call. Take care, buddy.

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.280
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:15.280
OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.280
Hello, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is the guy that hopes Comcast is going to let him stay on the stream long enough.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:23.280
Well, welcome. I'm glad to see your audio is working tonight, too, Jason.

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.280
I know you've been a long time listener to the show. Tonight's been a little crazy, hasn't it?

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.280
No worse than I've heard before.

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.280
Two quick things before the actual question.

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.280
The new Dragon Ball game and the releases. Do you know that Dragon Ball Z is being re-released

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:43.280
as a series in Japan? No, I did not know that.

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.280
Well, that makes a ton of sense. It's freaking classic.

02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.280
Is it being re-related? Yeah, but everything is a classic, and they're not re-releasing everything.

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.280
At any rate, Fullmetal Alchemist is being re-released as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.280
Dragon Ball Z is being re-released as Dragon Ball Kai.

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:03.280
They both started at the start of April, and

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:07.280
both of them are a re-released series that are supposed to be more

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:11.280
closer in story to the manga.

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.280
Are they re-animated? To an extent, yeah.

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:19.280
It's done like the Evangelion movies that are coming out, right?

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.280
I have no idea. Well, with the Evangelion movies, they're pulled a lot of original

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:27.280
footage and then added a new animation. I don't know about Dragon Ball Kai,

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.280
but you can watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood at

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.280
Funimation is broadcasting that subbed.

02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:39.280
Nice! Rama is saying re-released in HD with extra footage.

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.280
Do you want? I don't know about Kai, but Fullmetal Alchemist.com

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:47.280
has links. I've been meaning to watch it, I just haven't had the time.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:51.280
Random ask question, does this have anything to do with the recent Dragon Ball Z movie

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.280
that came out to theaters? I don't think so, and I sure as hell hope not,

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.280
because the movie looks like an absolute travesty, but then again, I never liked Dragon Ball.

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.280
I have to say, I was one of the people that had

02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:07.280
fifth generation fan subs of Cell Game and everything.

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.280
I will say, Dragon Ball Z on the Super Nintendo was the first import

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:15.280
game I ever played, because they actually had a little place around here,

02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:19.280
an independent movie store before Blockbuster

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:23.280
and Hollywood kind of stomped everything out that used to rent import games.

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:27.280
It was kind of crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry Jason, what was your question?

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.280
One more quick thing. WarioWare myself, let me guess,

02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:35.280
you play WarioWare games with yourself using the DSI camera? I think it is the exact

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.280
same DSI game that we've already got over here, I'm fairly certain.

02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:43.280
I don't know for sure. The real question,

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.280
I know that the only classic Sierra games I've played have been Space Quest,

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.280
I've seen bits and pieces of King's Quest, but that's been about it.

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:55.280
Why does the name Sarian sound so familiar? I know it's in the title, like Space Quest

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.280
1 was the Sarian encounter, was that a race or something in that series?

02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:03.280
I'm assuming it's a race in the game.

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.280
I'm sure they named the website after something that you see in one of those games.

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.280
Yeah, I should go look at it, because that name is so familiar, but I just don't remember it

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:15.280
from the series. But then again, it's also been upwards of five or six years since I've played it.

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:19.280
I remember seeing the news about Sarian.net

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:23.280
and I thought it was awesome, I still have yet to check it out. Again, the whole

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:27.280
not enough time thing. Just want to point out the subtitle of the original Space Quest

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.280
game is Space Quest the Sarian Encounter. Yeah, and I think I've heard it

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:35.280
in a few other places throughout the series. I beat Space Quest 1,

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:39.280
the VGA remake, but I don't know, I just don't remember it.

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.280
I've mentioned a lot how interfaces like Home on the PS3

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:47.280
don't work, because they're just an interface and there's nothing to do.

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:51.280
But whatever they did to put the applications in

02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:55.280
Sarian.net sounds absolutely amazing. I mean, yeah

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.280
it's the next step up of what Xbox Live is right now

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.280
with the partying and all of that kind of stuff. Where even if you're not actually playing the game

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.280
you can be around and congregate and do whatever

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:11.280
in a game interface that's, I guess, familiar assuming you've actually

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:15.280
played the game before.

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:19.280
Space Quest, not so much. Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, yes, tons.

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.280
I've played every single King's Quest game.

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.280
And I've played every single Space Quest game. Oh, funny.

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:31.280
Alright, well Jason, we've got to wrap up to get some more

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.280
calls. Do you have any other quick thoughts? You talk too fast

02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:39.280
sometimes. I'm sorry, do you have any other quick, do you have any

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:43.280
other quick thoughts for our listener? That's the second time I've been told that this week.

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:47.280
It's my nature. Yeah, it is. But you're clear in your

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:51.280
speaking so it's not a bad thing. I know, I'm like the Micro Machines dude.

02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:55.280
Alright, see you later Jason, thanks for the call.

02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:59.280
John Machido. Bye. Is that his name? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm like that guy. Maybe I should

02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:03.280
addition to be the Micro Machines. See, I do trip up on my words sometimes though and I talk really fast.

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:07.280
I think it would be easier if I was actually reading from a script.

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:15.280
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Oh, hey

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:19.280
guys, what's up? This is Dan Shadow. Hey, Dan Shadow, what is on your mind? Greetings and

02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:23.280
celebrations. Greetings, I don't think we've had you on the show before. What's on your mind?

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:27.280
Oh, shoot, nothing much. Hey, you guys were just talking about the guns and all the fun

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:31.280
stuff and you made me think of this Penny Arcade

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:35.280
comic that came out recently making fun of Rock Band Nirvana.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:39.280
Ha, I saw this, yes. I did see that.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.280
Did you take it down? I couldn't find it. It was posted on my friends list.

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.280
Let me see if I remember which friend of mine posted it

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.280
too. It wasn't that long ago. Why don't you describe the comic for our

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:55.280
listeners who haven't seen it. Okay, so the first panel, they

02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.280
have the Rock Band box and it looks just like a Rock Band box that says Rock Band Nirvana.

02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.280
Second panel, one guy pulls out the guitar controller.

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:07.280
Everything looks cool. Third panel, the guy has a weird little bass and he

02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:11.280
pulls out this giant shotgun controller and that's it.

02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:15.280
Yeah, because it's Rock Band Nirvana edition. I found the comic, by the way, on my friends page

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:19.280
of LiveJournal and I linked it in chat. I don't know if they pulled it from the original

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:23.280
Penny Arcade site, but it's still on their server. April 22nd was the day.

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:27.280
Okay, sweet. Yeah, I tried finding it again and that was

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:31.280
wrong, yet I couldn't help but laugh how bad it was.

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:35.280
You know, it was to me one of those things where it's like, you know, sometimes

02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:39.280
we find solace in death through humor, like how people laugh at

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:43.280
funerals and stuff like that. I don't think anybody, you know, it's kind of one of those

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:47.280
oh wow, too soon, but I mean, you know, obviously it's been many, many years since

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:51.280
that happened, but I think it's one of those things where

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:55.280
if you can't laugh at it, what can you do, if that makes sense. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, totally.

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:59.280
And didn't it come out on the anniversary of his death or something like that? Did it

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:03.280
really? That would be kind of interesting. Well, I thought it was just topical because

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:07.280
you know, they have the Rock Band Beatles game coming out with the Beatles paraphernalia. I just kind of

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:11.280
talked it up to that. I didn't even realize there might be a correlation with the anniversary of Kurt Cobain's

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:15.280
death or anything like that. Either way, it seems like the timing is great on all

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.280
points. Yeah, so it was kind of one of those

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:23.280
that's so wrong kind of things where you're just kind of like laughing through it.

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:27.280
Yeah, totally. I told my friend about it and he just shook his head

02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:31.280
and laughed and walked away. Exactly. That's exactly what that kind of comic should be.

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:35.280
Well hey, anything else going on in your gaming week? Stuff you've been up to?

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:39.280
Oh yeah, definitely. I am very much into Valkyria Chronicles

02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:43.280
on the PS3. I'm loving that game. Is it really cool

02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.280
because I played the demo and I had a lot of fun with the demo and I kept telling myself I was going to

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:51.280
go get the full game but I just never did. I think it's on sale now though so I might have to check it out.

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.280
Yeah, totally. It's the next step

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:59.280
in a tactics game that is much needed because when you think of

02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:03.280
tactics game, you always think of the same, nearly the same style from what Final Fantasy

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.280
Tactics did. What is this next step that makes you so sold

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:11.280
on this game? Well, it starts off and shows the overview map

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:15.280
so you see all the pieces and then you get to move around in

02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:19.280
nearly real time. You still have your spaces or whatever movements

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:23.280
people can make. The setting is fresh almost. It's very different. It doesn't have that

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.280
everyone's kind of walking in place look to it. The animation is pretty good

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:31.280
and just the way it works, I mean every unit likes other people

02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:35.280
or dislikes other people. Everyone has specialties so if this guy works well in the desert

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:39.280
or if he likes to hang around chicks, you get the bonus.

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.280
It's almost like a weak third person shooter but it works great in a tactical environment.

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:47.280
You can take cover. You can have your snipers or you can have a tank.

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:51.280
Everything works well together and the graphic style

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:55.280
is very stylized, very fun. It is very stylized and to answer some questions

02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:59.280
in chat, it is a PS3 exclusive as far as I know. There is a demo on the Sony

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:03.280
store that you can check out if it sounds interesting because yeah, I did like the whole

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:07.280
like you were actually moving the pieces around and jumping over obstacles

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:11.280
and things. It did feel kind of tactical in that way. It was awesome.

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:15.280
I should really just suck it up and buy the full game.

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:19.280
It's a very fun game and it's quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. I just can't put it down.

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:23.280
Valkyria Chronicles is the game.

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.280
Is it related to Valkyria profile? You're thinking Valkyria

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.280
from Square. No, this is from Sega.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:35.280
It's a whole new thing. Yeah, Sega made it. A whole new thing.

02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:39.280
And new DLC coming out as well. Oh, so they're keeping it going. Wow, that's pretty cool.

02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:43.280
Well Dan, any other closing thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:47.280
No, just saying hi.

02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:51.280
If you guys are around for E3, an offer is sold out but I can get you all into Disneyland.

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:55.280
Well, that's a very generous offer. I know Loki is going to Disneyland.

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:59.280
I don't know if he already bought the tickets. I already have the ticket vouchers. Sorry.

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:03.280
Well, you know what? Maybe I'll take him up on that.

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:07.280
If I could get down there, I'd be happy to, but I'm broke.

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:11.280
I will keep in touch, Dan. I know you're on the Twitter, so I'll be in touch.

02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:15.280
Alright, cool. Nice talking to you guys. Alright, take care Dan. Thanks for the call.

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:19.280
Speaking of Twitter, we're keeping an eye on things tonight.

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.280
User Javier Altman says,

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:27.280
Yeah, it's just footy monster.

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:31.280
But I'm reading the usernames here.

02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.280
Magical Nathan simply gave us a yeah.

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.280
Yeah. I don't know. Magical Nathan's username.

02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:43.280
ActDeft says, I hope Sky updates the podcast soon.

02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:47.280
Since this is a pretty hilarious episode. It will be caught up next week.

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:51.280
I promise. We will be all caught up next week. We have to be for the contest.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:55.280
Or it's not going to work. I know. It's just, you know, when I'm drunk, nothing's funny.

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:59.280
Alright, hi. You're on Orange Andrea. Who's this? It's Deathwishing again.

02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:03.280
Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind? Huh? What's on your mind?

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.280
Um, first of all, I would like to say I have a great first person shooter idea.

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:11.280
It involves you, and it would always be you running away from the battles.

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.280
Where's the guns everywhere? Worst game ever. I'm sorry to tell you.

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:19.280
It'd be a great game, because it'd be like little girly screams.

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:23.280
Why are you making fun of me?

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:27.280
Second, um, do you, um,

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:31.280
think of Konami as a first person shooter developer at all?

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:35.280
Konami as a first person shooter developer. Well, like, do you think of them?

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:39.280
Because they're making a first person shooter game called Six Days in Fallujah.

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:43.280
No, I've heard of the Fallujah game though. I have.

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.280
I guess it's supposed to be some ultra realistic game, like from my herd.

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.280
Yeah, yeah.

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.280
Weren't they, like, actually interviewing veterans or something to figure this game out?

02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.280
And terrorists. Oh my gosh.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.280
I'm thinking, like, what's going to happen? Am I going to be playing, like, getting ready to do a breach and entry on Adoro,

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.280
all of a sudden Contra, big alien thing flies out of nowhere?

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.280
That wouldn't be very realistic now, would it?

02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.280
But I just can't understand it.

02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:19.280
Like, they're really kick ass, PS3 one, and then they're like,

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.280
eh, forget it. No one wants to play a good game.

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:27.280
Well, good games never last. That's true. That's kind of true.

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:31.280
What kind of games have you been playing this week? Death Wishing?

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:35.280
Well, I was at a cyber cafe yesterday, and I played

02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:39.280
a lot of, I played Street Fighter a lot, actually, with my

02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.280
death Asian friend who could beat me with the controller behind his back,

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:47.280
and down the hallway, like a douche, showing off to everyone.

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:51.280
Everyone's clapping, and I'm just like, you bitch.

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:55.280
Isn't that crazy how people can do that? Like, I remember a story about

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:59.280
there was a Soulcalibur player that could do that, too. Like, they were blind or something, and they could just

02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.280
whoop everybody at Soulcalibur. It was amazing.

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.280
It's because they're Asian. Asians are better at any game that comes from Asia. Like, Starcraft!

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.280
Did you say your Asian friend was deaf? Yeah.

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.280
Or, when you have loss of a sense like that, all your other senses are heightened.

02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.280
Could it be because of that? No, I just really think the Asian race itself

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:23.280
is just better at video games than anyone else.

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:27.280
Rice Princess, as our token Asian in studio tonight, confirmed deny these said allegations.

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:31.280
I can very much confirm. Very good. Uh-huh.

02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.280
You can send those cards and letters to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.280
I will be sure to forward them appropriately. Wow.

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.280
Wow, wow, wow.

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.280
And you're getting yelled at by GS68 in chat, who is also... I can tell, and I can just tell

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:51.280
him, um, no, it's not a stereotype, because

02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:55.280
it's more of a fact, because I can't beat anyone at Starcraft that's...

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.280
Anyways, Rob, I'll invite you to go

02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:03.280
paintballing with me sometime. Oh, I'm sure that'll be a joy,

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.280
especially after what I said tonight. There'll be, like, a secret meeting while I run to the restroom

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.280
or something before the thing starts. Okay, everybody, target Rob. He's the

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.280
gun-a-phobe. And I'll just... I'll want to cry when the day's over.

02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:19.280
Alright, well, Deathwishing, thank you very much for the

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.280
call. Have a good week, okay? Oh, God.

02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:27.280
Take care, buddy. Alright.

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:31.280
That's going to do it for the calls tonight. Sorry if you guys didn't get through. Send us an email or a tweet

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:35.280
or try again next week, you guys. Alright, um, by the way, I wanted to say this

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:39.280
real quick before we get into the last-minute stories tonight, because I just thought of something I was reading.

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:43.280
One page I go to once in a while is yahoo.com, and they have, you know, news

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:47.280
stories that rotate on the front. There was a story on there the other day talking about how Grand Theft Auto

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.280
4's sales figures have... Sorry, not 4. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:55.280
sales have been extremely disappointing. They went so far as to call it a flop,

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.280
because it sold only, what, 87,000 copies its first week?

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:03.280
Loki, I know you're a huge Grand Theft Auto fan. What do you think? Is this true? Are people judging

02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:07.280
this too early? Is it a flop? Was it a bad idea to begin with? Well, it's only

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:11.280
been a... They're basing it off of the NPD numbers, which are only, you know,

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:15.280
it's only showing two weeks of the sales right now, so I'd have to

02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:19.280
see what it looks like, you know, at the end of this month.

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:23.280
I don't think it's going to be a flop. You know, like most DS games that come out, they sell over

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:27.280
a longer period of time. You know, since it's more of a casual system, people

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:31.280
are more casually, you know, wanting to pick up stuff. So,

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.280
there's that, and then also the DS is really, really easy

02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:39.280
to pirate stuff on. So, you know, you have a lot of people that were, you know,

02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:43.280
pirating and that kind of thing. But, um, I think it's going to do well.

02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.280
I mean, like, even like Super Mario 64, a game that

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:51.280
literally came out with, you know, the Nintendo DS is still

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:55.280
selling well today. So, I don't doubt that this will sell well.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:59.280
Do you think it's maybe because the DS is more of a kiddie system in Grand Theft Auto?

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:03.280
You know, how many really adult gamers admit to playing the DS

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:07.280
regularly? Um, I don't know, but yeah, I can imagine that it is more

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:11.280
a kiddie system, but also people are dumb and they'll buy their kids this stuff. I guess that's true.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:15.280
I guess that's true. Alright, last minute stories, anybody.

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:19.280
DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight? Um, although it was kind of mentioned in an email,

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:23.280
um, Marvel vs Capcom 2 is getting a re-release

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.280
with, um, arcade sticks.

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:31.280
Nice. Is it like an arcade thing? I remember hearing something about the

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:35.280
achievements. I think Xbox Live. It's so rumored right now.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:39.280
Interesting. I know there was a, somebody posted to our show roll prep

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:43.280
thread and I just, we didn't post it because there wasn't a lot there besides a countdown timer

02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.280
that they're saying is rumored to be the Marvel vs Capcom 2. So, anyway.

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:51.280
Anything else DarkSakura tonight? What? Anything else

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:55.280
for last minute stories? Flem. Alright, Loki. Um, there's

02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:59.280
a couple things. One, there's some new info for, uh, Star Trek

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:03.280
DAC, which will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade in May

02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:07.280
and kind of looks a little bit like, um, Star Control, which is pretty cool.

02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:11.280
And then also, um,

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:15.280
there's a rumor that there's going to be a new Clone Wars game coming to the PS3

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:19.280
and Xbox 360. It's supposed to feature co-op as well

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:23.280
and will be entitled, uh, Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes.

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:27.280
I can see this coming out. I mean, they let the horror of this stuff out.

02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:31.280
And then finally, um, this is awesome. Coming to

02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:35.280
Virtual Console soon, Clay Fighters.

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:39.280
No way! Yes, Clay Fighters.

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:43.280
It has been raided by the ESRB.

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.280
I thought Clay Fighters was already out in Europe. And Helga.

02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:51.280
Um, no, in the US. I don't know if it's out

02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:55.280
in Europe already. Wait, so, but if it's already out here, why is it being

02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:59.280
re-rated? No, it's not out here. It's coming out here.

02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:03.280
Oh. I don't know if it's out in Europe already, but it's coming out here

02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:07.280
because it just got raided by the ESRB. Yeah, Rob. Got it.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:11.280
Does this have the theme song, maybe?

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:15.280
Hold on, I'm looking at YouTube to try and find...

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:19.280
Aw, it just has the intro.

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:23.280
Music

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:27.280
Music

02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:31.280
Music

02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:35.280
I think it's off an emulation. Yeah, it's off an emulator or something. I can't find it.

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:39.280
I'm not going to bother. Anyway, I got submitted a last minute story

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:43.280
here real quick, and I remember reading about this this week. The plug has been pulled on

02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:47.280
Bioshock, apparently. Not the game, but the movie. It was to be

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:51.280
directed by Gore Verbinski, who's famous obviously for the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Apparently

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:55.280
the movie had been in pre-production, and the plug was pulled this week.

02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:59.280
This happens sometimes in Hollywood. This is a very Hollywood thing to happen.

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:03.280
There it is. Apparently, they

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:07.280
wanted to move the film outside the US to take advantage of the tax credit. It's not necessarily

02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:11.280
completely done with, by the way. It's just the game is in a quote-unquote

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:15.280
holding pattern. In other words, it's been delayed a little while.

02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:19.280
There you go. Bioshock. You have to jump around. Oh, the game you're playing right now

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:23.280
is Mylon's Secret Castle. You go in the little doors, and there's a little, like,

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:27.280
go to the right, dummy. Can you keep going to the right?

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:31.280
There you go. And you go in those little, like, you can go in there.

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:35.280
Anyway, forget it. Alright,

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:39.280
any other last minute stories, Loki? That's all I have. And that's going to do it for

02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.280
tonight's Orange Launch Radio. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:47.280
Wellie Wellie, I know you didn't get to say a whole lot here, but hopefully you had fun.

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:51.280
And watching and participating when you did. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:55.280
I just lost the game. Sorry to hear that. Alright.

02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:59.280
The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:03.280
Yeah, everyone should go to the UOP Film Festival in May.

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.280
Because, you know, our international audience can all make it to UOP. Yeah, because

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.280
my engagement to Movie Merge is coming out.

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:15.280
Princess Princess, do you have any final thoughts? In the mic, please.

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:19.280
Thanks, Rob. Want to go to Disneyland for free?

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:23.280
Come to LA in June with us.

02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:27.280
If Loki already bought his ticket, you can have his ticket. Alright, Loki, do you have any final

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:31.280
thoughts for our listeners? Nope, I need a Cage Man song, but I'm finding

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:35.280
one right now. My final thought is, the wine buzz

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.280
is gone. That's kind of sad. It didn't last long. Dark Sakura, our final, final,

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:43.280
final thought tonight. Give me money. Alright, thank you guys so much for

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:47.280
downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio or listening to us live, however you do it.

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:51.280
We really appreciate all the support of you guys. Remember, if you like what you hear here, and

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:55.280
if you've stuck with the show until the very end tonight of all nights, I

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:59.280
really applaud you, and you must really like what we're doing here. So please tell a friend or two

02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:03.280
about our show. That's how we get around is word of mouth. We don't have a big magazine or

02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:07.280
a big website that backs us. Nope, it's just a couple of friends who all met playing DDR

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.280
doing this shit out of their garage for the past seven years. So, there you go.

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:15.280
Dark Sakura? I actually forgot to put up the contest about winning my

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:19.280
TurboGrafx. So now I'm just going to say that the 200th, actually, the

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.280
300th person to follow me on Twitter will get it.

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:27.280
Oh god, it's going to be one of those contests, huh? No, I'm just being silly. However,

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.280
the 300th person will get something. Well, maybe we can, you know, because we're going to have the contest for this

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.280
Miles Decay thing next week. Maybe we can do, like, contest week next week or something. We'll do it. Think about what

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:39.280
you want to do for your contest. Contest week. Because we're going to do, I'll tell you off air. I'm just being a whore.

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:43.280
Alright. Well, congratulations. Alright. Um.

02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:47.280
Dylin, you are a whore. Alright. Anyway, that's it.

02:35:47.280 --> 02:36:09.280
Goodnight everybody. We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:21.280
Anyway, see you next week.
