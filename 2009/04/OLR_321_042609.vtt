WEBVTT

00:14.779 --> 00:14.959
[SPEAKER_14]: April 26, 2009.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Could a popular MMO be coming to the iPhone?

00:19.423 --> 00:22.005
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft promises a barrage of games for Japan.

00:22.425 --> 00:24.667
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first details are announced for PAX 2009.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.843
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.883 --> 00:41.487
[SPEAKER_17]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.547 --> 00:43.488
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:43.969 --> 00:49.673
[SPEAKER_17]: And leading it through the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.973 --> 00:50.273
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

00:50.453 --> 00:50.834
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

00:51.014 --> 00:52.235
[SPEAKER_13]: I left my lungs at Disneyland.

00:52.355 --> 00:53.335
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, how was Disneyland?

00:53.676 --> 00:54.836
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god!

00:54.877 --> 00:55.837
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Disneyland, right?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.039
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it was fun and they have a new game.

00:58.686 --> 01:00.468
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I will touch on in my gaming week.

01:00.748 --> 01:03.911
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I might know what you're talking about, so I want to talk about it too.

01:03.931 --> 01:04.751
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the same one I remember.

01:05.052 --> 01:07.113
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, and also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:08.314 --> 01:10.616
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's picking off pickles off of his double cheeseburger.

01:10.756 --> 01:11.998
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are you not a pickle fan?

01:12.038 --> 01:13.419
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you specifically ask no pickles?

01:13.439 --> 01:17.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I never do, because then that means they have to take longer.

01:17.721 --> 01:19.882
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm the Doctor It's been like a couple weeks

01:41.917 --> 01:42.778
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I'm doing really good.

01:43.058 --> 01:43.479
[SPEAKER_17]: Woo!

01:44.060 --> 01:45.222
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple weeks is a long time.

01:45.783 --> 01:47.045
[SPEAKER_17]: And Rice Princess is here too.

01:47.085 --> 01:50.029
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I can get the mic all the way over there, but say hello to Rice Princess is here.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.440
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you can hear that at all.

02:12.321 --> 02:13.801
[SPEAKER_12]: They're playing it on the Dreamcast.

02:13.861 --> 02:19.403
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, they're playing it so that they can switch to other games if they want to play something else really easy.

02:20.163 --> 02:23.644
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki was not able to bring Excitebots tonight, which we were hoping to look at.

02:23.684 --> 02:24.345
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened, Loki?

02:25.565 --> 02:25.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I knew.

02:26.485 --> 02:28.266
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to take it away from my wife.

02:28.426 --> 02:32.427
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been playing it constantly, so, you know, she'd be pissed off.

02:32.507 --> 02:33.787
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's past the wife test?

02:34.008 --> 02:35.128
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's past the wife test.

02:35.148 --> 02:37.649
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, well, we'll hear a little more about your gaming week in just a little bit.

02:38.049 --> 02:38.949
[SPEAKER_17]: But let's get into it.

02:39.009 --> 02:40.089
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your gaming week?

02:40.229 --> 02:41.350
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start off with Dark Sakura.

02:41.370 --> 02:41.950
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your gaming week?

02:42.383 --> 02:43.023
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:11.361 --> 03:39.549
[SPEAKER_13]: I was convinced well I had said the next time I go to Disneyland I was going to go on Tower of Terror and I sat between Tiara and Marissa and Marissa kept saying that I would like that I would be okay on the drops and that the part that would scare me would be the lead up well the lead up was the fun part and the drop freaked me the hell out to the point that the only thing I could say on the entire ride was I'm not doing this again

03:41.890 --> 03:43.350
[SPEAKER_13]: or I Hate This or something like that.

03:43.430 --> 03:47.432
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I didn't make any more noise until I was off of it and almost throwing up when I got outside.

03:47.672 --> 03:50.773
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I will tell everybody right now, my fear is falling.

03:51.034 --> 03:55.035
[SPEAKER_13]: Not high places, not motion, it's falling.

03:55.095 --> 03:57.016
[SPEAKER_17]: The Tower of Terror is really freaking scary.

03:57.336 --> 04:01.658
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been in an elevator when it fell two feet before, so no, Jamie doesn't do this.

04:03.279 --> 04:08.821
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was actually so freaked out that I was actually going to go in California Screamin' and I was actually relieved.

04:09.403 --> 04:09.988
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

04:13.352 --> 04:19.394
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, I want to give a shout out to Pete and Jasmine who hung out with us and were really awesome while we were there.

04:19.714 --> 04:21.175
[SPEAKER_13]: But okay, back now to the story.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.675
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're like, let's go on Toy Story.

04:22.695 --> 04:23.636
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, okay, let's go on Toy Story.

04:24.156 --> 04:25.236
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Toy Story.

04:25.696 --> 04:29.018
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you wear 3D glasses, like the same kinds you wear at the Muppet Show thing.

04:29.658 --> 04:37.481
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you stop in front of these screens and you have these guns that are the pop gun that you pull the big string on over and over again.

04:38.081 --> 04:40.922
[SPEAKER_13]: And you fire out 3D ammunition.

04:41.602 --> 04:43.124
[SPEAKER_13]: at targets on the screen.

04:43.164 --> 04:46.569
[SPEAKER_17]: You're basically having to flick your wrist back and forth as fast as possible to pull this string.

04:46.589 --> 04:47.170
[SPEAKER_13]: So men are better at it.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.993
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, men have a distinct advantage at this game.

04:49.553 --> 04:50.194
[SPEAKER_13]: I made a good score.

04:50.234 --> 04:52.898
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I've got my score because I took a picture of my score.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.701
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you really good at flicking your wrist back and forth real quick?

04:55.341 --> 04:56.383
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, I am married.

04:59.773 --> 05:00.574
[SPEAKER_17]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

05:20.648 --> 05:21.468
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just really cool.

05:21.508 --> 05:24.389
[SPEAKER_13]: There were all sorts of little mini-games to do on it.

05:24.809 --> 05:27.910
[SPEAKER_13]: But my score for the first time playing it was 114,400.

05:29.150 --> 05:32.170
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of that, you know what my animal was?

05:32.990 --> 05:33.711
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a beaver.

05:35.131 --> 05:39.572
[SPEAKER_06]: And as GameGuru says in the chat, they're putting it out on the Wii as a Wii game.

05:40.912 --> 05:41.932
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be in 3D.

05:42.612 --> 05:44.792
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of awesome, I have to say.

05:44.832 --> 05:47.733
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have to tell you, Rob, did you notice this when you came out of the ride?

05:49.162 --> 05:49.387
[SPEAKER_17]: What is...

05:49.966 --> 05:58.252
[SPEAKER_13]: When you walk out of the ride, if you look to the left where the little desk and everything is and the room setting, it shows the cutout box.

05:59.032 --> 06:00.873
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the ride that you're on.

06:02.454 --> 06:03.615
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a paper box.

06:03.755 --> 06:05.076
[SPEAKER_13]: You set up an inside midway.

06:05.516 --> 06:14.743
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you look at the wallpaper that's inside the ride, it's got little tabs and stuff and instructions for where you stick everything, like old paper doll houses.

06:15.763 --> 06:18.945
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an old midway ride, like a child's midway ride.

06:18.985 --> 06:19.526
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty cool.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.407
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was a great ride.

06:21.727 --> 06:24.089
[SPEAKER_17]: So, real life gaming, basically, this week.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.631
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it was a lot of fun.

06:27.071 --> 06:29.212
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I came back and real life intruded itself.

06:31.054 --> 06:32.715
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki did mention the chat room.

06:32.755 --> 06:35.697
[SPEAKER_17]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live for this chat.

06:35.837 --> 06:37.838
[SPEAKER_17]: And, of course, there was that comment from GameGuru earlier.

06:38.199 --> 06:41.421
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, DarkTetsuya, I still want that Mr. Toad's Wild Ride racing game.

06:42.161 --> 06:43.122
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be pretty awesome.

06:43.682 --> 06:44.483
[SPEAKER_13]: Only if you go to hell.

06:45.544 --> 06:47.625
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100Matt says... I mean in the game, not you go to hell.

06:47.865 --> 06:48.186
Yeah.

06:49.073 --> 06:50.073
[SPEAKER_17]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:18.823 --> 07:25.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the game is really awesome itself, but I don't care for some of their changes that they made.

07:26.588 --> 07:31.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they have these stunt bars, basically, that you have to grab and you can swing around.

07:32.112 --> 07:35.955
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gold ones that you swing around a few times and you just launch off and you get stars.

07:36.255 --> 07:40.778
[SPEAKER_06]: And then every track has a red bar that you have to swing around and spin ten times.

07:41.658 --> 07:46.722
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess they're kind of neat, you know, to keep with the whole trick racing thing, but I think it should be optional because...

07:48.032 --> 07:48.673
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:59.329 --> 07:59.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

08:20.335 --> 08:48.000
[SPEAKER_06]: and also what was I going to say no support unfortunately for custom music which kind of sucks but the music that's in the game is not as annoying as the last game and I don't know it's pretty hard but most of the site truck games if you're going to try to actually rank the courses then yeah you're going to have to play it a few times to actually be able to do it perfectly but it's fun lots of air you know

08:48.885 --> 08:50.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I remember another gripe I had about that.

08:52.452 --> 08:53.773
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:22.404 --> 09:25.787
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, that's the way they did it and kind of get over it.

09:26.288 --> 09:27.809
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the game's really weird.

09:27.909 --> 09:30.912
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a super sandwich, so it's awesome.

09:31.672 --> 09:40.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I played Rhythm Heaven on the DS, which is definitely a fun music kind of micro-game collection.

09:40.721 --> 09:43.523
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar to the WarioWare stuff because it's made by the same people.

09:44.424 --> 09:45.164
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, though...

09:46.147 --> 09:52.688
[SPEAKER_06]: is it's very strict on accuracy so if you're not accurate in that or if you're just a little bit off

09:53.709 --> 09:55.010
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to penalize you big time.

09:55.230 --> 09:56.091
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of sucked.

09:56.351 --> 09:58.513
[SPEAKER_06]: But fun game overall.

09:59.514 --> 10:02.216
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I played, more Grand Theft Auto.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.680
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually messing around with the PC version again, editing some stuff.

10:06.840 --> 10:12.624
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got cars to bounce into the sky really far and come down and explode.

10:12.665 --> 10:13.365
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was kind of fun.

10:14.626 --> 10:17.589
[SPEAKER_06]: And I downloaded the new download content for Saints Row 2.

10:17.629 --> 10:19.570
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully I'm going to get to play that this week.

10:20.851 --> 10:21.091
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

10:22.202 --> 10:24.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think, for my gaming week.

10:26.424 --> 10:27.545
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, sounds pretty good.

10:28.385 --> 10:28.845
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing else?

10:29.526 --> 10:31.187
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything you're looking forward to in this next week, Loki?

10:32.727 --> 10:33.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, not this week.

10:33.828 --> 10:39.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing coming out really worthwhile, at least.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah, it's just X-Men Origins, which doesn't look bad.

10:42.973 --> 10:47.175
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not something I'd plan on picking up unless I get it for free.

10:50.414 --> 10:53.076
[SPEAKER_06]: The other game I was waiting for, unfortunately, got delayed to the end next month.

10:53.356 --> 10:59.781
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Fuel, which was originally supposed to be coming out in two weeks, but now it's not until four weeks.

10:59.981 --> 11:00.902
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

11:01.102 --> 11:02.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

11:02.803 --> 11:03.084
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

11:03.104 --> 11:06.626
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get to the Doctor and the Rice Princess in their gaming weeks momentarily, except now they're playing what?

11:06.646 --> 11:07.027
[SPEAKER_17]: You switched?

11:07.047 --> 11:08.248
[SPEAKER_17]: God, you guys have been switching games.

11:08.528 --> 11:10.009
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw Contra flash by for a minute.

11:10.069 --> 11:10.549
[SPEAKER_17]: Now you're on what?

11:10.589 --> 11:11.030
[SPEAKER_17]: Double Dragon 2?

11:11.070 --> 11:11.330
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

11:11.690 --> 11:13.131
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:39.751 --> 11:42.575
[SPEAKER_17]: and having to pick up the people that were getting launched from the cannons.

11:42.695 --> 11:50.604
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you can launch yourself from a cannon onto the back of the boss to fight it and then the boss throws you off and you have to get picked up in a motorcycle and get carried back to the cannon.

11:50.885 --> 11:51.846
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's really intricate.

11:51.886 --> 11:54.389
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of neat what they've done in Warcraft with this.

11:54.769 --> 11:57.232
[SPEAKER_17]: Although, I can say that but at the same time say...

11:57.933 --> 11:59.134
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:19.213 --> 12:27.799
[SPEAKER_17]: I played a little bit of Outrun, but not enough for me to say a whole lot about it besides, you know, thankfully there's a cartoon arcade style racing game on Xbox 360 I enjoy right now.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.822
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, pretty much all we've had otherwise is more realistic type of racing games.

12:33.464 --> 12:34.064
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really it.

12:34.244 --> 12:35.365
[SPEAKER_17]: There hasn't been a whole lot otherwise.

12:35.865 --> 12:36.226
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock Band 2.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.887
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been playing a lot of Rock Band still.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.468
[SPEAKER_17]: That game's getting a lot of value even today.

12:39.868 --> 12:41.049
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's really it for my Gaming Week.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.994
[SPEAKER_17]: The Doctor, Rice Princess, anything you guys have been playing in your Gaming Week besides what you're doing right now?

12:47.014 --> 12:47.254
[SPEAKER_17]: The Doctor?

12:47.274 --> 12:47.594
[SPEAKER_17]: The Doctor.

12:48.659 --> 12:49.219
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

12:49.399 --> 12:50.560
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been making movies.

12:51.460 --> 12:52.300
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been making movies?

12:52.340 --> 12:52.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty movies?

12:53.581 --> 12:54.541
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, dirty movies.

12:55.521 --> 12:57.382
[SPEAKER_17]: So, nothing that you've been really playing lately.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.682
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you're a big Nintendo fanboy.

12:58.702 --> 13:01.263
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anything you're looking forward to on the Wii?

13:01.323 --> 13:02.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely the Wii Motion Plus.

13:03.484 --> 13:03.724
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.405
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

13:05.425 --> 13:06.045
[SPEAKER_17]: What have you been up to?

13:06.485 --> 13:07.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing WoW.

13:08.266 --> 13:09.986
[SPEAKER_17]: And how's your Warcraft week going?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Snowball Garden, so that's it.

13:13.490 --> 13:14.531
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right, there's a new holiday.

13:15.112 --> 13:16.853
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a new holiday in World of Warcraft, right?

13:16.873 --> 13:18.575
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you do in the Noble Garden event?

13:18.675 --> 13:19.996
[SPEAKER_17]: Explain it to our listeners, Rice Princess.

13:20.456 --> 13:21.557
[SPEAKER_17]: Put the damn game on pause.

13:22.759 --> 13:26.382
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Easter stuff that they couldn't update in time or something.

13:26.442 --> 13:26.882
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

13:28.984 --> 13:30.346
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, she's busy playing Double Dragon.

13:30.406 --> 13:31.867
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

13:31.887 --> 13:33.288
[SPEAKER_17]: You go around and you hunt for eggs.

13:33.328 --> 13:34.469
[SPEAKER_17]: I kind of thought it was stupid.

13:34.529 --> 13:35.791
[SPEAKER_17]: I played it for about five minutes.

13:35.831 --> 13:36.551
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was stupid.

13:36.571 --> 13:37.572
[SPEAKER_17]: You're full of crap.

13:38.013 --> 13:39.174
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are you saying I'm full of crap?

13:41.658 --> 13:41.958
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

13:42.379 --> 13:43.880
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess is screaming at me.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.341
[SPEAKER_17]: She has no microphone.

13:46.021 --> 13:46.422
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

13:46.742 --> 13:47.022
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.624
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to get into some gaming news here in just a moment.

13:49.684 --> 13:53.147
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, if you want to join us live, chat.orangeentreter.com is the place to be.

13:53.427 --> 13:57.911
[SPEAKER_17]: You can also follow us on Twitter at OLR, and we're looking at your tweets during the show.

13:58.431 --> 14:02.755
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks to you guys who have been saying stuff to kind of help plug the show.

14:02.795 --> 14:05.236
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw some retweets from ActDeft and GoldAnthro.

14:05.577 --> 14:07.178
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you guys very much over on Twitter.

14:09.071 --> 14:10.852
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, housekeeping, housekeeping.

14:10.872 --> 14:11.893
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

14:12.673 --> 14:13.553
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very excited.

14:13.754 --> 14:15.394
[SPEAKER_17]: In a couple weeks I will be in Chicago.

14:15.675 --> 14:18.556
[SPEAKER_17]: I am going to Anime Central, ASEN for short.

14:19.056 --> 14:25.760
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to this convention and I will be doing a panel Friday at 4.30 in panel room 7?

14:26.740 --> 14:27.441
[SPEAKER_17]: Consult your program.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.082
[SPEAKER_17]: So You Think You Can Podcast is the name of the panel.

14:30.102 --> 14:35.745
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll be talking about my seven years of experience that I have in internet broadcasting and talking about

14:36.165 --> 14:36.726
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

14:57.586 --> 15:08.250
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, next week on the program, you heard us tease this a little bit last week, but next week on the program, we're very excited because we're going to be giving away That's right, that's SmileDK

15:11.667 --> 15:17.851
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an autographed copy of one of the Dance Dance Revolution games on, I believe it's Supernova 2.

15:18.572 --> 15:22.174
[SPEAKER_17]: Dance Dance Revolution autographed by SmileDK that we're giving away on the show next week.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.655
[SPEAKER_17]: So that should be pretty awesome.

15:24.696 --> 15:26.717
[SPEAKER_17]: Live or podcast, either way.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.179
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can listen to that and win it live.

15:29.219 --> 15:34.022
[SPEAKER_17]: It was signed at SakuraCon, thanks to the awesome Brest Lowell for getting that for us.

15:34.382 --> 15:39.786
[SPEAKER_17]: So next week on the show, if you want to tune in live or in podcast form, and I'll give you more details next week.

15:40.066 --> 15:41.047
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll have two weeks to do it.

15:42.167 --> 15:45.009
[SPEAKER_17]: Question from chat, will you be recording the panel at ASEN?

15:45.429 --> 15:46.250
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can.

15:47.190 --> 15:56.335
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not really about Orange Lounge Radio though, so I don't know if we'll put it on the podcast feed if we can do it, but maybe like a bonus thing.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.796
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love to tape it if we can.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.978
[SPEAKER_17]: If nothing else, I'll have someone videotape it and I can dump the audio or something.

16:01.198 --> 16:01.798
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll figure something out.

16:03.539 --> 16:04.300
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, I want to say this.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.581
[SPEAKER_17]: This is very, very, very, very, very, very important.

16:06.981 --> 16:09.362
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to say a huge thank you to all the listeners.

16:10.003 --> 16:16.627
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if everybody in studio saw, but there is a bunch of boxes sitting in the house.

16:17.087 --> 16:19.988
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a new used computer.

16:20.069 --> 16:20.949
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I mean by new used?

16:20.989 --> 16:22.150
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a refurbed computer.

16:22.470 --> 16:24.091
[SPEAKER_17]: The listeners pooled together money.

16:24.711 --> 16:31.156
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you remember our meltdown on air two weeks ago when everything broke, but the listeners pulled together and got us a new computer that we can use for the show.

16:31.356 --> 16:31.616
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweet.

16:31.696 --> 16:32.917
[SPEAKER_17]: That's very, very exciting.

16:32.977 --> 16:35.119
[SPEAKER_17]: We weren't able to put it all together for tonight.

16:35.139 --> 16:36.320
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, guys.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.042
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, obviously, huge, huge amounts of thanks.

16:39.782 --> 16:50.170
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, with us having probably a little break in a couple weeks with me being off in the Midwest, we'll probably have a lot of time to put that together and get it up and running and hopefully have some fun new stuff for the show.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.011
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you guys so much for that.

16:52.472 --> 16:53.132
[SPEAKER_17]: That's very exciting.

16:53.372 --> 16:53.933
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very exciting.

16:55.660 --> 16:56.481
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for everyone.

17:17.121 --> 17:17.341
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

17:18.141 --> 17:19.582
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.323
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think there's anything else, really.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.324
[SPEAKER_17]: You follow us on Facebook, MySpace.

17:23.344 --> 17:24.465
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone use MySpace anymore?

17:24.905 --> 17:25.165
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone?

17:25.445 --> 17:25.946
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

17:26.026 --> 17:26.426
[SPEAKER_17]: Stalkers.

17:26.466 --> 17:29.128
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if you're there, you can get us on Orange Lounge Radio there.

17:30.068 --> 17:32.129
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're not on Craigslist because that's where the murderers are.

17:32.189 --> 17:34.811
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the one social site that we're not on is Craigslist.

17:34.851 --> 17:35.992
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know.

17:36.552 --> 17:38.273
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should have a Noel Army on Craigslist.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how that works.

17:39.494 --> 17:41.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought my first Xbox 360 on Craigslist.

17:42.455 --> 17:42.936
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

17:42.956 --> 17:43.076
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it.

17:44.026 --> 17:45.547
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:09.002 --> 18:09.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Get her a doula!

18:31.431 --> 18:35.194
[SPEAKER_17]: The show will continue, you guys, even if Loki's going to be out for a little while.

18:35.214 --> 18:35.915
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll figure something out.

18:35.935 --> 18:38.197
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was thinking Skyping it or something.

18:38.257 --> 18:46.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, obviously, I'm not going to leave my wife home alone with two kids by herself for the first few weeks or so.

18:46.164 --> 18:47.426
[SPEAKER_17]: We will figure something out.

18:47.466 --> 18:48.967
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got plenty of time to figure it out.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.869
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to leave my husband alone with my kid.

18:50.969 --> 18:52.510
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not even a worry right now.

18:52.850 --> 18:55.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.654
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not planning on going anywhere.

18:56.694 --> 18:57.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

18:58.355 --> 19:01.338
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing too is we're going to be getting a house actually.

19:01.438 --> 19:02.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

19:02.739 --> 19:04.180
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already had our offer accepted.

19:04.200 --> 19:09.924
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the walkthrough on yesterday and it looked good.

19:10.084 --> 19:16.309
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're assuming, I don't think anything's going to go wrong because we know what condition the roof is in basically.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.952
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably yeah, we'll be probably moving into a house by the end of next month.

19:21.013 --> 19:22.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, I didn't know the house was that far along.

19:22.634 --> 19:24.155
[SPEAKER_17]: Well that's great, especially with twins on the way.

19:24.295 --> 19:25.275
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, definitely.

19:25.295 --> 19:25.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

19:25.776 --> 19:28.537
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've never known anyone that had twins, so that's kind of fun.

19:28.677 --> 19:30.338
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fertility drugs for you.

19:31.198 --> 19:34.579
[SPEAKER_13]: Small word of advice, check your pipes in the house.

19:35.400 --> 19:35.840
[SPEAKER_13]: In the house.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have an inspector.

19:37.961 --> 19:40.402
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Nellie should check her lady pipes, too, for the twins.

19:42.116 --> 19:43.297
[SPEAKER_17]: The babies will come out when they come out.

20:02.652 --> 20:03.052
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

20:03.512 --> 20:07.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Nellie doesn't want to do the one anymore.

20:07.634 --> 20:10.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally, she was really fond of the name Max.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.136
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, okay, that's cool.

20:13.576 --> 20:14.977
[SPEAKER_06]: How about naming the other one Sam?

20:15.017 --> 20:15.997
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, okay.

20:16.117 --> 20:17.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Sam X, sweet.

20:18.778 --> 20:22.159
[SPEAKER_17]: If you name your twins Sam and Max, I'm going to laugh for a week.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.501
[SPEAKER_17]: I might literally die of laughter if you name the twins Sam and Max.

20:25.661 --> 20:28.282
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't want to name the one Max because...

20:28.982 --> 20:30.624
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:44.403 --> 20:50.247
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what the sex of the babies are for a few months.

20:50.427 --> 20:53.149
[SPEAKER_06]: She's only eight weeks along right now.

20:53.910 --> 20:58.073
[SPEAKER_06]: We know early because we didn't know it was going to be twins until last week.

20:58.654 --> 21:01.476
[SPEAKER_06]: She had cramping in her side or whatever.

21:01.816 --> 21:04.698
[SPEAKER_06]: She wanted to make sure everything was okay.

21:04.738 --> 21:06.739
[SPEAKER_06]: They did ultrasounds and stuff.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.702
[SPEAKER_06]: First, the woman didn't see any heartbeats at all.

21:10.302 --> 21:14.125
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they found one, and then we went to radiology, and then they found a second one.

21:14.145 --> 21:15.806
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, okay, there's two.

21:17.587 --> 21:20.469
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, it still weighs off.

21:20.509 --> 21:28.154
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have our first real doctor's visit in two weeks, so we get to see them slightly more growing up, I guess.

21:29.575 --> 21:30.516
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, not until...

21:30.956 --> 21:32.137
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, there's still tadpoles.

21:32.197 --> 21:34.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Not until, like, you know, August or so.

21:35.159 --> 21:36.120
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the sex of them.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.681
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to find out for sure.

21:38.101 --> 21:42.444
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, Salmon Max would be better than Ratchet and Clank as names.

21:42.584 --> 21:43.585
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.285
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

21:45.026 --> 21:52.191
[SPEAKER_17]: And, chat, he is not really going to name them Salmon Max just to get a goddamn gift from, you know, from the makers of the game, okay?

21:52.351 --> 21:55.373
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder, though, if I... These are children you're talking about.

21:55.393 --> 21:59.516
[SPEAKER_13]: When I have mine, if I name it Richter or Annette, if Konami would give me a present...

22:02.004 --> 22:03.465
[SPEAKER_06]: She really will name the damn kid Richter.

22:03.485 --> 22:04.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami will give you a present, alright?

22:04.586 --> 22:05.526
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll sue you.

22:07.087 --> 22:12.191
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan and I decided like ten years ago before I ever even thought of wanting children that if we had a boy, his name was Richter.

22:12.471 --> 22:16.633
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she, okay, she keeps, my wife keeps suggesting the name Mason.

22:16.653 --> 22:18.595
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, Mason is a stupid name.

22:18.835 --> 22:19.836
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a friend named Mason.

22:19.856 --> 22:21.336
[SPEAKER_13]: Mason's my little brother-in-law's name.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody names their kids Mason.

22:23.598 --> 22:25.719
[SPEAKER_06]: He might actually listen to this show, you ass.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's a horrible name.

22:29.292 --> 22:31.235
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, Mario doesn't work because we're not Italian.

22:31.455 --> 22:31.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

22:32.216 --> 22:33.337
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll figure out names later.

22:33.518 --> 22:38.023
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what's funny is that I have toyed around the idea of naming a boy Strider.

22:38.744 --> 22:40.627
[SPEAKER_17]: But it has nothing to do with the game, I swear to God.

22:40.647 --> 22:41.508
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a name I like.

22:42.769 --> 22:43.791
[SPEAKER_17]: Not from... Oh, forget it.

22:44.171 --> 22:44.431
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

22:45.441 --> 22:47.342
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to stop naming children after video games.

22:47.402 --> 22:50.504
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get on to the gaming news.

22:50.784 --> 22:51.845
[SPEAKER_17]: God, we're like 20 minutes into the show.

22:51.865 --> 22:53.306
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't touched on a lick of gaming news.

22:53.966 --> 22:55.467
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.

22:55.727 --> 23:00.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's more drama going on with the whole Scratch the Ultimate DJ game.

23:01.431 --> 23:03.112
[SPEAKER_06]: First, Scratch actually...

23:04.072 --> 23:19.829
[SPEAKER_06]: was awarded their restraining order against Seven Studios and Seven Studios was basically told to give back the controllers that they had been holding hostage, I guess, and also all the development materials and that kind of stuff.

23:21.107 --> 23:24.171
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of a cool victory for Genius there.

23:24.772 --> 23:36.326
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a weird chain event also led to Seven Studios now countersuing, saying that it was actually Genius' fault that they were behind schedule and it was a...

23:38.448 --> 23:43.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, they put them back several months because they couldn't get, I guess, licensed music.

23:44.559 --> 23:50.089
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they couldn't provide licensed music for the game and not obtain publishing approval.

23:50.890 --> 23:51.151
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

23:52.563 --> 23:52.883
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

23:52.923 --> 23:56.425
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently the game is still not cleared for launch on the PS3 according to them.

23:56.986 --> 23:58.767
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll find out what happens there.

23:59.107 --> 24:01.348
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure this is not going to be going away anytime soon.

24:01.649 --> 24:07.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is very disappointing because I have a feeling this is going to delay the release of this game if it even comes out anymore now.

24:08.413 --> 24:12.355
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure DJ Hero will not be affected by this at all.

24:13.476 --> 24:13.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

24:14.673 --> 24:19.737
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, because DJ Hero is being put out by the bigger company, so regardless of quality, it will come out regardless.

24:19.757 --> 24:31.626
[SPEAKER_06]: And regardless of whether they find Activision accountable for any wrongdoing whatsoever, it's still they get what... They have oodles of money to pay off any lawsuits that could possibly happen.

24:31.646 --> 24:34.969
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically get what they're hinting at they're trying to get.

24:36.727 --> 24:37.027
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

24:37.227 --> 24:43.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at least I figured, you know, hey, Scratch might not be the more popular game, but at least if it's out first, it has a fair chance.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.151
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's like, I don't know.

24:46.271 --> 24:55.874
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think it'll do okay, but I'm wondering if we see anything called DJ Revolution or something coming out that's going to be crap.

24:56.514 --> 24:57.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Konami, don't disappoint me.

24:59.878 --> 25:03.244
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, well, I guess we'll see what further develops of this.

25:03.264 --> 25:04.205
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure 2B continued.

25:04.225 --> 25:06.870
[SPEAKER_17]: There's plenty more to have in countersuits, appeals, etc., etc.

25:06.910 --> 25:07.791
[SPEAKER_17]: I've seen the controller.

25:07.811 --> 25:08.492
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks awesome.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's not done, but it looks awesome.

25:12.148 --> 25:15.230
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, well, kind of going on a completely different note.

25:15.270 --> 25:18.372
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, we were talking about Warcraft a little bit in the opening of the show tonight.

25:18.412 --> 25:19.253
[SPEAKER_17]: This is interesting.

25:19.273 --> 25:23.756
[SPEAKER_17]: There's rumors going around the Internet about a World of Warcraft app on the iPhone.

25:24.497 --> 25:35.364
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, you know, somebody had ported Second Life to iPhone a little while ago, and now apparently there's this little movie circulating around the Internet that actually shows a jailbroken iPhone that is running World of Warcraft.

25:35.864 --> 25:36.705
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of interesting.

25:36.725 --> 25:37.426
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

25:38.706 --> 25:48.149
[SPEAKER_17]: There's kind of this no comment going on when asked if it's officially or whatever, that the company is apparently negotiating with Activision, etc., etc., to try and get this going.

25:48.569 --> 25:49.950
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is kind of a load of crap.

25:50.070 --> 25:53.791
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think Warcraft... I mean, I think people are kind of jumping to conclusions.

25:54.111 --> 25:57.032
[SPEAKER_17]: They see this and they assume, oh, Warcraft must be on its way for the iPhone.

25:57.072 --> 25:59.012
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, how stupid would Warcraft be on the iPhone?

25:59.312 --> 26:02.773
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't take a game like World of Warcraft and put it on the small scale of the iPhone.

26:03.014 --> 26:03.554
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't.

26:03.634 --> 26:04.094
[SPEAKER_17]: You could.

26:04.574 --> 26:05.354
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

26:24.625 --> 26:26.847
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, Dark Elf or something, it's going to look different.

26:26.927 --> 26:28.688
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's what I think they should do.

26:28.788 --> 26:36.412
[SPEAKER_17]: If they're going to have to do anything with this, what they should do is they should go, you've got to go all the way back to, I don't know if you remember Final Fantasy VIII on the PlayStation.

26:36.833 --> 26:40.335
[SPEAKER_17]: If you had that little thing that was only out in Japan, I forget the name of it.

26:40.755 --> 26:42.717
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it, Pocket Station.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.918
[SPEAKER_17]: You could link with the PlayStation.

26:44.958 --> 26:50.322
[SPEAKER_17]: You could raise your Chocobo on the Pocket Station and then that would affect some Chocobos that you had in game.

26:50.763 --> 26:58.328
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe something like that where you have a spin-off game where, I don't know, you do something in it and it affects your character.

26:58.408 --> 27:03.972
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get loot that you can actually use in the game or enchantments or something that you can actually use in the game.

27:04.333 --> 27:07.995
[SPEAKER_17]: Something to enhance the World of Warcraft game without throwing off the balance.

27:08.035 --> 27:09.817
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't work because someone would hack it to...

27:10.297 --> 27:10.838
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

27:29.096 --> 27:30.757
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have it somewhere, I don't even know where it is

27:57.594 --> 27:58.114
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I don't know.

27:58.174 --> 28:04.936
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they'd have to be very careful with the balance of the game, but it's not like, you know, it's not like Blizzard's never made major changes to their game.

28:04.956 --> 28:12.338
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I mean, Second Life, I mean... I could see something with vehicular combat, like on the iPhone, like a little side game, but I don't know.

28:12.478 --> 28:12.818
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

28:12.938 --> 28:21.760
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I believe it's not like a hoax or anything, I don't think, but, you know, because they're not showing that it's like, you know, awesome frame rate or anything like that, but...

28:23.502 --> 28:26.603
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see, you know, if they could port it to the iPhone, I think it'd be pretty big.

28:26.643 --> 28:31.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, definitely portable World of Warcraft would be awesome for somebody, I'm sure.

28:31.344 --> 28:33.544
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I think there's no point.

28:33.784 --> 28:34.385
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I mean?

28:34.465 --> 28:36.545
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, you can't party, you can't group.

28:37.005 --> 28:40.606
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, it's just, it would just be slow, it would be clunky.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.287
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would devalue Warcraft.

28:43.387 --> 28:46.587
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would devalue World of Warcraft to put out a subpar game on the iPhone.

28:46.607 --> 28:48.508
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why you would have to, you know...

28:49.488 --> 28:50.169
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

29:06.724 --> 29:07.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

29:26.391 --> 29:43.973
[SPEAKER_17]: or maybe they should just stick with the mobile authenticator and that's it that's a good use of the iPhone the mobile authenticator I heard they don't even sell the keychain authenticators anymore in favor of the mobile authenticator so what I have here on my keychain from BlizzCon that my friends brought me back is going to be a collector's item that I actually use

29:45.342 --> 29:45.722
[SPEAKER_17]: Pretty cool.

29:46.562 --> 29:48.283
[SPEAKER_17]: The question being asked, what is an authenticator?

29:48.603 --> 29:50.123
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, what do they call those?

29:50.183 --> 29:50.803
[SPEAKER_17]: VPNs?

29:51.163 --> 29:52.124
[SPEAKER_17]: Like a lot of companies use them.

29:52.144 --> 29:53.184
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a little thing on your keychain.

29:53.204 --> 29:54.084
[SPEAKER_17]: You press this button.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.965
[SPEAKER_17]: It generates a number based on the seed that's on the sticker on the back of your card.

29:58.445 --> 30:00.946
[SPEAKER_17]: And that number changes every minute.

30:01.026 --> 30:03.807
[SPEAKER_17]: So it basically uses the seed and the time to generate a number.

30:04.407 --> 30:08.048
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you want to log into WoW, you have to have the keychain with the number.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.048
[SPEAKER_17]: Or somebody can't log in.

30:10.068 --> 30:12.329
[SPEAKER_17]: It helps protect your account from hackers, basically.

30:12.349 --> 30:12.869
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.146
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

30:15.246 --> 30:20.072
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking at comments from chat, Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, you could have an iPhone app for WoW.

30:20.412 --> 30:24.316
[SPEAKER_17]: Here you do your single player quests and gather loot and or items for your character.

30:24.877 --> 30:28.420
[SPEAKER_17]: I still think it would be a lesser game than what you have on the PC.

30:28.961 --> 30:29.521
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know.

30:29.541 --> 30:34.166
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, granted, okay, you have a lot of iPhone games that are lesser versions of... But, I mean...

30:34.947 --> 30:35.507
[SPEAKER_17]: and DarkSakura.

30:55.387 --> 31:00.349
[SPEAKER_06]: or like, I don't know, Phantasy Star online would be kind of cool.

31:00.389 --> 31:01.609
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's other things you could do.

31:01.629 --> 31:05.451
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't think the World of Warcraft game is going to fit on an iPhone.

31:05.871 --> 31:06.511
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's move on.

31:06.591 --> 31:08.572
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have more Warcraft news, right, DarkSakura?

31:08.972 --> 31:09.472
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

31:10.173 --> 31:11.113
[SPEAKER_13]: You addicts.

31:12.133 --> 31:14.394
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been thrown another bone by PopCap.

31:15.735 --> 31:20.717
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there's a new command in World of Warcraft that I'm sure Rob has used.

31:21.784 --> 31:22.847
[SPEAKER_13]: It's slash peggle.

31:23.208 --> 31:24.953
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yes, yes, more yes.

31:25.073 --> 31:27.399
[SPEAKER_17]: This is amazing what has happened this week.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.242
[SPEAKER_13]: It's freaking peggle.

31:29.877 --> 31:35.461
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you type it in, you can play Peggle, challenge each other, and have Peggle duels.

31:36.422 --> 31:38.923
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have your friends do an enormous battle.

31:39.544 --> 31:41.825
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have a time limit, not a time limit.

31:42.346 --> 31:43.627
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, you can do Peggle loot.

31:44.467 --> 31:48.050
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can decide who takes the loot instead of doing the roll command.

31:49.971 --> 31:57.536
[SPEAKER_13]: But you also have World of Warcraft themed backgrounds and points for using a special Peggle talent tree.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.319
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's fucking Peggle and fucking World of Warcraft.

32:03.019 --> 32:07.521
[SPEAKER_17]: And honestly, just reading about it or hearing about it right now does not do this justice.

32:07.581 --> 32:09.322
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, just how awesome this marriage is.

32:09.622 --> 32:10.722
[SPEAKER_13]: My soul cries.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.903
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, really, you have to see it.

32:12.963 --> 32:18.445
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's like, they really have adapted the game Peggle for free, put it into Warcraft, and...

32:19.285 --> 32:22.108
[SPEAKER_17]: They have these all new stages that are based off the WoW levels.

32:22.468 --> 32:27.913
[SPEAKER_17]: They've made this talent tree, which is a WoW thing, but they made it about Peggle.

32:28.334 --> 32:30.075
[SPEAKER_17]: You can do duels through the game.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.418
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's pretty... Rice Princess, I know you've been playing the hell out of this.

32:33.459 --> 32:34.740
[SPEAKER_17]: I kicked your ass at a duel the other day.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.355
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:55.066 --> 32:55.406
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

32:56.406 --> 32:59.687
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how the levels are based on actual places in WoW.

32:59.707 --> 33:04.969
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they have the pictures in the background and all the pegels are arranged, like, kind of like in the regular Peggle.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.590
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the way, for those that have never played Peggle before, it's like Plinko as a game.

33:08.970 --> 33:09.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinda.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.290
[SPEAKER_17]: From The Price is Right.

33:10.410 --> 33:10.550
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinda.

33:10.570 --> 33:10.950
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

33:11.410 --> 33:16.632
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to, like, shoot at these little pegs and make them go away and they bounce on each other and stuff like that.

33:16.652 --> 33:20.353
[SPEAKER_10]: And it sounds like the most mediocre, boring game ever, but it's so fun.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.033
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very addicting.

33:21.053 --> 33:22.813
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll spend, like, hours playing it.

33:22.853 --> 33:23.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me.

33:24.454 --> 33:24.594
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

33:25.094 --> 33:27.020
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really awesome.

33:29.324 --> 33:32.386
[SPEAKER_17]: So, good times, very good times with this.

33:32.486 --> 33:34.568
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, just the marriage of two crackheads.

33:34.768 --> 33:47.658
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I like about it, like, I'm not going to sign into WoW just to play Peggle, but it's really great because sometimes, especially, like, I'm leveling an alt right now, so I don't have a mount, I don't have a flying mount or anything like that, so when I'm using the flying taxi system, it takes four minutes to go from one place to another.

33:47.958 --> 33:50.080
[SPEAKER_17]: Peggle's a great distraction to pass the time.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.681
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's integrated into the game.

33:51.701 --> 33:52.641
[SPEAKER_00]: Four whole minutes, Bob!

33:52.842 --> 33:53.162
[SPEAKER_17]: I know!

33:53.642 --> 33:56.044
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a long time to fly in WoW when you're a low-level player.

33:56.344 --> 34:11.654
[SPEAKER_17]: 4 whole minutes at least it's not Final Fantasy 11 you didn't even have you had to wait 10 minutes for the airship to show up then you get on the airship take a 10 minute ride and then it might be remotely near where you're trying to go

34:12.173 --> 34:15.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's why Final Fantasy XI is ridiculous.

34:15.255 --> 34:16.216
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure it's gotten a lot better.

34:16.236 --> 34:17.457
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more realistic, though.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.158
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it is more realistic.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.821
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think they have more teleport spells and stuff now to help ease that up.

34:22.841 --> 34:23.442
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a crap.

34:23.482 --> 34:24.563
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a crappy game.

34:24.683 --> 34:25.163
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, shut up.

34:25.183 --> 34:26.504
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, anyhow.

34:27.045 --> 34:30.527
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, Peggle is in WoW, and the amazing part is it's free.

34:31.128 --> 34:33.009
[SPEAKER_17]: But what a great thing for PopCap's brand.

34:33.049 --> 34:34.891
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, everybody's talking about it this week.

34:34.911 --> 34:36.132
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's talking about Peg Crack.

34:36.872 --> 34:38.513
[SPEAKER_17]: We got sucked right in just like everybody else.

34:39.134 --> 34:39.874
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

34:41.256 --> 34:49.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so something not Peggle related, but actually, oddly enough, it's something related to what's going on just in TV.

34:49.502 --> 34:55.647
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dreamcast, yes, Sega isn't making Dreamcasts anymore, however, you can still purchase them.

34:55.727 --> 35:00.651
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, ThinkGeek is now offering brand new Dreamcasts for $100, $99.99.

35:04.856 --> 35:20.781
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, yes, and it includes, of course, uh, it's a version 2.0, um, with the web browser version 2.0, including Sega Swirl, and a demo disc, and, um, yeah, awesome, brand new Dreamcast.

35:21.621 --> 35:25.602
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when I got my Dreamcast, I wanted it at an all-nighter at QZAR.

35:25.622 --> 35:27.522
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Dreamcast?

35:27.643 --> 35:28.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want this.

35:28.763 --> 35:32.744
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I got, I got games for it, and I'm like, sweet, it has Power Stone, that's awesome.

35:33.837 --> 35:36.299
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even think new Dreamcasts existed anymore.

35:36.359 --> 35:37.580
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the crazy part to me.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.203
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, where did they find new Dreamcasts?

35:41.123 --> 35:42.044
[SPEAKER_17]: Where did they find these?

35:42.765 --> 35:43.145
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

35:43.165 --> 35:44.046
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe in a warehouse?

35:44.326 --> 35:45.127
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess so.

35:45.287 --> 35:46.829
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, just collecting dust somewhere.

35:46.849 --> 35:56.217
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have to say, though, the article on this is amazing for showing the last Sega Tatsunoshiro commercial when the Dreamcasts came out.

35:57.581 --> 36:05.267
[SPEAKER_17]: I would really recommend picking up a Dreamcast if you have some extra money and you want a great system with a lot of homebrew available out there.

36:05.887 --> 36:12.053
[SPEAKER_17]: I realize the legality of some of this stuff is questionable, but the Dreamcast is a great, great system.

36:12.093 --> 36:13.274
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it has good games anyway.

36:13.874 --> 36:16.116
[SPEAKER_13]: And make yourself a boot disk and you can play in the import.

36:16.957 --> 36:17.537
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

36:17.597 --> 36:18.338
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're easy.

36:18.838 --> 36:20.439
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some real classics on Dreamcast.

36:20.459 --> 36:22.981
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure many classic games of the week that DarkSakura's picked have come from there.

36:24.042 --> 36:26.583
[SPEAKER_17]: Space Channel 5, Sonic Adventure.

36:26.824 --> 36:29.185
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just great games on Dreamcast.

36:30.866 --> 36:32.948
[SPEAKER_17]: Check it out if you don't already have one of these.

36:34.149 --> 36:35.910
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of old stuff... Oh, they're sold out.

36:36.710 --> 36:37.391
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they all gone?

36:38.071 --> 36:40.093
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably because the blogs all picked up the stories.

36:40.173 --> 36:40.633
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gone.

36:42.474 --> 36:43.795
[SPEAKER_13]: Console sold out.

36:43.975 --> 36:44.956
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they'll get more in the future.

36:46.786 --> 36:50.090
[SPEAKER_17]: Old Sierra Games Leisure Suit Larry 1, Police Quest 1, Space Quest 1

37:03.587 --> 37:10.750
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's kind of cool because the games run in Flash, but there's this weird multiplayer element where you can watch other people solve puzzles.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.951
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a new right-click menu system in the game.

37:14.192 --> 37:19.634
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to check this out, the website is called sarien.net, S-A-R-I-E-N dot net.

37:19.754 --> 37:24.076
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's just kind of like a walkthrough of these classic old-school Sierra games.

37:24.316 --> 37:29.178
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you were a Sierra game fan like I was back in the day, then you definitely want to check that out.

37:30.319 --> 37:30.579
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura

37:47.955 --> 37:58.602
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm sure some of our regular listeners remember me talking about getting a FC Mobile, which is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.

37:59.863 --> 38:03.245
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there is a new one, which I am going to be getting and selling my old one.

38:04.186 --> 38:08.149
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the FC Mobile 2, and it comes with stuff and things.

38:10.090 --> 38:15.334
[SPEAKER_13]: As in, it comes with controllers.

38:17.110 --> 38:19.532
[SPEAKER_13]: They're wireless controllers and a light gun.

38:19.632 --> 38:20.673
[SPEAKER_13]: A wireless light gun.

38:21.134 --> 38:26.238
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty good in relation to the old NES Zapper.

38:26.838 --> 38:35.745
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you have it basically using the TV tuner mode and using it as your Nintendo, you have actual controllers.

38:35.785 --> 38:37.066
[SPEAKER_13]: You do not have to use the system.

38:37.807 --> 38:40.068
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to be out in May.

38:40.969 --> 38:45.793
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be $60 and it will have a black version and a white version.

38:46.770 --> 39:10.704
[SPEAKER_17]: and um I'm gonna have one mine will go up for sale my old one the end I this this is so interesting how the old school Nintendo stuff is making such a comeback what thanks to in part this whole FC mobile stuff so it's kind of cool kind of cool how much money you think you're gonna end up spending on all this crap not much it's only 60 bucks it should be cheaper um elsewhere

39:12.487 --> 39:19.213
[SPEAKER_17]: Hitstun in our chatroom right now says, yeah, this week I bought an FC Mobile, tried it, realized the fucking A and B buttons were backwards and returned it for a refund.

39:19.233 --> 39:20.134
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, they're fixing that.

39:20.474 --> 39:21.535
[SPEAKER_17]: All in about a half hour's time.

39:21.615 --> 39:22.296
[SPEAKER_13]: They're fixing that.

39:23.176 --> 39:26.800
[SPEAKER_13]: They've reversed the A and B buttons to where they should be on the new version.

39:27.660 --> 39:31.164
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that have anything to do with the fact that in Japan most games do have it flipped?

39:31.304 --> 39:33.526
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is that just, no, it really was messed up?

39:34.474 --> 39:38.776
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that they based the old FC mobile off of the Famicom mobile.

39:40.116 --> 39:50.481
[SPEAKER_13]: The US one was based off of the Japanese one, but I think that the US release one is going to actually... They were saying that the button should be corrected for American audiences.

39:51.681 --> 39:52.001
[SPEAKER_17]: Alrighty.

39:54.298 --> 39:55.759
[SPEAKER_17]: I like King's Quest better than Space Quest.

39:55.779 --> 39:56.500
[SPEAKER_17]: I like Space Quest 4.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.120
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.

40:17.489 --> 40:17.909
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I do.

40:17.989 --> 40:21.531
[SPEAKER_17]: I like Leisure Suit Larry too, but I think King's Quest is more accessible for everybody.

40:22.451 --> 40:25.932
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to have a certain sense of humor to like Leisure Suit Larry.

40:27.873 --> 40:28.393
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

40:29.554 --> 40:30.674
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, more news.

40:30.934 --> 40:31.955
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got release dates coming up.

40:32.395 --> 40:32.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

40:33.695 --> 40:35.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this ought to make Jamie happy.

40:36.176 --> 40:42.959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been confirmed that next week on the Virtual Console, on Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual Lawn will be coming out.

40:42.979 --> 40:43.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

40:44.298 --> 40:49.041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on April 29th, you can expect Virtualon out on Xbox Live Arcade.

40:50.922 --> 40:54.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, though, it is going to be priced at 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.

40:54.625 --> 40:54.725
[SPEAKER_06]: So?

40:54.825 --> 41:00.069
[SPEAKER_06]: That earns a so from me.

41:00.129 --> 41:01.249
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Virtualon.

41:01.349 --> 41:03.371
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live.

41:03.451 --> 41:06.793
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live Marketplace recently.

41:06.833 --> 41:08.594
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there's Virtualon.

41:08.614 --> 41:09.295
[SPEAKER_13]: Or an adapter.

41:09.595 --> 41:10.055
[SPEAKER_17]: An outrun.

41:10.776 --> 41:11.436
[SPEAKER_13]: Adapter.

41:12.377 --> 41:13.998
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can use my Dreamcast twin sticks.

41:15.464 --> 41:33.824
[SPEAKER_17]: random Xbox Live Arcade one thing I did play actually this week as well was Lode Runner I did check that out because I have fond memories of that game on the Commodore 64 personally I don't think that game has aged very well they've tried to make it look nicer but I think the core game itself has not aged very well I think it's a game that's better left in my memory on the Commodore 64

41:36.806 --> 41:45.972
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to base the review off the demo, but as I was checking it out, I was kind of going, this is one of those things that I remember a lot more fondly when I was younger.

41:47.233 --> 41:49.515
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a nice new graphics.

41:50.315 --> 41:56.299
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like they put the same old game in this nice new packaging, but it's still the same old game that I think is better left in the 80s.

41:57.200 --> 41:57.700
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.462
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's go to some release dates.

42:01.977 --> 42:02.637
[SPEAKER_17]: X-Blades X-Blades

42:27.711 --> 42:37.773
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, you have Jikkyo Powerful Major League 2009 and Mahjong Kakuto Club Wii come out as well.

42:37.793 --> 42:39.333
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of a slow release week.

42:39.533 --> 42:40.234
[SPEAKER_00]: Battle Club.

42:40.314 --> 42:41.034
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can imagine.

42:41.314 --> 42:42.254
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

42:42.334 --> 42:47.915
[SPEAKER_17]: PlayStation 2 has a game called NHL 2009 as well as Tiernanog is coming out as well.

42:47.935 --> 42:49.216
[SPEAKER_17]: Wasn't that a song in DDR?

42:49.696 --> 42:49.936
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

42:51.896 --> 42:52.296
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it is.

42:52.456 --> 42:53.216
[SPEAKER_17]: It is.

42:53.296 --> 42:54.837
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a game based off the Mystic Knights of Tiernanog.

42:55.157 --> 42:55.637
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it is.

42:56.097 --> 42:56.237
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?

42:57.105 --> 42:58.627
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say it's Celtic Mythology.

42:59.088 --> 42:59.628
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it is.

42:59.949 --> 43:00.910
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a role-playing game.

43:00.930 --> 43:01.891
[SPEAKER_17]: This actually looks kind of cool.

43:02.973 --> 43:03.393
[SPEAKER_13]: Neato.

43:03.693 --> 43:05.956
[SPEAKER_17]: That's on PlayStation 2 of all systems.

43:06.477 --> 43:09.080
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's coming out from SystemSoft this week in Japan.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.662
[SPEAKER_17]: That looks to be the most exciting thing I've seen yet.

43:11.403 --> 43:12.344
[SPEAKER_17]: Going to the handhelds.

43:12.364 --> 43:14.647
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if there's any big handheld stuff coming out this week.

43:15.248 --> 43:17.671
[SPEAKER_17]: Dragon Ball Z, WarioWare, Shinobi Retsuden 3

43:32.475 --> 44:00.509
[SPEAKER_17]: and let's see, that's all on the DS and on the Sony PSP there you go, Persona comes out just this week on the PSP that must be the big game that's coming out this week as well as a version of Tier Nanook on Sony PSP you fail at Blaster Master that's kind of cool alright so they're playing Blaster Master on Justin.TV right now but having a hard time with the Dreamcast controller there you go alright

44:01.397 --> 44:02.318
[SPEAKER_17]: Marbles Balance Challenge Wii

44:23.663 --> 44:24.644
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a slow week.

44:24.784 --> 44:27.406
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Marbles Balance Challenge is a WiiWare game.

44:27.987 --> 44:30.809
[SPEAKER_13]: They're too busy practicing fertility rights.

44:31.750 --> 44:32.751
[SPEAKER_13]: Dancing the maypole.

44:33.932 --> 44:37.015
[SPEAKER_06]: This week there's not a whole lot coming out as well in the U.S.

44:37.716 --> 44:43.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting off Backyard Baseball 2010 coming out on the PlayStation 2, but you might as well skip that game because it sucks.

44:44.702 --> 44:49.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantasy Aquarium World, which is apparently a port of the DS franchise,

44:49.474 --> 44:50.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Aquarium Game.

44:50.955 --> 44:51.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Also sucks.

44:51.796 --> 44:52.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Please avoid that one.

44:53.197 --> 44:53.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible game.

44:55.219 --> 44:59.823
[SPEAKER_06]: Elite Forces Unit 77 coming out on the DS.

45:00.984 --> 45:03.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Still horrible, but okay.

45:03.245 --> 45:06.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Velvet Assassin coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

45:06.268 --> 45:07.309
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's supposed to be okay.

45:08.230 --> 45:11.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Dynasty Warriors Strike Force on PSP.

45:11.292 --> 45:14.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

45:15.691 --> 45:19.232
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the wrong date, but Klonoa on the Wii is supposed to be coming out.

45:19.332 --> 45:23.754
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the week after, but we'll go with that, I guess.

45:24.054 --> 45:27.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Robot Taisen OG Saga Endless Frontier, which actually looks pretty cool.

45:27.876 --> 45:28.936
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out on the DS.

45:29.756 --> 45:32.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Tournament Pool coming out from Destiny, which means that must suck.

45:33.738 --> 45:34.418
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on the Wii.

45:35.439 --> 45:42.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming out on the DS.

45:42.421 --> 45:43.742
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it like Imagine Fuego?

45:44.807 --> 45:46.669
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not quite Imagine Fuego.

45:47.509 --> 45:52.953
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, probably the bigger game of the week, and this is sad, but X-Men Origins Wolverine.

45:53.574 --> 46:03.161
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you happen to be buying it on the 360 and on the PlayStation 3, the Uncaged Edition, which means it's slightly more violent, will be coming out in pretty much every system out there.

46:04.022 --> 46:09.546
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also some more crap from Destiny or Party Pigs, Farmyard Games on the Wii.

46:11.127 --> 46:12.228
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is it.

46:14.448 --> 46:17.050
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:38.464 --> 46:42.426
[SPEAKER_17]: The Wii Video Service is going to be launching in Japan on May 1st.

46:42.806 --> 46:43.826
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the cool thing about it.

46:43.986 --> 46:46.467
[SPEAKER_17]: You will be able to connect with your DSi.

46:46.987 --> 46:49.348
[SPEAKER_17]: Notice how it doesn't say your DS, but your DSi.

46:49.788 --> 46:54.150
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called the Wii No Ma Channel, and it's coming out from May 1st.

46:54.670 --> 47:00.332
[SPEAKER_17]: It's being launched by Nintendo, and Densu is their publisher partner.

47:00.852 --> 47:04.654
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it makes sense that you couldn't do the DS because you can't download anything to the DS.

47:05.851 --> 47:07.232
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you can't download programs.

47:08.113 --> 47:09.533
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, to the regular DS, yeah.

47:10.134 --> 47:14.537
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you could... I guess you could... Well, couldn't you download a movie to the regular DS, close it, and have it later?

47:14.597 --> 47:14.937
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

47:15.017 --> 47:16.398
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as you don't turn it off.

47:16.798 --> 47:20.721
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I believe it uses flash memory for the... For the...

47:21.341 --> 47:22.302
[SPEAKER_13]: Demo's

47:50.834 --> 47:52.015
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48:16.130 --> 48:17.833
[SPEAKER_17]: that you get from this channel.

48:18.153 --> 48:22.380
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd get it to your DSI and then they scan it on your DSI at the restaurant to redeem it.

48:22.880 --> 48:23.321
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of neat.

48:25.126 --> 48:28.807
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a trailer out there on the internet if you want to check that out, but it is in Japanese.

48:29.127 --> 48:30.148
[SPEAKER_17]: So, there you go.

48:31.188 --> 48:33.049
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think they'll have something like this out here soon?

48:33.729 --> 48:34.349
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.889
[SPEAKER_13]: Too much trouble for us lazy Americans.

48:36.290 --> 48:42.211
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you'll have quite that cool functionality like the fast food restaurant thing I was describing, but why not the video service?

48:42.992 --> 48:48.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would mean that they actually are going to embrace online for the US and that's never going to happen.

48:49.073 --> 48:51.074
[SPEAKER_17]: But wasn't Japan always kind of holding them back?

48:52.321 --> 48:56.845
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no, because... Look at the one company that's braced online better than anybody else is an American company.

48:57.645 --> 48:58.266
[SPEAKER_17]: Microsoft.

48:58.826 --> 48:59.167
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

49:00.548 --> 49:02.649
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nintendo is a Japanese-run company.

49:03.690 --> 49:07.754
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, and Sony has been always having to run to catch up with the online stuff.

49:08.823 --> 49:10.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Belize are willing to give it a shot.

49:10.304 --> 49:17.467
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, after all, their systems, you know, did have, you know, support for, you know, online network games.

49:17.707 --> 49:22.069
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, the GameCube did as well, but, I mean, honestly, how many games really used it?

49:22.889 --> 49:23.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, two.

49:26.391 --> 49:26.791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

49:26.971 --> 49:28.051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we'll see this.

49:29.072 --> 49:33.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, after all, they haven't even brought the normal video download service to, you know, the Wii yet, so...

49:35.467 --> 49:36.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the video streaming?

49:37.128 --> 49:40.670
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't see this as something they're just going to do.

49:41.350 --> 49:45.392
[SPEAKER_06]: It adds functionality to the Wii, but really they don't need it.

49:45.512 --> 49:51.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people want to buy Wii Sports and hopefully Wii Sports 2 or Wii Sports Resort.

49:51.716 --> 49:54.177
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well we'll see if they give this a shot in the US or not.

49:54.277 --> 49:55.478
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not.

49:55.898 --> 49:56.658
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, moving on.

49:56.859 --> 49:57.219
[SPEAKER_17]: More news.

49:59.449 --> 50:04.812
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in other news, this is actually a statement made by American McGee.

50:05.313 --> 50:06.934
[SPEAKER_13]: And I fully endorse this, you know.

50:06.954 --> 50:10.236
[SPEAKER_13]: They're asked about...

50:12.393 --> 50:27.136
[SPEAKER_13]: The trend of using user-made content, and American McGee was saying that it's actually extortion of the users to make the content.

50:27.176 --> 50:31.617
[SPEAKER_13]: They're basically using the users to make the game, they just make the properties to go with it.

50:32.717 --> 50:40.419
[SPEAKER_13]: He thinks that there should be some kind of reward out there for gamers who make the content, which I agree with.

50:40.459 --> 50:41.639
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would be a good idea.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.302
[SPEAKER_13]: or at least contests and things like that.

50:46.243 --> 50:53.929
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's really just partially laziness on part of the programs.

50:53.989 --> 51:02.897
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it actually, there's the immersive element of having people, the players provide content, but at the same time, yeah, they should be rewarded for it.

51:03.137 --> 51:03.637
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

51:20.971 --> 51:22.212
[SPEAKER_17]: Alice is Good

51:42.489 --> 51:43.790
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you mean if I'm going to use a drawing app?

51:43.810 --> 51:47.434
[SPEAKER_17]: Or let other people... Is the pencil company going to sell your drawing, basically?

51:47.454 --> 51:50.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be... Yeah, but they're not selling their online content.

51:50.957 --> 51:55.341
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to be drawing up for common use so that anybody else on the internet can use your piece?

51:55.381 --> 51:56.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Then don't make anything for it.

51:56.922 --> 51:57.623
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the thing.

51:57.703 --> 52:04.289
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, if you're going to be all butthurt about people using your stuff that you made, then don't make anything.

52:04.389 --> 52:07.312
[SPEAKER_13]: The point is that the games rely on user consent.

52:07.432 --> 52:15.261
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't, because they actually have their own standby levels, and if you never touched online, it wouldn't matter anyways, because you still got full games worth of stuff.

52:15.321 --> 52:17.223
[SPEAKER_17]: To be fair, I'm using LittleBigPlanet as an example.

52:17.303 --> 52:20.666
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know exactly what kind of game he had in mind, either.

52:20.686 --> 52:21.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he's full of crap.

52:21.848 --> 52:26.433
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, his game Grimm is... I'm sorry, it's not that great, but...

52:27.914 --> 52:28.654
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

52:28.694 --> 52:31.595
[SPEAKER_06]: He thinks he's an expert because he's developed two game series.

52:32.256 --> 52:34.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, let's bow down to you.

52:34.556 --> 52:35.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.717
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your Bad Day LA game?

52:36.777 --> 52:37.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

52:37.437 --> 52:38.698
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't very good.

52:39.218 --> 52:43.900
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe if you had some user-created content, it would have made that game worth buying, but...

52:44.952 --> 52:54.943
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, it's just, I'm kind of in the middle here, like I kind of understand what he, I do agree that if companies are going to use your stuff, you should get rewards for that, you know what I mean?

52:54.983 --> 52:59.808
[SPEAKER_17]: You should be able to, they could even go as far as compensation, you know what I mean?

53:00.228 --> 53:02.590
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that there should actually be contests.

53:03.651 --> 53:05.132
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, content contests.

53:05.192 --> 53:10.156
[SPEAKER_17]: And Sony does kind of reward, like they give the crowns in LittleBigPlanet if you're super popular.

53:10.216 --> 53:12.678
[SPEAKER_17]: The trophies are based off the popularity of your levels.

53:13.098 --> 53:13.919
[SPEAKER_17]: Little perks.

53:13.959 --> 53:14.559
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing big.

53:14.599 --> 53:15.460
[SPEAKER_13]: Like real prizes.

53:16.340 --> 53:16.861
[SPEAKER_17]: Real stuff.

53:17.581 --> 53:18.262
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's what I think.

53:18.547 --> 53:19.687
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

53:19.727 --> 53:23.949
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys have a comment, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is a place you can leave us a comment on this.

53:24.949 --> 53:29.091
[SPEAKER_17]: Or you can always send us a tweet at OLR is a place you can go as well.

53:29.191 --> 53:31.772
[SPEAKER_17]: Some comments from chat right now over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

53:32.112 --> 53:34.312
[SPEAKER_17]: Leo Shen says, hopefully that new Alice game will be good.

53:34.452 --> 53:36.553
[SPEAKER_17]: I keep forgetting they are working on a new Alice game, aren't they?

53:37.113 --> 53:38.634
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working on an Alice movie too.

53:38.854 --> 53:40.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Alice in Wonderland.

53:40.535 --> 53:42.775
[SPEAKER_06]: He was supposed to be working on an Alice movie as well.

53:42.815 --> 53:43.936
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

53:44.016 --> 53:44.336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

53:45.731 --> 53:46.311
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:07.122 --> 54:08.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just one person's opinion.

54:08.363 --> 54:10.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like his opinion.

54:10.404 --> 54:11.725
[SPEAKER_06]: He thinks that people should be compensated.

54:11.985 --> 54:12.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, great.

54:12.565 --> 54:18.248
[SPEAKER_06]: If he ever creates a game that has user-created content, then I want to see him compensating everybody, since he's made such a fuss over it.

54:18.349 --> 54:19.229
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

54:20.270 --> 54:21.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

54:22.271 --> 54:22.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

54:23.471 --> 54:30.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Advent Children Complete, the brand new Blu-ray box set that came out in Japan last week, has actually been doing very well.

54:30.836 --> 54:32.797
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's sold over 274,000 copies, and

54:37.182 --> 54:40.243
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo itself has actually pushed the PS3 to the top of the charts.

54:41.343 --> 54:45.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Because yes, people do actually want to buy this box set for the game.

54:46.185 --> 54:47.086
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's fine.

54:47.446 --> 54:48.246
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie's awesome too.

54:48.626 --> 54:53.568
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's definitely... I mean, they must be pretty confident in it.

54:53.768 --> 54:58.350
[SPEAKER_06]: After all, they did release a special edition PS3 in Japan with this box set.

54:58.890 --> 55:02.311
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, people love their Final Fantasy VII.

55:04.167 --> 55:11.851
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though it's really probably the Final Fantasy XIII demo that's driving all of this Yes I mean, how many of those came to America?

55:11.951 --> 55:25.679
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I haven't heard of people importing a game as much as I've heard of this Like, I seriously know, I know you imported it One of my friends on LiveJournal imported it I know Bobby imported it And I don't, like, I haven't heard of that many people importing anything else You know what I mean?

55:26.397 --> 55:27.418
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:54.144 --> 55:55.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, because it'll be region free.

55:55.746 --> 55:56.508
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be region free.

55:56.688 --> 55:57.649
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a few months early.

55:58.751 --> 56:01.455
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they'll buy it again in the US because we're all consumer whores, right?

56:01.495 --> 56:01.996
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

56:02.376 --> 56:02.797
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

56:02.857 --> 56:03.959
[SPEAKER_17]: Already thinking about it.

56:04.259 --> 56:04.660
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

56:05.137 --> 56:09.619
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm kind of curious, chat room, what kind of games, because I see Actdeft Comments has imported three games.

56:10.179 --> 56:13.680
[SPEAKER_17]: What are some games, chat room, you've imported in the past year?

56:13.700 --> 56:19.062
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, when you, and the reason why I ask this is because it costs a lot more money when you order import games from Japan.

56:19.442 --> 56:21.983
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm kind of curious, those of you in chat, give me some ideas.

56:22.023 --> 56:27.805
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of games have you imported in the past year or two, we'll say year or two, within this current console cycle?

56:28.145 --> 56:29.906
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, what kind of stuff have you imported?

56:30.186 --> 56:33.187
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the only thing you've imported during this cycle?

56:33.627 --> 56:35.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, I imported Smash Bros.

56:35.214 --> 56:35.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl.

56:36.679 --> 56:37.783
[SPEAKER_06]: I also imported...

56:40.356 --> 56:41.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls

57:08.268 --> 57:10.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even played the PS3 games I have now.

57:10.410 --> 57:13.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I have Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 that I still haven't played anything.

57:14.773 --> 57:23.780
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I haven't even gotten past, like, the first level in, um... Well, I passed the first level, but not the second level in Resistance 2, so... I don't know.

57:23.820 --> 57:33.287
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought about getting a Japanese Xbox 360 because I haven't figured out a good way to region-free my, um... 360, since most of the games that come out in Japan aren't region-free on the 360, so...

57:35.462 --> 57:36.349
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's pretty much it.

57:36.430 --> 57:38.063
[SPEAKER_06]: Just those three games.

57:40.431 --> 57:44.713
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me read some comments from our chatroom about the imports, the games that have been imported.

57:45.113 --> 57:53.137
[SPEAKER_17]: Actdeft says he's imported Happy Sky, Gyakuten Saiban 2, and Street Fighter's Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.

57:53.157 --> 57:53.938
[SPEAKER_17]: Why can't I talk tonight?

57:54.658 --> 58:06.204
[SPEAKER_17]: Dark Knight says 2DX Red, Leo Shen says 2DX, Poppin' and Oz, GS68 says Kitsui Death Label, Poppin' Music 13 Carnival, DJ Max Portable, Black Square, DJ

58:06.744 --> 58:08.827
[SPEAKER_17]: Jason says, current console cycle, I haven't.

58:08.887 --> 58:11.310
[SPEAKER_17]: Goldanthro says, I've never really imported a game ever.

58:11.670 --> 58:12.591
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the extra money.

58:13.893 --> 58:14.333
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

58:15.194 --> 58:17.978
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the comments from things that have been imported in the current cycle.

58:19.319 --> 58:21.722
[SPEAKER_17]: Funny enough, none of them said the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

58:23.224 --> 58:24.445
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

58:25.475 --> 58:25.775
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

58:26.657 --> 58:30.141
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, PlayStation Home, another popular destination on the PlayStation 3.

58:30.181 --> 58:33.044
[SPEAKER_17]: There is an update coming for PlayStation Home.

58:33.305 --> 58:35.307
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a new Disgaea Lounge.

58:35.507 --> 58:39.332
[SPEAKER_17]: And apparently in this new Disgaea area, you'll be able to play like a Disgaea test.

58:39.612 --> 58:42.576
[SPEAKER_17]: There'll be a card game, some type of block game available as well.

58:42.616 --> 58:43.597
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, prinnies.

58:44.198 --> 58:46.599
[SPEAKER_17]: LittlePrettyPenguin people that you can see in this area.

58:47.400 --> 58:49.101
[SPEAKER_17]: Also some other stuff coming to home this month.

58:49.141 --> 58:50.741
[SPEAKER_17]: Street Fighter IV Avatar items.

58:51.142 --> 58:53.403
[SPEAKER_17]: You can start Street Fighter IV within home.

58:53.963 --> 59:02.207
[SPEAKER_17]: And Uncharted Waters Online, Cruz del Sur is supposed to come out as well, which offers some new home items within home.

59:02.908 --> 59:03.408
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

59:05.949 --> 59:07.510
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all coming to PlayStation Home.

59:07.850 --> 59:09.271
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't been to home in a while.

59:09.679 --> 59:12.960
[SPEAKER_17]: Me neither, but well, I guess only a couple weeks when I say a while.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.800
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, there you go.

59:16.180 --> 59:17.901
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all coming to PlayStation Home this month.

59:19.641 --> 59:20.701
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's special.

59:22.261 --> 59:23.202
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very special.

59:24.742 --> 59:27.742
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about some different PlayStation 3 news?

59:27.762 --> 59:34.744
[SPEAKER_13]: This is definitely a reason that is if you... Sorry, the mic's died for a minute.

59:35.604 --> 59:36.264
[SPEAKER_17]: It was my fault.

59:37.338 --> 59:38.719
[SPEAKER_17]: Live radio, boys and girls.

59:38.859 --> 59:39.399
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that work?

59:39.639 --> 59:40.960
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear that microphone?

59:41.000 --> 59:41.440
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sorry.

59:41.460 --> 59:41.961
[SPEAKER_13]: Roar!

59:41.981 --> 59:42.061
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

59:42.081 --> 59:44.842
[SPEAKER_13]: You're fine, go ahead.

59:44.862 --> 59:46.883
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a problem, you can take it up with me.

59:50.479 --> 59:58.704
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so for fans of the PlayStation 3, there's a very good reason to have Arkham Asylum on that system.

59:59.005 --> 01:00:00.986
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you get to play the Joker.

01:00:01.606 --> 01:00:02.827
[SPEAKER_13]: The Joker is cool.

01:00:05.609 --> 01:00:09.712
[SPEAKER_13]: Reviews so far of the game have been pretty positive, so I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:16.896
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's really, though, no comment on if you're going to be able to use him at all on the Xbox 360 or PC.

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:17.897
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

01:00:19.423 --> 01:00:21.865
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, because Joker is Joker.

01:00:21.925 --> 01:00:22.245
[SPEAKER_13]: I want Harley.

01:00:47.219 --> 01:00:48.119
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you don't know.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.322
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe there's still going to be a special character on the 360 that's going to be, you know, everybody's going to want that, too.

01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:58.445
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously, the Joker's the big-ass deal with the movie and everything, but, you know, I don't know.

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.967
[SPEAKER_17]: Me, personally, I love Batman for years and years.

01:01:02.007 --> 01:01:05.508
[SPEAKER_06]: This will probably come out on the 360 after a certain amount of time.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:11.771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, sweeten the deal because you've got to sell some PS3 units since there's not as many systems.

01:01:11.992 --> 01:01:14.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Only if one of the Joker's attacks is the magic trick.

01:01:16.018 --> 01:01:17.979
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Mark Hamill Joker, so probably not.

01:01:17.999 --> 01:01:20.601
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right, X-Link is reminding us in chat that Mark Hamill is doing the voice.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.842
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, hot.

01:01:23.742 --> 01:01:29.446
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Mark Hamill is the best voice actor ever for Joker The End.

01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:38.631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also got the same guy that's doing the voice from the animated series for Batman as well, and I think they have the writer doing the actual story of the game too, so...

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:39.608
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.

01:01:39.869 --> 01:01:43.591
[SPEAKER_17]: Too bad they can't get Eartha Kitt for Catwoman because she's, you know, dead.

01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:45.332
[SPEAKER_17]: That would have been great.

01:01:45.392 --> 01:01:51.295
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I've seen in the video trailer for it, I think they have the same voice actor for Harley Quinn, too.

01:01:51.655 --> 01:01:52.276
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

01:01:52.936 --> 01:01:53.797
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I love Harley.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:02:02.922
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that she's great because she was totally made for the animated series and fans loved her so much that she made it into the comic universe.

01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:04.803
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I hope the game's as good as the hype.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.511
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's getting excited about it.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.372
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody's played the game yet.

01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:13.935
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, some people have had their hands on early copies to review it.

01:02:14.596 --> 01:02:17.978
[SPEAKER_13]: And it did get some pretty good reviews.

01:02:18.058 --> 01:02:19.659
[SPEAKER_13]: Eurogamer really, really liked it.

01:02:19.879 --> 01:02:21.580
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just excited because they had early copies.

01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:35.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Sony was teasing an electrifying announcement that they were going to make on April 27th regarding Uncharted Drake's Fortune 2 and also Infamous.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:41.412
[SPEAKER_06]: However, like any other secret announcement that they have, it got ruined by Best Buy.

01:02:41.572 --> 01:03:03.221
[SPEAKER_06]: So, apparently, part of the announcement, at least we can assume it's part, if not all, of the announcement, if you buy your copy of Infamous, you will get a downloadable demo, as well as access to Uncharted 2, Among Thieves, the multiplayer beta, one that launches in June.

01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:31.867
[SPEAKER_06]: so much like Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta you'll get to do a similar type of thing with Uncharted 2 and of course everyone's thought was hey, not only will you probably be able to play the Uncharted 2 beta but maybe the infamous character is going to be in Unlockable and Uncharted 2 so that might be another theory as well but we'll hear the official announcement on the 27th and everybody act surprised

01:03:33.436 --> 01:03:36.097
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry the surprise got ruined by Best Buy, Sony.

01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:37.858
[SPEAKER_17]: This sad trombone's for you.

01:03:45.562 --> 01:03:45.842
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

01:03:45.983 --> 01:03:47.863
[SPEAKER_17]: We love sad trombone here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:48.404 --> 01:03:54.787
[SPEAKER_17]: We should make that an official thing, that when this type of stuff happens, we give them a sad trombone, and then that's whatever little competition.

01:03:54.807 --> 01:03:56.188
[SPEAKER_17]: The sad trombone of the week.

01:03:56.248 --> 01:03:57.769
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right, the sad trombone of the week.

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:05.133
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we got one more story for you that won't be a sad trombone for some people are going to be very excited to hear this.

01:04:05.173 --> 01:04:09.816
[SPEAKER_17]: But apparently, you know, Kojima is swearing there's not going to be another Metal Gear for a while.

01:04:10.316 --> 01:04:15.479
[SPEAKER_17]: But one of the other games he's looking at possibly revisiting, Zone of the Enders.

01:04:16.259 --> 01:04:16.760
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.541
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently they are interested in making a Zone of the Enders 3.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:23.003
[SPEAKER_17]: And this came up during one of the Metal Gear Solid 4 podcasts.

01:04:24.858 --> 01:04:30.380
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been six years since Zone of the Enders, the second runner, but apparently Kojima is interested.

01:04:30.941 --> 01:04:34.842
[SPEAKER_17]: He wants gamers to email them if they're interested in seeing it happen.

01:04:35.283 --> 01:04:44.667
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you want to add to the email barrage I'm sure they're getting right now, go check that out, the MGS4 podcast, and you can send them an email.

01:04:45.387 --> 01:04:46.248
[SPEAKER_17]: Zone of the Enders 3

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:02.618
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes!

01:05:04.239 --> 01:05:04.739
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, why not?

01:05:04.979 --> 01:05:06.300
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as Sana sings the song

01:05:31.812 --> 01:05:32.893
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura is back DarkSakura is back

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.430
[SPEAKER_17]: The Game of the Week is Klonoa.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.051
[SPEAKER_17]: Because Klonoa is great.

01:05:50.151 --> 01:05:50.811
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's have some music, Rob.

01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:18.304
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, this is from the PlayStation 1 version of Klonoa.

01:06:18.624 --> 01:06:19.164
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's check it out.

01:06:20.785 --> 01:06:21.626
[SPEAKER_17]: Explosions!

01:06:22.987 --> 01:06:24.047
[SPEAKER_13]: I love these games, guys.

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.709
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna choke on the queue.

01:06:26.729 --> 01:06:28.770
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the best music ever.

01:06:43.786 --> 01:06:47.349
[SPEAKER_17]: You can still just see how nauseously cute this game is from music.

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:48.150
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:54.096
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it starts off nauseously cute, but how many people has, uh, actually, uh, played the damn game?

01:06:54.796 --> 01:06:58.460
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, basically, you start off, um, in a world called Phantom Isle.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:04.905
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Klonoa lives in his little village called Breeze Gale, and he lives with his grandfather.

01:07:06.187 --> 01:07:06.907
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um...

01:07:08.108 --> 01:07:16.553
[SPEAKER_13]: He goes and visits dream worlds where he has to go and save different people.

01:07:18.354 --> 01:07:25.278
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically he meets up with his buddy named Hupal who lives in a ring that Klonoa found in the forest.

01:07:26.298 --> 01:07:29.420
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where Klonoa gets his power from.

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:49.774
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, he basically has to go and rescue this girl named Lolo, who is a, uh, um, well, actually, wrong one, because he has to, no, I think it's Lolo that he has to, to, to, what's he have rescued?

01:07:53.018 --> 01:07:53.598
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:22.296
[SPEAKER_13]: He thinks that darker emotions should reign and that you should accept it as much as you do the light.

01:08:23.497 --> 01:08:29.844
[SPEAKER_13]: However, he's just doing this to do it, so...

01:08:31.866 --> 01:08:43.757
[SPEAKER_13]: As you go through the game, pretty much you're having to... I really don't want to spoil things too much, but as it goes through, you have to go through the different stages and fight the different bosses.

01:08:43.837 --> 01:08:47.901
[SPEAKER_13]: And the game plays sort of pseudo-3D.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:48.181
[SPEAKER_13]: It's...

01:08:50.083 --> 01:09:01.951
[SPEAKER_13]: It plays on a 2D platform, but you've got some three-dimensional elements thrown in, like hitting stuff that goes into the background, like to pop eggs to get more jewels to power your stuff up with.

01:09:02.531 --> 01:09:08.375
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can also rescue these different people that live in different places.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:13.559
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you've got these people that look like Klonoa in the first level, and you have these people that look like moon things in the next level.

01:09:14.379 --> 01:09:25.590
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to go through and actually rescue people as you go along and fight the enemies by picking up the smaller enemies and throwing them at the bigger ones or using the different properties.

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:30.294
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's ones that fly and you have to grab them and they'll fly you upwards a little bit.

01:09:32.596 --> 01:09:34.338
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a ton of fun.

01:09:34.358 --> 01:09:37.000
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually did get a sequel over here in the U.S.

01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:39.242
[SPEAKER_13]: which was Klonoa 2, Limity's Veil.

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:50.792
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and, uh, it, it really, it used, uh, cell shading for the game, and, um, this is, actually, uh, this is where, um, those other characters came in.

01:09:51.113 --> 01:10:03.643
[SPEAKER_13]: It, I don't, I'll be perfectly honest, I haven't played the first Klonoa in a long, long time, so I don't really remember all the people's names except for Joka and Godius, and I remember his grandfather, which was very sad, and I'm not gonna say what happens to him.

01:10:04.164 --> 01:10:05.225
[SPEAKER_13]: Joka, though, sucks.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.756
[SPEAKER_13]: Sucks a lot!

01:10:08.736 --> 01:10:21.243
[SPEAKER_13]: But Klonoa 2 had the sort of platformer levels and different types of boss battles and time attack challenges and water parks and things like that too.

01:10:22.143 --> 01:10:41.834
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but the thing about this game, about actually both of the games I'd say, is that for as cute and light as they look, and you know, it'd be a game that a little kid could play and not really understand the darker elements to, it does have a ton of darker elements.

01:10:41.894 --> 01:10:44.575
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really, this game gets downright freaking depressing.

01:10:45.856 --> 01:10:46.877
[SPEAKER_13]: Just depressing.

01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:51.900
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the further you get on in the game, you're like, oh my god, can this get any more screwed up?

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.761
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it gets more screwed up.

01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:54.801
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah.

01:10:54.821 --> 01:10:56.582
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:56.783 --> 01:11:01.105
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, did you happen to pick this game this week because there's that Wii version coming out very soon, or just coincidence?

01:11:01.525 --> 01:11:09.490
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was thinking about it, and what I do now when I pick a classic game is I'll look through my own collection, which usually takes me quite a while.

01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:15.174
[SPEAKER_13]: But I happened to see Klonoa, and I was like, oh, Klonoa's coming out this week, so I may as well pick it.

01:11:16.074 --> 01:11:20.457
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but there's also, um, other versions of the game, too.

01:11:20.497 --> 01:11:26.181
[SPEAKER_13]: There's, um, uh, Klonoa 2 Dream Champ Tournament that came out in Game Boy Advance in Japan.

01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:31.325
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and it actually did come out over here quite a bit later.

01:11:32.285 --> 01:11:40.731
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, there's also Klonoa Moonlight Museum, which came out in Japan on WonderSwan, which I, I might have, um,

01:11:42.512 --> 01:11:48.196
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's also Klonoa Empire of Dreams that also came out for Game Boy Advance.

01:11:49.137 --> 01:11:57.122
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's actually in 2002, there was Klonoa Heroes Legend of the Star Metal, which is an action RPG.

01:11:57.982 --> 01:12:01.165
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually play through the game as an RPG.

01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:06.788
[SPEAKER_13]: For other things, Klonoa had a cameo in MotoGP and Alpine Racer 3.

01:12:12.732 --> 01:12:18.654
[SPEAKER_13]: were a playable pair in Namco vs. Capcom.

01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:22.595
[SPEAKER_13]: And they had their moves from Klonoa Heroes.

01:12:22.795 --> 01:12:27.817
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can also see Joka, Janga, and the moves as enemies.

01:12:29.057 --> 01:12:30.718
[SPEAKER_13]: And also Lolo and...

01:12:32.378 --> 01:12:58.043
[SPEAKER_13]: Lala Kusha who was another priestess as non-playable characters and in Tales of Symphonia you could put Persia in a Klonoa costume there's also Shippu Tengoku Kaze no Klonoa which was a really just comedic manga about Klonoa who was a kid who wanted to be a superhero and

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:04.869
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, that's it.

01:13:04.889 --> 01:13:07.872
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just a fun, fun, fun game.

01:13:08.352 --> 01:13:14.858
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really, really... It can get difficult because you have to think ahead with the puzzles.

01:13:15.339 --> 01:13:23.607
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to always be keeping your eyes open, but it does build up in such a way that the learning curve really is a bit more kind.

01:13:27.535 --> 01:13:34.083
[SPEAKER_13]: It's... In fact, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the website I used to have a long time ago.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.926
[SPEAKER_13]: It was called the Anime and Video Game Alliance.

01:13:37.507 --> 01:13:39.949
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, this was a long, long time ago.

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:45.656
[SPEAKER_13]: But my... One of my banner characters was a picture of Klonoa.

01:13:46.657 --> 01:13:46.777
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

01:13:48.107 --> 01:13:50.308
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so... I've liked this game for a very long time.

01:13:50.568 --> 01:13:53.528
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely a classic, one that I know some of our listeners love.

01:13:53.548 --> 01:13:54.909
[SPEAKER_17]: They love that you picked this tonight.

01:13:54.929 --> 01:13:57.009
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you have it, Klonoa.

01:13:57.729 --> 01:13:58.970
[SPEAKER_17]: Your classic video game of the week.

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, did you play the conversation track?

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.330
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I played it in the background already.

01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:02.931
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

01:14:02.951 --> 01:14:04.771
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if we can go back to the beginning of that one.

01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:05.751
[SPEAKER_17]: I will try, yes.

01:14:05.771 --> 01:14:16.954
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the other thing I wanted to bring up, is that they have sort of a made-up language, which I tried to see if they were speaking Japanese or something, and of course, given the voice actors, it borrows a lot of elements from Japanese, but it's not quite...

01:14:17.794 --> 01:14:19.878
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually reminds me of La La Nea.

01:14:34.327 --> 01:14:34.667
[SPEAKER_17]: Cute.

01:14:35.067 --> 01:14:35.287
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:15:02.545 --> 01:15:02.925
[SPEAKER_17]: Klonoa.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:06.146
[SPEAKER_17]: Klonoa, your classic game of the week.

01:15:06.706 --> 01:15:08.967
[SPEAKER_13]: We also did, Dan and I used to walk around going, what do?

01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:10.567
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because.

01:15:10.908 --> 01:15:11.188
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:17.049
[SPEAKER_17]: That's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:17.069 --> 01:15:22.891
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got more stories to talk about in part B, some Xbox 360, some Penny Arcade Expo news we have as well, and plenty more.

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:26.572
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:32.938 --> 01:15:38.580
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 26th of 2009.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:45.222
[SPEAKER_17]: We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and then we put out the podcast at some point.

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:49.724
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, my name of course is Rob Roberts, joining you for this lovely Part B here of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:50.024 --> 01:15:56.666
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura is here as well, Loki, special guest tonight, The Doctor, and Rice Princess, and we've been joined by somebody else.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:56.866
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.848
[SPEAKER_17]: Fart Princess, Rice Princess, Wine and Belly Flop Night

01:16:22.503 --> 01:16:23.684
[SPEAKER_00]: A new challenger has arrived.

01:16:23.764 --> 01:16:24.885
[SPEAKER_17]: A new challenger has arrived.

01:16:24.985 --> 01:16:26.866
[SPEAKER_17]: Who is our new person?

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:27.667
[SPEAKER_17]: Never been on the show before.

01:16:28.687 --> 01:16:29.408
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Melly Welly.

01:16:29.848 --> 01:16:30.328
[SPEAKER_17]: Melly Welly.

01:16:30.589 --> 01:16:31.109
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

01:16:31.349 --> 01:16:31.889
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Melly Welly.

01:16:31.909 --> 01:16:32.250
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:33.731
[SPEAKER_11]: I am good.

01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:34.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:34.911
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not loud enough.

01:16:35.192 --> 01:16:35.572
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all right.

01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:36.793
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a little getting used to.

01:16:36.813 --> 01:16:39.655
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to practically scream into the microphone to be heard around here, but that's all right.

01:16:40.535 --> 01:16:42.697
[SPEAKER_17]: Quickly, Melly Welly, what kind of video games do you enjoy?

01:16:44.155 --> 01:16:49.797
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually enjoy Flash games, like the reason that it took me a while to get here is because I was playing the new GemCraft prequel.

01:16:50.758 --> 01:16:51.638
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what's GemCraft?

01:16:51.678 --> 01:16:52.238
[SPEAKER_17]: I've not heard of this.

01:16:52.418 --> 01:16:57.360
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a tower defense game, but you use gems in the towers, and it's actually really nerdy, but it's a lot of fun.

01:16:58.154 --> 01:17:00.316
[SPEAKER_17]: Those Tower of Defense games are pretty crazy awesome, though.

01:17:00.496 --> 01:17:02.257
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a big Final Fantasy one right now that's new.

01:17:02.737 --> 01:17:03.578
[SPEAKER_17]: So, there you go.

01:17:04.218 --> 01:17:04.679
[SPEAKER_17]: Very cool.

01:17:04.759 --> 01:17:08.602
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you played... What is that?

01:17:09.182 --> 01:17:10.083
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't Shit Your Pants?

01:17:10.323 --> 01:17:13.365
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my favorite Flash game as of late.

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.546
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one I like.

01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:17.708
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I heard you guys talking about it a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had a chance to play it.

01:17:18.909 --> 01:17:20.329
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the one I reckon it is.

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that why you're not wearing any right now?

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.531
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there's a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants.

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.491
[SPEAKER_17]: What's this, Rice Princess?

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:29.311
[SPEAKER_17]: You play this every day?

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:36.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I play the Don't Shit My Pants game every day because I successfully don't shit my pants every day.

01:17:37.633 --> 01:17:40.314
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking about the Flash game, Rice Princess, not real life.

01:17:41.754 --> 01:17:41.874
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

01:17:43.975 --> 01:17:44.335
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

01:17:44.395 --> 01:17:44.655
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:49.119
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyhow, alright, so yeah, that's a great Flash game, I recommend that.

01:17:49.139 --> 01:18:01.654
[SPEAKER_17]: And then of course we talked about Part A, you probably missed it because you were on your way over here, but we were actually talking about some of the old school Sierra games, like the very first Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry are now Flash games available on the internet that you can play somewhere.

01:18:02.235 --> 01:18:03.536
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to find Leisure Suit Larry.

01:18:04.117 --> 01:18:06.460
[SPEAKER_17]: They have that, Leisure Suit Larry 1 is playable, so check that out.

01:18:07.714 --> 01:18:08.294
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, anyhow.

01:18:09.615 --> 01:18:11.896
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, the chat room is always joining us every week.

01:18:11.936 --> 01:18:13.537
[SPEAKER_17]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:14.678
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan Shadow in chat.

01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:18.100
[SPEAKER_17]: I just barely beat the first level of the FF Tower defense game.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.601
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that game's kind of hard, actually.

01:18:21.902 --> 01:18:22.362
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

01:18:22.722 --> 01:18:26.484
[SPEAKER_17]: I Like Old People asks, is Rob actually not wearing any pants?

01:18:26.504 --> 01:18:27.125
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the name.

01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:29.611
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are you laughing?

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:30.971
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's true.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:32.632
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is not wearing any pants.

01:18:32.672 --> 01:18:34.013
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I am too wearing pants.

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:36.694
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you see, because he just got some new Hello Kitty undies.

01:18:37.155 --> 01:18:38.295
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got to show them off.

01:18:38.835 --> 01:18:39.296
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut up.

01:18:40.356 --> 01:18:41.637
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is dancing in his panties.

01:18:43.818 --> 01:18:44.679
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut up, all of you.

01:18:45.739 --> 01:18:46.480
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good chat name.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:46.940
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that name.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:47.500
[SPEAKER_17]: I like old people.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.981
[SPEAKER_12]: We still have to get Rob some manties.

01:18:49.628 --> 01:18:50.309
[SPEAKER_17]: I like old people too.

01:18:50.349 --> 01:18:51.530
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I was very saddened by the way.

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:52.651
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to mention at some point today.

01:18:53.051 --> 01:18:54.513
[SPEAKER_17]: Very saddened to hear about Bea Arthur.

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:58.156
[SPEAKER_17]: That's, I mean, really, like really ruined my day yesterday.

01:18:58.496 --> 01:19:01.839
[SPEAKER_17]: I was having a great day and then I heard, I did a charity walk yesterday morning.

01:19:01.879 --> 01:19:02.160
[SPEAKER_17]: It was great.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.982
[SPEAKER_12]: I was slightly amused that she was mentioned on the Deadpool Bugle.

01:19:06.123 --> 01:19:08.486
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Deadpool is obsessed with Bea Arthur.

01:19:08.546 --> 01:19:09.166
[SPEAKER_17]: Too soon.

01:19:09.587 --> 01:19:10.087
[SPEAKER_17]: Too soon.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.448
[SPEAKER_12]: She's 86.

01:19:11.929 --> 01:19:13.390
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, but she just died.

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:14.271
[SPEAKER_17]: Show a little respect.

01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:15.092
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:19:17.054 --> 01:19:18.575
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, I'll tell you what's funny though.

01:19:18.775 --> 01:19:18.955
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:20.976
[SPEAKER_12]: You miss because you miss class.

01:19:23.238 --> 01:19:25.299
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, she's in my typography class with me.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:31.202
[SPEAKER_13]: We were doing brainstorming about doing our play on words thing project that we have coming up.

01:19:31.922 --> 01:19:34.864
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the words that came up just by accident was mod.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.265
[SPEAKER_13]: And we started talking about the TV show just a little bit.

01:19:37.285 --> 01:19:38.366
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the next day, dead.

01:19:39.086 --> 01:19:39.587
[SPEAKER_17]: OMG, dead.

01:19:39.627 --> 01:19:41.748
[SPEAKER_13]: That happened with Ricardo Montalban.

01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:54.013
[SPEAKER_13]: We were listening to Montalban, which is our cage match winning song, the night before and watching the Rich Corinthian leather commercial, and then he died the next day.

01:19:55.114 --> 01:19:56.154
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, that looks like a penis.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:19:58.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:19:58.454 --> 01:20:01.695
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what they're listening to is that secretly DarkSakura is the Grim Reaper.

01:20:03.095 --> 01:20:03.776
[SPEAKER_15]: It could very well be.

01:20:05.356 --> 01:20:06.276
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you the Grim Reaper?

01:20:07.116 --> 01:20:07.877
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to find out?

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.661
[SPEAKER_12]: I will reap you with my grim reaping equipment.

01:20:14.762 --> 01:20:22.506
[SPEAKER_17]: I was trying to find the intro to Mod on YouTube somewhere so I could actually play it, but the best thing I could find was I found this here.

01:20:23.286 --> 01:20:24.287
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I found something different.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:30.290
[SPEAKER_17]: The Family Guy one is on there, but I found Rosie O'Donnell singing it.

01:20:40.024 --> 01:20:40.724
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what, though.

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:43.347
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's your Bea Arthur trivia for the night.

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:43.887
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God.

01:20:44.267 --> 01:20:47.190
[SPEAKER_13]: The show Mod was a spinoff of All in the Family.

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.231
[SPEAKER_13]: All in the Family, yes it was.

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.733
[SPEAKER_13]: The show Good Times was a spinoff of Mod.

01:20:52.154 --> 01:20:52.795
[SPEAKER_13]: There's your trivia.

01:20:52.815 --> 01:20:52.955
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:53.916
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:55.097
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you know.

01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:57.059
[SPEAKER_13]: And knowing is half the battle.

01:20:57.199 --> 01:20:59.241
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I know that, what was the show with Urkel?

01:20:59.361 --> 01:21:01.603
[SPEAKER_17]: Family Matters was a spinoff of Perfect Strangers.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:01.823
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

01:21:04.115 --> 01:21:30.065
[SPEAKER_17]: No, the mother God damn it, I will go throw down on this The mother of Family Matters was the elevator person on Perfect Strangers Yeah, and then the Full House baby was on the other show, so shut up You shut up, maybe they were all related Alright, anyway Hi, we actually talk about video games, not just ABC Friday Night Lineup Hey, we're not talking about food That's right, and But Rob, it's Friday night And the mood is right Shut up, I hate you

01:21:31.348 --> 01:21:41.835
[SPEAKER_13]: Gonna have some fun, show you how it's done, TGIF Okay, what the fuck, Alpha Cananogram Why don't I have a Jamaican accent?

01:21:41.875 --> 01:21:43.476
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you ask this weird question?

01:21:43.496 --> 01:21:58.045
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I want to point this out, though But this Cleo is not the Reaper I have something very important I need to point out, though It is not actually TGIF without...

01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:16.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, sing along if you know it.

01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:19.136
[SPEAKER_07]: I only know the chorus.

01:22:19.176 --> 01:22:19.776
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to fast forward.

01:22:19.796 --> 01:22:21.037
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know this part.

01:22:21.057 --> 01:22:22.618
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I want everyone at home to sing it.

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.359
[SPEAKER_17]: Step by Step was amazing.

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers.

01:22:27.921 --> 01:22:30.483
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Suzanne Somers, the makers of the Somersize Diet.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.571
[SPEAKER_04]: They did tell the baby what lesbians were.

01:22:33.611 --> 01:22:34.112
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

01:22:42.911 --> 01:22:47.713
[SPEAKER_06]: So the writers had to put in less... Oddly enough, that's two minutes longer than my interest in the show.

01:22:48.973 --> 01:22:53.115
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Loki, how about you save us... Loki, video games!

01:22:53.255 --> 01:22:56.296
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get sick of TV and we turn on a video game.

01:22:56.656 --> 01:22:58.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, goddamn, save the show, please.

01:22:58.777 --> 01:23:04.139
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be called the complete opposite of Step by Step, there was a new Fallout game announced.

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:14.623
[SPEAKER_06]: This one will be taking place in New Vegas, or I guess post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, which we can only expect to be awesome.

01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:19.785
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's apparently not a sequel to Fallout 3, but it's just another game in the Fallout universe.

01:23:21.645 --> 01:23:23.066
[SPEAKER_04]: In this one, do you start out as a fetus?

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:25.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

01:23:26.227 --> 01:23:29.748
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's actually going to go through the whole chain of evolution.

01:23:30.969 --> 01:23:32.129
[SPEAKER_13]: You start off as an amoeba.

01:23:32.249 --> 01:23:33.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's half Spore, half Fallout.

01:23:36.676 --> 01:23:38.517
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you have to make your way to the grandstand.

01:23:40.257 --> 01:23:42.618
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I mean... Doctor, we can't hear you if you're not saying it in a mic.

01:23:42.859 --> 01:23:44.859
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just because Melanie was shaking her head.

01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:49.821
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, but you started as a baby, which I thought was dumb.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:53.483
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people like the intro to Fallout, that you're a baby.

01:23:54.223 --> 01:23:56.224
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you can press a button to make a baby noise over and over.

01:23:57.184 --> 01:23:58.845
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if you can press a button to shit.

01:23:59.805 --> 01:24:00.105
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut up.

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:05.027
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record, this is the shit show, not the fuck show.

01:24:05.328 --> 01:24:05.848
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, look...

01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:08.250
[SPEAKER_17]: What was I saying?

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:10.071
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember what I was saying because I'm drinking wine.

01:24:11.072 --> 01:24:12.072
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, a new Fallout game.

01:24:12.453 --> 01:24:13.013
[SPEAKER_17]: Obvious.

01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:14.734
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, hello, obvious.

01:24:14.814 --> 01:24:15.894
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course this is going to make me fall in love.

01:24:15.914 --> 01:24:17.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Sequel to successive selling game?

01:24:17.435 --> 01:24:17.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:24:17.916 --> 01:24:21.417
[SPEAKER_17]: There may be a Final Fantasy XIV coming out someday.

01:24:21.698 --> 01:24:23.699
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, how about a new Mario game on the Wii?

01:24:23.719 --> 01:24:25.400
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, maybe a new Zelda game in the works?

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.840
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they're all happening.

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.242
[SPEAKER_17]: Metroid Prime 4, you betcha.

01:24:30.883 --> 01:24:34.705
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to do Metroid Primal where Samus is a catwoman.

01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:43.587
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to be an interesting show because I haven't eaten much today, so only like a little bit of wine that I'm drinking so far is kind of having an effect.

01:24:44.067 --> 01:24:44.748
[SPEAKER_17]: I want cake.

01:24:45.128 --> 01:24:46.650
[SPEAKER_13]: The cake was not a lie.

01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:51.034
[SPEAKER_17]: It was made... Doctor, you keep asking me to take my pants off.

01:24:51.074 --> 01:24:51.634
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to do it.

01:24:51.794 --> 01:24:52.335
[SPEAKER_17]: Just you wait.

01:24:52.395 --> 01:24:56.318
[SPEAKER_13]: No, for the love of God and all that is holy, keep your pants on.

01:24:57.159 --> 01:25:00.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Which in Jamie speak means, please take your pants off right now.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:04.497
[SPEAKER_13]: Take off your pants and have them on your head.

01:25:04.998 --> 01:25:13.268
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone on the entirety of the internet should be thankful that A, this is a radio show, and B, that Justin TV only shows video of our games now.

01:25:13.288 --> 01:25:14.089
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't you glad you came tonight?

01:25:14.129 --> 01:25:15.591
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on slideshow mode tonight anyway.

01:25:17.133 --> 01:25:17.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.

01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:18.114
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyhow.

01:25:19.576 --> 01:25:20.236
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Microsoft.

01:25:20.256 --> 01:25:20.957
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Microsoft.

01:25:21.826 --> 01:25:26.350
[SPEAKER_17]: Microsoft, with their pants on, had a press conference in Japan this week.

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:29.572
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were saying, hey Japan, we didn't forget about you.

01:25:29.592 --> 01:25:33.876
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, we've got 31 games that are on their way for the Xbox 360 out here.

01:25:34.276 --> 01:25:36.678
[SPEAKER_17]: Including some big games that you guys are excited about.

01:25:36.738 --> 01:25:38.259
[SPEAKER_17]: Magna Carta 2 in August.

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.462
[SPEAKER_17]: End of Eternity, which is a new RPG from Tri-Ace.

01:25:42.282 --> 01:25:46.446
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Mass Effect is going to be making its way to Japan on May 21st.

01:25:46.626 --> 01:25:50.409
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that's a long time since our release of it, but they've translated it apparently for Japan.

01:25:51.029 --> 01:26:01.413
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Virtual On, Mega Man 9 for Japan in June, Space Invaders Extreme, King of Fighters 2002, just lots and lots of new games coming out in Japan.

01:26:02.053 --> 01:26:06.915
[SPEAKER_06]: They also added Pachinko to Mass Effect, which is pretty cool, because every game needs Pachinko.

01:26:08.055 --> 01:26:09.496
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a complete lie, but that's alright.

01:26:09.516 --> 01:26:10.516
[SPEAKER_17]: A little Pachinko minigame.

01:26:10.596 --> 01:26:11.976
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought that was the Wii that had that.

01:26:12.437 --> 01:26:13.117
[SPEAKER_17]: Pachinko minigames.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:14.040
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:15.482
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so there you go.

01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:17.144
[SPEAKER_17]: 31 new games coming to Japan.

01:26:17.724 --> 01:26:20.767
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that, 31 more Xboxes sold in Japan.

01:26:20.867 --> 01:26:22.950
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:22.950
31?

01:26:24.311 --> 01:26:25.012
[SPEAKER_13]: In a row?

01:26:25.312 --> 01:26:26.193
[SPEAKER_17]: 31 flavors and then some.

01:26:28.335 --> 01:26:28.615
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:26:28.936 --> 01:26:29.677
[SPEAKER_17]: More news, please.

01:26:30.339 --> 01:26:31.679
[SPEAKER_13]: How about GTA 4?

01:26:31.759 --> 01:26:32.340
[SPEAKER_17]: How about it?

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.861
[SPEAKER_13]: It's... I mean, it's getting... It stinks!

01:26:39.902 --> 01:26:41.082
[SPEAKER_13]: The peasants are revolting.

01:26:41.142 --> 01:26:42.202
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they stink on ice.

01:26:42.702 --> 01:26:43.963
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

01:26:44.283 --> 01:26:47.924
[SPEAKER_13]: GTA 4 is getting an Xbox 360 Elite bundle.

01:26:47.944 --> 01:26:48.864
[SPEAKER_13]: Get that off my foot.

01:26:49.164 --> 01:26:49.564
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:50.785
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where it landed.

01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:51.905
[SPEAKER_13]: New cup!

01:26:52.005 --> 01:26:52.485
[SPEAKER_13]: Move down!

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:53.365
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

01:26:54.006 --> 01:26:55.266
[SPEAKER_13]: And no, we didn't go with the teacups, Rob.

01:26:55.745 --> 01:26:57.185
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I mention Jamie's been drinking too?

01:26:57.245 --> 01:27:00.266
[SPEAKER_17]: So if this show gets really, really random, I apologize in advance.

01:27:00.686 --> 01:27:02.987
[SPEAKER_13]: The alcohol's going to be burned off in about five seconds.

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:04.387
[SPEAKER_17]: True, this is wine.

01:27:05.968 --> 01:27:20.571
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, there is going to be later this year a Grand Theft Auto 4 bundle that is going to be for $399.

01:27:20.611 --> 01:27:24.112
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have no idea what it's going to look like.

01:27:25.399 --> 01:27:31.402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically just like how there's a new bundle that's been announced this week that's coming out.

01:27:31.962 --> 01:27:37.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's mocked up, but with Fallout 3, Fable 2, and Halo 3 that's going to be coming out.

01:27:38.005 --> 01:27:39.946
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be doing this kind of every few weeks.

01:27:40.366 --> 01:27:47.829
[SPEAKER_06]: This one, they're speculating, is going to come out maybe around the time of the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 sometime in the fall.

01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:49.430
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually what I was going to be saying.

01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:51.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you stopped talking, so I didn't know.

01:27:52.451 --> 01:27:53.051
[SPEAKER_13]: My turn.

01:27:53.972 --> 01:27:54.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Go.

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.610
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.

01:27:56.131 --> 01:27:56.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:27:58.092 --> 01:27:58.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me finish!

01:27:58.633 --> 01:27:59.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me finish!

01:27:59.453 --> 01:27:59.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you finished?

01:28:00.194 --> 01:28:00.654
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm finished.

01:28:02.676 --> 01:28:03.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:28:03.537 --> 01:28:08.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something else that's coming out, and this can't be good in any way because it's Driver.

01:28:09.421 --> 01:28:11.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft has trademarked a new Driver game.

01:28:13.024 --> 01:28:13.164
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:23.278
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm just... I guess it can't get worse than it is already, but apparently Driver 5, they recruit.

01:28:24.358 --> 01:28:31.459
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um... Assuming that it's coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, we are recruiting you to play our shit game.

01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:34.880
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's not as bad as all the other Driver games.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:35.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the first one.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.040
[SPEAKER_06]: The first game was awesome.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Second one was okay.

01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:42.842
[SPEAKER_06]: Third just went down into the pooper, and then the rest just sucked from there on out.

01:28:44.542 --> 01:28:44.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

01:28:47.042 --> 01:28:50.603
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I kind of want to play it because I liked how crappy they were.

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:58.426
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, you liked how crappy the Driver games were, right?

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:03.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I actually thought about picking up Driver 3 again just to play because it's that bad.

01:29:03.107 --> 01:29:04.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to relive how crappy it is?

01:29:05.848 --> 01:29:06.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:07.529
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to remind myself.

01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:09.289
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:10.710
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds good.

01:29:12.789 --> 01:29:18.011
[SPEAKER_17]: Lego Rock Band, we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago that it was rumored, but fuck, we all knew it was true.

01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:21.693
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was finally officially announced, Lego Rock Band is happening.

01:29:22.834 --> 01:29:24.834
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happening holiday of this year, as it was announced.

01:29:25.855 --> 01:29:32.858
[SPEAKER_17]: Lego Rock Band is going to be coming on the PlayStation 3, the 360, the Wii, and the DS, and there's screenshots to prove it, and yes, it's Lego people in a rock band.

01:29:32.998 --> 01:29:33.758
[SPEAKER_06]: Mid-November.

01:29:35.719 --> 01:29:39.341
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, some of the songs that will be included in the game, Song 2 by Blur,

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:46.836
[SPEAKER_17]: Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting, Europe with The Final Countdown, Good Charlotte with Boys and Girls, and Pink with So What.

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:51.837
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are kind of like, I guess they're saying more kid-friendly songs, although I don't know.

01:29:53.177 --> 01:29:55.498
[SPEAKER_17]: Pink isn't the most kid-friendly artist in the world.

01:29:55.518 --> 01:29:57.279
[SPEAKER_17]: She has some pretty nasty songs, you know what I mean?

01:29:57.499 --> 01:29:59.099
[SPEAKER_17]: You and Your Hand, hello, have you ever heard that song?

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:05.221
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you like Blur, but we don't know yet if you're going to be able to import these songs into the other games.

01:30:05.301 --> 01:30:05.881
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.262
[SPEAKER_17]: If they're trying to keep a kid safe, they're probably going to keep the game segregated, don't you think?

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also being published by Warner Brothers, Warner Games, and not EA.

01:30:16.383 --> 01:30:18.625
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's another problem with that, too.

01:30:18.665 --> 01:30:25.349
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would hope that you'd be able to import them because, you know, I would like a little bit of Kung Fu Fighting or Final Countdown in Rock Band 2.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.290
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:28.731
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it doesn't sound bad.

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:30.592
[SPEAKER_06]: If the song list is good, I'd pick it up.

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:39.412
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, by the way, in this game as well, apparently you're going to be able to collect pieces in the regular mode where you build cooler vehicles and go to new venues by building the pieces.

01:30:40.012 --> 01:30:43.352
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an extra easy setting for children, I'm assuming.

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.973
[SPEAKER_17]: And apparently there will now be challenges in this game.

01:30:45.993 --> 01:30:53.274
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll be able to destroy a giant robot, summon a storm, and demolish a skyscraper all with your drums and guitar and vocals.

01:30:54.355 --> 01:30:54.675
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.

01:30:55.255 --> 01:30:57.515
[SPEAKER_13]: It means you battle with the power of rocking out?

01:30:57.995 --> 01:31:00.956
[SPEAKER_17]: Still no word, however, on whether or not

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:06.705
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to be able to do the whole exporting of the songs and all that.

01:31:08.086 --> 01:31:08.546
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

01:31:10.066 --> 01:31:10.327
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.447
[SPEAKER_13]: I could save the world through the power of my walking out.

01:31:12.628 --> 01:31:13.068
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you now?

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:14.568
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

01:31:15.329 --> 01:31:15.889
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to see?

01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:17.799
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's okay.

01:31:17.879 --> 01:31:20.281
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I can't show anyone because then I'd have to kill you all.

01:31:21.962 --> 01:31:23.142
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this makes me happy.

01:31:23.182 --> 01:31:26.284
[SPEAKER_13]: This makes my insides quiver with delight.

01:31:28.546 --> 01:31:29.446
[SPEAKER_13]: What am I... Ew.

01:31:31.347 --> 01:31:32.988
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking about my liver.

01:31:34.569 --> 01:31:35.590
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking about my liver.

01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:36.410
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I just verped.

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:37.651
[SPEAKER_13]: You made my liver quiver.

01:31:37.991 --> 01:31:40.753
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Justin TV's complaining it's boring because there's no games going on.

01:31:40.773 --> 01:31:41.933
[SPEAKER_17]: Play something.

01:31:41.953 --> 01:31:42.934
[SPEAKER_17]: Is anyone going to play a video game?

01:31:46.311 --> 01:31:47.812
[SPEAKER_17]: Play a goddamn game, Rice Princess.

01:31:49.533 --> 01:31:51.294
[SPEAKER_17]: Play something easy that'll keep them entertained.

01:31:54.657 --> 01:31:56.978
[SPEAKER_17]: I can try to play a game, but I'm doing the show.

01:31:56.998 --> 01:31:58.959
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm drunk, too, so I don't know if... No, I'm not drunk.

01:31:58.999 --> 01:32:00.140
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a little buzzed.

01:32:01.521 --> 01:32:04.283
[SPEAKER_17]: Just play... Don't play Rob's Wiener.

01:32:04.383 --> 01:32:04.923
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't do that.

01:32:05.263 --> 01:32:05.864
[SPEAKER_13]: Hug what?

01:32:06.004 --> 01:32:06.764
[SPEAKER_13]: In lap?

01:32:06.865 --> 01:32:07.445
[SPEAKER_13]: Phone what?

01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.870
[SPEAKER_13]: We're translating.

01:32:10.531 --> 01:32:11.531
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, game.

01:32:12.492 --> 01:32:13.852
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox Live Arcade.

01:32:14.853 --> 01:32:20.396
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, SNK people are doing drugs and they're doing happy drugs that make me happy and want to do drugs.

01:32:20.756 --> 01:32:21.456
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wrong way.

01:32:21.896 --> 01:32:29.980
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, a game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade which is called King of Fighters Sky Stage.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:30.200
[SPEAKER_13]: Aww.

01:32:35.427 --> 01:32:37.569
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm being raped during the show, I want to point out.

01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:38.431
[SPEAKER_13]: Shoulder rape.

01:32:38.611 --> 01:32:39.973
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just raped live on air.

01:32:41.695 --> 01:32:42.917
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you took your pants off.

01:32:42.997 --> 01:32:44.139
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not take my pants off.

01:32:44.359 --> 01:32:44.900
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.342
[SPEAKER_13]: How many of us are not wearing socks and shoes?

01:32:47.623 --> 01:32:48.585
[SPEAKER_17]: Myself, you, and Loki.

01:32:49.392 --> 01:32:52.534
[SPEAKER_13]: Mississippi or G Shut up and read your story.

01:32:54.195 --> 01:33:05.081
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, the game is coming out called King of Fighters Sky Stage which is your King of Fighters characters flying around and shooting stuff out of their hands.

01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:08.763
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

01:33:27.984 --> 01:33:29.444
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we going to see Mai's tits or not?

01:33:29.504 --> 01:33:31.665
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the big question we want to know about this game.

01:33:31.685 --> 01:33:36.726
[SPEAKER_13]: The only characters that I'm seeing in the screenshots here are Kyo and Athena.

01:33:37.827 --> 01:33:42.208
[SPEAKER_13]: And Athena's shooting, it looks like eggs out of her head.

01:33:43.108 --> 01:33:45.029
[SPEAKER_13]: Like pink and white eggs.

01:33:46.169 --> 01:33:46.569
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

01:33:47.409 --> 01:33:49.310
[SPEAKER_13]: She's shooting dip and dots at people.

01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:51.491
[SPEAKER_13]: Kyo is shooting fire.

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.632
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we all know, fire makes everything better.

01:33:59.825 --> 01:34:02.387
[SPEAKER_17]: Out of all the games she could play, she's playing Rygar?

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:03.248
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

01:34:03.988 --> 01:34:04.329
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

01:34:04.929 --> 01:34:10.433
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that was the cool Rygar was the arcade one.

01:34:10.493 --> 01:34:15.277
[SPEAKER_17]: This one's the... Yeah, you need to be playing Karnav.

01:34:15.377 --> 01:34:15.938
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:34:15.958 --> 01:34:17.379
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually really like Rygar.

01:34:17.679 --> 01:34:19.340
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop tickling me on air!

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.041
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not funny!

01:34:21.482 --> 01:34:22.062
[SPEAKER_17]: Leave me alone!

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:35.391
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, Peter, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:34:47.409 --> 01:34:51.430
[SPEAKER_17]: I swear to God, one more time and the pants are coming off.

01:34:51.591 --> 01:34:54.932
[SPEAKER_17]: Irene is not shitting her pants.

01:34:55.572 --> 01:34:57.153
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my God, I can't hear anything.

01:34:58.113 --> 01:34:59.153
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to do it right.

01:35:00.414 --> 01:35:01.734
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop tickling me.

01:35:02.354 --> 01:35:02.815
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:05.256
[SPEAKER_13]: Story.

01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:06.276
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have one?

01:35:06.673 --> 01:35:08.674
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, Loki, please save this show.

01:35:09.315 --> 01:35:21.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Muramasa Demon Blade lost its publisher earlier this week, which is not good, but at least it picked up a new one, and that new publisher would be Ignition Entertainment.

01:35:21.963 --> 01:35:28.428
[SPEAKER_06]: However, because the publisher changed, the game will now be coming out in September instead of June.

01:35:29.721 --> 01:35:30.982
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, at least it's still coming out.

01:35:31.162 --> 01:35:32.582
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually kind of fun.

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:34.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Just I wish I knew what was going on.

01:35:35.283 --> 01:35:36.544
[SPEAKER_06]: So English might help with that.

01:35:38.625 --> 01:35:39.425
[SPEAKER_06]: English is useful.

01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:40.685
[SPEAKER_17]: It is useful.

01:35:43.367 --> 01:35:45.247
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this the same game you had here a couple weeks ago?

01:35:45.487 --> 01:35:45.707
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

01:35:47.568 --> 01:35:50.449
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought it was coming out next week or something.

01:35:50.469 --> 01:35:51.690
[SPEAKER_17]: It had to get pushed back because of that?

01:35:52.190 --> 01:35:53.411
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't coming out next week.

01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.591
[SPEAKER_06]: It was coming out in June, originally.

01:35:55.852 --> 01:35:56.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.883
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah, so it came out in Japan already alright

01:36:03.443 --> 01:36:05.844
[SPEAKER_17]: A game that has not come out yet is Street Fighter 4.

01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:11.648
[SPEAKER_17]: On the PC, not at the consoles obviously, but Street Fighter 4 has not made its way to the PC just yet.

01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:15.010
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently there is a PC version in the works, you've probably heard about it before.

01:36:16.191 --> 01:36:19.453
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently the game is actually going to be bundled with fighting sticks, maybe.

01:36:19.493 --> 01:36:22.235
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't said one way or the other if it will for sure or not yet.

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:31.041
[SPEAKER_17]: However, it has been announced on the official Japanese Street Fighter 4 blog that they will be announcing the PC version's release date on May 1st.

01:36:32.162 --> 01:36:36.586
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, I am reporting an announcement of an announcement of a game that's already out.

01:36:38.267 --> 01:36:38.908
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, really.

01:36:39.748 --> 01:36:40.069
[SPEAKER_17]: Really.

01:36:40.349 --> 01:36:43.612
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm blinking audibly, but the mic can't pick it up, so.

01:36:44.192 --> 01:36:49.116
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, but is it really worth this much hype for the PC version of a game that's already out?

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:49.877
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:36:50.257 --> 01:36:51.598
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand there's some PC gamers.

01:36:51.738 --> 01:36:53.120
[SPEAKER_17]: Street Fighter IV is a great game.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.281
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an audience of people very happy about this.

01:36:55.582 --> 01:36:58.244
[SPEAKER_17]: But really, we need a release date for a release date.

01:36:59.701 --> 01:37:00.202
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.

01:37:00.783 --> 01:37:02.085
[SPEAKER_17]: Get off your high horse, Capcom.

01:37:02.105 --> 01:37:02.906
[SPEAKER_17]: Just tell us the date.

01:37:03.487 --> 01:37:04.228
[SPEAKER_17]: Just tell us the date.

01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:06.030
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop making people wait.

01:37:09.876 --> 01:37:15.665
[SPEAKER_17]: Articles like this make me angry, and when I get angry, naughty music plays, and it brings on a segment called The F'ers of the Week.

01:37:31.496 --> 01:37:36.698
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to point out, Leo Shen in the chat makes a good point, if Street Fighter 4 is out on the PC, nude mods.

01:37:37.598 --> 01:37:38.318
[SPEAKER_17]: That might be worth it.

01:37:38.358 --> 01:37:40.139
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, DarkSakura, your FUs of the week.

01:37:41.399 --> 01:37:45.440
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, FU to being way too busy.

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.481
[SPEAKER_13]: I have way too much shit to do.

01:37:48.521 --> 01:37:48.962
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

01:37:48.982 --> 01:37:50.062
[SPEAKER_13]: Way too much shit to do.

01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:51.102
[SPEAKER_13]: All before Friday.

01:37:52.423 --> 01:37:53.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Loki.

01:37:54.368 --> 01:38:23.124
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the squirrel that is bothering my cat because the squirrel has figured out that we have bird seed on the porch and so it decided to try to dig out all the sunflower seeds that are in there and my cat can't get to it so it frustrates the hell out of her of which I put more bird seed on the porch but it's still funny but yeah since she can't give enough you because she's a cat meow meow meow meow meow meow exactly meow meow

01:38:25.879 --> 01:38:28.480
[SPEAKER_17]: My FU of the week goes to this program.

01:38:30.341 --> 01:38:32.241
[SPEAKER_17]: Melly Melly, what's your FU of the week?

01:38:32.742 --> 01:38:39.124
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the week goes to going to a celebration party, getting really stupid, and doing something really stupid.

01:38:40.305 --> 01:38:43.666
[SPEAKER_17]: That's never fun when we wake up in the morning and go, that was stupid.

01:38:46.187 --> 01:38:48.909
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess, The Doctor, do you have any FUs?

01:38:48.929 --> 01:38:49.809
[SPEAKER_17]: Come over here and say them on the mic.

01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:54.226
[SPEAKER_17]: F you, Rob, for not being pantless.

01:38:56.408 --> 01:38:57.388
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yes, Rice Princess.

01:38:58.970 --> 01:39:00.370
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to shitting in your pants.

01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:04.533
[SPEAKER_17]: That can be a day ruiner right there.

01:39:05.514 --> 01:39:05.894
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

01:39:06.555 --> 01:39:07.095
[SPEAKER_17]: Good lord.

01:39:09.093 --> 01:39:09.754
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.624
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I'll need a ton of sanitizer.

01:39:33.564 --> 01:39:34.085
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

01:39:34.285 --> 01:39:35.506
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, first email.

01:39:36.087 --> 01:39:39.550
[SPEAKER_13]: This comes from Rini.

01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:46.096
[SPEAKER_13]: This is to chime in briefly on the recent feature they should have put on the DSi that would have made Rob buy a DSi.

01:39:46.756 --> 01:39:50.518
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki commented that the music player sucks because it only supports AAC.

01:39:51.178 --> 01:39:53.460
[SPEAKER_13]: In reality, AAC is superior to MP3.

01:39:53.580 --> 01:40:00.543
[SPEAKER_13]: AAC's main strength is that it can achieve the same quality of sound that MP3 would have at higher bit rates and smaller file sizes.

01:40:00.563 --> 01:40:04.345
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole albums in MP3 will decrease in megabytes when they're converted to AAC.

01:40:05.626 --> 01:40:18.229
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's something to bitch about DSI Sound, it's that it really accepts M4A, MP4, and 3GP files because they're the container for the AAC audio.

01:40:18.689 --> 01:40:23.411
[SPEAKER_13]: For what it does, DSI Music Player is actually competent feature-wise for a basic music player.

01:40:23.871 --> 01:40:27.592
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no real playlist function, but who uses those on a portable device?

01:40:28.012 --> 01:40:28.692
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an iPhone.

01:40:29.332 --> 01:40:31.794
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

01:40:50.584 --> 01:40:51.365
[SPEAKER_13]: Link that later.

01:40:52.545 --> 01:40:57.227
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you need a GBA slot and don't want the fancy crap, get a Lite.

01:40:57.807 --> 01:40:58.647
[SPEAKER_13]: The camera is shit.

01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:00.148
[SPEAKER_13]: The browser is a last resort.

01:41:01.028 --> 01:41:09.352
[SPEAKER_13]: But the DSi shop sounds great and I want to see what developers can do with the upgraded processor, larger memory, and the camera for gamers.

01:41:11.873 --> 01:41:12.933
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also more.

01:41:12.993 --> 01:41:13.653
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a PS.

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:14.374
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

01:41:14.434 --> 01:41:15.674
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still not sold.

01:41:16.895 --> 01:41:17.635
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to see more.

01:41:18.886 --> 01:41:19.186
[SPEAKER_13]: P.S.

01:41:19.246 --> 01:41:23.029
[SPEAKER_13]: WarioWare snapped is an insult both as a game and to the series.

01:41:23.429 --> 01:41:25.791
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't spend 500 points free or bought on a game.

01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:27.111
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll only play once.

01:41:27.292 --> 01:41:27.652
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't.

01:41:28.432 --> 01:41:28.913
[SPEAKER_13]: P.P.S.

01:41:29.093 --> 01:41:34.516
[SPEAKER_13]: Sky, when the next class update for Team Fortress 2 comes out, you're getting my invite for a free weekend.

01:41:35.097 --> 01:41:37.518
[SPEAKER_13]: Team Fortress 2 has classes attuned to your play style.

01:41:37.618 --> 01:41:38.499
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't aim for shit.

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:41.961
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe you've bought the orange box for $10 from Steam's weekend sale.

01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:43.262
[SPEAKER_13]: And today...

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:44.282
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I had.

01:41:44.403 --> 01:41:45.383
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I already have Portal.

01:41:45.503 --> 01:41:47.124
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the game I wanted most in there.

01:41:48.085 --> 01:41:49.786
[SPEAKER_17]: I suck at Team Fortress.

01:41:50.326 --> 01:41:53.147
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why you get the special classes.

01:41:54.088 --> 01:41:54.508
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

01:41:55.969 --> 01:41:57.910
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just really horrible at first-person shooters.

01:41:57.950 --> 01:42:01.592
[SPEAKER_17]: Words do not do my suckage justice, if that makes sense.

01:42:01.612 --> 01:42:03.913
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you don't want to throw up every time you play one.

01:42:04.634 --> 01:42:05.414
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be me!

01:42:06.935 --> 01:42:08.356
[SPEAKER_13]: Or even watch someone play one shoot.

01:42:09.416 --> 01:42:09.857
[SPEAKER_13]: More email.

01:42:11.177 --> 01:42:12.098
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, OLR!

01:42:13.339 --> 01:42:14.260
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, happy listener!

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.602
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I'd mention a few things.

01:42:17.142 --> 01:42:23.968
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, there was a glaring error in the email I sent you last week, specifically in regards to some of the Capcom games coming to PSN.

01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:28.592
[SPEAKER_13]: I had mistakenly said SNK vs. Capcom 2 instead of Marvel vs. Capcom.

01:42:29.213 --> 01:42:35.398
[SPEAKER_13]: To my credit, once I did catch the error, I left you a voice message, but I guess the message was overlooked accidentally.

01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:37.760
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't do the voicemails, so whatever.

01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:40.562
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to correct that bit of news...

01:42:44.008 --> 01:42:46.551
[SPEAKER_13]: for our fellow listeners' sake more than anything else.

01:42:47.412 --> 01:42:50.895
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, if you three haven't already, try picking up Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

01:42:51.056 --> 01:42:51.816
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have it.

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:55.500
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked it up a few weeks ago, partially due to Bobby Blackwolf's recommendation.

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.703
[SPEAKER_13]: In a nutshell, it's 40 games for 30 bucks.

01:42:57.743 --> 01:43:02.408
[SPEAKER_13]: You really can't get much better than that unless Sega pays us to take their games.

01:43:02.648 --> 01:43:03.048
[SPEAKER_13]: Sarcasm.

01:43:04.049 --> 01:43:09.391
[SPEAKER_13]: If I had to recommend one version over another, I'd have to pick the PS3 version.

01:43:09.491 --> 01:43:17.193
[SPEAKER_13]: Although fundamentally the same, the 360 already has many of the games within the collection on the Xbox Live Arcade, nods are most of us have at least some of them.

01:43:18.013 --> 01:43:20.114
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, at least some of them?

01:43:20.154 --> 01:43:21.514
[SPEAKER_13]: How about multiple copies of each?

01:43:23.015 --> 01:43:23.676
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:43:39.454 --> 01:43:41.936
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, typos are... I have it on PlayStation 3.

01:43:42.196 --> 01:43:42.576
[SPEAKER_17]: It's cool.

01:43:43.196 --> 01:43:47.419
[SPEAKER_13]: Only downside to either version is that neither would have online co-op.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.842
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it would have been a nice feature nonetheless.

01:43:52.262 --> 01:43:53.383
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry this email ran so long.

01:43:53.403 --> 01:43:55.505
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try to keep future ones a tad shorter.

01:43:55.805 --> 01:44:02.869
[SPEAKER_13]: This email was brought to you by your local 7-Eleven, home of the Street Date Broken Games, 20-year-old hot dogs, Slurpees, back-galley crack dealers, and hookers.

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:03.910
[SPEAKER_17]: Who is this from?

01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:05.051
[SPEAKER_13]: That's from Spazinator.

01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:05.711
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Spazinator.

01:44:07.152 --> 01:44:08.193
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I want a hooker.

01:44:10.009 --> 01:44:11.470
[SPEAKER_17]: 7-Eleven is pretty awesome, actually.

01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:13.551
[SPEAKER_13]: Slurpees are amazing.

01:44:14.291 --> 01:44:15.912
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so I can smack a bitch.

01:44:16.012 --> 01:44:17.433
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, last email.

01:44:18.453 --> 01:44:21.615
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from Jacob.

01:44:23.649 --> 01:44:24.489
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, OLR.

01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:29.552
[SPEAKER_13]: I've not been in chat or called in before, but I have been a regular podcast listener for a couple of years now.

01:44:29.992 --> 01:44:32.893
[SPEAKER_13]: The show gives me some laughs and a decent update on the gaming world.

01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:36.655
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I could game more like I used to, but life demands a great deal of time.

01:44:36.795 --> 01:44:37.856
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, fuck yes it does.

01:44:38.056 --> 01:44:38.536
[SPEAKER_17]: Preach.

01:44:39.416 --> 01:44:39.777
[SPEAKER_17]: Truth.

01:44:39.797 --> 01:44:42.838
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do try to keep up with some games that interest me.

01:44:43.238 --> 01:44:45.960
[SPEAKER_13]: Mirror's Edge was a great concept, but way too short.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.721
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sick and tired of shooters and have been playing Street Fighter IV.

01:44:50.442 --> 01:44:52.983
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead Space was made precisely for me.

01:44:55.154 --> 01:44:56.816
[SPEAKER_13]: and I fell in love with it instantly.

01:44:56.876 --> 01:45:00.901
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys think EA will let the Niche team give it a sequel?

01:45:01.362 --> 01:45:04.587
[SPEAKER_13]: I really like Gears and constantly wonder why the OLR team bashes it.

01:45:04.867 --> 01:45:06.049
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think I've bashed it.

01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.950
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't care about it.

01:45:08.027 --> 01:45:10.948
[SPEAKER_17]: Gears of War is all about the stealth and hiding in cover and I get that

01:45:35.738 --> 01:45:38.720
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're a shooting game fan, I get why that's alluring.

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.221
[SPEAKER_17]: I get the strategy involved in that.

01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:41.361
[SPEAKER_17]: I get where the game is there.

01:45:41.701 --> 01:45:44.923
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not for me because I suck at first-person shooters really bad.

01:45:45.604 --> 01:45:53.528
[SPEAKER_13]: Multiplayer on Gears 2 will be quite strategic and is beautifully gory.

01:45:54.168 --> 01:45:54.929
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautifully gory?

01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:59.171
[SPEAKER_13]: I am thinking about picking up Resident Evil 5, but I've only played the originals.

01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:00.312
[SPEAKER_13]: Originals?

01:46:02.156 --> 01:46:04.339
[SPEAKER_13]: I am really looking for an innovative game to pick up.

01:46:04.639 --> 01:46:06.622
[SPEAKER_13]: Just sick and tired of playing the same old stuff.

01:46:06.742 --> 01:46:07.583
[SPEAKER_13]: Any recommendations?

01:46:07.684 --> 01:46:07.904
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a 360.

01:46:08.244 --> 01:46:12.090
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like the game variety gets squeezed tighter and tighter.

01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:16.576
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I greatly enjoy the show and must applaud your endurance with full respect.

01:46:16.736 --> 01:46:17.537
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jacob.

01:46:18.833 --> 01:46:20.935
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to make the same recommendation I do to a lot of people with 360.

01:46:21.395 --> 01:46:21.716
[SPEAKER_17]: Rez.

01:46:22.176 --> 01:46:22.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Rez.

01:46:22.796 --> 01:46:23.117
[SPEAKER_17]: Rez.

01:46:23.757 --> 01:46:27.280
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially if you're like a, you know, kind of like a motion, a game that's always moving.

01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:31.983
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Rez is, like, you know, you want an outside-the-box type of game, I think Rez is a good start.

01:46:32.804 --> 01:46:33.484
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't already have it.

01:46:33.504 --> 01:46:34.465
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also plenty to download.

01:46:34.505 --> 01:46:37.768
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I mean, if you want to go old school, you do have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:46:38.508 --> 01:46:43.592
[SPEAKER_13]: And you've also got, I haven't played it, but I know a lot of people recommend Braid.

01:46:44.605 --> 01:46:45.285
[SPEAKER_17]: I like Braid a lot.

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.526
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely recommend Braid.

01:46:48.147 --> 01:46:54.410
[SPEAKER_17]: If he hasn't already got that, if he's been listening to the show any amount of time or following the game blogs, as he probably does, I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have that.

01:46:54.950 --> 01:47:06.115
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just to follow up, did you actually read the list of, to the earlier email, did you read the list of DSI patents?

01:47:07.196 --> 01:47:08.096
[SPEAKER_17]: Not the full list, no.

01:47:08.677 --> 01:47:10.398
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Lord, there's quite a number of these.

01:47:11.338 --> 01:47:12.799
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a trademark for 3D Picross patents.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:17.681
[SPEAKER_06]: That's already out.

01:47:18.461 --> 01:47:26.125
[SPEAKER_13]: DS Navi, DS Phone, DS Plus, DS Point, DS School, DS Speak, DS Shop, DS Shopping, DS Trainer, DS Time, DS Walk.

01:47:26.405 --> 01:47:27.866
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't mean they're making all these things.

01:47:27.926 --> 01:47:29.107
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but I just think it's funny.

01:47:29.167 --> 01:47:30.968
[SPEAKER_17]: Protecting their rights, you know what I mean?

01:47:31.328 --> 01:47:32.068
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's funny.

01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:37.131
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got to be that they have some ideas for it.

01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:41.053
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them is DSI Tsushin, which is DSI Communication.

01:47:42.454 --> 01:47:42.994
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'd be cool.

01:47:44.619 --> 01:47:49.822
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, well, if you want to send us a mail, email, sorry, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us our mail.

01:47:49.882 --> 01:47:51.343
[SPEAKER_17]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:47:51.984 --> 01:47:53.244
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope we hear from you next week.

01:47:54.125 --> 01:47:55.506
[SPEAKER_17]: But please stop sending spam.

01:47:55.626 --> 01:47:59.108
[SPEAKER_17]: Christ, we have to clean up so much spam out of that box, in my personal box.

01:47:59.548 --> 01:48:00.509
[SPEAKER_17]: I have so much spam.

01:48:00.529 --> 01:48:01.790
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's Shadowgate?

01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:02.850
[SPEAKER_17]: Spam needs to die in a fire.

01:48:02.931 --> 01:48:07.033
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Shadowgate, by the way, which is the game that's, I don't even know if Chess TV's working anymore.

01:48:07.053 --> 01:48:08.534
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of suck at Shadowgate.

01:48:08.554 --> 01:48:08.974
[SPEAKER_13]: It's working.

01:48:09.074 --> 01:48:10.635
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the game that Eddie's playing right now.

01:48:11.296 --> 01:48:11.536
[SPEAKER_17]: Good time.

01:48:11.556 --> 01:48:13.077
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have to go in the door and everything's on fire?

01:48:14.898 --> 01:48:16.299
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:48:17.039 --> 01:48:23.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's some interesting... I mean, we knew this was coming, but it's getting more official day by day.

01:48:23.284 --> 01:48:26.566
[SPEAKER_06]: The court has approved the Square Enix buyout of Eidos.

01:48:27.507 --> 01:48:31.229
[SPEAKER_06]: So, soon we'll have Square... I don't know.

01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:32.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Square Enix?

01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:36.973
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to... Too many companies to combine together.

01:48:37.013 --> 01:48:39.175
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have... Squito... We'll have SquinoDocs.

01:48:39.275 --> 01:48:39.915
[SPEAKER_13]: SquitoDocs.

01:48:41.436 --> 01:48:42.697
[SPEAKER_06]: SquinoDocs.

01:48:44.482 --> 01:48:47.283
[SPEAKER_06]: What has Eidos done for us lately?

01:48:47.303 --> 01:48:47.964
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, fuck them.

01:49:09.929 --> 01:49:10.950
[SPEAKER_17]: Square and Friends Square is a lie

01:49:34.693 --> 01:49:49.020
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, all right, I don't know if you might have to think of a name for this merger, but apparently Warner Brothers Interactive is contemplating a purchase of Midway, which, as you know, has just been hemorrhaging money, and they're in the news every week about how just, you know, in crappy shape the company is.

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.361
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll call that a clusterfuck.

01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:51.001
[SPEAKER_17]: Those poor guys.

01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:59.485
[SPEAKER_17]: Warner, by the way, lost the Eidos bid to Squeenix, so Warner apparently is now looking at possibly picking up Midway.

01:49:59.905 --> 01:50:03.107
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an anonymous source that's tipping that's leaked to all these blogs.

01:50:03.467 --> 01:50:05.388
[SPEAKER_17]: Warner is pretty confident that they will get Midway.

01:50:05.928 --> 01:50:07.868
[SPEAKER_17]: They are ready to put the money on the table.

01:50:08.628 --> 01:50:13.910
[SPEAKER_17]: Possibly the whole 30 million bucks to pick up Mortal Kombat and stuff, I guess.

01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:19.831
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what else Midway's got besides their pretty cool collections and things.

01:50:20.071 --> 01:50:21.131
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't they split with Williams?

01:50:22.212 --> 01:50:22.892
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they get.

01:50:23.452 --> 01:50:28.753
[SPEAKER_13]: They could be making instead of, well, not pinball tables because Williams abandoned us, the bastards.

01:50:29.294 --> 01:50:31.114
[SPEAKER_13]: They could be making tons of slot machines.

01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:33.612
[SPEAKER_13]: But no.

01:50:35.693 --> 01:50:38.776
[SPEAKER_17]: What if that means we'll have a Mortal Kombat vs. DC 2?

01:50:38.876 --> 01:50:39.036
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh.

01:50:40.637 --> 01:50:42.599
[SPEAKER_17]: Because doesn't Warner and DC kind of have a thingy?

01:50:42.699 --> 01:50:43.840
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Warner Brothers.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:44.561
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

01:50:45.401 --> 01:50:45.782
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

01:50:47.323 --> 01:50:47.723
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on.

01:50:48.104 --> 01:50:50.626
[SPEAKER_17]: A little more news and we're going to get to the Skype line in just a little bit.

01:50:52.507 --> 01:50:56.530
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about something that should make everyone happy?

01:50:57.451 --> 01:50:58.952
[SPEAKER_13]: Pax Details!

01:51:00.033 --> 01:51:01.935
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone said yay!

01:51:02.529 --> 01:51:02.949
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay!

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:04.270
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope I can afford it this year.

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:11.315
[SPEAKER_13]: September 4th, in Seattle, we will be having PAX, and they are going to have over 60 exhibitors.

01:51:12.035 --> 01:51:14.697
[SPEAKER_13]: That means, again, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve, Blizzard.

01:51:15.878 --> 01:51:18.499
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony isn't on the list, and who cares?

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.341
[SPEAKER_17]: They weren't there last year.

01:51:20.361 --> 01:51:21.141
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, they were there last year.

01:51:21.161 --> 01:51:21.821
[SPEAKER_13]: They were there last year.

01:51:22.062 --> 01:51:22.442
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

01:51:22.462 --> 01:51:23.963
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the first time we played LittleBigPlanet.

01:51:24.123 --> 01:51:25.824
[SPEAKER_17]: That's interesting they're not on the list yet.

01:51:27.865 --> 01:51:30.007
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, they're going to have FreezePop.

01:51:31.178 --> 01:51:35.001
[SPEAKER_13]: Jonathan Colton, which I have to do another MySpace photo.

01:51:35.061 --> 01:51:36.402
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the same shit as last year?

01:51:37.243 --> 01:51:38.304
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, some different people.

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:46.110
[SPEAKER_13]: There's MC Frontalot, of course, Anamanaguchi, who was there last year, Metroid Metal, and Paul and Storm.

01:51:47.731 --> 01:51:49.172
[SPEAKER_13]: So not everyone there is listed.

01:51:50.473 --> 01:51:52.835
[SPEAKER_17]: Like four of those bands were all there last year, which is fine.

01:51:52.935 --> 01:51:53.395
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all great.

01:51:53.416 --> 01:51:53.856
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get me wrong.

01:51:53.896 --> 01:51:54.456
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all great bands.

01:51:54.476 --> 01:51:57.759
[SPEAKER_13]: This time I'm going to go see Jonathan Colton and none of you can stop me.

01:51:58.419 --> 01:51:58.720
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.081
[SPEAKER_17]: You go on with your bad self.

01:52:01.257 --> 01:52:06.080
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm broke, so if someone wants to pay, then I'll go.

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:06.300
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:06.860
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all broke.

01:52:20.922 --> 01:52:21.702
[SPEAKER_06]: by E3.

01:52:22.943 --> 01:52:27.105
[SPEAKER_06]: I already got my confirmation and my tickets and my stuff all booked.

01:52:27.125 --> 01:52:27.765
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your ticket?

01:52:27.825 --> 01:52:28.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like flight tickets?

01:52:28.986 --> 01:52:29.846
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already got my flight.

01:52:29.887 --> 01:52:32.488
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my Disneyland shit.

01:52:32.728 --> 01:52:33.588
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready to go.

01:52:33.889 --> 01:52:34.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready to rock.

01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:38.179
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's see.

01:52:38.339 --> 01:52:42.341
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some interesting stuff going down with Gamefly.

01:52:42.942 --> 01:52:51.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they are filing suit against the United States Postal Service over breakage rates and preferential treatment.

01:52:51.866 --> 01:53:02.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamefly has tried to get the same kind of treatment but it has been denied and also they've noticed that there's quite a bit of in-transit breakage and also theft

01:53:17.506 --> 01:53:19.607
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're not too happy about that.

01:53:19.788 --> 01:53:22.309
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've actually tried to take some measures to fix that.

01:53:22.329 --> 01:53:24.250
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if the Postal Service is hiring.

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:30.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Change the color of their mailers and stuff like that, but it's still a problem.

01:53:32.536 --> 01:53:33.577
[SPEAKER_06]: What color are their mailers?

01:53:33.617 --> 01:53:35.318
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they like bright neon green and orange?

01:53:35.378 --> 01:53:37.319
[SPEAKER_17]: They used to be orange and now they're white.

01:53:37.619 --> 01:53:39.100
[SPEAKER_17]: No wonder they stick out, you know?

01:53:40.181 --> 01:53:41.862
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, probably trying to save money on the ink.

01:53:42.694 --> 01:53:46.457
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm surprised Netflix doesn't have the same problems with those very distinctive red envelopes.

01:53:46.497 --> 01:53:49.820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they do, but games are more valuable than movies.

01:53:52.062 --> 01:53:53.903
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you steal games if you worked for the Postal Service?

01:53:54.323 --> 01:53:56.305
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wanted to be fired and arrested, yeah.

01:53:56.325 --> 01:53:58.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Just curious.

01:53:58.106 --> 01:53:59.768
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't say you should.

01:54:00.088 --> 01:54:03.591
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I probably wouldn't because it's too easy to find them online.

01:54:06.004 --> 01:54:06.184
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Star

01:54:22.403 --> 01:54:23.003
[SPEAKER_17]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:54:48.082 --> 01:54:51.244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also coming out over here, also by Deep Silver in July.

01:54:51.264 --> 01:54:56.346
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be coming out in two weeks, which sucks, but now, later on.

01:54:57.626 --> 01:54:58.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:54:58.507 --> 01:54:59.607
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be curious to check this out.

01:55:00.628 --> 01:55:04.669
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to hear more about it and what the game is in it, because I didn't hear a lot about what the game is.

01:55:04.689 --> 01:55:05.710
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that you can mix stuff.

01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:07.191
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, what's the game?

01:55:08.251 --> 01:55:09.352
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I kind of want to know right now.

01:55:10.232 --> 01:55:10.852
[SPEAKER_17]: It's hard to tell.

01:55:12.273 --> 01:55:12.553
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

01:55:14.005 --> 01:55:14.345
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura

01:55:37.252 --> 01:55:41.714
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really, because I'm one of those people that I'm afraid if I had a gun in my house, I'd shoot myself with it somehow.

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:46.237
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, I'm seriously deathly afraid that if a gun is in my house, I will be killed with it.

01:55:46.317 --> 01:55:48.318
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why you need to take gun safety courses.

01:55:48.478 --> 01:55:52.160
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but that doesn't necessarily mean I will be the one killing myself with the gun.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:57.002
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to think I'm not that stupid, where I'm like, oh, gee, I need to get out my gun and dust it.

01:55:57.082 --> 01:55:58.023
[SPEAKER_17]: La la la, dust the gun.

01:55:58.223 --> 01:55:59.884
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, fuck, I just shot myself in the face.

01:55:59.904 --> 01:56:01.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, dust it with live ammo in it.

01:56:01.324 --> 01:56:02.305
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of retarded.

01:56:03.177 --> 01:56:05.921
[SPEAKER_17]: I just feel like I'm the stupid person that would do that.

01:56:06.221 --> 01:56:10.767
[SPEAKER_17]: Or I'm also paranoid if I had a gun in my house and somebody would break into my house, know where my gun is, and shoot me with it.

01:56:11.207 --> 01:56:13.270
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's probably an irrational fear.

01:56:13.751 --> 01:56:14.952
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a fear of a gun in my house.

01:56:15.373 --> 01:56:17.536
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually just trying to say that as a lead into the story.

01:56:18.877 --> 01:56:19.859
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I'm buzzed.

01:56:22.157 --> 01:56:30.424
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, a middle school kid brought in a gun and caused the school to be locked down.

01:56:30.864 --> 01:56:31.885
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what he brought it for?

01:56:32.445 --> 01:56:33.726
[SPEAKER_13]: He brought it to trade for PSP.

01:56:35.043 --> 01:56:38.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, trade for a PSP, rob for a PSP, it's all the same.

01:56:38.685 --> 01:56:45.208
[SPEAKER_13]: He swiped it out of his dad's collection, the gun was unloaded, but he did bring ammo with him, and he was going to trade it.

01:56:45.729 --> 01:56:51.172
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, his dad said a second gun was missing, and the kid's locked up in GV right now, so.

01:56:52.152 --> 01:56:52.953
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid child.

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:54.914
[SPEAKER_17]: How did he get the gun?

01:56:55.874 --> 01:56:56.575
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid father.

01:56:56.775 --> 01:56:59.776
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say, I need the parents slightly to brave me.

01:56:59.796 --> 01:57:01.157
[SPEAKER_13]: You leave this shit locked up!

01:57:02.258 --> 01:57:02.818
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, first of all.

01:57:04.673 --> 01:57:05.093
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

01:57:20.902 --> 01:57:26.567
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to say, even though I have my rant that I will not have a gun in my house, that doesn't mean somebody else can't have a gun in their house.

01:57:26.747 --> 01:57:31.331
[SPEAKER_17]: There is this thing called the Tonstitution that allows you to have a gun in your house if you want.

01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:32.471
[SPEAKER_17]: The Tonstitution?

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:34.733
[SPEAKER_17]: The Tonstitution, is that what I called it?

01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:36.114
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut up.

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:37.035
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonstitution?

01:57:37.075 --> 01:57:41.359
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, my point is, you can have a gun in your house if you want.

01:57:41.519 --> 01:57:43.761
[SPEAKER_17]: I choose to not have one in mine, and I'm allowed that choice.

01:57:45.102 --> 01:57:45.402
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

01:57:45.902 --> 01:57:47.464
[SPEAKER_17]: I still think... By the Tonstitution.

01:57:48.174 --> 01:57:54.516
[SPEAKER_13]: I, by the way, do still think that Penn & Teller said it best, that you take every woman in America, give them each a pink gun.

01:57:55.296 --> 01:57:56.556
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's pink because they said so.

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:59.857
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it doesn't matter if they keep it, give it away, whatever.

01:58:00.517 --> 01:58:02.257
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's going to know who has the gun.

01:58:03.638 --> 01:58:04.978
[SPEAKER_13]: And it'll make a safer society.

01:58:07.679 --> 01:58:09.119
[SPEAKER_17]: Make guns that match handbags.

01:58:09.159 --> 01:58:09.799
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, perfect.

01:58:10.059 --> 01:58:11.280
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I want to have a gun.

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.420
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want a gun.

01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:16.301
[SPEAKER_13]: But because you can't have a concealed weapon, I would wear it on a holster.

01:58:17.349 --> 01:58:18.089
[SPEAKER_17]: Just everywhere you go.

01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.769
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't bring it here.

01:58:21.590 --> 01:58:22.451
[SPEAKER_13]: I leave it in my car.

01:58:22.471 --> 01:58:23.571
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, you can leave it in the car.

01:58:23.591 --> 01:58:24.431
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no room in my house.

01:58:24.471 --> 01:58:25.612
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I would be afraid.

01:58:25.632 --> 01:58:26.392
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be shot with it.

01:58:26.712 --> 01:58:29.893
[SPEAKER_17]: Like during a break or something, like you'd trip and fall and the gun would go off and shoot me in the foot.

01:58:29.913 --> 01:58:34.715
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I just, I have these horrible... Hey Rob, look at me juggle these guns.

01:58:35.895 --> 01:58:36.695
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

01:58:37.396 --> 01:58:40.837
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Loki would be like, can I touch your gun, Dark Sakura?

01:58:41.177 --> 01:58:41.557
[SPEAKER_17]: Bang!

01:58:42.117 --> 01:58:42.898
[SPEAKER_13]: Shoot me in the face.

01:58:43.098 --> 01:58:46.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me throw the gun at Rob and hopefully it will go off and shoot him.

01:58:46.521 --> 01:58:51.764
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, if I had a gun, I would not just... Ooh, look at my gun!

01:58:51.784 --> 01:58:54.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this, it's loaded and everything.

01:58:54.507 --> 01:58:55.587
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to look down the barrel.

01:58:56.048 --> 01:58:58.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you put it in your mouth?

01:58:58.770 --> 01:58:59.670
[SPEAKER_13]: My gun would be pink.

01:58:59.750 --> 01:59:01.972
[SPEAKER_13]: My gun would be black and hot rod red.

01:59:03.313 --> 01:59:04.274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Kurt Cobain.

01:59:05.526 --> 01:59:05.866
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.623
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but I mean like being surrounded by water, not drinking water.

01:59:25.404 --> 01:59:27.066
[SPEAKER_17]: God, you guys are jerks.

01:59:28.608 --> 01:59:31.911
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I seriously have a fear of guns being pointed at me.

01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:34.214
[SPEAKER_17]: That's probably an irrational fear.

01:59:34.234 --> 01:59:37.578
[SPEAKER_13]: That is actually a rational fear.

01:59:38.458 --> 01:59:40.859
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's irrational.

01:59:40.939 --> 01:59:42.099
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's paranoid.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.020
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you this right now, Rob.

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:53.782
[SPEAKER_13]: If you've got someone who has a gun who knows how to use it and knows how to take care of it, you are not in any danger.

01:59:54.922 --> 01:59:57.083
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even want a chocolate gun.

01:59:59.123 --> 02:00:00.123
[SPEAKER_13]: God, you're a baby.

02:00:02.204 --> 02:00:03.904
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just now learning this?

02:00:04.024 --> 02:00:05.185
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I like saying it.

02:00:05.205 --> 02:00:06.325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring a chocolate

02:00:09.039 --> 02:00:10.500
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll shoot you with yummy.

02:00:11.922 --> 02:00:13.483
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll get shot with tastiness.

02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:15.985
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even like water guns.

02:00:17.927 --> 02:00:18.768
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not joking.

02:00:18.828 --> 02:00:21.250
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even like water guns.

02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:25.534
[SPEAKER_13]: You would have hated my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil.

02:00:26.615 --> 02:00:30.479
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the Resident Evil one and I carried around two very realistic looking Uzis.

02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:36.017
[SPEAKER_17]: SSJ100 Matt says, so wait, was Rob freaked out when Loki brought his airsofts to the studio?

02:00:36.658 --> 02:00:43.449
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob, kinda, actually, like, when he raises them up, I do get a little nervous.

02:00:43.529 --> 02:00:45.532
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I don't want to get shot in the ass.

02:00:45.612 --> 02:00:46.594
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do you think I don't go out to...

02:00:47.655 --> 02:00:49.338
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't hurt that bad.

02:00:49.358 --> 02:00:52.422
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do you think I haven't gone out to play a game with him?

02:00:52.442 --> 02:00:57.048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to come in and shoot him one of these days so he can see how not bad it is.

02:00:57.068 --> 02:00:58.810
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you do that?

02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:00.512
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shoot Rob!

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:03.396
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember kids, don't shoot Rob.

02:01:03.857 --> 02:01:04.518
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob is food.

02:01:04.798 --> 02:01:07.360
[SPEAKER_17]: Shoot me in a video game all you want because I know the difference.

02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:07.900
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.140
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.601
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, Nerf Battle.

02:01:09.621 --> 02:01:11.042
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is not Nerf Battle.

02:01:11.062 --> 02:01:12.963
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is not Nerf Battle.

02:01:12.983 --> 02:01:17.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Get Rob over the gun thing by shooting him with everything you can find.

02:01:17.846 --> 02:01:19.447
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just going to make it worse.

02:01:21.028 --> 02:01:21.728
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record.

02:01:24.630 --> 02:01:25.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, no.

02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:29.793
[SPEAKER_13]: I say I'll bring a Nerf Gatling gun and shoot Rob in the ass.

02:01:30.373 --> 02:01:31.053
[SPEAKER_06]: They have those.

02:01:31.434 --> 02:01:31.874
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

02:01:31.994 --> 02:01:32.474
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw it.

02:01:32.514 --> 02:01:33.095
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted one.

02:01:35.277 --> 02:01:36.958
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a Nerf revolver.

02:01:37.159 --> 02:01:37.899
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I have to ask.

02:01:37.919 --> 02:01:38.179
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:38.880
[SPEAKER_17]: Chat room.

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:40.802
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't read from chat in a while.

02:01:40.822 --> 02:01:42.083
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, they're all teasing me right now.

02:01:42.123 --> 02:01:49.409
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I want to know, somebody in chat has to understand what I'm saying about guns.

02:01:50.129 --> 02:01:53.292
[SPEAKER_17]: Is somebody in chat willing to admit that they have a gun fear as well?

02:01:54.363 --> 02:01:55.284
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, somebody.

02:01:55.705 --> 02:01:57.747
[SPEAKER_17]: Just make it up so I don't feel so bad.

02:01:57.808 --> 02:01:58.448
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what.

02:01:58.488 --> 02:02:03.135
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what my thing about the gun safety hysteria is.

02:02:03.655 --> 02:02:06.239
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the gun safety hysteria is bullshit.

02:02:06.599 --> 02:02:08.642
[SPEAKER_13]: Plain out bullshit.

02:02:10.004 --> 02:02:11.025
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that...

02:02:14.039 --> 02:02:26.503
[SPEAKER_13]: People, if you were in an area where it is listed in big labels that no one there is going to be able to protect themselves, we know what that says to a criminal mind, fair fucking game.

02:02:28.023 --> 02:02:34.545
[SPEAKER_13]: If you were in a place where you know that anyone could be armed, are you going to really try something unless you're phenomenally stupid?

02:02:35.806 --> 02:02:36.826
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I have to say.

02:02:37.446 --> 02:02:38.927
[SPEAKER_13]: People are phenomenally stupid.

02:02:39.967 --> 02:02:42.808
[SPEAKER_13]: And if someone breaks into my house, they deserve to get their ass shot.

02:02:43.837 --> 02:02:48.440
[SPEAKER_17]: X-Link says I have a gun fear, that is why I have a gun Digital says everyone fears guns sir

02:03:11.604 --> 02:03:14.345
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad says, I don't owe one because I'm too damn hot-headed.

02:03:14.986 --> 02:03:17.627
[SPEAKER_17]: I Like Old People says, yes, Rob, you are a pussy.

02:03:17.687 --> 02:03:19.008
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, meow, meow, meow.

02:03:19.948 --> 02:03:21.369
[SPEAKER_17]: Decipher says, I hate guns.

02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:24.451
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, one of them hates guns.

02:03:24.491 --> 02:03:27.172
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess, you've got to say this over here because we can't hear you otherwise.

02:03:30.354 --> 02:03:32.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone's afraid of guns so he has a gun?

02:03:33.891 --> 02:03:34.472
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:03:51.247 --> 02:03:51.868
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:10.561
[SPEAKER_13]: You can protect yourself.

02:04:12.102 --> 02:04:25.111
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, I know a lot of women who carry a gun because, I mean, let's face it, on a general level, physically, men, for the most part, are stronger physically, again, than a woman.

02:04:25.412 --> 02:04:29.014
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless she's a black belt and can kick him in the face.

02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:33.738
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, you have to deal, it's the great equalizer.

02:04:35.599 --> 02:04:37.700
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that as long as

02:04:42.031 --> 02:04:52.820
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as you feel that you want to have a gun, and of course live in America, get a gun.

02:04:53.001 --> 02:05:00.006
[SPEAKER_13]: But make damn sure you know how to use it, make damn sure you know how to keep it safe, and make really sure that your kids can't get to it.

02:05:00.106 --> 02:05:00.687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get a phaser.

02:05:02.796 --> 02:05:04.217
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, phasers are awesome.

02:05:04.437 --> 02:05:05.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Always set on stun.

02:05:05.938 --> 02:05:08.639
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lightsaber, but that can kill people.

02:05:08.699 --> 02:05:09.260
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just a phaser.

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:13.422
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, Actdeft, that's the Second Amendment.

02:05:14.162 --> 02:05:16.443
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, First Amendment is, yeah, you have a voice to use it.

02:05:16.483 --> 02:05:19.325
[SPEAKER_13]: Second Amendment is, goddammit, we can have guns if we fucking want them.

02:05:20.863 --> 02:05:23.144
[SPEAKER_17]: SSJ100Matt asked, what about a marshmallow gun?

02:05:24.205 --> 02:05:27.466
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft says the OLR Constitution, Second Amendment.

02:05:27.906 --> 02:05:28.767
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't shoot Rob.

02:05:28.807 --> 02:05:29.287
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, don't.

02:05:29.847 --> 02:05:30.287
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that.

02:05:30.307 --> 02:05:31.708
[SPEAKER_17]: That should actually be rule number one.

02:05:33.049 --> 02:05:33.529
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the thing.

02:05:33.609 --> 02:05:37.190
[SPEAKER_17]: Even the marshmallow gun, it depends on what speed the marshmallows are traveling at.

02:05:37.210 --> 02:05:39.091
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's very slow speed, I'm okay with that.

02:05:39.111 --> 02:05:39.852
[SPEAKER_17]: Mach 10.

02:05:40.772 --> 02:05:47.715
[SPEAKER_17]: But if they're flying really fast and could actually spank my butt a little bit if they hit me in the ass, I don't think I'd like that.

02:05:49.181 --> 02:05:50.482
[SPEAKER_17]: You can spank my butt.

02:05:50.502 --> 02:05:52.964
[SPEAKER_17]: All you want is don't do it with a fucking gun.

02:05:54.946 --> 02:05:57.287
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob does not want to get pistol whipped in the ass.

02:05:58.408 --> 02:05:59.049
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, okay.

02:05:59.469 --> 02:06:00.430
[SPEAKER_13]: We really are, though.

02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:01.190
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened to video games?

02:06:01.891 --> 02:06:02.371
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:06:02.491 --> 02:06:10.458
[SPEAKER_13]: We were talking about why the... I think it was because it was talking about why the butthead dad didn't have his guns locked up.

02:06:12.719 --> 02:06:14.061
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's get back to video games.

02:06:16.082 --> 02:06:16.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the PSP...

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:20.286
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:06:39.823 --> 02:07:02.505
[SPEAKER_06]: and also they're going to add some internet security if you happen to be a little kid you can use the trend micro security to block certain websites and also filter out other things as well including all that nasty porno because you know the PSP is a gateway to porn what if I want all that nasty porno well then don't enable the optional security oh okay

02:07:04.526 --> 02:07:27.565
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also you'll be able to do an internet search for games directly from the cross media bar as well and they've included some memory stick improvements including your ability to be able to create and access subfolders on your memory stick pro duo for music, videos, and photos which is awesome because folders make things nice and neat for all that porn that's on there.

02:07:28.739 --> 02:07:30.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this what you're using your PSP for as porn?

02:07:32.503 --> 02:07:35.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Porn and Riff Trax audio samples.

02:07:35.926 --> 02:07:36.246
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.

02:07:36.346 --> 02:07:39.089
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm so sad I missed the last little Riff Trax thing.

02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.930
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it was awesome.

02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:40.931
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you doing it again this week?

02:07:40.951 --> 02:07:42.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll come.

02:07:42.172 --> 02:07:43.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not this week, but we'll find a new one.

02:07:44.214 --> 02:07:44.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad.

02:07:45.715 --> 02:07:45.935
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:07:45.955 --> 02:07:46.416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow.

02:07:46.636 --> 02:07:50.379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Twilight is made much better with people making fun of it.

02:07:50.479 --> 02:07:51.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not yet seen Twilight.

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:52.041
[SPEAKER_06]: Lying.

02:07:52.601 --> 02:07:52.782
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

02:07:53.692 --> 02:07:57.313
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we are going to open up the Skype line.

02:07:57.353 --> 02:08:04.096
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm almost a little afraid to open it up tonight, but we are going to open it up at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:07.397
[SPEAKER_17]: And this has to do with something else that's kind of related to the PlayStation Portable.

02:08:07.417 --> 02:08:09.958
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about Skype, because you guys are going to be calling us on Skype soon.

02:08:10.258 --> 02:08:11.879
[SPEAKER_17]: But actually, it's not about the PSP.

02:08:12.339 --> 02:08:14.020
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about the DS.

02:08:16.045 --> 02:08:20.007
[SPEAKER_17]: You see, a Skype representative was recently speaking to the blog TechRadar.

02:08:20.627 --> 02:08:22.608
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost said TechRadar, but it's TechRadar.

02:08:22.969 --> 02:08:27.111
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, the technical possibility to have Skype on the DS is there.

02:08:27.551 --> 02:08:28.632
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not planned.

02:08:28.652 --> 02:08:37.096
[SPEAKER_17]: The exact comment, quote, Whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype... Oh my... Oh my god.

02:08:38.096 --> 02:08:39.757
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had butt splat.

02:08:39.897 --> 02:08:43.419
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, we just had a huge accident in studio.

02:08:43.479 --> 02:08:44.680
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck?

02:08:46.959 --> 02:08:48.640
[SPEAKER_17]: The doctor just got shot!

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:49.440
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck?

02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.322
[SPEAKER_13]: He fell on his tailbone, shoving his spine through his trachea.

02:08:53.983 --> 02:08:55.564
[SPEAKER_13]: Who brought the gun into my house?

02:08:55.924 --> 02:08:57.105
[SPEAKER_13]: All over Irene.

02:08:58.145 --> 02:09:00.607
[SPEAKER_13]: Oddly enough, his blood is rainbow colored.

02:09:00.787 --> 02:09:03.809
[SPEAKER_17]: Doctor, could you please explain what just happened to cause such chaos?

02:09:03.829 --> 02:09:07.491
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I forget where the chair was?

02:09:08.031 --> 02:09:09.552
[SPEAKER_06]: She moved the chair when he got up.

02:09:09.992 --> 02:09:15.056
[SPEAKER_17]: Did she really do that old prank where the doctor went to sit down and Rice Princess pulled the chair back?

02:09:15.276 --> 02:09:15.516
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

02:09:17.897 --> 02:09:19.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

02:09:19.598 --> 02:09:23.779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because you unplugged the controller.

02:09:28.441 --> 02:09:35.664
[SPEAKER_06]: I just... Can we just... Awesome.

02:09:36.144 --> 02:09:36.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

02:09:36.984 --> 02:09:38.024
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so done with this show.

02:09:38.044 --> 02:09:38.365
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

02:09:41.058 --> 02:09:43.339
[SPEAKER_17]: What was I going to say about... Oh yeah!

02:09:43.839 --> 02:09:49.562
[SPEAKER_17]: Quote, whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype to Nintendo's DSi, it would technically be possible.

02:09:49.622 --> 02:09:50.062
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

02:09:51.563 --> 02:09:52.223
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not going to happen.

02:09:53.604 --> 02:09:56.685
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's not going to happen because Nintendo wants to do their own proprietary thing, I bet.

02:09:57.126 --> 02:09:58.646
[SPEAKER_17]: They were already showing it... Shut up!

02:09:58.886 --> 02:10:01.548
[SPEAKER_17]: They were already showing it a couple years ago at E3.

02:10:03.308 --> 02:10:07.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means they'll never... Well, that was the whole... They have voice chat in other games.

02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:11.031
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is a tech demo, but I don't think they're going to ever do Skype.

02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:16.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you feel so terrible, why did you pull the chair away?

02:10:20.935 --> 02:10:22.976
[SPEAKER_17]: If I had a gun, I would shoot you in the foot right now.

02:10:23.036 --> 02:10:23.716
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I would do.

02:10:23.896 --> 02:10:24.376
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you're right.

02:10:24.396 --> 02:10:25.137
[SPEAKER_17]: I was scared of the gun.

02:10:26.309 --> 02:10:29.852
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be afraid that the gun would suddenly point at me while I'm trying to pull the trigger.

02:10:29.873 --> 02:10:31.774
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll shoot you in the face with a marshmallow spank ray.

02:10:36.839 --> 02:10:37.219
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:38.541
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck it.

02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:41.003
[SPEAKER_17]: We're opening the Skype line.

02:10:41.023 --> 02:10:43.686
[SPEAKER_17]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:44.066 --> 02:10:45.227
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:45.247 --> 02:10:45.708
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's this?

02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:48.931
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:49.551
[SPEAKER_17]: What's on your mind?

02:10:49.671 --> 02:10:51.053
[SPEAKER_13]: Planet Chaos, can you help us?

02:10:51.809 --> 02:10:56.475
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much, just chilling tonight, just trying to bear the stifling heat in New York City.

02:10:57.603 --> 02:10:59.905
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had a weird weather week in California as well.

02:10:59.925 --> 02:11:03.948
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like super duper hot one day and then it was rainy and cold the next and now it's hot again.

02:11:04.008 --> 02:11:04.509
[SPEAKER_17]: Go figure.

02:11:04.849 --> 02:11:05.249
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get it.

02:11:05.309 --> 02:11:07.471
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, apparently it was like 90 degrees.

02:11:07.551 --> 02:11:13.375
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, just trying to snag some other deals like the orange box for $10.

02:11:14.036 --> 02:11:15.197
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, I got that shit.

02:11:15.337 --> 02:11:16.738
[SPEAKER_17]: What an awesome deal that was.

02:11:16.758 --> 02:11:17.018
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on.

02:11:17.298 --> 02:11:19.580
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to read this comment in chat real quick because it's funny.

02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:22.803
[SPEAKER_17]: SSJ100Matt says, Irene is now jerk princess.

02:11:22.823 --> 02:11:23.063
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god.

02:11:23.303 --> 02:11:24.984
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go, yay, jerk princess.

02:11:25.284 --> 02:11:26.424
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I'm sorry, Zaku.

02:11:26.444 --> 02:11:28.766
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, Orange Box is $10.

02:11:28.846 --> 02:11:31.747
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the deal everyone's been talking about this weekend.

02:11:32.347 --> 02:11:33.708
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you pick it up?

02:11:34.488 --> 02:11:38.670
[SPEAKER_08]: I just picked it up like, what, 15, 20, like half an hour ago.

02:11:38.730 --> 02:11:42.792
[SPEAKER_08]: I have yet to download it yet, but hopefully I'll be doing that tonight or tomorrow.

02:11:42.852 --> 02:11:47.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Just waiting to see whether or not that sense of job of mine will actually extend.

02:11:48.723 --> 02:11:49.884
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you working recently.

02:11:49.984 --> 02:11:50.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you.

02:11:50.464 --> 02:11:50.885
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats.

02:11:51.085 --> 02:11:55.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, working temporarily, but, you know, working for Uncle Sam for that time being.

02:11:55.268 --> 02:12:05.437
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, besides buying Orange Box, I just indulged in DJ Max Technica location test today up in New Rochelle, not far from the Bronx.

02:12:05.957 --> 02:12:09.280
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell us a little bit about DJ Max and the arcade for those that don't know much about it.

02:12:10.296 --> 02:12:11.037
[SPEAKER_08]: on that, on that,

02:12:39.833 --> 02:12:47.635
[SPEAKER_08]: on the note right there on the screen, or you just gotta tap it a few times to the beat, follow the curse around.

02:12:48.395 --> 02:12:54.056
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a bigger, it's a larger version of Elite Beat Agents, put it that way.

02:12:54.756 --> 02:12:55.296
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

02:12:57.217 --> 02:13:00.257
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you're a big fan of the Beatmania series, Beatmania 2DX.

02:13:00.297 --> 02:13:01.658
[SPEAKER_17]: How does it compare to Beatmania for you?

02:13:02.558 --> 02:13:03.458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of different.

02:13:03.478 --> 02:13:08.599
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it compares, just more like instead of using keys, actually hard keys, you have to

02:13:09.175 --> 02:13:11.156
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more using a lot more fingers.

02:13:11.576 --> 02:13:17.740
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that you have to touch every part of the screen wherever you have to.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:23.663
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like Chewbacca, how Konami's doing it with that game.

02:13:24.384 --> 02:13:30.928
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that you have to touch the screen to hit the notes instead of having to hit a particular key on the screen.

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:37.862
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's completely foreign, and as I said, it takes a while for certain players to pick it up.

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:41.066
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I basically pissed away like six bucks on that game.

02:13:41.206 --> 02:13:46.952
[SPEAKER_08]: I had $1.50 a game, so it was as much as I could today.

02:13:46.972 --> 02:13:50.036
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta do it again, seriously.

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:53.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners before we move on to another call?

02:13:55.002 --> 02:13:57.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2, get it.

02:13:57.683 --> 02:13:59.364
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care what they say, just get it now.

02:13:59.424 --> 02:14:01.184
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better than the first one, multiplayer.

02:14:01.725 --> 02:14:03.465
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, a reigning endorsement from our listeners.

02:14:03.505 --> 02:14:04.626
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much, Saku, for the call.

02:14:05.572 --> 02:14:05.812
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:14:05.852 --> 02:14:06.532
[SPEAKER_17]: Take care, buddy.

02:14:07.232 --> 02:14:07.493
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:14:07.513 --> 02:14:09.813
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:14:09.833 --> 02:14:11.954
[SPEAKER_17]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:11.994 --> 02:14:12.974
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:12.994 --> 02:14:13.354
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's this?

02:14:14.154 --> 02:14:15.715
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:15.895 --> 02:14:19.376
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the guy that hopes Comcast is going to let him stay on the stream long enough.

02:14:19.496 --> 02:14:20.016
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, welcome.

02:14:20.036 --> 02:14:22.197
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad to see your audio is working tonight, too, Jason.

02:14:23.177 --> 02:14:24.997
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you've been a longtime listener of the show.

02:14:25.317 --> 02:14:27.098
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight's been a little crazy, hasn't it?

02:14:28.179 --> 02:14:29.500
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, no worse than I've heard before.

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:30.420
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, fair enough.

02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:31.480
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, what's on your mind?

02:14:32.461 --> 02:14:34.241
[SPEAKER_16]: Two quick things before the actual question.

02:14:34.541 --> 02:14:36.882
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys mentioned a new Dragon Ball game in the releases.

02:14:36.942 --> 02:14:41.924
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you know that Dragon Ball Z is being re-released as a series in Japan?

02:14:42.444 --> 02:14:43.124
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I did not know that.

02:14:43.265 --> 02:14:44.905
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well that makes a ton of sense.

02:14:44.985 --> 02:14:45.845
[SPEAKER_13]: It's freaking classic.

02:14:46.586 --> 02:14:46.946
[SPEAKER_16]: Well...

02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:48.941
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it being reanimated?

02:15:14.094 --> 02:15:14.855
[SPEAKER_16]: To an extent, yeah.

02:15:15.775 --> 02:15:18.876
[SPEAKER_13]: It's done like the Evangelion movies that are coming out, right?

02:15:19.877 --> 02:15:20.357
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea.

02:15:20.597 --> 02:15:25.419
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, with the Evangelion movies, they pulled a lot of original footage and then added a new animation.

02:15:26.579 --> 02:15:35.123
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about Dragon Ball Kai, but you can watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood at Funimation is broadcasting that subbed.

02:15:35.483 --> 02:15:35.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

02:15:36.003 --> 02:15:38.704
[SPEAKER_16]: Ranma is saying re-released in HD with extra footage.

02:15:39.185 --> 02:15:39.765
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want...

02:15:41.312 --> 02:15:43.853
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about Kai, but FullmetalAlchemist.com has links.

02:15:43.933 --> 02:15:46.754
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been meaning to watch it, I just haven't had the time.

02:15:47.034 --> 02:15:52.115
[SPEAKER_17]: Random-ass question, does this have anything to do with the recent Dragon Ball Z movie that came out to theaters?

02:15:52.895 --> 02:15:57.036
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so, and I sure as hell hope not, because the movie looks like an absolute travesty.

02:15:57.056 --> 02:15:58.597
[SPEAKER_16]: But then again, I never liked Dragon Ball, so...

02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:06.373
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to say I was one of the people that had fifth generation fan subs of Cell Game and everything.

02:16:08.013 --> 02:16:23.458
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say Dragon Ball Z on the Super Nintendo was the first import game I ever played because they actually had a little place around here, an independent movie store before Blockbuster and Hollywood kind of stomped everything out that used to rent import games.

02:16:23.478 --> 02:16:24.118
[SPEAKER_17]: It was kind of crazy.

02:16:24.638 --> 02:16:26.459
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I'm sorry Jason, what was your question?

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:28.900
[SPEAKER_16]: One more quick thing.

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:29.160
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:30.421
[SPEAKER_16]: WarioWare myself.

02:16:30.681 --> 02:16:31.141
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me guess.

02:16:31.381 --> 02:16:34.383
[SPEAKER_16]: You play WarioWare games with yourself using the DSi camera.

02:16:34.443 --> 02:16:37.044
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it is the exact same DSi game that we've already got over here.

02:16:37.304 --> 02:16:38.425
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm fairly certain.

02:16:39.225 --> 02:16:40.005
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know for sure.

02:16:40.926 --> 02:16:41.546
[SPEAKER_16]: The real question.

02:16:41.706 --> 02:16:42.787
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

02:16:43.007 --> 02:16:47.089
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that the only classic Sierra games I've played have been Space Quest.

02:16:47.109 --> 02:16:50.450
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen bits and pieces of King's Quest, but that's been about it.

02:16:51.011 --> 02:16:53.072
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does the name Sarian sound so familiar?

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:56.778
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's in the title, like Space Quest 1 was the Sarian encounter.

02:16:56.838 --> 02:16:58.541
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that a race or something in that series?

02:16:58.621 --> 02:17:00.264
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm assuming it's a race.

02:17:00.365 --> 02:17:01.807
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a race in the game.

02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:06.216
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure they named the website after something that you see in one of those games.

02:17:06.803 --> 02:17:07.583
[SPEAKER_16]: Space Quest The Sarian Encounter

02:17:30.177 --> 02:17:33.002
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and I think I've heard it in a few other places throughout the series.

02:17:33.423 --> 02:17:36.448
[SPEAKER_16]: And I beat Space Quest I, the VGA remake, but...

02:17:37.455 --> 02:17:38.916
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I just don't remember it.

02:17:40.177 --> 02:17:46.602
[SPEAKER_16]: I've mentioned a lot how interfaces like Home on the PS3 don't work because they're just an interface and there's nothing to do.

02:17:47.543 --> 02:17:53.908
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever they did to put the applications in Sarian.net sounds absolutely amazing.

02:17:53.988 --> 02:18:05.678
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, yeah, it's the next step up of what Xbox Live is right now with the partying and all of that kind of stuff, where even if you're not actually playing the game, you can be around and congregate and do whatever.

02:18:06.855 --> 02:18:12.139
[SPEAKER_16]: in a game interface that's, I guess, familiar, assuming you've actually played the game before.

02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:16.762
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, well, Space Quest, not so much.

02:18:16.883 --> 02:18:18.784
[SPEAKER_17]: Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, yes, tons.

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:22.587
[SPEAKER_17]: I've played every single King's Quest game.

02:18:24.468 --> 02:18:25.789
[SPEAKER_16]: and I've played every single Space Quest game.

02:18:26.350 --> 02:18:26.550
[SPEAKER_16]: Funny.

02:18:28.391 --> 02:18:30.633
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, Jason, we've got to wrap up the game.

02:18:30.993 --> 02:18:31.494
[SPEAKER_17]: Get some more calls.

02:18:31.514 --> 02:18:32.414
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any other quick thoughts?

02:18:34.796 --> 02:18:36.037
[SPEAKER_17]: You talk too fast sometimes.

02:18:36.258 --> 02:18:36.758
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

02:18:36.778 --> 02:18:41.402
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any other quick... Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners?

02:18:41.782 --> 02:18:43.583
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the second time I've been told that this week.

02:18:43.984 --> 02:18:44.925
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my nature.

02:18:45.525 --> 02:18:46.226
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is.

02:18:46.286 --> 02:18:49.068
[SPEAKER_16]: But you're clear and you're speaking, so it's not a bad thing.

02:18:49.368 --> 02:18:49.809
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

02:18:49.889 --> 02:18:51.110
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like the Micro Machines dude.

02:18:52.658 --> 02:18:52.919
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:18:53.399 --> 02:18:54.119
[SPEAKER_17]: See you later, Jason.

02:18:54.139 --> 02:18:55.160
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for the call.

02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:56.280
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye.

02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:57.161
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that his name?

02:18:57.421 --> 02:18:57.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:18:57.781 --> 02:18:57.981
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

02:18:58.201 --> 02:18:59.002
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I'm like that guy.

02:18:59.022 --> 02:19:01.023
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I should addition to be the Microchip.

02:19:01.283 --> 02:19:03.104
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I do trip up on my words sometimes when I talk really fast.

02:19:03.124 --> 02:19:04.944
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would be easier if I was actually reading from a script.

02:19:07.626 --> 02:19:08.866
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:19:08.886 --> 02:19:09.247
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's this?

02:19:12.213 --> 02:19:14.154
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:19:14.775 --> 02:19:16.916
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hey guys, what's up, this is Dan Shadow.

02:19:17.056 --> 02:19:18.717
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Dan Shadow, what is on your mind?

02:19:18.737 --> 02:19:19.878
[SPEAKER_13]: Greetings and salivations.

02:19:19.978 --> 02:19:22.519
[SPEAKER_17]: Greetings, I don't think we've had you on the show before, what's on your mind?

02:19:23.179 --> 02:19:24.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shoot, nothing much.

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:34.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you guys were just talking about the guns and all the fun stuff, and you made me think of this Penny Arcade comic that came out recently, making fun of rock band Nirvana.

02:19:36.852 --> 02:19:37.772
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw this, yes.

02:19:38.253 --> 02:19:39.013
[SPEAKER_17]: I did see that, too.

02:19:39.053 --> 02:19:39.793
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it take it down?

02:19:40.094 --> 02:19:40.734
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't find it.

02:19:41.654 --> 02:19:43.395
[SPEAKER_17]: It was posted on my friend's list.

02:19:43.455 --> 02:19:47.797
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see if I remember which friend of mine posted it, too.

02:19:48.417 --> 02:19:49.178
[SPEAKER_17]: And it wasn't that long ago.

02:19:49.198 --> 02:19:52.159
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you describe the comic for our listeners who haven't seen it?

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:58.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so the first panel, they have the rock band box, and it looks just like a rock band box that says Rock Band Havana.

02:19:59.543 --> 02:20:02.844
[SPEAKER_09]: Second panel, one guy pulls out the guitar controller.

02:20:03.565 --> 02:20:04.385
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything looks cool.

02:20:04.981 --> 02:20:09.583
[SPEAKER_09]: 3rd panel, but there's a weird little face and he pulls out this giant shotgun controller.

02:20:10.203 --> 02:20:10.984
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

02:20:11.004 --> 02:20:11.764
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, sweet.

02:20:11.784 --> 02:20:14.045
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I tried finding it again and that was wrong, yet I couldn't help but laugh how bad it was.

02:20:31.164 --> 02:20:32.165
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:20:51.178 --> 02:20:52.039
[SPEAKER_17]: Kurt Cobain's Death

02:21:16.673 --> 02:21:19.114
[SPEAKER_17]: I am very much into Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3.

02:21:19.214 --> 02:21:20.654
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm loving that game.

02:21:42.654 --> 02:21:43.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it really cool?

02:21:43.255 --> 02:21:48.917
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I played the demo, and I had a lot of fun with the demo, and I kept telling myself I was going to go get the full game, but I just never did.

02:21:48.977 --> 02:21:51.498
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's on sale now, though, so I might have to check it out.

02:21:52.979 --> 02:21:53.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, totally.

02:21:53.599 --> 02:22:03.904
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the next step in a tactics game that is much needed, because when you think of tactics games, you always think of nearly the same style from what Final Fantasy Tactics did.

02:22:04.925 --> 02:22:07.886
[SPEAKER_17]: What is this next step that makes you so sold on this game?

02:22:08.717 --> 02:22:12.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it starts off, it shows the overview map so you see all the pieces.

02:22:12.659 --> 02:22:16.380
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get to move around in nearly real time.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:19.982
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you still have your spaces or whatever movements people can make.

02:22:20.542 --> 02:22:21.782
[SPEAKER_09]: The setting is fresh almost.

02:22:21.822 --> 02:22:22.603
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very different.

02:22:22.643 --> 02:22:26.004
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have that everyone's kind of walking in place look to it.

02:22:26.124 --> 02:22:27.325
[SPEAKER_09]: The animation is pretty good.

02:22:27.465 --> 02:22:32.467
[SPEAKER_09]: And just the way it works, I mean, every unit likes other people or dislikes other people.

02:22:32.587 --> 02:22:33.547
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone has specialties.

02:22:33.587 --> 02:22:37.369
[SPEAKER_09]: So if this guy works well in desert or if he likes to hang around chicks, you get the bonuses.

02:22:38.402 --> 02:22:43.393
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's almost like a weak third person shooter but it works great in a tactical environment.

02:22:43.413 --> 02:22:44.516
[SPEAKER_09]: You could take cover, you could...

02:22:45.031 --> 02:22:46.492
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:17.872
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very fun game and it's quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites.

02:23:17.952 --> 02:23:19.053
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can't put it down.

02:23:19.453 --> 02:23:21.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Valkyria Chronicles is the game.

02:23:21.655 --> 02:23:21.835
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

02:23:22.075 --> 02:23:22.516
[SPEAKER_17]: Here you go.

02:23:24.557 --> 02:23:25.478
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it related to Valkyria?

02:23:25.498 --> 02:23:26.098
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it related to Valkyria?

02:23:26.118 --> 02:23:28.260
[SPEAKER_17]: You're thinking Valkyrie profile from Square.

02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:29.421
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this is from Sega.

02:23:29.441 --> 02:23:30.862
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a whole new thing.

02:23:31.182 --> 02:23:31.863
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega made it.

02:23:32.123 --> 02:23:33.244
[SPEAKER_09]: A whole new thing.

02:23:33.364 --> 02:23:35.805
[SPEAKER_09]: And new DLC are coming out as well.

02:23:36.126 --> 02:23:37.146
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so they're keeping it going.

02:23:37.667 --> 02:23:38.427
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

02:23:38.708 --> 02:23:39.048
[SPEAKER_17]: Very cool.

02:23:39.508 --> 02:23:41.910
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Dan, any other closing thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

02:23:43.171 --> 02:23:44.931
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just saying hi.

02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:48.632
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if you guys are around for E3, that offer's still up.

02:23:48.672 --> 02:23:50.192
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get you all into Disneyland.

02:23:51.352 --> 02:23:52.973
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's a very generous offer.

02:23:53.053 --> 02:23:55.673
[SPEAKER_17]: We might have to... I know Loki's going to Disneyland.

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:56.873
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if he already bought the tickets.

02:23:56.893 --> 02:23:58.474
[SPEAKER_17]: I already have the ticket vouchers.

02:23:58.554 --> 02:23:59.614
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, well, you know what?

02:23:59.654 --> 02:24:00.634
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I'll take him up on that.

02:24:01.234 --> 02:24:04.455
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe if I could get down there, I'd be happy to, but I'm broke.

02:24:04.835 --> 02:24:05.815
[SPEAKER_17]: I will keep in touch, Dan.

02:24:05.855 --> 02:24:07.835
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you're on the Twitter, so I'll be in touch.

02:24:09.296 --> 02:24:09.636
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, cool.

02:24:09.696 --> 02:24:10.456
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice talking to you guys.

02:24:10.536 --> 02:24:11.336
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, take care, Dan.

02:24:11.356 --> 02:24:11.876
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for the call.

02:24:13.431 --> 02:24:16.832
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio if you want to call in.

02:24:16.872 --> 02:24:18.853
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of Twitter, we're keeping an eye on things tonight.

02:24:20.013 --> 02:24:24.675
[SPEAKER_17]: User Javier Altman says, I adore it when Rob is drunk and or tipsy.

02:24:24.755 --> 02:24:26.215
[SPEAKER_17]: Makes my heart warm and fuzzy.

02:24:27.575 --> 02:24:28.976
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just footy monster.

02:24:29.256 --> 02:24:30.716
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm reading the usernames here.

02:24:31.777 --> 02:24:33.977
[SPEAKER_17]: Magical Nathan simply gave us a yeah!

02:24:33.997 --> 02:24:34.077
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah!

02:24:37.549 --> 02:24:39.171
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, Magical Nathan is the username.

02:24:40.452 --> 02:24:45.677
[SPEAKER_17]: Actdeft says, I hope Sky updates the podcast soon since this is a pretty hilarious episode.

02:24:45.998 --> 02:24:48.060
[SPEAKER_17]: It will be caught up next week, I promise.

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:49.121
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be all caught up next week.

02:24:49.141 --> 02:24:50.282
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to be for the contest.

02:24:51.663 --> 02:24:52.344
[SPEAKER_17]: Or it's not going to work.

02:24:52.504 --> 02:24:52.924
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

02:24:53.004 --> 02:24:55.487
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, you know, when I'm drunk, nothing's funny.

02:24:55.507 --> 02:24:55.947
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, hi.

02:24:56.348 --> 02:24:57.169
[SPEAKER_17]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:57.189 --> 02:24:57.509
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's this?

02:24:58.130 --> 02:24:59.030
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Deathwishing again.

02:24:59.050 --> 02:24:59.731
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Deathwishing.

02:24:59.771 --> 02:25:00.312
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

02:25:02.144 --> 02:25:02.805
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

02:25:04.485 --> 02:25:07.266
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I would like to say I have a great first person shooter idea.

02:25:07.326 --> 02:25:12.729
[SPEAKER_03]: It involves you and it would always be you running away from the battles.

02:25:12.929 --> 02:25:14.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst game ever, I'm sorry to tell you.

02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:17.691
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a great game because it'd be like little girly screams.

02:25:19.391 --> 02:25:21.032
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are you making fun of me?

02:25:22.893 --> 02:25:24.734
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be called Don't Get Shot.

02:25:24.854 --> 02:25:30.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think of Konami as a first person shooter developer at all?

02:25:30.953 --> 02:25:33.194
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami is a first-person shooter developer.

02:25:33.314 --> 02:25:33.994
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think of them?

02:25:34.134 --> 02:25:37.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're making a first-person shooter game called Six Days in Fallujah.

02:25:37.655 --> 02:25:40.075
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I... Oh, I've heard of the Fallujah game, though.

02:25:40.135 --> 02:25:40.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.

02:25:41.035 --> 02:25:44.756
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I... I guess it's supposed to be some, like, ultra-realistic game, like, from what I heard.

02:25:45.116 --> 02:25:46.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:25:46.257 --> 02:25:48.197
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we reported on it on a previous episode.

02:25:48.337 --> 02:25:51.598
[SPEAKER_17]: Weren't they, like, actually interviewing veterans or something to figure this game out?

02:25:51.618 --> 02:25:52.278
[SPEAKER_03]: And terrorists.

02:25:52.378 --> 02:25:53.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

02:25:53.078 --> 02:25:55.799
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is I'm, like, thinking, it's like, what's going to happen?

02:25:55.839 --> 02:25:59.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I going to be playing, like, getting ready to do a breach and entry on Adoro?

02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:00.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in Contra...

02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Big alien thing flies out of nowhere.

02:26:04.342 --> 02:26:06.023
[SPEAKER_06]: That wouldn't be very realistic now, would it?

02:26:07.164 --> 02:26:09.065
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just can't understand it.

02:26:09.505 --> 02:26:13.188
[SPEAKER_06]: What they were doing was coded arms for a while.

02:26:13.808 --> 02:26:20.472
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to do the really kick-ass PS3 one, and then they're like, eh, forget it.

02:26:21.012 --> 02:26:22.093
[SPEAKER_06]: No one wants to play a good game.

02:26:23.919 --> 02:26:25.580
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good games never last.

02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:26.980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of true.

02:26:27.501 --> 02:26:29.602
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games have you been playing this week, Deathwishing?

02:26:30.602 --> 02:26:47.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was at a cyber cafe yesterday, and I played Street Fighter a lot, actually, with my deaf Asian friend who could beat me with the controller behind his back, sitting down the hallway like a douche, showing off to everyone.

02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:48.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's clapping, and I'm just like, you...

02:26:49.758 --> 02:26:51.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

02:27:09.428 --> 02:27:15.231
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it because they say when you have loss of a sense like that, all your other senses are heightened?

02:27:15.552 --> 02:27:16.272
[SPEAKER_17]: Could it be because of that?

02:27:16.292 --> 02:27:21.175
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just really think the Asian race itself is just better at video games than anyone else.

02:27:22.055 --> 02:27:27.118
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess, as our token Asian in studio tonight, confirm, deny these said allegations.

02:27:27.678 --> 02:27:29.199
[SPEAKER_10]: I can very much confirm.

02:27:29.699 --> 02:27:30.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:30.620
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

02:27:32.221 --> 02:27:35.423
[SPEAKER_17]: You can send those cards and letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:27:35.463 --> 02:27:37.084
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be sure to forward them appropriately.

02:27:37.104 --> 02:27:37.364
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

02:27:39.531 --> 02:27:40.111
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, wow, wow.

02:27:43.012 --> 02:27:54.596
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're getting yelled at by GS68 in chat, who is also... I can tell, and I can just tell him... No, it's not a stereotype, because it's more of a fact, because I can't beat anyone at StarCraft that's...

02:27:57.541 --> 02:28:00.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Rob, I'll invite you to go paintballing with me sometime.

02:28:00.944 --> 02:28:04.567
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sure that'll be a joy, especially after what I said tonight.

02:28:04.827 --> 02:28:08.831
[SPEAKER_17]: There'll be, like, a secret meeting while, like, I run to the restroom or something before the thing starts.

02:28:09.111 --> 02:28:10.872
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, everybody, target Rob.

02:28:10.912 --> 02:28:11.813
[SPEAKER_17]: He's the gun-a-phobe.

02:28:12.214 --> 02:28:14.435
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just, I'll want to cry when the day's over.

02:28:16.097 --> 02:28:19.880
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, Deathwishing, thank you very much for the call.

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:20.761
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good week, okay?

02:28:20.781 --> 02:28:22.742
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God.

02:28:24.063 --> 02:28:24.944
[SPEAKER_17]: Take care, buddy.

02:28:26.837 --> 02:28:27.798
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:28:44.857 --> 02:28:53.664
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a story on there the other day talking about how Grand Theft Auto 4's sales figures have been extremely disappointing.

02:28:54.144 --> 02:28:58.207
[SPEAKER_17]: They went so far as to call it a flop because it sold only 87,000 copies its first week.

02:28:59.228 --> 02:29:01.029
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, I know you're a huge Grand Theft Auto fan.

02:29:01.109 --> 02:29:01.649
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think?

02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:02.310
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this true?

02:29:02.370 --> 02:29:04.211
[SPEAKER_17]: Are people judging this too early?

02:29:04.371 --> 02:29:04.992
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a flop?

02:29:05.032 --> 02:29:06.233
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it a bad idea to begin with?

02:29:07.008 --> 02:29:17.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's only been a... They're basing it off of the MPD numbers, which are only... It's only showing two weeks of the sales right now, so I'd have to see what it looks like at the end of this month.

02:29:19.357 --> 02:29:20.378
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be a flop.

02:29:20.758 --> 02:29:25.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Like most DS games that come out, they sell over a longer period of time.

02:29:25.461 --> 02:29:28.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Since it's more of a casual system, people are more casually...

02:29:29.324 --> 02:29:30.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

02:29:44.794 --> 02:29:52.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Even like Super Mario 64, a game that literally came out with the Nintendo DS is still selling well today.

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:55.261
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't doubt that this will sell well.

02:29:55.541 --> 02:29:58.744
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think it's maybe because the DS is more of a kiddie system?

02:29:59.704 --> 02:30:03.847
[SPEAKER_17]: How many really adult gamers admit to playing the DS regularly?

02:30:05.148 --> 02:30:10.051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but yeah, I can imagine it is more a kiddie system, but also people are dumb and they'll buy their kids this stuff.

02:30:10.592 --> 02:30:11.212
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

02:30:11.232 --> 02:30:12.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:15.633
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:30:28.086 --> 02:30:29.167
[SPEAKER_17]: X-Box Live Marvel vs. Capcom

02:30:48.343 --> 02:30:49.744
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything else, DarkSakura, tonight?

02:30:50.445 --> 02:30:50.705
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

02:30:50.925 --> 02:30:52.127
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything else for last-minute stories?

02:30:52.927 --> 02:30:53.788
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki.

02:30:55.049 --> 02:30:56.050
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple things.

02:30:56.410 --> 02:31:03.316
[SPEAKER_06]: One, there's some new info for Star Trek DAC, which will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade in May.

02:31:03.817 --> 02:31:07.400
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks a little bit like Star Control, which is pretty cool.

02:31:08.881 --> 02:31:10.202
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also...

02:31:11.988 --> 02:31:13.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes Clay Fighters

02:31:35.805 --> 02:31:36.425
[SPEAKER_13]: No way!

02:31:36.926 --> 02:31:39.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Clay Fighters.

02:31:39.167 --> 02:31:41.428
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been raided by the ESRP.

02:31:42.869 --> 02:31:46.091
[SPEAKER_06]: So, soon enough we will... I thought Clay Fighters was already out in Europe.

02:31:46.171 --> 02:31:46.471
[SPEAKER_13]: No, in the US.

02:31:50.489 --> 02:31:51.909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's out in Europe already.

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:55.951
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, so, but if it's already out here, why is it being re-rated?

02:31:56.151 --> 02:31:57.511
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not out here.

02:31:57.911 --> 02:31:58.971
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out here.

02:31:59.372 --> 02:31:59.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

02:31:59.592 --> 02:32:04.853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's out in Europe already, but it's coming out here because it just got rated by the ESRB.

02:32:04.873 --> 02:32:05.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob.

02:32:05.433 --> 02:32:05.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

02:32:08.754 --> 02:32:10.295
[SPEAKER_17]: Does this have the theme song, maybe?

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:13.516
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on, I'm looking at YouTube to try and find it.

02:32:17.277 --> 02:32:18.597
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it just has the intro.

02:32:30.126 --> 02:32:31.027
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, I had the funny intro.

02:32:31.087 --> 02:32:32.408
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's off an emulation.

02:32:32.488 --> 02:32:34.229
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's off an emulator or something.

02:32:34.349 --> 02:32:35.030
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't find it.

02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.711
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to bother.

02:32:36.671 --> 02:32:41.615
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I got submitted a last-minute story here real quick, and I remember reading about this this week.

02:32:41.695 --> 02:32:44.298
[SPEAKER_17]: The plug has been pulled on Bioshock, apparently.

02:32:44.698 --> 02:32:46.459
[SPEAKER_17]: Not the game, but the movie.

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:50.723
[SPEAKER_17]: It was to be directed by Gore Verbinski, who's famous, obviously, for the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

02:32:51.083 --> 02:32:55.406
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, the movie had been in pre-production, and the plug was pulled this week.

02:32:55.827 --> 02:32:57.108
[SPEAKER_17]: This happens sometimes in Hollywood.

02:32:57.288 --> 02:32:59.210
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a very Hollywood thing to happen, so...

02:32:59.830 --> 02:33:00.230
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

02:33:02.751 --> 02:33:05.913
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently they wanted to move the film outside the US to take advantage of the tax credit.

02:33:06.273 --> 02:33:09.554
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not necessarily completely done with, by the way.

02:33:09.594 --> 02:33:11.935
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just the game is in a quote-unquote holding pattern.

02:33:12.456 --> 02:33:13.916
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, it's been delayed a little while.

02:33:15.277 --> 02:33:15.757
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

02:33:16.197 --> 02:33:16.677
[SPEAKER_17]: Bioshock.

02:33:18.218 --> 02:33:20.499
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, the game you're playing right now is Mylon's Secret Castle.

02:33:20.539 --> 02:33:23.741
[SPEAKER_17]: You go in the little doors and there's a little jumper.

02:33:23.821 --> 02:33:24.941
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to the right, dummy.

02:33:26.022 --> 02:33:26.902
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you keep going to the right?

02:33:27.705 --> 02:33:28.045
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

02:33:28.125 --> 02:33:29.865
[SPEAKER_17]: And you go in those little, like you can go in there.

02:33:29.885 --> 02:33:33.786
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, forget it.

02:33:34.506 --> 02:33:34.806
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:33:35.727 --> 02:33:37.007
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other last minute stories, Loki?

02:33:37.787 --> 02:33:38.307
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I have.

02:33:38.487 --> 02:33:40.187
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:40.207 --> 02:33:42.368
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:33:43.048 --> 02:33:46.469
[SPEAKER_17]: Melly Welly, I know you didn't get to say a whole lot here, but hopefully you had fun.

02:33:46.949 --> 02:33:47.229
[SPEAKER_17]: I did.

02:33:47.449 --> 02:33:49.309
[SPEAKER_17]: And watching and participating when you did.

02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:51.050
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:52.590
[SPEAKER_11]: I just lost the game.

02:33:53.628 --> 02:33:54.429
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to hear that.

02:33:54.789 --> 02:33:55.109
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:33:56.970 --> 02:33:59.552
[SPEAKER_17]: The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:34:00.412 --> 02:34:02.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everyone should go to the UOP Film Festival in May.

02:34:03.374 --> 02:34:05.995
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, our international audience can all make it to UOP.

02:34:06.416 --> 02:34:09.637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because my engagement to movie murder is coming out.

02:34:11.118 --> 02:34:12.479
[SPEAKER_17]: Rice Princess, do you have any final thoughts?

02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:14.460
[SPEAKER_17]: In the mic, please.

02:34:16.301 --> 02:34:17.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Rob.

02:34:17.402 --> 02:34:18.783
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go to Disneyland for free.

02:34:20.399 --> 02:34:22.300
[SPEAKER_17]: Come to LA in June with us.

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:25.201
[SPEAKER_17]: If Loki already bought his ticket, you can have his ticket.

02:34:26.081 --> 02:34:26.361
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:34:26.461 --> 02:34:27.802
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, do you have any final thoughts for listeners?

02:34:28.922 --> 02:34:29.282
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.

02:34:29.302 --> 02:34:32.783
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a Cage Match song, but I'm finding one right now.

02:34:32.923 --> 02:34:35.784
[SPEAKER_17]: My final thought is the wine buzz is gone.

02:34:35.844 --> 02:34:36.504
[SPEAKER_17]: That's kind of sad.

02:34:36.865 --> 02:34:37.485
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't last long.

02:34:37.805 --> 02:34:40.166
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, our final, final, final thought tonight.

02:34:40.346 --> 02:34:40.886
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me money.

02:34:42.237 --> 02:34:46.898
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio or listening to us live, however you do it.

02:34:47.158 --> 02:34:48.918
[SPEAKER_17]: We really appreciate all the support of you guys.

02:34:49.258 --> 02:34:57.560
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, if you like what you hear here, and if you've stuck with the show until the very end tonight of all nights, I really applaud you, and you must really like what we're doing here.

02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:59.881
[SPEAKER_17]: So please tell a friend or two about our show.

02:35:00.181 --> 02:35:01.901
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how we get around is word of mouth.

02:35:01.941 --> 02:35:04.602
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have a big magazine or a big website that backs us.

02:35:04.682 --> 02:35:04.842
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.

02:35:05.242 --> 02:35:09.623
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a couple of friends who all met playing DDR doing this shit out of their garage for the past seven years.

02:35:10.023 --> 02:35:11.123
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you go.

02:35:11.983 --> 02:35:12.404
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura?

02:35:13.124 --> 02:35:15.827
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually forgot to put up the contest about winning my TurboGrafx.

02:35:16.508 --> 02:35:19.451
[SPEAKER_13]: So now I'm just going to say that the 300th person to follow me on Twitter will get it.

02:35:23.499 --> 02:35:25.039
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh God, it's going to be one of those contests.

02:35:25.059 --> 02:35:26.640
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just being silly.

02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:28.620
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the 300th person will get something.

02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:32.041
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe we can, you know, because we're going to have the contest for the SmileDK thing next week.

02:35:32.101 --> 02:35:34.142
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we can do like contest week next week or something.

02:35:34.162 --> 02:35:34.542
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do it.

02:35:34.842 --> 02:35:36.462
[SPEAKER_17]: Think about what you want to do for your contest.

02:35:36.482 --> 02:35:36.963
[SPEAKER_13]: Contest week.

02:35:37.003 --> 02:35:38.543
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we're going to do, I'll tell you off air.

02:35:38.783 --> 02:35:39.583
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just being a whore.

02:35:39.783 --> 02:35:40.023
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:35:40.524 --> 02:35:41.544
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, congratulations.

02:35:42.004 --> 02:35:42.264
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:35:42.984 --> 02:35:44.405
[SPEAKER_13]: Darling, you are a whore.

02:35:44.685 --> 02:35:45.065
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:35:46.325 --> 02:35:46.965
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, that's it.

02:35:47.205 --> 02:35:47.845
[SPEAKER_17]: Good night, everybody.

02:35:48.046 --> 02:35:49.486
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:50.199 --> 02:35:50.759
