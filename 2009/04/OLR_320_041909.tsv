14446	15367	and I, April 19th, 2009.
15868	19752	A new PSP game is set to be released with no UMDs.
20153	25679	Karaoke Revolution looks to be getting a reboot, but what is the hidden bonus feature in the PC version of Braid?
31670	36114	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36214	43100	Yes, we are back and here to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
43680	48164	My name is Rob Roberts and joining you every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
48904	52387	Not with us tonight, unfortunately, is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52407	58371	It's her birthday today, and she's celebrating her birthday at Disneyland, because, you know, they have that whole get-in-free-for-your-birthday thing going on.
59251	62314	Joining us, though, of course, as always, say hello to TechMasterLoki.
62634	62974	Hello.
63254	63775	How you doing, Loki?
63915	64075	Good.
64455	64775	All right.
65595	67796	Before anybody asks, yes, we have a new video card.
67976	68196	Okay?
68336	68996	We're taking care of it.
69516	70497	Old video card, yes.
70757	73277	We'll talk about it a little more during the housekeeping segment tonight.
73337	79739	But we're excited here because in studio right now we're playing the Final Fantasy XIII demo and actually streaming it on Justin.TV.
79759	81780	And, yes, I know we're not the first to do it.
82260	87461	I feel like there's some people out there that were in the main All Games chat room earlier doing the whole Simpsons did it thing.
87481	88021	You know what I mean?
88081	89141	Like, okay, we get it.
89441	90322	But, like, you know what?
90342	91222	I don't know.
92142	98183	And this may not be as big for you guys, but for me, it's one thing to watch it on YouTube and watch somebody else play it on Justin.TV.
98563	102744	But to actually see it on my little TV here in the garage is like, wow.
103204	104084	Wow, that looks nice.
104364	106725	Wow, because it's not pixelated at all or anything like that.
106765	108285	So it's pretty nice.
108505	112846	So if you haven't seen it at all for whatever reason yet, you can check out our Justin.TV channel while we're live.
113426	118267	If you are listening on podcast, hopefully there's some archived footage over there on Justin.TV that you can look at.
119874	123977	So Loki, tell us about a little bit how you got this demo and how you ordered it and all that and why you did it.
124537	130801	I just imported the Final Fantasy VII Adventurer and Complete, the Final Fantasy XIII trial version.
131581	135144	And I did it because, one, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII.
135444	141207	And honestly, this is probably the only way I could play it for a year until it comes out.
141227	142188	I'm assuming spring 2010 for us.
144629	151394	And also because I like Advent Children a lot and I wanted to see the movie all high def with extra scenes.
151914	153155	So it's a win-win.
153455	163042	And because PlayStation 3 games are region free and because the Blu-ray movie is the same region for both... You know, it just wouldn't be OLR without tech problems.
163082	163502	Sorry.
163742	166424	So it's the same region for Japan and US.
168305	168666	Why not?
168906	172688	And plus the movie itself actually has the English dub track in it.
172788	172989	So...
174161	176202	It works, and it's pretty awesome.
176222	182005	I actually watched more of the movie than I have played of the demo, so I've only played about 10 minutes of the demo right now.
182546	183046	And so far?
183466	183726	So far.
183746	184066	You like it?
184327	185507	Yeah, it's going to be good.
185547	187868	I mean, it's got a lot in common with Final Fantasy VII.
187888	195593	It starts off with the train, sort of futuristic, you know, there's a lot of battle stuff going on.
195933	197534	It just feels very VII-ish.
197854	200775	But which Final Fantasy game have they been able to whore unlike any other?
201216	201316	VII.
201456	201856	Exactly.
201876	203157	Yeah, and they're going to whore this like crazy, but...
203937	204798	But you know what, though?
205118	209781	It's without a doubt going to be the best RPG that's ever going to grace the PlayStation 3 and the 360.
210841	214083	Without a doubt, it's going to be the one that's going to be on these systems.
214123	216465	Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the PS3.
216545	217425	I can guarantee it.
218026	218286	Huh.
218746	222188	Well, it'll probably be on... I mean, because they're going to whore XIII out for a while.
222208	224730	They've got like three... With Versus and everything?
224970	228232	There's still Versus and then all the other ones they're going to put out.
228292	229653	XIV probably won't be out for a long time.
230133	231614	And by that time, there'll be probably a new system.
231774	233535	I wonder if XIV won't be another MMO.
234275	238119	I don't think it'll be part of the series if that's the case.
258599	260200	Not even going to resemble this by the time.
260220	267862	It was kind of like the 8 demo, because the 8 demo came out warily, and then 8 came out, and it was quite a bit different.
268883	274405	Well, Loki's going to do his best to kind of go back and forth from actually playing the demo to doing what he needs to do on the show.
274445	279887	It's going to be very difficult tonight because DarkSakura's not here, so it's just Loki and I here to cover the news tonight.
280627	282168	But he'll play the game as much as he can.
282208	288330	But if we have stragglers come into the Justin TV room that aren't really familiar with the show, if our regular listeners would help them understand.
288470	290151	Yeah, I haven't figured out what we want to do with audio.
290171	296255	If we want to do half Final Fantasy XIII, half us talking, you know, because we can only do one channel at a time or whatever.
296275	297076	Probably half and half is good.
297376	297837	Half and half?
297857	298437	Half and half is good.
298597	298917	All right.
299017	300058	All right.
300278	301039	And then...
302728	304530	Yeah, I mean, that's it.
304550	306232	I mean, the movie itself looks awesome.
306272	308754	And the HD, oh, it's sweet.
309035	310957	Well, what else has been going on in your gaming week, Loki?
311577	312558	What other stuff have you been playing?
312699	315562	I finished Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.
316703	318505	I was playing that online a bit.
318625	320507	There's actually a lot of people cheating out there.
320907	323670	You know, apparently I'm not the only one that knows how to modify the 360 version.
325865	326346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
341916	345758	I downloaded the demo for Outrun, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet.
346819	354984	I was actually looking at some of the XNA games that they had on there, the community stuff, and there was not a lot that I'm interested in, but there's a few that I was going to try.
355404	357165	I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet.
357745	361508	I did on the DS, I tried giving...
363001	365643	Bob's Game, another try, and no, it still sucks.
365763	366304	Really bad.
366444	368665	In fact, it sucks even more than the last time I played it.
369166	371648	And it's just so poorly put together.
371868	373049	That's it.
374570	378573	And I tried a little bit of... What was it?
378693	379734	Trackmania DS.
379934	380474	That was fun.
381935	385198	And last week we played Muramasa, the Demon Blade.
385258	389982	That game, actually, I'm thinking I'm not going to pick it up when it comes out in the US.
390642	391343	It's just not...
392441	392841	I don't know.
394103	395184	Not quite how I pictured it.
395204	397326	Wasn't that what we were looking at last week at the Bort show?
397426	398647	Yeah, but it was the Japanese one.
399128	403632	Usually I'll pick it up when they come over here.
404032	408196	It looks good, but it's just not something I can see myself putting a lot of time into.
411139	412521	Then I'm trying to think what else I played.
413442	413542	Um...
414980	416342	That's pretty much it right now.
416362	417263	I have just a lot of stuff.
417283	421127	I got into the Fat Princess beta, which if we have time, I may show some of that.
422589	425131	I don't even know if that plays offline or not.
425372	426693	I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
426713	427374	I just downloaded it.
428075	428435	And then...
431064	433565	Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it for right now for games.
433585	434986	It's just been busy.
435406	436026	Alright, sounds good.
436046	439847	Why don't you unpause the demo and let the folks see a little more of it while... I'm going to hook up the audio again.
440047	440508	Okay, sounds good.
440528	443789	And I'm going to talk a little bit about My Gaming Week, and we're going to do something a little different tonight.
443829	449731	Because it's just Loki and I, just the two of us, us two here holding down the fort, we're actually going to do something different tonight.
449751	451672	We're going to let our Skype line be open all night long.
451792	457034	Usually we only will take Skype calls at the end of the show, but tonight you guys are truly in the passenger seat.
457674	459415	You will be able to call in, and if you want to...
459815	460375	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
486144	486805	My Gaming Week.
487586	490049	Actually, not totally eventful.
490129	491650	I'm still on my Wii Fit plan.
491991	497417	It's been two weeks since I started actually taking Wii Fit seriously, and I'm trying to get in as much of it as I can every day.
497777	503023	I did go through a two or three day streak where I didn't play at all just because I had other stuff going on, but I've been trying to get in a good...
503423	503943	This is Leo Shen.
531156	534819	I played a little bit of Arcana Heart 2.
534859	536260	I tried to give it another shot on the PS2.
557331	558031	It's a piece of shit.
558051	559732	That's the all-girl fighting game.
559772	561292	It's got major slowdown and it was a pretty bad port.
584364	584804	Really?
585165	586846	It's a port of an arcade version?
587827	588247	Yes, it is.
589007	589448	Interesting.
590729	592029	So it's just a bad port?
592210	592970	Is it pixelated?
592990	593991	Does it run crappy?
594051	595312	Is it just not fun?
595832	598154	If you could put your finger on what it is, what is it?
600776	601316	Let's see.
602617	611103	Whenever, okay, all the old characters are fine, but when you try to use the new characters, their frame rate slows down majorly and it
611721	616825	Pretty much makes the game, like, you can play it, but it's just not fun waiting for it.
617845	620647	If it was in the arcade and on PS3, maybe.
620667	621848	Anything else you've been playing this week?
636400	642024	Actually, I've been playing a lot of Street Fighter 4 because I just received my tournament edition Madcap stick.
643245	644285	How does it play with the new stick?
645886	647067	It plays amazing with the stick.
648908	649188	Nice.
649549	650769	How much of an investment was that for you?
653231	663378	Well, I play a lot of fighters and I'm thinking that this could serve me well in BlazBlue, King of Fighters 12, and Tekken 6.
664258	665219	So, I picked it up.
666857	667337	Very cool.
668238	670818	Wow, so you're very busy with fighting games.
671518	673899	Is that like your primary genre of games you enjoy?
675659	678960	Well, I play all sorts.
679940	683841	Recently I've been playing a lot of eroge, which is Japanese pornography games.
683861	685302	Those are fun.
686102	686442	Nice.
687202	687822	Sounds like fun.
688143	689823	Are you a role-playing game fan?
689843	690983	Are you excited about Final Fantasy XIII?
691003	691043	No.
694540	699864	I'm thinking with Lost Odyssey I'm liking Lost Odyssey a lot I don't like Final Fantasy at all No problem, you too
717808	718808	All right.
718868	719729	Enjoy those fighting games.
720149	723510	And now I'm actually a little bit distracted by this Final Fantasy XIII demo.
723530	723950	So what is this?
723970	725611	This is that one new character that was announced.
725651	727592	Yeah, and he has a chocobo that lives in his afro.
727752	730253	A little chocobo that lives in the dude's afro, and he just kind of let it go.
730553	731853	But I'm watching this.
731973	734214	This is all like the in-game engine, isn't it?
734534	734694	Yeah.
735054	735615	Oh, my gosh.
736315	736595	Wow.
736695	737335	That looks nice.
738096	738356	All right.
738396	739596	We got another call coming in, so why not?
739616	740176	We'll take this call.
740496	741337	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
741357	741657	Who's this?
742397	743317	It's GS68.
743457	744138	Hey, GS68.
744158	744518	How you doing?
746485	746985	What's on your mind?
747245	747986	How was your gaming week?
748646	750207	Wow, so you've had a pretty busy week.
750227	756131	So even after all these years, you're still playing Para Para Paradise?
756151	756332	Yeah.
774099	775941	Um, yeah, whenever I get a little penis girlfriend.
776982	782709	Like on Friday, I had a male friend and a female friend with me, and they encouraged me to play, so I played around.
784048	784729	Parapara Paradise
807228	813337	It's easier to maintain the machines because instead of stepping on pads, you just move your hands under sensors so you're not wearing out the sensors.
814960	820969	And then also, not only is it easier to freestyle, but the game actually encourages you to freestyle.
822250	824552	We had a guy locally who used to play Para Para Paradise.
824592	829536	He was very good at the freestyle, but he didn't do the Para girl type moves.
829616	831838	He did this weird rave dancing thing.
831858	833720	Do you remember that guy with the little hat?
833760	835642	He was really good at that stuff.
835662	836562	He would do break dancing.
836582	838444	Yeah, he'd do break dancing to Para Para Paradise.
838484	840786	I'm like, that's Para freestyle to me.
841407	842948	It was pretty cool.
843228	848913	I think Para kind of got teased a little bit over here because it's such a girl game or what have you, but it's fun.
848933	849434	Fuck it.
850684	854365	I remember myself as more manly for playing that game.
855406	858507	I mean, because, you know, most men would not bother with that game.
859387	861868	It's just interesting, the cultural differences from there to here.
863529	863849	Alright.
864749	866970	Well, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
867410	874693	Yeah, I gave... Yeah, I got... I played the Bare Knuckle 3, the Japanese version of Streets of Rage 3 with the English patch.
875433	877474	The story's much more comprehensible, and I...
878479	884342	I actually get to play on the real normal difficulty instead of this American normal that's really Japanese hard BS.
885182	885462	Hmm.
886023	889844	So, wait, then Japanese normal is like easy mode.
891565	893426	Yeah, there are a lot of changes to the American version.
893646	895967	Like, all the difficulties got bumped up by one.
896007	901950	For example, on the US version, easy is the equivalent of normal on Japanese version.
902910	908133	And what really sucks about it is that if you play on easy on the US version...
908885	912427	The game ends on stage 5 with a bad ending, which I think is retarded.
915069	918191	Alright, well, excuse me, I just coughed.
920093	921113	Sorry to hear about the bad ending.
921133	925316	My god, if it's not the computer breaking, it's me breaking here at OLR.
925336	925797	Alright, sorry.
926077	928398	Anyway, sorry to hear about the bad ending of the game.
928619	930680	We're going to get back to our gaming weeks, but thanks for the call, buddy.
930900	931360	Have a good one.
932381	934483	And keep dancing the par-a-par no matter what anyone else says.
935643	936464	Alright, bye.
937776	938537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
959955	960616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
990175	1002869	But it's very buggy right now and it's having a lot of lag and bug issues and some of the WoW and Blizzard folks have been taking a lot of heat from the fans for not testing this patch thoroughly enough because they're having a lot of problems on the main server.
1003110	1006754	People have been getting stranded in the Uldular dungeons where they've been locked out of their characters.
1007514	1008955	You know, people have been having problems.
1009035	1011635	I was having problems today with the jousting in Argon Tournament.
1012035	1018697	You're supposed to do, like, you want to collect five emblems every day, and that's the most you can collect, and then you can advance quicker through the levels.
1018717	1019998	So I'm trying to collect my five every day.
1020338	1027420	And while I was trying to do my fights to get one of the emblems, the game was just, like, I was losing when it was halfway through the fight.
1027840	1028840	So it was kind of buggy.
1028960	1030621	So that was disappointing a little bit.
1031261	1031781	You know, but you...
1032481	1034062	I can't believe these people, blah blah blah blah
1052799	1053640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1072398	1075340	So there's the battle system, it's transitioned into this.
1075740	1081503	You have a little bar that's like your AP bar or whatever, and you can pick attacks and they have different lengths.
1081603	1088786	So this one attack will do one, I can do three normal attacks, and it'll do just kind of like a little hack and slash thing.
1089527	1098111	Or, for example, I can do Fagra, which will do all three, and then that attacks everything.
1099434	1100516	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1108148	1109629	Yeah, especially if you're trying to find a cure spell.
1109649	1111930	It's like, uh, where is it out here?
1112010	1114572	I'm like, uh, maybe it's this menu.
1114612	1121776	One of these other menus, I think it's, if I remember correctly, I think that's attack, skill, and I think that's white magic, maybe.
1121796	1125518	You can probably guess it's very similar to the layout of most other Final Fantasy games, too.
1125598	1127119	Like, your top command's always going to be attack.
1127359	1129360	Yeah, I mean, you can just do, like, three different things.
1129380	1132042	See, I don't even know what I just did there, but...
1132782	1145250	So it's interesting because having played a lot of Final Fantasy XII, it looks like in a way they've taken a step back to not even XI because XI was so different, but X. This is more like Final Fantasy X's battles.
1145270	1148392	I think it's supposed to be like XII because you can actually avoid battles.
1148453	1151815	You just have to not walk into the creature.
1152015	1153396	So it's kind of a hybrid of X and XII.
1153476	1154557	Something like that.
1154637	1155137	Strange.
1155897	1156358	Very strange.
1157609	1157829	All right.
1158029	1161390	Well, if you want to join us and chat with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
1161410	1162590	We'll be reading comments from chat all night.
1162610	1163631	We'll also have the phone lines open.
1163651	1171152	I am trying to keep a little eye on the Justin TV chat, but I'm not always the best at balancing two chat rooms, especially when we're down a host tonight.
1171772	1175073	We're all very, very busy in multitasking right now here in studio.
1175413	1177814	But we will do our best to try and get through the show tonight.
1178554	1180214	Let's start to get into some gaming news.
1180254	1182195	But first, I want to talk about some housekeeping tonight.
1183155	1183595	and DarkSakura.com.
1207950	1209630	Well, the computer was a doorstop, yes.
1210411	1211751	The video card was just sitting there.
1212051	1212691	That's hilarious.
1213151	1214672	But hey, now we're getting some use out of it.
1214932	1216032	But this is what I wanted to say.
1216352	1233736	It has come to my attention that the listeners, a lot of the people that were listening last night, or not last night, last week, actually ended up taking up a collection because of, and I don't know if it was inspired by my frustrations and venting that was going on that night with all the problems and what have you,
1234096	1235457	or what it was.
1235577	1238358	But regardless, the listeners took up a collection.
1238378	1243201	They collected something like, I'm not even kidding, $250 or $280 I think they got, almost $300.
1243741	1245562	They've bought us a new studio computer.
1245762	1248003	Some type of refurbished thing I think they got on Newegg.
1248343	1250304	They've got us a new studio computer that's on its way.
1250344	1251085	Well, that's awfully nice.
1251505	1251705	I know.
1251745	1252786	I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.
1252806	1253326	It's not a Mac.
1253846	1254507	No, it's not a Mac.
1254547	1255227	It's not a Mac, Loki.
1255468	1256909	I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.
1256929	1258651	We just needed the video card.
1258691	1259291	We're fine.
1259371	1266638	But at the same time, now that we know there's a third one coming, we're kind of like, okay, well, come to think of it, there is a lot we could do with a third computer.
1267539	1271603	We could have one in the house so we could stream more from the TV in there.
1272003	1276968	We could have a satellite computer at DarkSakura's for nights that we want to broadcast from her house.
1277008	1277968	There's things we can do with it.
1278389	1279170	So there's...
1280362	1281443	or Loki can tear it apart.
1281924	1283586	No, I'm not going to tear it apart.
1283626	1290135	I'm just... It might come in handy with Skype later on.
1290475	1291076	Oh, okay, okay.
1291116	1291737	Sure, sure.
1291797	1293579	You can do some fancy things with Skype.
1293599	1295081	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
1295121	1296242	Sounds good.
1296523	1297264	I'm liking this idea.
1299415	1300637	So, um, great.
1300757	1305061	And actually, Brad from PodCulture in the chatroom is clarifying it's a lot of new parts as well.
1305182	1305822	It's all new parts.
1306463	1308105	And all the chatters are being very nice.
1308285	1310567	Actdeft says, we didn't have to, but we wanted to.
1311148	1312189	You guys are very, very nice.
1312229	1315453	I mean, I'm almost at a loss for words, like, when I read about it.
1315653	1317855	You know, my reaction is just like, guys, you really don't, I mean, like...
1318416	1323559	We kind of pride ourselves on the fact that we've done this for seven years and really not made a lot of money off of it.
1324059	1327622	I wouldn't think we've made any money off of it.
1327662	1335446	Well, thanks to another very generous donation we had a couple years ago on Christmas, you might remember, we got to do some travel the next year and do some shows that we wouldn't normally do.
1336667	1338408	Actually, I want to say something about shows in a minute.
1339289	1341050	But yeah, it's just been...
1342090	1349092	Just very thankful and very floored and just really shows you the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio and it's just amazing.
1350132	1351693	I'm very thankful.
1351833	1352113	Thank you.
1352453	1354313	They say that I'm going to fill it full of porn.
1354773	1355454	That's wrong.
1355634	1358514	I have a PC at home and a PSP to fill full of porn.
1358575	1360335	I don't need any more porn on this computer.
1360455	1362597	They're saying Loki will have to put it together, which is fine.
1362777	1363177	That's fine.
1364939	1368742	We're going to put the old drives in it so we don't lose any of the shows and all that, so we'll figure it out.
1368762	1369063	That's fine.
1369303	1370224	I have to call Ranma.
1370264	1373346	He's been trying to get a hold of me, and I've been so busy trying to get everything together.
1374648	1376249	We will have more to come.
1376349	1377270	We'll put it to good use.
1377630	1378591	Yes, we will.
1378731	1381053	One way or another, we will definitely get good use out of that machine.
1382034	1382635	Very excited.
1383295	1383896	All right.
1385869	1387291	And let's see, what else do I want to mention?
1387351	1400982	Speaking of travel, I am going to be attending, after being requested to do so for about the past three years by various listeners, it is true, which you may have heard, I am going to ASAN, Anime Central in Chicago.
1401543	1404265	Not only am I going, I'm going to be doing a panel there.
1404345	1406287	It's called So You Think You Can Podcast.
1406827	1422175	and I'm going to take my seven years of podcasting experience well, radio slash podcasting experience and talk about how if you are an independent gamer independent anime fan it's not going to be just about video games it's about fandom if you have a fandom you want to make a podcast about
1422355	1424176	DarkSakura and Loki not able to go.
1424216	1424296	No.
1447868	1449329	because the wife won't let Loki go.
1450129	1452250	I don't have travel budget.
1453951	1458433	We're doing the E3 thing just because... I'm using my tax return to do it.
1458753	1460234	It's not something that was paid for by anybody.
1460374	1466157	I got paid for by my work because our work gave us each $1,500 trips, basically.
1467037	1473400	I'm using it to go to LA and we're staying at a nice hotel, E3, and then a slum hotel in Disneyland.
1474821	1476342	We're going to go do that.
1476502	1476522	I
1477282	1479603	Find something for the wife to do while I'm at E3, though.
1480484	1490989	I was going to get her in, but I thought about it, and even if I could get her in, which wouldn't have been exactly the most up-and-up ways, she would have been bored out of her mind.
1491069	1493471	Yeah, yeah.
1493611	1493851	But yeah.
1494757	1517596	Bobby is in chat right now, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us on All Games Radio I have considered going to ASEN just to crash Rob's panel, that's very sweet That's alright because I was going to go to DragonCon and crash yours But then I guess they have, now PAX and DragonCon are the same weekend or whatever PAX is looking very likely this year as well, it's just, I think we're all in the mindset of Let's get past E3 first, then we'll talk PAX Yeah, I'm not going to PAX No
1517876	1519397	I know I definitely want to go.
1519997	1523820	This will be the last trip I take for a long time, unfortunately.
1523860	1524740	Fair enough, fair enough.
1524780	1525601	You got to do what you got to do.
1525761	1526482	Personal life first.
1526902	1527102	All right.
1527922	1532325	Let's get into tonight's gaming news because the Justin TV-ers are like, are you going to unpause the damn game?
1532345	1533046	Sorry.
1533286	1533926	We're trying to do a show.
1534006	1535387	I can't multitask like that.
1535527	1536168	Well, I probably could.
1536188	1537368	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
1537408	1539450	Does it say Final Fantasy XIII television?
1539490	1539690	No.
1539710	1541551	We're trying to do both tonight.
1541591	1541891	Sorry.
1542131	1542312	All right.
1542332	1542732	No, that's all right.
1543212	1544213	Don't apologize, Loki.
1573345	1573925	Thank you for watching!
1592714	1594254	So basically, here's what you're going to get.
1595014	1596115	You're going to get this case.
1596235	1597955	It's going to have a voucher in it.
1598035	1600356	It's going to have a printed manual, and it'll be $20.
1600516	1605156	Now, if you don't give a crap about your printed manual, you can download it for $15.
1607257	1612738	Honestly, I think $5 for a case that you're basically going to throw away in a manual is a ripoff to me.
1612838	1617479	But this is something that they're trying, that they're testing out, apparently.
1619352	1622094	I have a feeling, though, that this is not going to be a test.
1622314	1634481	Especially if that PSP 2 rumor, or whatever, 4000 or whatever you're going to call it, happened to be true, and there is a no UMD port in the new upcoming system, then all of the PSP games will be like this.
1636007	1646821	or at least they're going to have this option so that you can those who may not have this new system will be able to download it or be able to play it on the original system as well.
1646841	1648804	Yeah, this sounds like a little more than a test to me.
1649304	1653470	This is letting the middle man down gently is I think what this is about.
1653510	1654031	Don't you think?
1654471	1654691	Yes.
1654951	1658854	I mean, this is very successful, which I actually don't think it's going to be.
1659394	1660635	I don't think it's going to be that successful.
1660715	1662837	I don't think this is going to sell any more than the regular arcade title.
1662877	1668681	Honestly, I think if they were smart, they would not put it in stores and just leave it as a download, and that's it.
1668761	1680189	Because I think they're wasting money putting it in stores, because really, if you're an informed buyer, an informed consumer, you're going to realize, huh, it's $5 cheaper online.
1680269	1681870	Why the hell would I pay for it in the store?
1681890	1682030	Right.
1682210	1682531	and so on.
1699063	1704587	If it's just going to be the same price online versus buying it in the store, why do I even bother buying it in the store?
1705268	1715955	Is this for grandma, mom, relative who just wanders into the game store and thinks this looks like a good family-friendly title to buy the children?
1716215	1720258	Maybe, but at the same time, it also might be for the people that had pre-orders on it.
1721479	1721879	I don't know.
1722159	1722800	At the same time...
1724226	1724847	www.DarkSakura.com
1750748	1752169	They can't sell it used.
1752409	1753630	There are no used copies.
1754031	1756793	It's all new all the time.
1756813	1758475	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to comment on this.
1758895	1759916	We are open all night tonight.
1760516	1768443	Decipher in chat says they're not really wasting money putting it into stores as it will let people who didn't know about the online store find out about it and how to use it.
1768823	1770405	And Cheeseburger says this could be for a gift.
1770645	1772747	Those are coming from our chat room, chat.orangeonsradio.com.
1772967	1776929	But they could easily do a gift online or something with a voucher and that kind of stuff.
1777029	1777990	I mean, that can be done.
1778570	1778950	I don't know.
1778990	1781031	But Grandma can't exactly go on the PlayStation Store.
1781192	1781652	You know what I mean?
1782012	1782432	Yeah.
1782672	1785594	They know, oh, my grandson loves video games.
1785614	1787255	I'm going to go to GameStop and buy a game.
1787415	1789756	Oh, this Patapon looks very nice and cutesy.
1789776	1790357	I'll buy this.
1790757	1790997	Right?
1791757	1792538	I guess, yeah.
1792658	1795479	But I mean, I don't know how... Is it going to be enough?
1795519	1799942	Is there really going to be enough of that to justify this whole strange way of releasing titles?
1800002	1800342	I don't know.
1801463	1801483	I...
1802481	1806944	It's going to be a test, and I have a feeling, though, it's not going to be just a one-time test, despite what they said.
1808544	1812667	I have a feeling it's going to be something that we're going to see a lot more of.
1815328	1821612	Because, I mean, everyone's kind of going to the online digital stuff, especially now with the iPhone app store doing well by itself.
1821632	1826915	I mean, they're realizing they don't need to sell stuff in a traditional marketplace.
1826935	1828956	Wait a minute, are you trying to blame Apple for this whole thing?
1831402	1832362	Part of it, I guess.
1832782	1834743	But it's not even so much Apple.
1834783	1838104	Look at Xbox Live Arcade or even just the normal PlayStation Network.
1838964	1843926	They've figured out that you can put stuff out just digital only and it still sells pretty well.
1844106	1844846	Let's go to the lines.
1844866	1845326	We have a call.
1845386	1846286	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1846306	1846687	Who's this?
1847727	1848567	Hi, this is Actdeft.
1848607	1849267	Hey, Actdeft.
1849307	1849688	How you doing?
1849708	1850448	What do you think about this?
1850528	1856490	Patapon 2, digital release only, but kind of $5 more if you want the case and manual in stores.
1856510	1856950	What do you think?
1858015	1859936	Well, I think it's a good idea.
1860836	1868760	Not necessarily in the United States, but in the whole world, especially down in Mexico and other Latin American countries.
1869260	1874983	And for those listeners that don't listen to the show regularly, you actually are from Mexico, so I'm kind of curious your perspective on this.
1875063	1875223	Why?
1876782	1877283	Why?
1877363	1885652	Because the PSN store in Mexico, it's barely updated on time.
1886273	1894441	We don't get all the stuff the US gets, like some games, demos, videos, and other stuff.
1895342	1915689	So if Fata Ponteo goes to only download on the PSN, I don't know if it would get released on time, but having to go to the store and having something you can use to download, it would be very useful.
1916636	1919197	Loki, have you heard anything about what's going to happen outside the US?
1920138	1923519	Because I would think, wouldn't these codes be region locked on top of everything else?
1924179	1925880	They released as UMD in Europe.
1926800	1930682	So this is only in Japan, I think they also released it as a UMD.
1930842	1934224	So it's only in the US that they're trying this right now.
1936765	1941327	Most of the things they release in the US, it's brought over here.
1941387	1943948	So that's why I'm concerned about this.
1944870	1951694	I don't have a PSP, but I tried the Patapon 1 demo on a friend's PSP, and I liked it.
1951754	1955497	And if I'm getting a PSP soon, probably will, I do want to get Patapon 2.
1955537	1955757	Hmm.
1969011	1976775	Well, if you do end up getting the PSP or if your friend does it, I'd be kind of curious how easy or difficult it is for you to do so.
1977055	1978376	So you'll have to follow up with us later.
1980697	1980877	Yeah.
1981098	1981878	And let us know how it goes.
1982158	1983319	Alright, well thanks for the call, Actdeft.
1984179	1984700	And have a good one.
1984720	1985180	Thank you.
1985200	1985340	Bye-bye.
1986140	1987721	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1988041	1994565	We're doing a little bit different and keeping it open all night tonight for your calls if you want to call in at any time and comment on what have you.
1995045	1998107	Let's go ahead and move on to another story and talk a little bit about Gears of...
1998487	1999287	I'm sorry, Gears of War 3.
1999567	2000128	God of War 3.
2000368	2001988	Every time I see G-O-W, I think Gears of War.
2002008	2003029	It's actually God of War 3.
2004189	2004769	God of War 3.
2004829	2006670	I guess there was a survey going on out there.
2007110	2009351	And there's going to be a God of War 3 collector's edition.
2009391	2017574	And one thing they've actually been exploring, putting into this, per a survey that went out earlier this week, that there could be re-releases of God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-ray.
2020031	2021851	God of War 2 Cinematic Movie Compilation
2043474	2058780	And if it's feasible to actually be able to play PlayStation 2 games and emulate them on Blu-ray, then that means that they've built an emulator that runs in software, which means that they can do an update that will be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games.
2058840	2062081	But why would they do that if they can resell the game just like Nintendo does?
2062381	2072805	Exactly, that's true, but I think that they would want to do it as a patch so that you can have it on the system so that you can download PlayStation 2 games, just like you can PlayStation 1 games.
2072865	2078828	I have a feeling this is where it's going to go, and I have a feeling they're playing this down right now because that's going to be an announcement that they're going to make.
2079688	2081189	Or if this ever comes to fruition.
2081229	2082850	I mean, it could be just all talk right now, but...
2083590	2088454	Well, and if a later comment from Sony is to be believed, this is just all talk right now.
2088834	2095059	There was actually an unnamed Sony Computer Entertainment representative that said, It is simply a marketing survey.
2095259	2096881	The goal of it is to do focus testing.
2097321	2101965	If that was the number one requested thing, that would be something they would need to see if it was technically feasible.
2102685	2105487	That is retarded.
2105728	2106308	I'm sorry.
2106408	2109290	They would not offer something if it was completely unfeasible.
2110111	2112693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2136451	2140982	and I'm sorry but I have a feeling if this is on this survey that it's going to happen.
2142968	2146309	They may not offer that, but it's something that they're working on, obviously.
2146429	2151190	Well, don't these companies usually use an outside marketing vendor to do this type of crap anyway?
2151210	2151310	Yes.
2151330	2154091	So let's just say the outside marketing vendor didn't just pull this out of their butt.
2154271	2160292	I don't think that they would do that because they're wanting to see, okay, we're going to make this box set or whatever of God of War.
2160812	2163033	Here's the components that we're thinking about putting in it.
2163513	2169594	Let's see what people want in there and most people are looking for so we can cut our costs and not put everything in there.
2169614	2171775	We just put the stuff that people are mostly interested in.
2172375	2172956	Thanks for watching!
2186428	2187548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2209798	2228191	and I will bet you anything this was a rumor from last E3 that they're you know figured out a way to have downloadable PlayStation 2 games and if they've got an emulator built of course they're going to use it because now you can reissue all those old PlayStation 2 games because you know a lot of them are out of print now and let's start making a lot more money you can sell them for 20 bucks a pop I would be so
2228251	2233734	I'm so happy if a software emulator comes out for PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility, because I do have a lot of PS2 games I would like to play.
2234134	2238356	Granted, I do still have a working PS2, but I'm running out of shelf space, for Christ's sake.
2238416	2242258	I have a 360, a Wii, and a PS3, and a cable box.
2242899	2245640	I have a lot of crap in my living room.
2245660	2249584	And it also would be fine right now, too, because they dropped the price of the PlayStation 2.
2249884	2255809	And yeah, it might cut into their PlayStation 2 system sales, but really at this point, who gives a crap about their system sales?
2256069	2257751	There are 44 million units out there.
2258011	2259473	Who cares if it cuts down?
2260033	2261895	You want to catch up with the PlayStation 3, so...
2263841	2268504	Hey, now we can say, hey, we're fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 stuff, and that would be a big thing.
2268564	2270125	Here's something thought-provoking from chat.
2270165	2277170	Brad from PodCulture says, Rob, Sony can make their buckage by selling the PlayStation 2 emulator as a purchase in the Sony online store.
2277270	2278351	Oh, God, don't give them ideas.
2279211	2281193	Don't give them ideas, because that sounds very feasible.
2281953	2282494	It really does.
2282874	2286516	HitStun says they could sell the PlayStation 2 emulator for $100 and people would buy it.
2286836	2288538	No, I draw the line.
2288658	2289218	I would pay $20.
2291266	2292468	I would pay probably up to $20.
2293410	2297236	More than that, I'll just say fuck it, I'll bring the PlayStation 2 in the house if there's something I really want to play.
2297536	2302123	But for that convenience of being able to get rid of my PS2 practically, I might actually pay like $20.
2302163	2303626	Just so you know.
2305168	2306229	I don't know.
2307570	2312033	Also, GameGuru says E3 will obviously have Sony announce the end of the PlayStation 2.
2312553	2314154	I don't think that's necessarily true.
2314394	2316155	They're never going to announce that.
2317096	2322199	I don't think they would ever come out on stage and say, and just so you know, we killed the PlayStation 2.
2322840	2323480	They're not going to do that.
2323500	2325662	We took it out to the barn last night and put a hole in it.
2325782	2327103	They're still making money.
2327343	2328183	They're not ever going to do that.
2328303	2332266	If the PlayStation 2 ever dies, which it won't, they're still making PS1 games.
2332726	2333047	No, they're not.
2333067	2333627	Some people aren't.
2334367	2334668	Aren't they?
2334908	2334988	No.
2335288	2337810	Not Sony, but third-party developers are still supporting.
2338090	2338330	Really?
2338991	2341093	Yeah, they saw PlayStation 1 support years ago.
2341513	2345976	No, they're still making PlayStation 2 games, and it's still doing pretty well for them.
2346577	2347838	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2347858	2348118	Who's this?
2348138	2348678	Let's take a call.
2349819	2351340	This is Spazinator.
2351441	2352301	Hey, Spazinator.
2352361	2357345	So PlayStation 2 games possibly coming to the PlayStation 3, would you pay for an emulator?
2358726	2359647	Oh, yeah, definitely.
2360127	2363870	As long as they don't go overly expensive with it.
2365316	2366716	Actually, it's a pretty good idea.
2367657	2379959	In a sense, I agree with you because you may have multiple systems and don't tend to sell you all the games.
2381440	2384240	Having a backwards compatible system would be great.
2385080	2388241	Less clutter, less wires, that kind of thing.
2389281	2390642	And not only that, but...
2392403	2402347	You know, at least with the original launch, you know, PlayStation 3s, you know, they were fully backwards compatible with the Emulsion Engine.
2402907	2405708	You can't really find those new anymore, which kind of sucks.
2406664	2407325	Yeah, at least with me.
2407345	2408025	I used to have the 60GB model.
2432574	2457983	but as I had mentioned before last year that was stolen and unfortunately before the system was stolen I had sold my PlayStation 2 kind of thinking well since my system was backwards compatible why keep the PS2 around now after the theft I kind of regret that because my new system isn't backwards compatible but
2458766	2477528	No, but I figure, you know, if they're going to do, like, some kind of update where they put Emily on it, you know, that'll be great, you know, because now I can go back and play all my old PlayStation 2 games over again, and a lot of them I haven't even finished yet, so, you know.
2478722	2485588	I would love to go back and play some of my games I haven't finished or play some of the ones all over again.
2485648	2487249	A lot of them are classics.
2488170	2490252	I would love to see them kind of unlock.
2490272	2495856	That would be a really sweet treat for Sony to kind of give people is the fact that you could suddenly play all your PlayStation 2 games again.
2495876	2496316	But I don't know.
2496597	2498578	The realist in me just thinks it's not happening.
2498758	2500680	They're still selling so many PlayStation 2s.
2501020	2502662	They realize that people have both.
2503022	2505244	And, you know, Sony wants to live in this bubble.
2505344	2506805	I think they literally think.
2506865	2507946	I think there are people there.
2508326	2511688	And to kind of touch on what you were saying before you took my call
2532327	2542574	You know, granted, yeah, they just dropped the price on the PlayStation 2, and at least right now, the PlayStation 2 is selling better than the PlayStation 3.
2544035	2560047	If they want to boost their PlayStation 3 sales dramatically, they would make some kind of emulator available on PSN ditch the
2560902	2568246	the physical PlayStation 2 all together and say, you know, we want you to buy this system.
2568446	2572588	You can play all your old games on it.
2572648	2588916	You may have to pay some kind of fee for downloading, but you'll still be able to play your old games plus they'll buy all these new games and hopefully they'll see their sales on PlayStation 3 increase as a result, you know.
2589454	2594536	All right, well, Spazinator, I think we can all agree, though, that wherever Sony's going to think they're going to make the most money, that's what they're going to end up doing, right?
2594556	2595816	All right.
2596356	2597197	Well, I have a good one.
2597897	2599377	All right, Spazinator, wait real quick before you go.
2599958	2602919	Final Fantasy XIII, you excited or don't care?
2604579	2605359	I'm excited.
2605379	2609221	I'm definitely looking forward to getting it.
2609321	2612622	I've been a real big fan of the series for some years now.
2614512	2619397	Hell, I even played the original one on the NES, so I'm kind of looking forward to it.
2620158	2630628	From what I see of trailers and whatnot, it looks like they took bits and pieces of different Final Fantasies, a little bit of 7, a little bit of 10, a little bit of 11, 12.
2630688	2638856	So, you know, I really haven't played a bad Final Fantasy yet, so this one proved to be pretty good.
2639238	2639398	X2, or X2.
2665973	2667355	Spazinator, thanks so much for the call.
2667395	2667815	Have a good one.
2667835	2667915	Sure.
2667935	2668676	No problem, everybody.
2680462	2686084	Yeah, has there ever been just a Final Fantasy game where you just picked it up?
2686204	2688504	And I'm not talking about your mystic quests.
2688524	2689845	I'm not talking about your tactics.
2689885	2691545	I'm talking about Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
2692405	2694326	Have any of them been bad?
2694506	2695866	12 didn't seem... I don't know.
2695906	2699227	I never played 12, but it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in.
2699367	2700087	But it wasn't bad?
2701228	2701528	I don't know.
2701548	2702088	I never played it.
2702588	2702828	All right.
2702888	2704289	Anyhow, let's move on with some news.
2704689	2704849	We're...
2706235	2707056	Spiral of the Dragon Aragon
2725672	2729773	is actually going to be putting out a CG animated film.
2730533	2733913	And they have a movie poster for it, and it looks interesting.
2734294	2740095	I mean, Eragon, granted, was not a good movie, and I'd probably say the best part about that movie was the dragons.
2740195	2741435	So, hey, why not?
2741515	2742195	Let's run with it.
2742515	2743635	Run with what was good about it.
2743795	2746156	So, that sounds interesting.
2747156	2749896	No word on when it's going to be out yet, but hopefully soon.
2750216	2752777	I imagine this will be something targeted towards children, though?
2753517	2754377	Probably, yeah.
2757088	2757869	So, I don't know.
2757969	2758269	It's neat.
2761372	2764114	And I'm looking, Actdeft in chat says, wait, that's true?
2764755	2768318	I guess some things came out that maybe doubted the truth.
2768358	2769219	I think it's true.
2769499	2771901	It's on their website, so I don't know.
2772542	2773723	Huh.
2775705	2776065	I don't know.
2777126	2777406	All right.
2777466	2780589	Well, we will see in just a matter of time.
2781370	2781910	Meanwhile...
2782950	2789313	I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently there are Star Trek costumes coming to PlayStation Home.
2789373	2790093	Did you hear about this?
2790753	2791774	Yeah.
2805322	2806383	That sounds about right, yeah.
2806703	2809626	Now, you've actually paid for downloadable costumes at home, right, Loki?
2810226	2813469	Only the Santa Claus stuff, and that's the only costume that I'll be wearing forever.
2813489	2814990	Would you not pay for a Star Trek costume?
2815230	2816371	I don't know if you're supposed to be free or what.
2816391	2817352	No, I am not a fan of Star Trek.
2817592	2819874	At least not to the point of where I'd buy a costume.
2821795	2822936	Or even a virtual costume.
2824678	2826399	Some folks in chat seemed to like that, though.
2826459	2828441	Actdeft says, Star Trek costumes do want.
2828921	2829462	Kurosaki87 says, cool.
2829502	2829622	Yeah.
2833496	2838118	Well, something else that's coming out available on the PlayStation Network and also Xbox Live Arcade.
2838578	2847221	Konami announced at their Gamers Night that they're going to be putting out the third installment of Vandal Hearts, their strategy RPG series.
2848202	2851223	Now the new game is going to be Vandal Hearts Flames of Judgment.
2851383	2854644	It'll be out on both the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
2855725	2859386	I think it's been the first Vandal Hearts game we've had in a long time.
2859506	2860767	I want to say the original...
2861952	2863233	Original PlayStation.
2863253	2869259	I don't know if they did a PlayStation 2 game, but it's been a long time coming.
2869419	2877067	Once again, figuring out that the online digital distribution method is still a very viable business model.
2878869	2879229	Interesting.
2880541	2880981	Indeed.
2882082	2884224	Now, this is part of what they announced at their Big Gamers Night, right?
2884244	2889468	And I'm sure we'll have other stories from that a little later, but I guess that was probably one of the pleasant surprise things they got into.
2889808	2891069	Oddly enough, no DDR news.
2891709	2892810	Unless they're saving that for E3.
2893010	2895312	Ooh, do you think that's good news or bad news?
2896353	2896653	Neither.
2896873	2899575	I probably... There's got to be something DDR in the works, right?
2899595	2901757	They're going to do like, oh, look, Hottest Party 3.
2901797	2903078	I bet you didn't see that coming.
2903398	2903538	Oh.
2903558	2905960	You know, or like, you know, Universe 4.
2906500	2907100	I bet you didn't...
2908052	2910014	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2928715	2930216	A silver system that plays PlayStation 2 games?
2930256	2930396	Again?
2930416	2930817	Eh...
2944248	2944548	Maybe?
2944649	2948192	I don't think they'll do that, but there'll probably be another bundle.
2948212	2950674	They'll announce or something, maybe with God of War 3 or something.
2950994	2953936	But if you remember, they did a gunmetal gray one.
2953976	2956038	I mean, that's sort of silver.
2956238	2957940	Now, wasn't there a white one also at some point?
2958400	2959321	No, not in the U.S.
2959341	2960182	That was overseas.
2960202	2962223	There's also been a silver one, I think, overseas.
2964986	2970010	Well, I guess there is a silver PlayStation 3 available right now in Asia, actually.
2970723	2972184	So we just don't have it here.
2972805	2974566	But this controller would match that.
2975007	2975427	So I don't know.
2975707	2978150	Boy, Sony really loves to mix and match the regions.
2978270	2981693	I can't think of many companies that really mix and match their regions like Sony does.
2982633	2983114	You know what I mean?
2983354	2983594	Yeah.
2983674	2985055	Like with all the weird colors and stuff.
2985075	2986357	Well, I guess Nintendo kind of does it too.
2987558	2987838	I don't know.
2988585	2994171	Alpha Cananogram in chat asks, why would they release a clear blue DualShock 2 controller if there isn't a clear blue PlayStation 2?
2994511	2995192	I mean, fair enough.
2995292	2999256	I mean, there doesn't have to be a silver PlayStation 3, but it's just kind of weird.
2999976	3003800	The reason why I think that is because there's one already in another region.
3004080	3008344	It's not just, you know... Could they just be unloading the extras from the other region, maybe?
3009566	3010106	Very possible.
3010707	3012368	I mean, I don't see why they couldn't, but...
3015187	3018509	I think that it's probably an indicator of something else, though.
3019070	3022132	Because that seems to be the way Sony rolls.
3044309	3044809	Download content.
3044829	3045409	That's what I thought.
3045429	3047750	I was going to say it was delayed too.
3047970	3049211	It sucks.
3049411	3051312	Minion Everyday Hero comes out on the Wii.
3051712	3054513	Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3055053	3058834	Little King's Story on the Nintendo Wii as well as the new Play Control version of Pikmin 2.
3059274	3062936	And the Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena all come out on the 24th.
3067478	3078602	This week, really only one game that you need to worry about picking up anyways, Excitebots Trick Racing.
3078622	3080803	It's supposed to be out on the 20th or tomorrow.
3083825	3085725	That's my gaming week right there, basically.
3086146	3091708	There will be a version if you want to, if you're ever so inclined, with a wheel as well.
3093775	3095056	and DarkSakura.
3108975	3114239	Some other stuff, there's a PC game called Cryostasis.
3116020	3121244	Also, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360 this week.
3121945	3126889	I Love Horses on the DS, and sadly enough, that's
3127729	3127889	It.
3129109	3133470	The week after that, there's going to be a bunch of crap coming out in the DS and then X-Men Origins.
3134610	3135091	Wolverine.
3136051	3142452	Looking at chat, by the way, this is coming from JustinTVChat, because I'm trying to keep an eye on that, even though our main chat room is at chat.orange.com.
3142852	3147573	I know we have quite a few people in JustinTV who have never listened to this show before because of the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3148113	3153294	I want to point out, though, AkumaJP, one of our JustinTV chatters, actually responded to something Alpha Catanagram said earlier.
3153714	3156175	There is a clear blue PlayStation 2 in Japan.
3157730	3159671	Seriously, part of the reason I love this show.
3159751	3165755	Most radio hosts, we get pissed off when listeners correct them on things, but I think we realize we can't be everywhere.
3166775	3180403	We do something pretty ambitious here by trying to keep in mind, yes, there are gamers in Europe, yes, there are gamers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, all those places we have listeners throughout the world, but we can't be all those places.
3180423	3184325	We don't always know what colors and what things you guys have, so you guys are always there to correct us.
3185953	3186754	DarkSakura
3209908	3216229	This looks very similar to the one... God, what's that game she loves on the Sega with the witch flying on the broom?
3217130	3218230	It's like her favorite game ever?
3218910	3219230	I don't know.
3219330	3220310	One of the chatters will know it.
3221751	3226752	This looks very similar to that where it's a very comic style and everything in the game is little demons.
3227072	3229893	I don't know, this game looks kind of neat actually.
3229993	3230733	Death Smiles.
3232153	3232854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3250868	3252288	Check that out if you are into that.
3252868	3260430	On the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Monster Hunter G, that's going to be a big one coming out over there, as well as Tomb Raider Underworld finally gets its Japanese release.
3260610	3262370	Those are the big releases on the Wii this week.
3262710	3278794	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Little Anchor, also Tomb Raider Underworld, and a game called Kanuchi Kuroki Tsubasa no Shu comes out from Idea Factory, which looks to be an adventure game, probably based on another anime if the box art is any indication.
3280294	3295442	on the Nintendo DS we have another time another leaf that's what it's called Kagami no Naka no Tante comes out Last Bullet is another game coming out on the DS this week as well as something called I don't know what this is DS Vision Dual Masters Box Set
3296616	3301541	I guess it's some type of like dual master with the cards, like the actual cards, but it's something for the DS.
3302122	3302562	Kind of weird.
3302582	3303904	I don't know what the heck this is.
3303924	3307347	It's probably, I don't know, maybe something with the DSi or something.
3307387	3308769	That could be.
3308809	3311792	Oh, maybe something that scans the cards, like an Eye of Judgment type thing with the DS.
3312272	3313253	Am I thinking too far?
3313714	3314114	I don't know.
3314154	3317418	I'm totally guessing, so I don't really know.
3317978	3318639	If that's the case or not.
3318659	3320920	And thank you, Chatters, you got it.
3321020	3322361	AlphaCananagram, was he first?
3322421	3323502	No, DarkTipsy said Cotton.
3323562	3326304	Panorama Cotton was the game I was trying to think of earlier.
3326384	3328926	That Death Smiles looks a little bit like Panorama Cotton.
3328946	3329346	Thank you, guys.
3330367	3342455	Sony PlayStation Portable in Japan sees the release of Hoshigari and Pusa Portable, which is coming out on the PSP, which looks to be another little school kid adventure game coming out on the PSP.
3343636	3345037	And Chronicle of Dungeon Maker
3345805	3348106	Nantama, if you're into Dungeon Maker, that's coming out as well.
3348886	3350607	That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
3350727	3351808	Let's do a few more news items.
3352148	3356030	We'll get into the classic game of the week, and then we will get into a break here.
3358411	3359551	So, Loki.
3359851	3362413	Sorry, you've got to pause Final Fantasy XIII if you can.
3362833	3363753	Or are you in the middle of a battle?
3364153	3366595	I was in the middle of a battle, but that's all right.
3367315	3370416	So anyways, there was some interesting stuff.
3372287	3375488	There was a new action game coming from Square Enix.
3376389	3382031	And it's a little bit different than... Oh, this is the one I'm thinking of.
3382291	3382591	Never mind.
3383911	3386952	Vanguard Storm is the name of the game.
3387293	3394535	And if you may remember a game back on the PlayStation called Vanguard Hearts, I have a feeling it's a sequel to that.
3395196	3395336	And...
3396636	3407365	No word exactly on what it is, but apparently the May issue of the PlayStation Official Magazine made an announcement that they're working on unannounced titles.
3407505	3412230	So tie that in with that trademark for Vanguard Storm.
3414832	3417774	Probably what they're working on, a new Vanguard Hearts game, which would be pretty awesome.
3418375	3418495	Okay.
3420069	3420609	It's interesting.
3420649	3423911	We've heard kind of a flurry of stuff from Squeenix in just the past year or so.
3423931	3427113	I remember picking up Vanguard Hearts so I could get the demo for Final Fantasy VIII.
3428434	3430235	I thought that came with a Brave Friends from Musashi.
3430755	3431555	Oh, maybe that was Brave.
3431575	3432336	I thought it was both.
3432796	3433076	Was it?
3433256	3433797	I don't remember.
3433897	3434857	Or maybe I'm mixing them up.
3434937	3437058	Maybe one of them had the VII demo or something.
3437078	3437519	I don't remember.
3437539	3439059	I don't think they had a demo for VII.
3440220	3440680	Yeah, they did.
3440900	3441161	They did?
3441241	3441761	Oh, yeah, they did.
3442121	3443122	Yeah, they had a demo for VII.
3443282	3443522	Really?
3443842	3444002	Yeah.
3444863	3445303	I know they did.
3447126	3476717	um it was yeah because it was just that it was just it might have been multiple demos because they used to do that whereas a disc yeah I seem to remember that like they'd have an early demo then like a later demo that had extra stuff or something like just weird square type stuff to do uh our phone uh yeah Brave Fencer Musashi had the demo for Final Fantasy 7 says Actdeft oh yeah maybe I did play that demo because I bought Brave Fencer Musashi I I seem to remember um having that demo I don't remember if I rented it or what I did so
3478274	3481217	and then HendersonMan77 says it was actually with Toball No.
3481237	3481217	1.
3481417	3482599	Had the demo to 7 as well.
3482999	3483400	I'm sure it was.
3483680	3485222	I think there were a couple demos that came out.
3485522	3486463	It was so long ago, though.
3486844	3487324	All right, anyhow.
3488366	3489767	The phone lines are open, by the way.
3489787	3491309	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3491349	3495935	I know some folks might want to call in to talk about this one, but there were some drams in the music game world this week.
3495955	3496756	That's right, some big drama.
3497876	3501418	DJ Hero, Activision, and Scratch the Ultimate DJ.
3521345	3522826	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3546024	3546264	Deathwishing.
3546284	3547245	And I say, welcome to America.
3568723	3570124	Welcome to Sue Happy America.
3570144	3571465	Sue anybody for anything.
3571545	3575368	Where you can sue your own people that helped you get to where you are.
3575428	3577050	You can sue the pants off of them.
3577290	3581113	This is almost like Coke suing Coke Zero for sucking.
3582134	3584416	This is like Coke suing New Coke for sucking.
3584476	3585096	This is what it is.
3585316	3589860	This is like suing your mom for getting your umbilical cord cut.
3590661	3599770	But seriously though, if this is true, if everything that they're saying is true, basically that Activision bought this company because originally...
3600915	3607560	They were going to sell it off to Activision or something like that, and Activision's basically in cahoots with them to delay this game so DJ Hero comes out.
3607840	3612883	I just want to say, to be fair, to cover both sides of the story before we open up and let the listeners comment.
3613244	3620949	Activision did publish a statement after the fact a little later in the week that says they, quote, strongly deny the allegations made by Genius Productions and Newmark Industries.
3621229	3623451	The claims are disingenuous and lack any merit.
3624568	3625788	They should be called Activision Blizzard.
3647877	3668133	and strange thing is I'm drinking coke right now dude just be random because I see coke stuff in chat but uh yeah I can't help to notice they always seem to lose or they always get dropped I bet you this one will be dropped because it's just the judge is just gonna go you guys are little children yeah we all just get along
3669884	3679293	No, but seriously though, basically they're saying that Activision and Genius met together and they signed NDAs and they showed each other's games.
3680134	3681355	Why they did that is beyond me.
3681415	3683838	I guess they're trying to sell them Scratch or something.
3683858	3683918	And
3685819	3694206	Now they're saying that 7 Studios, since they have all this insider knowledge of how the game works and we're developing the game, that they gave that knowledge to Activision, breaching their contract.
3694846	3710238	And at the same time, because they were behind schedule anyways on everything, they weren't meeting their quotas and they were demanding more and more and more money, that now they're basically dragging their feet so that the Activision game gets out first.
3713458	3715819	They're still little babies.
3716879	3718500	You're saying they're babies, but why?
3718700	3719560	Explain a little bit here.
3719600	3722821	Who do you think is the good guy in this scenario and why?
3726902	3732044	This is hard because they're both kind of just freaking out, in my opinion.
3733804	3735005	I don't know.
3735105	3735765	It's really hard.
3736305	3741487	It's like one guy is suing because he's being sued and then
3742523	3746366	The other guy is suing the side company, I forgot what they're called.
3746967	3753252	I kind of see this as false claims.
3755093	3758276	Do you think it's really important which one of these games gets out first?
3759675	3761357	Right now, yeah, this will be important.
3761397	3765220	Which one gets out first will probably be the more popular one.
3765240	3767803	But wasn't Guitar Hero out before Rock Band?
3767883	3772887	I mean, granted, Guitar Hero is more popular, I guess, in the long run, but I think a lot of people recognize Rock Band.
3772927	3778392	Actually, Rock Band's made much more money than Guitar Hero has.
3778573	3785158	In fact, I think Guitar Hero's fault is behind Rock Band's sales.
3785919	3787201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3806242	3808203	It's like when Rock Band was coming out.
3808243	3808984	Yeah, exactly.
3809824	3811065	People perceive it.
3811605	3815888	They want DJ Hero out, so people go, oh, that's just a crappy knockoff of DJ Hero.
3815908	3817489	Why would I want to play that?
3817529	3823772	The thing is, Rock Band, though, was different because it did have a full band while Guitar Hero was just guitar.
3823812	3825033	So that's maybe why it sold better.
3825393	3826454	But these are the same games.
3826654	3828595	This is like saying Guitar Freaks is better than...
3829255	3830396	Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero
3852888	3857592	Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up part A and get to our break, but anything else you want to say for our listeners?
3857672	3857712	Uh...
3878388	3880650	People, I need a chat.
3880690	3882512	Should I get Final Fantasy XI online?
3884413	3886795	Oh God, you're going to open a whole can of worms with that one.
3887256	3887636	You know what?
3887676	3888897	They have a two-week trial now.
3888997	3890118	My advice, try the trial.
3891139	3891419	Okay.
3891439	3891760	Bye-bye.
3896391	3896951	1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR
3916398	3917699	It's absolutely coming out.
3917739	3923621	I mean, I don't think they've announced it yet, but it's been leaked out on all these different retailer sites and stuff like that.
3923941	3932124	It's coming up again on the show because I've saw it on about three different video game websites from three different sources saying, oh, Van Halen, Guitar Hero is still being speculated.
3932184	3934004	It is fucking happening already.
3934104	3936285	How many people do you have to hear it from?
3936545	3937606	Absolutely, end of August.
3938926	3939647	What more do you want?
3939847	3940947	No, I mean, seriously.
3940967	3945390	They're trying to keep it in their pants until E3 because they want to probably parade Van Halen out on stage.
3945870	3949972	Because they know that something big is going to happen with the Rock Band Beatles thing.
3950012	3954494	So they're trying, I mean, Van Halen is no Beatles, no matter how much you want to argue.
3955615	3963299	But they'll do whatever they can to put a tent in the... Because you know that is going to be the huge thing from EA Harmonix is Rock Band Beatles.
3963579	3965580	Exactly, but I just, I don't...
3967130	3970292	Good for them if they want to put out another game, but I just don't like their business model.
3970332	3982138	I don't like how it's not downloadable content, or that you can't load it into your Rock Band 2 game, if it were Rock Band equivalent content, that you can't load it into a Guitar Hero game or anything like that.
3982238	3985799	It's just all separate, and they do that because they want you to buy these games.
3985899	3987320	They want you to pay the $60 instead of...
3989281	3989662	DarkSakura,
4005945	4007086	Dude, I mean, seriously.
4007266	4008386	Everyone's saying it's coming out.
4008586	4009227	It's coming out.
4009807	4010887	If it's rated, it's coming out.
4010968	4016390	They're just trying to... It's the world's worst secret right now because they're gonna... Just like Metallica.
4016410	4021613	I will bet you money they are parading Van Halen out on stage or what's left of him anyway at E3.
4022213	4022713	I'm sure.
4023774	4025375	It'll be during their conference or something.
4025395	4025735	I don't know.
4026135	4026375	All right.
4026715	4031478	Anyhow, SingStar Queen is a game that I thought was supposed to come out some time ago.
4031518	4032758	It was supposed to come out in March.
4032878	4036840	I have a friend who is very excited about SingStar Queen because she loves Freddie Mercury.
4036880	4037641	I mean, how could you not?
4038341	4040042	I mean, what a fucking rock star.
4040102	4045185	Just a great band that I also wouldn't mind seeing a Guitar Hero rock band game made out of.
4045245	4048966	However, they are making a SingStar game out of it, or I guess you could say it's already been made.
4049066	4050827	Didn't this actually come out overseas already?
4051428	4051868	I think so.
4052208	4057631	Well, we are finally going to get it on August 18th is when the game will come out on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.
4058311	4065435	Just like SingStar ABBA, the PlayStation 3 version has five more songs than the PlayStation 2, so 20 and 25 songs each.
4066115	4073599	By the way, just on a side note, SingStar also got a big update, or I think is getting one this coming week, where they're finally putting trophies in the game.
4074540	4080303	And apparently, if you go in and read some of the trophy descriptions, they talk about unlocking trophies in PlayStation Home.
4080803	4083444	So you gotta wonder if that's right around the corner as well.
4083484	4085764	I wonder if that's going to be one of the things they parade out at E3.
4086744	4090045	Well, it's about time they parade something they've been showing off for years now.
4090225	4093146	I would bet anything that's going to be an E3 thing too, if not just before.
4093586	4095507	But yeah, SingStar's getting a big update.
4095887	4098847	I guess the SingStore's going to get a little bit of a tune-up too.
4098987	4100648	Honestly, I haven't been at home since...
4101708	4102368	Thanks for watching!
4120540	4121040	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4144875	4148217	There's lots of people just dancing away in the town square.
4149598	4149938	I know.
4150538	4152619	But yeah, I'm with you.
4152640	4155281	I don't get the point, but whatever.
4155521	4156242	I do and I don't.
4156542	4157502	I get the point.
4157602	4161625	I just don't think it's what we all were hoping it would be, which I don't know.
4162512	4165574	It's not revolutionizing anything, I don't think, right now.
4166635	4174100	I'm very curious to see, though, because I believe, wasn't Namco supposed to put some stuff into PlayStation Home, or at least that's happened overseas, but it hasn't happened here yet.
4174421	4176302	Yeah, they have their games that you can play and stuff.
4176382	4180525	I would kind of like to see what happens when that gets enabled, because now we're starting to talk about a point.
4181446	4181946	You know what I mean?
4182427	4184948	Having some of these games that you actually get in Home.
4185949	4186369	Curious.
4186730	4187010	Curious.
4188175	4189896	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4204988	4207669	They're Paul McCartney's new performance that he did.
4208249	4219051	And basically when they're playing Got to Get You Into My Life, they had behind them some actual footage from Rock Band with the digital artists singing and stuff.
4219071	4220292	You know how they do at concerts.
4220312	4223652	They have images playing behind the band when they're singing or what have you.
4223672	4227653	So Paul McCartney at this – in Coachella, I don't know how many of you guys listening have ever been.
4228193	4229174	The last time I went was in 2002.
4230834	4232075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4256624	4257164	I take that back.
4257204	4261085	I guess they do a Lollapalooza in the Chicago area, but there's no big tours and things like that.
4261505	4263726	This is one of the big festivals people talk about in this day and age.
4263766	4265126	So this is no small concert.
4265966	4266507	Yeah.
4268047	4268727	Very interesting.
4269347	4271008	Although they have this thing at the middle of nowhere.
4271568	4272468	You know about Coachella?
4272568	4275349	They do it at this big polo field that is literally in the middle of nowhere.
4275369	4276649	It's in Indio, California.
4277009	4279190	So you have to drive like two hours outside of LA to get there.
4279470	4281070	It is literally in the middle of frickin' nowhere.
4282031	4283691	But I guess that's so people don't complain about the noise.
4285871	4286351	So, anyhow.
4288533	4291575	Also, something about the Beatles game is it's going to have multiple microphones.
4291715	4293176	There's a rumor, yeah.
4293703	4294323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4321325	4331433	All right, well, earlier we talked about SingStar, and, you know, SingStar, their biggest competitors are probably the Lips franchise, which, you know, has had mediocre success, and Karaoke Revolution American Idol.
4331833	4339279	Well, it was announced at Konami Gamers Night this week that Blitz Games is developing a reboot, I guess you could say, of the Karaoke Revolution franchise.
4339619	4343202	We're calling it a reboot because they are calling it simply Karaoke Revolution.
4343222	4344142	At least right now, yeah.
4344202	4346484	It's a game being developed for the PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii.
4348225	4350347	And it's going to have 50 recordings on the disc.
4350567	4353668	You're going to be able to have a pretty comprehensive character creator mode in it.
4354129	4358831	And you'll have customizable venues, apparently, and original music videos for all the songs.
4358851	4359412	That's kind of cool.
4359792	4365255	Apparently, they're going to have song and item download content in the game, very similar to Rock Band.
4365275	4367456	However, it is Karaoke Revolution.
4367516	4368997	It is singing only.
4369938	4376662	What's kind of interesting, though, is that I noticed right away, the first thing I noticed, I don't know if you noticed this, where did American Idol go?
4377262	4378523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4402741	4429433	and they had pretty good success with it so they came out with American Idol Karaoke Revolution but that's nowhere to be found now so does this indicate they lost the American Idol franchise they're not interested in it which I would have a hard time believing or what no I doubt that I think if anything what was kind of neat about it is that they also had it's all master tracks now too it's not covers that is one big difference I suppose um
4430527	4431367	So that's kind of cool.
4431828	4440591	And then you can also create your own characters in this, you know, like customize actual characters and stuff like with sliders and all that fun stuff.
4441531	4442592	So really detailed there.
4443312	4445613	But yeah, they're kind of trying to reinvent themselves with that.
4446910	4448352	Why not like DDR or something?
4448372	4449313	I don't understand.
4449814	4455320	By the way, they're also saying this setlist will be very party-centric and it's going to have a drop-in and out duet mode.
4455720	4457482	Doesn't that sound exactly like what they did in Lips?
4458023	4466172	Also, though, there's going to be online play, it sounds like, which I can't think of a lot of other games outside of the Rock Band Guitar Hero games, the karaoke games that do this.
4466753	4467514	Does Lips do that?
4467634	4467994	I don't know.
4468214	4471337	Lips is the one karaoke game I haven't played because I have SingStar.
4472218	4489074	SingStar's online is the SingSpace or whatever they call it, the community download people videos making asses themselves, dancing around in Star Trek outfits and stuff to the various songs, which is actually kind of funny, some of it.
4491347	4494870	SSJ100 Matt is hoping for a Karaoke Revolution Susan Boyle edition.
4495151	4496552	Because she's all the rage this week.
4498333	4499594	I dreamed a dream.
4502317	4503037	Well, you know what?
4503177	4505279	You can always recreate her character in...
4506738	4507459	and DarkSakura.com
4529427	4529907	Thanks for watching!
4551073	4553094	Yeah, she was in the newest one, though, I think.
4553214	4557017	Well, now they could just have Kara, who's the actual... Just get rid of Paula off the show.
4557037	4557577	Just get rid of Paula.
4557597	4560839	I mean, everybody's saying just get Paula off the regular show anyway, because she talks too damn much.
4560999	4561859	Just have Kara be the third.
4561879	4564181	She's also high on something.
4564221	4564901	Methamphetamines?
4565302	4567643	Methamphetamines.
4567663	4568043	Say, hey!
4568563	4570745	I saw the colors that you were singing.
4571565	4571945	What?
4571965	4574347	It's like, stop talking.
4574367	4577209	It's like, oh, they're singing Ring of Fire.
4577389	4579010	I felt fire.
4580219	4580779	Thanks for watching!
4600369	4602250	We just read online who loses, you know.
4602750	4604950	And honestly, you already know who's going to win now anyways.
4605070	4608191	But seriously, she is like smoking crack or something.
4608211	4614332	And a lot of times now because for whatever reason their producer sucks so bad that they can't keep the show on time.
4614672	4618673	Even when they cut it down to only two judges talking, you know, per performance.
4618693	4624134	This is Paula wasting so much damn time talking about whatever she's talking about.
4625234	4627715	No, I was like staring her down like, what the fuck did you just say?
4629392	4639534	Oh, and yes, I'm on Justin.tv now playing a trailer for Final Fantasy Versus because apparently I got killed in XIII and so I don't feel like replaying half an hour of demo again.
4639654	4640034	Good job.
4640914	4641775	Alright, so check that out.
4642175	4644115	What, are you going to switch to Fat Princess a little later here?
4644155	4644775	Yeah, probably.
4644795	4652437	Well, hey, you got another story you got to cover and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week, which you don't even know what I'm doing tonight unless you took a peek, but I think you'll like the game I picked tonight.
4652677	4653657	We'll see.
4654457	4655978	Anyways, so we've got a...
4657958	4658478	Video Game Live at E3
4688219	4688459	Nice.
4689582	4693229	Hitstun in chat says, wait, it's a $70 fucking demo and you can't even save?
4694892	4695033	No.
4696155	4696436	Bummer.
4697014	4703121	I kind of want to go to Video Games Live at E3 just because I know they're going to really pull off the stops for that one, but I don't know.
4703161	4704722	It just may not work out.
4705623	4709067	There's a very strong possibility I'm actually going to Vegas that same weekend.
4709608	4710388	Huh.
4710609	4711390	That was interesting.
4711710	4716855	I noticed at the end of the Final Fantasy Versus 13 trailer it said PlayStation 3 only worldwide.
4717216	4718757	I didn't realize it was coming out in the U.S.
4720037	4721738	Yeah, of course Versus is coming out in the US.
4721958	4722959	I thought it was Japanese only.
4722999	4727582	No, it's been coming out in the US, but it still is reiterating that it's not coming out on the 360.
4727742	4728862	Eh, whatever.
4728922	4729463	I don't care.
4729563	4730003	Big deal.
4730563	4737007	It's not going to break my heart if I have to buy one of them on the 360 or one of them on the PS3 or both on the PS3.
4737588	4739349	I really don't care at this point.
4740749	4741110	Alright.
4741960	4744722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4770279	4771020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4788015	4788295	Spy vs. Spy
4810250	4810711	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4827372	4828053	Thank you for watching!
4847154	4848315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4870271	4871072	Thanks for watching!
4888965	4891287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4913644	4914085	Thanks for watching!
4931886	4932386	is what it is.
4932426	4935169	Basically, it's a giant game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that's going on.
4935609	4946757	What's kind of cool about this game, though, what I always liked about it is that, you know, because it is split-screen multiplayer on the same screen, part of winning the game was memorizing what your opponent was doing on the lower screen.
4947058	4949219	And the bigger the compound, the harder it is to do that.
4949259	4954343	Because, you know, you're talking about an old computer system where a lot of the rooms looked the same.
4954663	4956525	It was just the colors would be different and so on.
4956845	4958366	So there's the guy taking off in the plane.
4958426	4959107	He actually won.
4959747	4960208	There you go.
4960488	4974962	Let me show you, uh, or not show you because it's radio, but let me play for you a little clip of the NES version of the game that came out a little later, and you can hear, like, the souped-up music that was in this version of the game, which, by the way, they say is coming to, uh, the Europe Virtual Console very soon, if it hasn't already.
4976280	4981164	But also very similar, you know, was a Nintendo game that had the same screen multiplayer.
4981544	4984386	I was always thinking this would be a fun game for them to put out on Xbox Live.
4984606	4985226	Or the DS.
4985667	4987628	With like four players.
4987988	4990911	But not have everybody have their own screen.
4990951	4992992	You could still see what everybody is doing on the same screen.
4993012	4994433	Because that's how you win the game.
4994453	4997395	You have to memorize what other people are doing and where they've set the traps.
4997876	4998556	It's kind of interesting.
4998856	5002139	By the way, there was a Spy vs. Spy game that came out later on the Xbox.
5002419	5003960	But it was like a 3D re-imaging.
5004000	5005161	That's not the game I'm talking about.
5006201	5008262	I'm talking about the old school Commodore 64 game.
5029372	5029952	Thank you for watching!
5048644	5049345	Pretty cool stuff.
5049665	5050645	That was the second game that came out.
5050666	5054688	And then there was a third game that came out, and I didn't even own this game, but I did play it once.
5055049	5056309	It was called Arctic Antics.
5056710	5059932	So basically the antithesis of being on the island would be being on the North Pole.
5060312	5064455	And it was the same type of thing except you had a body heat meter and you could regenerate it by being in igloos.
5064896	5065216	Whatever.
5065676	5070940	But kind of interesting that the series went on for quite a while on the computer and then got rebooted a few years later.
5071900	5090091	I remember playing this with friends when I was like 8 or 9 years old and having fun with this because this is a great trash talking game when you're in the same room and just the sound you make when two people kind of discover each other in the same room versus like you just start hammering on the joystick trying to kill the other spy good times
5091232	5101558	So that's the Classic Video Game of the Week, Spy vs. Spy on the Commodore 64 is where I remember it most fondly, but a lot of you probably are more familiar with it on the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5102079	5103720	So there you have it, Classic Video Game of the Week.
5104200	5105501	I'm surprised you never played that, Loki.
5105521	5108903	I thought for some reason you had said in an earlier show you'd actually played it once.
5109123	5112886	So that was part of the reason I picked it, because it definitely seemed like a you type of game.
5114126	5114906	If that makes sense.
5115567	5117267	I guess it makes sense.
5117567	5119267	Anyhow, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5119287	5121488	We're going to come back and we have plenty more of the show to get into.
5122068	5128490	Xbox 360, we haven't even talked really about the 360, but we have news about the warranties for the E74 errors.
5128750	5132871	We'll talk about Bionic Commando and Sega games coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5133171	5134011	Do you really need them?
5134532	5134772	I don't know.
5134792	5135892	We'll talk about that when we come back.
5135932	5139893	All that and more, including your chat and your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5146240	5148080	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5168205	5190936	and I did see on her Facebook she updated a picture from Space Mountain and they're all screaming and throwing up metal signs and all that kind of stuff so it looks like they're having a fun time but not here tonight but Loki and I are holding down the fort and boy DarkSakura picked a hell of a night to miss I mean it is her birthday so I understand but we got Final Fantasy XIII demo here in house which we're checking out here and I'll tell you what it's much different to be looking at it than watching it on YouTube
5191536	5192577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5211571	5212512	and DarkSakura.
5231129	5231789	Final Fantasy XIII
5261329	5266833	The E74 errors in their three-year Xbox 360 warranty.
5266853	5277021	You may remember that before they announced that they were going to increase the warranty to three years for the Red Light of Death, I guess, or RODs.
5277881	5278041	And...
5280317	5282739	Those are basically general hardware failures.
5282859	5285061	Well, people are like, well, what's an E74 error?
5285222	5287423	And they're like, that's a general hardware failure.
5287443	5293629	And they're like, well, is that the same thing as, say, the red lights of death or whatever?
5294570	5296131	Well, no, but yes.
5296952	5303898	So, you know, basically, yes, it's basically the same thing as the three rings of death.
5304078	5306240	Let me go to the phones real quick because we do have a call coming in.
5306280	5307180	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5307200	5307521	Who's this?
5308488	5309668	Hi, this is Gold Anthro.
5310149	5310749	Hey, Gold Anthro.
5310769	5311169	How's it going?
5311469	5311689	Good.
5311729	5314250	We're talking about Xbox 360 and the E74 era.
5314290	5315650	Have you been a victim of this?
5316891	5317051	No.
5317731	5320272	To be honest with you, I wish I just had an Xbox 360.
5320552	5322272	That's the next console I want to get.
5322292	5324813	But to be honest with you, I'm 17.
5324913	5326534	I still don't even have a part-time job.
5326594	5329194	So that'll be my first target is to get a 360.
5329394	5330375	Well, it's good to have goals.
5330675	5332495	So to what do we attribute this call then tonight?
5334256	5336617	Like what I want to talk about?
5336697	5336857	Yes.
5336877	5337577	What are you calling in about?
5338121	5338601	Oh, okay.
5339061	5340122	Yeah, about that.
5342942	5346523	I wasn't going to bring it up, but Loki chose to bring it up again.
5347263	5360707	The Bob's Game thing, and I'm sorry, I'm not trying to open up a fight, but if I'm correct to bring up a point, Rob, you guys are trashing on it, but you said you don't like to judge things based on demos.
5363027	5363587	Yes and no.
5364628	5365168	Here's the thing.
5365788	5368710	I'm not trashing the game, because I haven't played the game.
5368910	5371231	Loki's, I guess, somehow played or whatever.
5371371	5373132	I have not played the game, so I'm not trashing the game.
5373412	5375533	But the designer is a butt nugget.
5375693	5377514	Like, I don't like reading about him.
5377894	5381635	I don't like hearing about all his antics going on on the blogs going on right now.
5381996	5384837	I think he's kind of an attention whore, and he's doing a decent job at it.
5384897	5385697	I mean, props to him.
5386117	5387458	I just don't want to buy into it.
5387518	5391080	So, yeah, I do have a little Steam cloud that's being brought up right now, but whatever.
5391140	5391240	It's...
5391880	5394383	Every gamer gets a voice, so if you want to bring it up, then fine.
5394403	5396925	Like I said, I wasn't trying to start a new drama.
5397186	5400069	I was just saying, and I don't really want to talk about him on the show.
5400669	5402491	Sorry I even mentioned I played the demo again.
5403672	5410079	Really, I mean, yeah, you shouldn't judge a game based on the demo, but the demo gives you a good idea of how the game is going to be, and
5411294	5415375	You know, that's how you base, you know, when you play a demo for a game, that's basically what it is.
5415455	5420137	It's to get an idea of what the full game's going to be so you can make a decision whether you want to purchase it or not.
5420877	5436541	And based on what I've seen so far, it looks very amateurish, it's not very good gameplay, and there are some really annoying parts that just would drive me crazy and I'm not planning on picking it up ever, if it even ever comes out.
5436681	5439162	And I could definitely see why Nintendo wouldn't want to
5440356	5441057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5461492	5462953	The Mark of the Exiled or something like that.
5464394	5472319	It used to be a homebrew game and the developers worked on it and they made an actual full-fledged DS game.
5472519	5473260	And it looks okay.
5473580	5475001	It looks like a pretty good RPG.
5475561	5476482	But that's the way you do it.
5476562	5478683	You go through one of these smaller companies to publish your game.
5478983	5482986	Until your game is hot shit, if it comes out and it's really awesome, then cool.
5483266	5485668	But honestly, based on what I see, if this game...
5486568	5497091	If this is a half an hour worth of his game, say, and his full game is hundreds of hours long or something like that, I cannot see myself playing this game for another 30 minutes, let alone hundreds of hours.
5497271	5500232	Goldanthro, let's let you make a counterpoint, because obviously you feel differently.
5500312	5500892	What do you want to say?
5501633	5508475	Well, okay, I'm going to throw the echo in and stuff.
5510500	5512202	Sorry, this is getting really distracting.
5513503	5514685	I can hear myself right now.
5515005	5517908	Make sure your speakers are turned down there in-house or whatever.
5518008	5519509	Sometimes we have those issues on Skype.
5520110	5520851	I have a headset.
5521071	5522713	I'm just going to keep talking like nothing happened.
5523093	5524354	Basically, I don't know.
5524374	5527958	I'm going to wait until a full review comes out for the game first.
5528699	5533063	And if people say it sucks then, then I'm going to probably leave them alone.
5534655	5535235	It's my opinion.
5535416	5536536	Fair enough.
5536616	5537036	That's cool.
5537336	5539237	But here's my question to you.
5539377	5546839	What do you think about all the antics such as the leafing of the Nintendo store and the locking himself in the room?
5549400	5550941	I think that was a little overboard.
5553201	5558503	Even if it really was an act, it got all these people to create drama on the internet and
5559269	5570635	Not that I should really care what people on the internet think, but yeah, it is kind of... I can see what he was trying to do, he was trying to be original, but the echoing went away, which is good.
5571015	5579160	But I think he's trying to... I see how he was trying to be original, but I think he also got a lot of people falsely worried over something that really didn't even happen.
5579240	5580880	So I guess I can see where that came from.
5581221	5582621	The game for itself, though, I...
5584611	5587073	I think it is my kind of game.
5587093	5593537	I'm just interested alone in the fact that it was made by one person and it took that long and that much effort.
5594097	5596278	So I am going to probably give it a try.
5597779	5598880	It was made by one person.
5599921	5600921	You've got to say that again, Loki.
5600941	5602182	I had us muted.
5602882	5603783	Let me put it this way.
5603963	5605844	It looks like it was made by one person.
5605984	5606685	It shows.
5607205	5608446	And that is not a compliment.
5609946	5612268	Alright, Anthro, we gotta let you go, but you know what?
5612428	5616511	That's fine, that's fine, and this will be the last, hopefully, that we get to talk about.
5616531	5617792	I just wanted to put my opinion in.
5617812	5622456	I was thinking about that the whole time that you guys have been talking about this, ever since you first started.
5622596	5624057	That's fine, you know what?
5624217	5627840	We don't mind being called out, so thank you for the call, and have a good one.
5628560	5628980	Okay, bye.
5629000	5629421	Alright, later.
5630219	5631319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5654425	5661349	Recently, I guess, they're going to refund your money by July 1st, 2009.
5662609	5671694	And you can claim, I guess you'll need to claim your repair or something on xbox.com support before November 1st.
5673728	5702271	so you have some time to go and if you were one of those people that got screwed didn't we have a caller that was in that predicament I want to say we got a call about this somebody got an E74 error and had to send it back and they were pissed because it was going to cost $100 so God I hope you're still listening to the show go back and get your money back alright we're going to take another call before we get into the next story hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this Brest Law Brest Law I am so glad you called in because I did not get a chance to talk about the contest did you hear about the train wreck that was our show last week
5704316	5707257	We actually went over it on Under Sedation Live last night.
5707377	5707918	Oh God.
5708538	5709318	I can only imagine.
5710078	5712179	Please don't tell me Travis has a recording.
5712579	5713920	Please don't tell me Travis has a recording.
5715180	5716241	Well, it's Travis.
5716281	5716841	What do you expect?
5717021	5717421	Oh God.
5717461	5719982	Alright, so quickly, what happened on Under Sedation Live?
5720956	5724218	Well, we just went over it because I hadn't heard it, and I just heard you go off.
5724238	5726820	And I'm like, wow, I have never heard Rob go off like that.
5726860	5727960	That was a little surprising.
5728841	5734925	But I saw the context of the conversation that sparked it, and I'm like, eh, I might have done the same thing in this situation.
5735845	5738987	I've got to say, though, I did listen to the playback because there is an archive of it somewhere.
5739007	5740068	I'm not going to advertise where.
5740448	5745552	But I laughed my ass off, literally laughed my ass off at how Loki just...
5746172	5747893	Rob didn't have his Perrier watered.
5747933	5750535	I mean, for those of you who don't know, I was there a couple years ago.
5750575	5754218	He needs his Perrier watered or he gets grumpy.
5754278	5754678	Shut up.
5754698	5756639	Well, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
5756659	5757720	Let's get out of the way first.
5769949	5770329	SmileDK
5799958	5801520	Veronica and Hannah
5823275	5827058	both signed the copy of DDR Supernova in the colors scheme of the game.
5827098	5829260	So one signature's in black, one's in red.
5829901	5830461	And I have it.
5831522	5833283	And... I don't want it.
5834685	5835185	How rude.
5836286	5836626	I know.
5837547	5843071	So... Well, and also, what was really cool about it is not a lot of people know this unless you listen to it.
5843091	5845153	So I've been on a cane for about five, six months.
5846254	5849116	So, um... SmellDK actually signed my cane.
5849977	5850357	Oh, wow.
5851078	5852119	I didn't know you were on a cane.
5852139	5852279	There...
5853181	5854222	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5882005	5894040	It's really awesome, and I do have to say that I've been with Flacon for five years, and this is the first time I actually gave a crap about a guest being there, and the girls are so nice.
5894841	5896403	Let me give you a little sample.
5896503	5898466	If you have no idea who SmileDK is, here you go.
5911226	5912307	So happy you'll barf.
5914169	5914469	Yeah.
5916551	5920894	I mean, yeah, anybody who's played even a lick of DDR has heard of SmileDK.
5921515	5926980	But we're going to be coming up with a contest here in the coming weeks to give this away to one lucky listener.
5927280	5931043	I'd hoped to do it tonight, but with everything else that had been going on with last week, we didn't get to it.
5931083	5933065	But definitely probably next week or the week after.
5933345	5936088	But it'll definitely be something not just for live, but for podcast listeners.
5937236	5939197	Yeah, it will be awesome.
5939257	5942339	I will say definitely keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5942619	5943680	We will be thinking of something.
5946162	5952526	Also, in my incredibly late-to-the-boat review, I finally got to play Fallout 3.
5953446	5953606	And?
5954527	5957249	And I have to say it is one of the ten greatest games I've ever played.
5957809	5959070	That's a pretty shining review.
5959130	5960171	Why do you like it so damn much?
5961051	5964173	Well, it's basically Oblivion.
5964213	5965634	For one, it's Oblivion without the suck.
5966780	5967601	Wait a minute!
5967661	5968802	Wait a damn minute!
5968862	5971123	Oblivion does not suck, sir.
5971143	5972004	I'm sorry, Rob.
5972604	5976167	If you want to compare it to Morrowind, it's a horrible game.
5977167	5977608	Whatever.
5977708	5978348	Alright, alright.
5978608	5978949	Whatever.
5979489	5992998	Well, no, and the Elder Scrolls series has progressively gotten better, and then Oblivion just kind of took the series in a nosedive, but it was just, the combat system was fun, you know, a little, if you're listening to the radio stations and you're
5996516	5999578	I've been on an unemployment spat, and that's over with, but...
6020370	6028014	I've, basically my weeks have been consisted of playing WoW or some video game and I played Fallout 3 for a week straight and then beat it.
6029294	6032476	But yeah, it's seriously that good.
6034557	6038759	I have yet to play the game, I feel so out of touch, but one of these days I'll sit down with it.
6041050	6050601	DMN, bring us back on track here a little bit if you can, because we've got to get back into Xbox 360 news and back into the show, but we've been talking about how the warranties were just recently extended for the E74 errors for Xbox 360.
6050701	6054765	I don't know if there's any comments you have on that whole thing.
6056427	6058570	I actually cannot comment on it.
6059130	6059891	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6059931	6060872	I forgot where you're at now.
6061073	6061413	All right.
6062182	6062642	That's fine.
6062882	6063463	Sorry, Rob.
6063483	6064563	I'm such a killjoy.
6064583	6067065	Well, how about Final Fantasy XIII?
6067125	6072187	Can you say anything about Final Fantasy XIII and the hype surrounding it, since that's something we're demoing on JustinTV tonight?
6073788	6083913	I will say from the footage I've seen, this game better live up to the hype, or I'm not touching a Final Fantasy game from XIII on.
6085534	6086815	It looks like it might be pretty hot.
6087735	6088316	Because XII...
6089369	6092770	12 was a step up because I think the series has progressively gone down since 8.
6093130	6093490	I hated 9.
6093770	6094690	I hated 10.
6095071	6096411	Don't get me started about 10 too.
6096971	6098972	If I say anything bad about 11, you're going to hang up on me.
6101492	6103073	And 12 was a step in the right direction.
6103113	6103753	It was a good game.
6103793	6108094	It brought it back to the fantasy roots and the game kept being fun.
6109455	6114496	So I have high hopes for 13, but if 13 is a disappointment, I'm done with Final Fantasy.
6115427	6116148	Alright, fair enough.
6116688	6121812	Alright, well, DMN, we're going to let you go so we can get back into the show and have a good one and we'll definitely be hearing from you in the coming weeks.
6121952	6124374	And your own show, give it a plug real quick before we hang up on you.
6125395	6129779	Undersedation Live every Saturday here on All Games at 8 Pacific, 11 Eastern.
6129959	6136144	If you like vulgarity and geekery and whatnot and laughs, be sure to tune in.
6136444	6138346	Dick, fart jokes, sci-fi talk, and boobs.
6138806	6139406	Pretty much, right?
6140447	6140647	Yep.
6141068	6141648	Alright, sounds great.
6141888	6142529	Have a good one, DMN.
6143590	6144330	Hey, later, buddy.
6144391	6144531	Bye.
6145285	6146166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6169342	6171824	It's actually for Xbox Live Arcade, they're thinking.
6171884	6176809	I want to say, didn't we have a story on this a while ago where we heard that this was coming out for Arcade?
6177249	6177609	I thought.
6177669	6178470	I don't remember that.
6178710	6180612	I thought I remember this a while ago.
6180732	6182313	Oh yeah, WiiWare, I think.
6182373	6185396	So this is probably just a port of it for Xbox 360.
6185916	6189039	And there's probably a PlayStation 3 one around the corner as well.
6189059	6189239	Sure.
6189259	6189619	Makes sense.
6189920	6190420	I'm sure it is.
6190840	6191021	Yeah.
6191541	6196085	Actdeft in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com says, Bubble Bobble Neo, you are the one.
6196909	6197129	Get it?
6197590	6198010	Old school joke.
6198450	6203294	By the way, I saw Matrix Reloaded for $6 on DVD at Suncoast the other day.
6203854	6204615	Yeah.
6205055	6206977	All those older catalog titles are cheap.
6207317	6208918	And one more comment from DarkTetsuya.
6209099	6210219	Rob, but can you get past level 30?
6211861	6212942	They will never live that down.
6212982	6213862	And rightfully so.
6214002	6214443	Christ.
6214983	6215203	Yeah.
6215764	6215924	Hmm.
6217885	6229170	Jonathan Blow, the creator of the hit puzzle game Braid, has revealed that there's a hidden level editor within the PC version.
6229750	6232452	Apparently, he's been kind of teasing it.
6232492	6240195	He says, when more people have played slash finished the game, there will be an update to unlock it.
6242009	6252097	It says basically the level editor will allow players to extend the life of the puzzle title with the potential to add up to another full game worth of puzzles.
6252938	6253238	Wow.
6253338	6261885	And you can also implement new things into it including importing your own images from Photoshop and stuff like that.
6261985	6264127	So that's going to be pretty neat.
6264687	6267810	I wonder, is this something that you'll be able to share levels with other people maybe?
6267870	6268771	I'm sure you probably could.
6268891	6271473	That's a bummer that the Xbox 360 crowd missed out on that.
6272366	6274007	XBOX 360 Bionic Commando XBOX 360 Bionic Commando
6288755	6289876	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6315689	6315990	We'll see.
6316030	6317313	I definitely want to give it a shot.
6317333	6318876	I guess that's the whole reason behind a demo, right?
6319377	6320179	Yeah.
6320580	6322083	Check that out when it comes out a little later this month.
6322484	6323727	I'm very interested in the demo.
6324408	6325912	Well, the game looks awesome.
6326866	6327907	I definitely want to give it a try.
6348945	6349526	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6361539	6361879	I don't know.
6361979	6364740	It usually is a good indicator of how the game's going to be.
6364760	6367501	I've got to read some comments from chat before we get into the next story, Loki.
6367721	6368422	Some comments from chat.
6368522	6375244	SSJ100Matt says, on the braid story in the level editor, the real question is, why haven't hackers found the code for this feature already?
6375905	6379686	And DeathWishing says, Photoshop levels, oh god, Penisland Platformer.
6380106	6382087	Yeah, you know, you're going to see plenty of those levels on YouTube.
6382747	6384148	I don't know why people haven't found it yet.
6384688	6385629	Maybe they weren't looking for it.
6385949	6388130	Maybe part of it's missing, and that's what's in the patch.
6388690	6388890	Maybe.
6390069	6395010	Maybe it's a whole Resident Evil multiplayer type situation.
6397171	6407093	Interesting enough, we've been hearing constant rumors of some old school arcade games from Sega coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
6407453	6413074	Well, now there's a little bit more confirmation about it, including achievements that have basically been...
6415759	6420580	MyGamerCard has a deck of achievements for Altered Beast, Comic Zone, and Shinobi.
6421240	6430504	All three of those titles belong to the classic arcade collection that will be available online.
6432384	6437666	What's interesting though is they didn't mention anything about Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.
6438847	6440707	But at least these three probably soon enough.
6444358	6447040	Now, why would I care, though, if I already have that other collection?
6447840	6448180	I don't know.
6448340	6450381	This seems kind of useless.
6450441	6461087	I mean, don't get me wrong, these games are pretty rad, but... Well, it's the same reason why they released, you know, Pac-Man on Xbox Live Arcade when, you know, it's available in, you know, the Namco collection as well.
6461227	6467031	You know, it's just another way for people to... But, I mean, Pac-Man is like $10 and that collection is like, you know, $30 or $40.
6467311	6470493	You're talking about this collection is $30 and you get what?
6470553	6470993	Like 25, 30 games?
6471033	6470993	$40. $40.
6473454	6474355	40 games or some shit.
6474795	6479157	Okay, so I think it's like $40 for 40 games, whatever, versus paying like $5 for one individual game.
6479177	6480198	That's a huge difference.
6480538	6481138	Huge difference.
6481739	6482239	You know what I mean?
6482459	6483120	Yeah, I know what you mean.
6483900	6485121	This just doesn't make sense.
6485241	6487842	This is for definitely the impulse buyer or something, right?
6488523	6488783	Maybe.
6489003	6489643	Achievement horse?
6489823	6490364	I don't know.
6490404	6492145	I guess achievement horse.
6492365	6496227	Unless they are going back and altering the actual code of the games, but I highly doubt that.
6496967	6498028	Yeah, I doubt it.
6498760	6506276	I thought Xbox got a little stricter on what they were going to let get on the service, and they weren't just going to let all these old ports get on there, but it seems like that's what's happening.
6509265	6511248	They go where the money is, I guess.
6511768	6512269	I guess.
6512369	6515252	I guess if they can even make $20 off it, it's worth it, I guess.
6516093	6516333	All right.
6516353	6520918	Well, anyhow, we're going to get into the part of the show where you get to interact with us through the email.
6521358	6524221	This is a good way for the podcasters to get involved when they can't listen live.
6524622	6525943	MailbagOrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6525963	6528366	Let's open up Ye Olde Mailbag and see what's in there.
6531994	6532975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6556852	6557273	and DarkSakura.com
6573152	6575073	There's no way to have a region-free 360.
6575393	6583959	You can either buy region-free games, or you can get a mod chip and change your region of your 360 to be an Asian region 360.
6583999	6584599	That's it.
6589299	6591060	Next question comes from Sterlok.
6611347	6613068	Where can I find Brilliant to Rave?
6613388	6615509	I've been looking for a while and can't seem to find it anywhere.
6615929	6629195	What he's mentioning, you guys, is a song that was played in the live-only segment of our show, because obviously we can't play licensed music on the podcast, but there was a remix of an old song from DDR called Brilliant to You, but the song was Brilliant to Rave.
6629575	6631416	It's from the new Diverse System, though.
6631956	6632616	Diverse Systems.
6632636	6634377	Where can they order that if they want to get that?
6634437	6634837	Diverse.jp
6637708	6643350	Next email comes from Robert M. The first question was for Jamie about Samurai Showdown Anthologies.
6643390	6643990	I can't answer that.
6644010	6644751	Sadly, she's not here.
6645271	6650673	Secondly, is the Sanrio character officially named Hello Kitty, or is she just named Kitty and her franchise is Hello Kitty?
6650713	6651193	Just curious.
6651733	6654854	I believe the franchise is Hello Kitty, but I don't know.
6654914	6656575	I think she's called Hello Kitty.
6657155	6663478	Yeah, as much as I claim to be the whore of Sanrio, I actually don't know.
6663538	6666939	Maybe one of our chatters knows, but I'm pretty sure it's still Hello Kitty.
6668160	6670863	Anyway, he continues on with some follow-up emails.
6671224	6674547	Sorry to hear about Rob's video card and hopefully the idiot who made that comment is banned.
6674587	6680734	I can't seem to get in chat myself lately, which may be related to a Java error on my end since I can't seem to get into the chat room for Bobby's shows either.
6681275	6685339	If I want to make a donation to help out and don't really want to use PayPal for whatever reason, where can I send a check?
6685640	6687462	Because I'm really looking forward to hearing next week's show.
6688122	6716398	it sounds like the other listeners took care of that and that's a very generous thing to offer hang on to it I'm hoping in the coming weeks we can have other ways that you guys can throw money at us if you really really want to that we'll put to good use I know we've been talking shirts for like three years I really want to make that happen in the near future it's just time and everything else going on hopefully soon so we'll let you know also there was one other follow up email that came in
6719391	6724194	I apologize if I was out of line stating that the chatter who asked why Rob bothered trying to run out of the show again should be banned.
6724714	6728036	As I said, I wasn't in chat, so I have no context of the comment, just Rob's reaction.
6728076	6734439	I absolutely understand that in a stressful situation, especially as one as serious as computer failure, such criticism is most unwelcome and hurtful.
6734779	6737980	I have no intention of defending his comments, but I can't say I have the right to condemn them either.
6738080	6740782	That said, I still hope the situation with your hardware improves.
6740882	6744944	I find not being able to listen to my favorite podcast to be as frustrating as you not being able to get it running.
6745404	6746326	Thank you very much for the kind words.
6752792	6757917	It looks like we're all in good shape now, and everything's hunky-dory happy, and it was just a bad week.
6758137	6762040	Some weeks are good weeks, and some weeks are bad weeks, and let's just leave it at that.
6764062	6772369	An email from Cheeseburger asks, I was wondering if there is an Xbox Live OLR clan named like the OL Army, or at least a motto that all OLR listeners can have.
6772769	6773990	Why, yes, we do have one.
6774330	6776052	The OLR clan is the OL Army.
6776252	6777213	That is the official clan.
6777473	6779054	We have a Steam community available.
6779094	6779535	If you look...
6779935	6780895	Thanks for watching!
6803840	6804541	Don't be a dick.
6830422	6833524	Hi everyone, I thought I would email you folks some questions and comments.
6833904	6836386	Well, more of a recommendation than a comment, but I won't get into semantics.
6836806	6841049	Since you three have professed the love of all things DDR on numerous occasions, well, hold on.
6842409	6843570	Hold on, I wouldn't go that far.
6844150	6848413	We used to all love DDR, but DDR got really stale in the past few years.
6848473	6849314	I just want to clarify that.
6850274	6852355	So we don't love all things DDR.
6852395	6856018	I think there will always be love for DDR, because without it we would have never met.
6856923	6859445	But that doesn't mean we love each and every game that comes out of the franchise.
6860286	6861447	Perhaps you can explain something to me.
6861507	6863469	What exactly is the reasons that you get into these games?
6863609	6869515	I get stuff like Rock Band and Guitar Hero, but the idea behind pushing arrows to music I've never heard of before doesn't seem very interesting.
6869555	6870275	Well, to me anyway.
6870956	6871617	Oh, that was just fun.
6872216	6872857	I know, it was just funny.
6873037	6874739	It was such a different type of arcade game.
6874819	6876881	I mean, you moved.
6877161	6877742	You know what I mean?
6877822	6878843	It wasn't just you stood there.
6879303	6880244	And for me, here's the thing.
6880585	6883588	Also, and maybe it's just me, I suck at fighting games.
6884188	6885330	I was never very good at them.
6885730	6888933	I wasn't very good at a lot of the types of games like shooter games that were in the arcade.
6889214	6892397	But when it came to the music games, I was pretty good at it.
6893137	6899301	It was the type of game I could get into and be good at because I was into music in high school and I know Jamie has a musical background.
6899401	6901643	I know Loki likes to mix music.
6901963	6905205	He's a big fan of music and has music as a hobby, you could say.
6905605	6907306	I think that's one common thing we all have.
6907706	6913210	Not to say you're not into music, but definitely I think it's something that enables us to be into DDR so much more.
6913490	6914411	I think it would be a big part of it.
6918152	6920292	Have any of you played Comet Crash yet?
6920672	6922973	If not, I recommend picking it up from the PSN store.
6923013	6931294	It's another tower defense game, like PixelJunk Monsters, but has more of a sci-fi feel and you can send vehicles on the offensive, whereas PJ Monsters is purely defensive.
6931374	6934095	Personally, after playing this game for a week, I would recommend getting this title.
6934775	6940496	For my last subject question, and on a semi-related note, have you played Ragdoll Kung Fu yet?
6940876	6942397	If so, what are your impressions of the game?
6942977	6943477	Haven't played it.
6943717	6944577	I haven't played it yet.
6944857	6945537	It looked okay.
6945838	6946658	Is it worth getting?
6946738	6949458	From what little I've seen, it looks like a cross between the Super Smash Bros.
6949498	6952779	games and parodies of classic Hong Kong Kung Fu movies from the 60s and 70s.
6953179	6954300	Is this a fair assessment?
6954620	6956420	I heard it wasn't as fun as it seemed.
6956780	6957040	Really?
6957740	6962742	Since neither of us have played it, we'll have to ask the chat room if there's any follow-up comments on that one.
6964142	6971024	Lastly... I want to read... He sent another email later in the week.
6971804	6971924	Um...
6973157	6973777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6994683	6996065	Ooh, I hope Mega Man Legends is in there.
6996085	7003091	I thought I remember seeing something from Capcom and more PS1 games, but... Well, I remember seeing something about Marvel vs. Capcom 2 achievements on 360.
7003191	7003311	Yeah.
7003431	7004713	I remember that.
7005473	7012600	Also, another rumor suggests that in tandem with the release of Capcom PS1 titles, an upgraded version of SNK vs. Capcom 2 will be coming out at the same time.
7012940	7014021	Oh, shit, I hope that's true.
7014401	7015823	That's one fighting game I can get into.
7016123	7017845	That is, like, one of my favorite fighting games ever.
7018665	7018705	Um...
7019426	7022549	It's been suggested that SVC2 will... Wasn't it Capcom vs. SNK?
7022749	7023130	Other way around?
7023150	7023510	I don't know.
7023830	7029516	Anyway, we'll get the same HD Remix treatment as Super Puzzle Fighter and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo did before this.
7029616	7036803	As I've stated, these are still just rumors until some kind of official announcement is made one way or another, but this does give us something to possibly look forward to if proven to be true.
7037483	7038044	That would be cool.
7038684	7039085	Interesting.
7040104	7043067	Let me read this last thing, because this will be the last email here from Mailbag tonight.
7043867	7044748	Also from Spazinator.
7045068	7050733	As you probably already know, PS3 owners, at their discretion, can install another operating system on their system, usually Yellow Dog Linux.
7051093	7053015	What benefit does this ultimately give you, if any?
7053095	7054276	What's the appeal in doing this?
7054356	7058299	Does this ultimately give you open source equivalents to Microsoft's Word, Excel, and so on?
7058659	7062082	I already know I won't be able to play Linux-supported PC games due to RAM limitations.
7062122	7062662	That's a given.
7063023	7067046	Furthermore, should I decide to take the proverbial plunge, where can I buy the disc to install Linux?
7067546	7069948	You don't buy the disc, you can download it off the internet.
7070909	7072190	You can burn ISO that way.
7072510	7074851	You could buy, they have Linux that's available.
7075212	7080015	I one time bought it at Best Buy because that was back when I was on dial-up.
7080576	7087521	And if I remember correctly, I think I was doing that because of something about installing some sort of mod or something on a PlayStation 2 or something.
7087541	7088281	I don't remember what it was.
7088742	7092705	But yeah, basically you would download it off the internet.
7093632	7094613	and then burn your own disc.
7095013	7096614	Now that doesn't answer the why.
7097474	7097694	Why?
7097894	7098575	To tinker with.
7098775	7099896	That's really the only reason.
7100516	7106779	I mean, you're going to be able to basically run a few things, probably like some emulators and stuff like that.
7107140	7112002	You're not going to be able to run any big games or anything, but it's basically just to tinker with.
7112383	7116705	I'm kind of getting the impression that if you would be interested in this, you already know.
7117225	7117806	You know what I mean?
7117826	7121188	If this is something that would really interest you, you already know this would interest you, right?
7121668	7121868	Yeah.
7123252	7127375	If you're the type of person that wants to try and put Linux on a toaster and all this shit, then you already know.
7127395	7130478	And it also stops people from trying to hack the system to put Linux on it.
7131358	7132399	By just opening it up?
7132519	7133980	Yep.
7134020	7135742	And that's a really fair response.
7136082	7139464	Sony kind of bowed down to the hackers in that regard, I guess.
7139544	7139845	I don't know.
7140646	7141666	Alright, well there you have it.
7141706	7142327	That's our mailbag.
7142367	7146068	If you want to send us some more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7146188	7147309	Let's get back into some gaming news.
7147349	7148029	We have a few more.
7148489	7148750	Loki.
7149370	7150750	Yes, this was fun.
7151631	7152911	I got an email from my boss.
7154582	7155363	Ghetto Golf Happy Gilmore Friday
7174343	7177206	And the game itself, it looks very interesting.
7177707	7178588	Kind of cool, actually.
7179368	7185976	This was actually a full-fledged download for Unreal Tournament 3, and I don't think it's available yet.
7186317	7192904	But if it was, man, I would probably pick up Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 to at least install this, because you remember, they do run...
7194525	7195146	Thanks for watching!
7212225	7217288	Interesting, but no idea if there's any release, because they still need somebody to pick it up, basically, right?
7217489	7221731	Yeah, basically, it says right now, Ghetto Golf exists as an Unreal Tournament 3 mod.
7223452	7233099	Illphonic, the developer, wants a publisher to support its development into a standalone download game for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam.
7234820	7247356	But apparently you can check out the Ghetto Golf... It's GhettoGolf.ilphonic.com And you can check out the game's official website, which has nothing other than a splash screen saying coming soon.
7247997	7248197	But...
7249690	7249990	I don't know.
7250070	7255817	I would like to download this at least if it's available and try it out as a mod.
7255917	7260863	But right now, I love their website, which is awesome.
7260963	7262845	It's got three links here.
7263126	7266309	The business, upcoming shit, and contact us.
7266710	7266970	Nice.
7267571	7268172	Very professional.
7269865	7272707	By the way, Actdeft in our chatroom right now brings up a really good point.
7272747	7275529	I don't know if maybe somebody else said it, but I noticed Actdeft is posting the link.
7275950	7282335	Kind of a follow-up to the question we got in the email bag about where can I join an OL Army or how can I be part of an OLR clan.
7282656	7293525	In case you forgot, in the midst of all the avatars and all this on Xbox 360, OLR does have an official gamer pick that actually is available for download officially through Microsoft on the gamer marketplace.
7293985	7294105	It's...
7295166	7323895	and now with the whole online integration Actdeft is posting a link in chat right now you can just click on that and it will put it in your queue to download it is free and it's part of a gamer pick collection of a bunch of all games radio shows so you get like all games interactive Bobby Blackwolf and some of the other like video game outsiders and you know some of the other shows that are on the network all have a little gamer pick that you can wear with pride on your little gamer card because everybody has a freaking avatar so now it's like unique to not have an avatar you know what I mean so check that out if you would like
7324215	7324475	Demigod
7354235	7357659	And here's the thing, too, about... This was a compound problem.
7357699	7360423	Basically... Can I say this real quick, though?
7360803	7364207	They had tested this for 50,000 players at peak times.
7364588	7366870	They were not ready for this type of load.
7367591	7370294	Yeah, and it also hurt them the fact that...
7372250	7375312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7396522	7414289	but also, you know, hacker groups got a hold of the game earlier and so now less people, you know, now that it's available for download, you know, before the game actually really comes out everywhere else, you know, a lot of people just said, ah, screw it, I'm just going to go download it because I really want to play this game.
7415770	7416990	Which is too bad, but, you know.
7417010	7424373	That's a bummer because Stardock was really taking a risk by not putting copy protection on the games and to kind of have it come back and bite them in the ass kind of sucks.
7424773	7425214	You know what I mean?
7425574	7425734	Yeah.
7426377	7432582	Well, now gamers can't bitch if, you know, Star Trek's next game has some sort of DRM on it.
7433022	7436245	Well, too bad you guys didn't buy the last one, so, oh well.
7437466	7446273	Alright, so, you know, I don't know, but this whole situation just gets us a little bit angsty and just seemed like the appropriate time to drop in a regular segment we do here on the show called the FUs of the Week.
7461294	7471859	Now, DarkSakura isn't here tonight to start us off, but I'm sure if she were here, she would say something along the lines of, God, I hate traffic on the way to L.A., and there was this one driver who really pissed me off, and blah, blah, blah.
7471979	7473180	F you to stupid drivers.
7473800	7476802	I'd say F you to stupid parents, because she's at Disneyland, obviously.
7477562	7478262	That could be, too.
7479423	7480964	All right, well, Loki, what's your F you of the week?
7481504	7487627	F you to a sore throat that I have right now, because I hope I'm not getting sick, because I don't really like being sick right now.
7491387	7493147	F you to Candy for being so delicious
7512136	7513497	That was a short FU segment.
7514878	7516920	Loki, do you have some news about the PSP?
7517080	7517500	Yes, I do.
7518221	7522544	The PSP, of course, you may remember that there was an exploit that came out.
7523204	7525866	Another TIFF file overflow.
7526527	7528829	You would think that they would figure out not to do that.
7530049	7534413	Or to at least protect against that because almost every single version of the PSP has been broken that way.
7534853	7534993	PSP-3000
7556441	7585320	and they're going to be adding some features of the M33 custom firmwares and it'll allow you to boot up Homebrew regardless but may be restrictive to certain applications right now so looks like they're not coming out with a new firmware yet but they are going to be adding a program that will allow you to run Homebrew on a PSP3000 which is the first step to an actual custom firmware being installed onto this new system so it's only a matter of time
7587677	7588638	You just can't stop them.
7589780	7592163	You just can't stop those hackers from getting in the PSP.
7592183	7595947	Even when the PSP 2 comes out, I'm sorry, it's not going to be unhackable.
7595987	7598590	Even when it's all digital download?
7598771	7599271	It doesn't matter.
7599371	7600533	This is all digital file.
7601094	7602235	So, it doesn't matter.
7603527	7605228	Game Daily ran a report on this.
7605569	7610732	With a nearly two-month span of time between the accessory release and the game's arrival at retail...
7629326	7634328	We expect that Nintendo will release patches that will make the new accessory work with your already existing library.
7635029	7636710	And the first would be, of course, Wii Sports.
7637070	7644713	But Fat Chance Game Daily, according to Nintendo, quote, the Wii Motion Plus accessory is only for games that are designed to make use of its abilities.
7645154	7650856	But also something to consider, the Wii really can't patch its games, if you think about it.
7651377	7654178	It can patch the firmware, but they can't really patch the games.
7654318	7661583	Yeah, they don't have anything built in to where it will read a common area of the Broadway CPU.
7662244	7665747	A very thorough article on this, by the way, at HackMe.com, M-I-I.
7666007	7674033	Yes, and unfortunately, because of all these restrictions and stuff on where the games can read basically data from...
7676047	7679569	It would be physically impossible for them to release any patches whatsoever.
7679849	7689013	So that's how you get problems like, you know, missing switches and stuff in Tomb Raider Underworld for the Wii, and there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch their game afterwards.
7689653	7691434	Way to be forward-thinking, Nintendo.
7691454	7697457	In fact, they basically say that all in all, the Wii software stack is designed with little to no future-proofing.
7697477	7704540	There's basically zero provisions for any future updates, even obvious things like new storage devices or game patches.
7705240	7724330	What's worse, it says this will affect compatibility mode of any future Wii successor, just like the DS titles won't get any WPA support on the DSi, effectively making the DSi's WPA mode useless if you want to use DS titles online.
7725150	7729972	And it says the DS Wi-Fi drivers and configuration stack are built into every game.
7730213	7732874	Well, don't worry, that's why you'll have new new play control.
7734955	7747747	It's just, it's really sad that, you know, such a company that thinks ahead, you know, that really is innovative can be so un-innovative at the same time.
7747987	7751851	It's like they're so far ahead and they're so far behind at the same time.
7753567	7753807	Oh, wow.
7754827	7755128	All right.
7755348	7758669	We've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then, believe it or not, we're getting towards the end of this show.
7758709	7768293	We'll open up the Skype line one more time in just a minute to take all your potpourri, any thoughts you have, after a couple more stories here, and then get ready to close out the show, believe it or not.
7768633	7768813	Yes.
7769853	7778697	Well, you may remember that there was a lawsuit with the NFL players and basically EA and the NFL and all that stuff over...
7780177	7786279	Basically, they were entitled royalties for using their likenesses and stuff like that in games.
7786299	7790660	This is basically retired NFL players.
7791561	7800804	They've already received $28 million in a settlement before, but now they're going to be targeting John Madden and EA exclusively.
7801464	7804865	And apparently, I guess, you know, the...
7806778	7809941	I don't know, a whole other mess to try to get some more money.
7810221	7818527	And I mean, granted that they should be guaranteed some money for having their likenesses shown, but I don't know.
7820089	7820369	Whatever.
7821604	7822744	Money, money, money.
7823165	7823405	Yeah.
7823465	7824065	Money.
7824105	7826126	Just another Sue Happy thing?
7826166	7827826	Or do they have something legitimately to complain about?
7827846	7830067	I mean, EA is profiting off these names and everything.
7830147	7833148	According to... That's why they pay license fees, right?
7833328	7833508	Yeah.
7833528	7836209	According to Cleveland Brown's Bernie Parrish...
7839712	7850241	The retired NFL players who were used in Madden EA video games will be suing Madden and EA for using us in those games without compensating us.
7850542	7855286	We will probably not use the attorneys who obtained a $28.1 million verdict.
7858028	7864649	for us against the NFLPA for scrambling retired players' identities in those video games.
7864829	7875311	It says the jury found it a grossly fraudulent action taken so that they wouldn't have to pay retired players.
7875691	7882652	In my opinion, Madden should have been included in our licensing suit against the NFLPA and so should EA.
7883233	7885753	So basically, hey, we won against the NFLPA.
7886113	7886734	But you know what?
7886774	7889597	We think that there's some more blood to take out of them.
7889677	7892300	So we're going to try suing them as well.
7892660	7893141	Good lord.
7895274	7896075	We'll see what happens.
7896115	7897997	We'll keep you posted with any further developments.
7898857	7902981	I just have to laugh at this random comment that came up in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com.
7903561	7905503	Kurosaki87 says, OMG!
7905983	7908666	Beyonce is playing Rhythm Heaven on DS on my TV.
7908766	7910047	I actually saw that same commercial.
7910067	7912709	I don't remember what it was during, but I've seen that same thing.
7913030	7916352	So Nintendo is still using the kind of...
7917113	7919855	all female big names.
7919895	7923117	Like, you know, because Carrie Underwood was in a DS commercial before, right?
7923497	7924258	Was there somebody else?
7924338	7926760	Some other kind of chick you'd see on Lifetime?
7927680	7933304	There was... I mean, you can't say Beyonce's for women only, though, because tons of dudes think she's hot, because she is.
7933985	7934265	You know?
7935125	7935426	I don't know.
7936006	7940509	Yeah, they had a bunch of, you know, what was it?
7942130	7942791	Lisa Kudrow.
7942831	7943311	Thank you, Decipher.
7943331	7944452	Yeah, Lisa Kudrow and...
7945936	7952707	I don't remember the other ones, but yeah, it's just... I guess if a woman's playing the game, it must be okay for all women to play the game.
7953088	7954891	She's just crazy in love with the game!
7956915	7957295	Oh, boy.
7957956	7958276	All right.
7958576	7961358	One more story for you guys, and we're going to open up the Skype line.
7961378	7962318	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7962959	7966101	And this was a story that made a lot of people say Woot this week.
7966161	7973825	Of course, the popular sales site, Woot.com, which if you've never been there, that's when you can buy just a piece of random somethings for a very, very low price.
7974126	7977968	Now, oftentimes, these random somethings are refurbished or they're...
7978368	7979749	Thanks for watching!
7997336	8002820	with 20GB hard drive and HDMI, $139 plus $5 shipping.
8003160	8007903	So you could have bought a 360 with the HDMI and a 20GB hard drive, $145 shipped to your house.
8007923	8009224	That's a good deal.
8009404	8010845	That is a fucking great deal.
8011385	8012746	And it even comes with a controller.
8013887	8015488	And, yeah, they're sold out.
8015848	8019951	Now, granted, these are refurbished systems, so you have to not be bothered by that.
8019991	8026876	But, honestly, when you put that next to, what, $199 for an arcade system with no hard drive, that's a pretty great deal, I think.
8027556	8029397	So, unfortunately, they're all gone.
8029477	8030658	Sorry, guys who are listening right now.
8031038	8036102	But I did want to mention that because one interesting thing about that is I noticed the word of mouth on that one really spread.
8036502	8038163	And that sometimes happens with the Woot deals.
8038223	8043086	Like, if you don't check the site every night, then once the blogs go wild with it, then they're gone.
8043586	8053873	I saw probably like 50 tweets on my personal Twitter from people retweeting Major Nelson posting about it, which I'm sure just made it spread like wildfire when he posted it.
8055336	8055916	I'm sure he did.
8056436	8064578	Although I finally defriended Major Nelson this week, and it's nothing personal, but I defriended all the celebrities on my Twitter, because I'm just sick of the celebrity Twitter thing.
8064698	8081083	I think, god damn, one of our listeners said it best, who I follow on Twitter, I think it was Justin with some zeros, said something like, I think when Ashton Kutcher hit a million users, that was... I don't remember the exact tweet, I apologize.
8081103	8081643	He said something like...
8082843	8087825	That was the shark that we all just jumped over when he hit a million users and all that garbage was going on.
8088185	8090006	You know, like Oprah getting on Twitter too.
8090566	8093407	I mean, you know, now I'm just like, okay, this is garbage.
8093468	8102491	I feel awful because I actually followed that stupid whole Twitter to a million because I wanted to be in Sims 3.
8103071	8106673	I did to an extent too, but I instantly defriended him once it was over and I wasn't the millionth person.
8106693	8111495	I haven't done it yet just because, you know, they haven't announced who won that yet and, you know, I don't want to...
8113425	8120470	I don't want to compromise anything, but to be honest though, I understand what he was trying to do with it, but at the same time, I didn't give a shit.
8120890	8124793	It was like, oh, this is a new wave of media.
8125353	8129155	Basically, anybody can go on here and have their voice heard and stuff.
8129355	8134419	At the same time, I'm like, I don't want all you having your voice heard because I really don't give a shit what you have to say.
8135299	8137120	But at the same time, I guess you don't have to friend them.
8137140	8140783	I guess at first it felt like, ooh, I'm a little closer to these celebrities.
8140903	8143444	But they're not reading what you have to say.
8143504	8146346	Do you think Oprah gives a shit about what you just did?
8146386	8146907	You know what I mean?
8147067	8152150	Well, they don't care, but it's something like they're actually responding back to you.
8152190	8159175	Like if you Twitter Ashton Kutcher and he responds back to you, it's Ashton Kutcher responding back to you and not some PR guy.
8159255	8161817	It's basically these guys are so...
8162597	8163638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8185027	8187650	and I can barely get through because the site's just been down, down, down.
8188271	8193837	I might add more celebrities and put them on a separate filter and I guess there's plugins and stuff that'll do it but I don't know.
8193857	8198422	It's kind of like staying ahead of trends basically.
8198502	8200263	Everybody gets a MySpace page.
8200283	8201785	Twitter's going to go the way of Friendster.
8202105	8205369	They're going to be screwed because they could never keep up with the demand.
8205509	8206109	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8228638	8229398	We got a phone call.
8229418	8230498	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8230518	8230958	Who's this?
8257895	8259055	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8259075	8259416	Who's this?
8261456	8262517	Caller, if you can hear us.
8262557	8265678	Comcast is a piece of crap.
8265798	8266538	I'm sorry to hear that.
8266598	8266938	Hello.
8267359	8268799	Oh, for crying out loud.
8269119	8270860	I listened to the whole conversation.
8270880	8272200	I'm minding my own business.
8272260	8273681	I'm enjoying the conversation.
8274141	8277222	And then Comcast drops me out for that five seconds.
8277242	8278063	Oh, I'm so sorry.
8278083	8279303	You piece of crap.
8279403	8280583	Why can't you stay up?
8280884	8281744	Maybe it's our fault.
8282104	8284165	Well, they got hit with a fail whale.
8284185	8284665	What can we say?
8286066	8286866	Introduce yourself.
8287745	8289667	Hi Orange Lines Radio Land, it's Jason.
8289847	8294771	Hi Jason, one of our fearless web team people with the fabulous Dekeman.
8295372	8295832	What's on your mind?
8295852	8299255	I'm continually owned by Comcast again as it's been so often lately.
8300236	8301017	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
8302298	8312883	The quote you were looking for was, I think A plus K, Ashton Kutcher's Twitter handle, I think A plus K is the shark, and when he hit a million, we all jumped over him on water skis.
8312923	8314423	That's exactly what I was looking for.
8314443	8317384	I would have read it myself, but Twitter would not fucking load for me.
8319045	8323787	And then on an unrelated note, I said something that I think was kind of interestingly along the same line.
8324327	8329990	It's interesting that Twitter's last great hurrah was Obama's election, and now that everyone else is following suit, everyone's complaining.
8332151	8334712	It's just surprising to me that it's a problem now.
8335312	8343475	I would have thought that all of the political madness for that whole year and a half primary and election would have been where everybody started complaining.
8343555	8347157	It's a problem because Twitter can't fucking handle it.
8347277	8348677	Twitter is the new Friendster.
8348837	8352138	I swear to God, you're going to see so many similarities.
8352178	8355940	Somebody's going to take the Twitter model and they're going to do it better and they're going to be the new Facebook.
8356480	8357520	If it isn't Facebook!
8357661	8362402	If Facebook themselves does not become the new Twitter, because that's what they're trying to do with their latest update.
8364283	8370286	Everybody says that, and I guess, like I said before, I guess I just don't use it enough to really know.
8370506	8380950	I don't use Facebook as much as a lot of other people I know, and that includes people like coworkers and stuff, which I'm kind of surprised that use Facebook as much as they do.
8381170	8385112	I don't use Facebook quite... You know what I do on Facebook more than anything else?
8386564	8387464	Play Bejeweled?
8387544	8389165	Yes, I play Bejeweled Blitz.
8389745	8391186	I've seen your scores.
8391626	8393707	Yes, that is the number one thing I do on Facebook.
8393847	8394407	Seriously.
8394927	8397188	And once in a while I'll upload a picture or comment on a picture.
8398629	8401670	Upload your Hawaii pictures and all of that.
8401990	8403071	It's a great way to share pictures.
8403351	8403851	I'll say that.
8404691	8406212	Otherwise, Facebook is great for Bejeweled.
8406232	8406612	That's about it.
8408257	8409578	I don't like all the other crap on there.
8409598	8410579	There's so many applications.
8411980	8413220	Once in a while I'll take a quiz.
8413340	8413921	I don't know.
8414361	8415122	You know what I love?
8415522	8416082	LiveJournal.
8416282	8417123	I love LiveJournal.
8417203	8418764	I've loved LiveJournal for so long.
8419765	8424188	Out of all the social networking sites I've ever been on, LiveJournal was my favorite four years ago.
8424788	8429112	And you need to put your $175 permanent account to use.
8429193	8429953	Well, yeah, that.
8430073	8440203	And, well, just the fact that, you know, just all these other sites that have come into play have kind of made LiveJournal go downhill a little bit, especially Twatter has really ruined LiveJournal.
8440684	8444007	And I miss the heydays of LiveJournal.
8444087	8446870	I missed LiveJournal circa four years ago, and people have more to say on it.
8446950	8447530	But, you know.
8448311	8451073	Live Journal Now is just a repost of all your Twitter posts.
8451153	8452794	And that's not on my friends list.
8452874	8457056	I found a code that filters that shit right off of there because I'm so fucking sick of it.
8457096	8457537	You know what I mean?
8457597	8459318	I got so fucking sick of it.
8459738	8460378	Anyway, sorry.
8461019	8461619	I cut mine.
8461739	8462640	Jamie cut hers.
8463540	8473266	I don't mind the LJ Cut people, but I had people that would have like 20 pages of tweets and it's all nonsensical because it's replies to people, but when I read it on Twitter, it filters that out.
8473286	8475167	That's the thing I hate about Twitter the most.
8475247	8479050	It's like all these replies and stuff and you're trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about and it's just...
8479850	8480150	I don't know.
8480550	8486611	I understand the whole people want to archive it or all this stuff, but please go in, figure out how to change your settings.
8486811	8489712	Make them private posts if you just want to archive it.
8490652	8492492	But I just... Well, it doesn't matter.
8492532	8493212	I filtered it out.
8493313	8498113	I think LiveJournals have an easier way for just click a button and I won't see Twitter crap on my friend's page anymore.
8498133	8500034	I think that would be the greatest thing LiveJournal could do.
8500374	8502474	But they'd have to stop firing their staff in order to do that.
8502794	8504035	Hey, let's talk video games.
8504275	8506375	Jason, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?
8506955	8511083	Ryan's hovering over my shoulder and she told me she had a question, so I'm going to start with that real quick.
8511103	8511303	Sure.
8512233	8518438	So I want to know, why is it that when Jason calls through Skype, he gets through first time?
8519038	8524522	When we're driving and I'm trying to call from my phone, we can't get through at all.
8525163	8526924	I haven't the foggiest idea.
8527205	8527825	Okay, here's the thing.
8527845	8528566	I can tell you this much.
8529086	8534971	Back in the day, Skype used to, every time we'd get a call, it would open up multiple tabs for each call we were getting.
8535311	8539274	So I would see 20 tabs up on the screen, and the great thing about that is I could see who was calling in.
8539614	8563168	and this way we could share the love a little bit like if there was a person that was calling in every week I wouldn't take their call one week so that somebody else could get through that's only fair right now ever since about a year ago Skype changed something and I have combed the settings up and down this is something they did on their end where I only get one tab at a time now so whoever gets through gets through and locks everybody else out and the natural delay with the phones I can even attest to of course
8563368	8566250	If it has been somebody... Yeah, and phones just have a natural delay.
8566630	8571633	If it's somebody who's really been on the show a lot lately... Like me.
8572393	8577036	And other people are trying to get through, I'll just consistently hang up on the person so that way somebody else gets through.
8577296	8581078	I don't like to do that, but I want everybody to have a chance.
8581418	8582479	It's only fair, right?
8582619	8583519	Every gamer has a voice.
8583539	8585000	Every gamer gets the voice, exactly.
8585441	8588662	But tonight's setup has actually been very nice, having the people sprinkled out throughout the show.
8588722	8591224	I don't know if this is something we'll do long-term, but it's something we're considering.
8591684	8596127	In fact, with a third computer, dot, dot, dot, we're thinking of ideas.
8597928	8603231	So is it that it actually comes up and shows you a phone number when somebody calls from like a cell phone?
8603391	8604532	Yes, it will show me a phone number.
8604832	8608494	And I almost always take the phone numbers because they're usually new people that haven't called before.
8609115	8609575	Gotcha.
8610510	8611311	Almost always.
8612573	8615256	I don't want people thinking they can circumvent it by calling on the phone.
8615796	8620081	And then there's people like me whose ISP decides to suck and they have to go to the phone instead.
8620441	8622384	I don't want people thinking I pick and choose.
8622644	8628150	I don't, but if a person was on the last three weeks in a row, I try not to take their call a fourth week.
8628250	8628671	You know what I mean?
8630034	8631175	So, just to share.
8631215	8635639	Assuming the traffic's coming in to warrant the need to ignore them in favor of somebody else.
8635739	8636359	Exactly, exactly.
8636379	8638060	But if it's a slow night, we'll hear from anybody.
8639221	8642144	Alright, well, Jason, speaking of which, I want to share the love and let some more people call in.
8642184	8643445	Thank you so much for your call, though, as always.
8643985	8645907	Wow, she completely took my question away.
8646027	8647188	Oh, no, okay, Jason, quickly.
8647268	8648008	Please, please, go ahead.
8648069	8650070	We gotta sidetrack with Twitter talk.
8650090	8650390	Go ahead.
8651832	8652732	Yeah, blame Twitter.
8652832	8654294	Twitter's the cause of all of our problems.
8654314	8655454	Twitter and Comcast.
8657048	8676867	and of course now that we've had this whole tangent I completely forgot all of my details somebody in chat earlier we were talking about all the Nintendo all of the Nintendo update stuff this that and the other and then somebody in chat talked about Nintendo where games go to die that rang really true right now because I really want to play Fatal Frame 4
8678192	8680957	I really want to see what they did with that game.
8682039	8686687	But the problem is, apparently, if you did see it in the news, they're not going to bring it to our region.
8686828	8691075	Or at least that they haven't announced it yet and they're saving it for E3 because they have to have something announced at E3.
8692063	8697666	Yeah... The whole licensing snafu like that thing seems kind of weird for something as simple as that.
8697686	8698607	I don't think it's licensing at all.
8698647	8700107	I think it's like, okay, look at this.
8700167	8701148	It's a game that's done.
8701308	8703309	All they have to do is localize.
8703990	8705710	Of course they want the easy way out.
8705971	8707932	That's what Nintendo does is the easy way out.
8708012	8709893	That's all they do nowadays.
8710333	8715096	So if there's a game that people want a lot, you know, maybe Mother of Three, of course, but...
8716531	8723655	That's a different reason altogether, but still, I have a feeling that they could be announcing this at E3 because they're like, hey, look, see, core game.
8724676	8725216	That'd be nice.
8725517	8728699	I would be so pleased if it were, especially if I was there.
8729259	8732681	But then again, Nintendo likes to disappoint as well, so it's hard to say.
8733982	8734442	Well put.
8735142	8741726	And a small plug, there is a Facebook group trying to get emails to Nintendo to try to get it localized.
8742067	8744048	We've been going on the scorns of social media.
8744088	8745849	We need not your Facebook chatter here.
8746417	8747838	Oh, what the hell, let her give it out.
8747878	8750239	Don't do emails, do actual letters.
8751680	8751860	Yeah.
8752160	8753221	Because that would be more effective.
8755722	8762546	Yes, that's been, other than that, I admit in very, I admit the sadness that I finally broke down and bought Peggle.
8763947	8766568	So I was through a lot of that last night.
8766588	8769770	Alright, we'll have to have a Peggle party at some point, Jason.
8769790	8774333	Alright, I really do have to let you go now, though, to get some other callers, but thank you and Rye as well for calling in, okay?
8775000	8775160	Yes.
8775300	8775760	Have a good night, guys.
8775780	8777101	Have a good one, buddy.
8777141	8778902	Just a note to the Justin TV folks.
8779442	8781203	Our phone calls don't go through to Justin TV.
8781243	8781864	I don't know why.
8782824	8783425	That's weird.
8784265	8785766	Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.
8785786	8787487	Just remember, it's a simulcast, guys.
8787687	8789048	We actually tape on allgames.com.
8789068	8798713	They should be, unless it's... See, the problem is, I think it's mono, and I think it's coming in on one side or the other, and I don't know which side, so I tried flipping it, but if it's... I could try flipping it again.
8798933	8799533	Don't worry about it.
8799553	8799773	Don't worry.
8799793	8802855	I mean, honestly, Justin TV is not the focus.
8802975	8803355	I know.
8803435	8804256	They think they are.
8804276	8804556	But it's...
8804756	8805216	Sailor Moon
8834498	8836680	What did you want to talk about with Sailor Moon?
8838081	8850011	Yeah, it's, you know, it was actually kind of like one of those crossovers between like Harry Potter meets the Power Rangers, how my friends kind of put it, sort of.
8850651	8853554	But do you think the storyline behind that would make a good game?
8854662	8856183	Do they have Sailor Moon games?
8856303	8858384	They've had multiple Sailor Moon games in Japan.
8858404	8860665	But none that have been brought over here, right?
8861325	8863686	No, I think they have had Sailor Moon games come out over here.
8863726	8867168	But the thing is, it's not a popular franchise anymore.
8867208	8871390	It's just like for some reason when Eidos thought it was a great idea to put out, was it Wacky Races?
8872031	8875312	The cartoon series that ran in the 80s and originally came from the 60s.
8875552	8876773	I mean, come on.
8878977	8886363	I would support a Sailor Moon game if it was the live-action Sailor Moon, because when the cat is actually a stuffed cat, that's pretty amazing.
8886723	8891407	So maybe we could get some old-school Sega CD-style live-action Sailor Moon games.
8891467	8892147	I would support this.
8893729	8903757	Yes, so would I. And, you know, besides that, I've been hearing a whole lot about that Rackman unplugged for PFT.
8904077	8906659	Now, the question is, will it have download content?
8907239	8907900	If it does...
8909150	8915133	I'm almost thinking of forging for that 32 gigabyte memory stick, which is probably going to drop me 600 bucks.
8915333	8918395	It will have a Rock Band store, so yeah, there will be download content for sure.
8918435	8922316	There definitely will be download content, but you probably won't need to drive that big.
8922376	8924918	I mean, I don't download every song that comes out on Rock Band.
8925338	8926919	That would be a little bit much, don't you think?
8930140	8934903	Probably, but then again, there's a lot of good songs from a certain artist I like.
8935423	8937824	I'd probably get their whole album if it's on there.
8939123	8950688	Because I'm already ticked off that Nintendo is kind of shafted for the Metallica content for Guitar Hero.
8951008	8965495	Because us Wii owners, we only get three tracks from the Death Magnetic album while you three 16 PS3 owners, not hating here, but you guys are getting the full albums while us Wii owners here are getting shafted, sort of.
8966633	8968534	for the Guitar Hero Metallica content.
8969134	8969995	That does suck.
8970055	8978999	That's why the Wii should... Honestly, part of me thinks the Wii shouldn't even have Rock Band and Guitar Hero because you're not really getting the same game.
8979039	8981660	But at the same time, you all know what you're getting into with the Wii.
8982100	8988283	But the Wii does not have the power of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
8988323	8990564	And when I say power, I mean storage space as well.
8990604	8991045	You know what I mean?
8992645	8995387	Yeah, even though I have an extra 2GB
8997576	9004280	Micro SD that can transfer into a normal SD card, which I'd really love to fill up with other stuff.
9004320	9013304	I mean, I always figured I had to get my virtual console tiles and everything onto there, which you can copy from... I figured I had to do it from the Wii memory.
9014105	9015105	Finally figured that out.
9016086	9019007	But it's a pain in the butt, though.
9020008	9021248	But isn't Wii Fit awesome?
9023859	9026420	Uh, Wii Fit stinks.
9026441	9029602	I only played it once, never played it again.
9029842	9031003	Well, one more thing before I let you guys go.
9031023	9031743	One of my favorite in my lines.
9049844	9052627	Moon, Prism, Power, and Rock On.
9052948	9054089	Keep the good shows, guys.
9054169	9054750	Thank you.
9054790	9055310	Take care.
9057252	9057473	Wow.
9058092	9059914	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9059934	9064999	We're going to close up shop on the Skype line so that we can get through some last minute stories and get to the end of the show.
9065059	9067000	God, this boss is so cheap.
9067161	9068482	It keeps tossing me in the air.
9068922	9070063	Is this further than you got last time?
9070544	9071705	It's the same place I got last time.
9072045	9074808	You know, it's probably one of those things where it's giving you hints, too, but they're all in Japanese.
9074828	9075849	No, it's not giving me hints at all.
9075869	9076830	It's just cheap.
9077090	9079592	I heard someone else that was talking about the demo.
9079612	9080733	They got tossed in the air 26 times.
9080773	9080954	Fine.
9082595	9083736	It's just being cheap.
9084536	9086798	Hey, that's why it's a demo, so they can fix that crap.
9088699	9096764	So anyway, some stuff we didn't talk about here, but the ESRB has raided Ghostbusters and two other Atari DS titles for the DSi.
9097365	9100927	Now, you may think, oh, well, that's not that big deal, because if you think about it,
9102782	9104103	DS games play on the DSi.
9104183	9111046	Well, it is a big deal because DSi games are only for the DSi.
9111226	9116769	Basically, they're DSiWare or DSi special enhanced versions of the game.
9117189	9122912	So, those three games, Ghostbusters, N+, and The Chase, Felix, Meet Felicity, the thought is...
9123820	9132625	Perhaps Nintendo is going to start allowing publishers to put up full copies of their games on the DSiWare store to download.
9132905	9143551	And to be honest, as a person that has downloaded his fair share of games for the DS and ROM form to play on, you know, things that allow that sort of thing, they aren't that big.
9143711	9145773	So I could see something like this happening.
9147310	9147931	Interesting.
9147951	9153422	And it says, you know, Atari, of course, has responded back saying, unfortunately, no official word from Atari.
9153442	9155125	We'll let this stay a rumor for now.
9155626	9157891	So announcement at E3, basically.
9160199	9167103	There's going to be a new Shining Force game coming out from Sega, although you may not guess what platform it's actually coming out on.
9167343	9169024	It's actually being brought to the arcade.
9169864	9172426	Shining Force Cross is the brand new game.
9172486	9178809	It is going to be an RPG-oriented game, but it is more a turn-based strategy, I guess.
9181010	9181531	It's weird, though.
9181551	9187494	It's actually played on cabinets linked via Sega's all.net platform.
9188314	9188454	And...
9190378	9192613	Apparently it's only in Japan, so that kind of sucks.
9193980	9204423	Um, then also, uh, the first round of songs picked for, um, Guitar Hero Smash Hits have been announced, and these were all based on, uh, people's votes, um, the first round that they've had.
9204603	9206064	Can I just say, though, who cares?
9206144	9206744	Fuck this game.
9206984	9209145	I mean, this is just the further milking of the franchise.
9209245	9213186	Not, I'm not saying that to you personally, Loki, but just, when I read the story, I just rolled my eyes.
9213246	9221369	I was like, God, I understand, you know, these games, these songs are being re-released with the full band and what have you, but my God, it's just like...
9222689	9223990	Can you hear them money sucking?
9224090	9225510	Just the masses.
9226350	9227831	This is going to kill music games right here.
9228811	9230251	But if you want to know, here you go.
9230612	9232612	Yeah, and they're all from Guitar Hero 1.
9233212	9235353	Pantera's Cowboys from Hell, the live version.
9235693	9238934	Franz Ferdinand, Take Me Out, Queens of the Stone Age, No One Knows.
9239514	9241855	Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, I Love Rock and Roll.
9241975	9243355	Boston, More Than a Feelin'.
9243756	9245796	White Zombie, Thunderkiss 65.
9246056	9247617	Blue Acer Cult, Godzilla.
9248037	9249998	Helmet, Unsung, the live version.
9250258	9251258	Queen, Killer Queen.
9252018	9273026	Incubus, Stellar, Ozzy Osbourne, Bark at the Moon, Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water The Donnas, Take It Off, and the Xyz, Hey You and of course this game is coming out in June and yeah it is kind of a milk in the franchise and then let's see here and that's all I've got right now
9274494	9277476	ExciteBots, Trick Racing, Hell Yeah Candy, More Candy, Need More Candy
9301974	9302695	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9320573	9322274	You know, just tell two friends about the show.
9322334	9322975	It's word of mouth.
9323015	9324216	Word of mouth helps get it out there.
9324636	9326237	That's all we've ever asked for the past few years.
9326277	9327258	So just help us spread the word.
9327298	9328298	Tell two people about the show.
9328719	9330160	Leave us nice reviews on iTunes.
9331360	9333922	I saw a MySpace bulletin of somebody advertising the show earlier.
9333942	9334763	I thought that was really cool.
9335543	9337404	So, you know, stuff like that really means a lot to us.
9337484	9338265	Really appreciate that.
9338745	9339486	Thank you guys so much.
9339966	9341227	And we'll see you again next week.
9341627	9342508	DarkSakura will be back.
9342548	9343548	We'll have more to talk about.
9343949	9345630	Loki might have another game to look at here.
9346090	9349532	Maybe he can pry Excitebots away from the wife long enough to a show here on JustinTV.
9349933	9350253	We'll see.
9351294	9353257	But we'll do it all again next week here on Orange Launch Radio.
9353297	9354218	Thanks you guys for tuning in.
9354238	9354899	We'll see you next week.
9355680	9356240	See you next week!
9386712	9387876	Thanks for watching!
