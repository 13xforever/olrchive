0	20200	Today, April 19th, 2009, a new PSP game is set to be released with no UMDs.
20200	24320	Karaoke Revolution looks to be getting a reboot, but what is the hidden bonus feature in the
24320	29760	PC version of Braid?
29760	35280	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35280	36280	Radio.
36280	40480	Yes, we are back, and here to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video
40480	43680	gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43680	48960	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining you every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
48960	52480	Not with us tonight, unfortunately, is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52480	56120	It's her birthday today, and she's celebrating her birthday at Disneyland, because you know
56120	59440	they have that whole get in free for your birthday thing going on.
59440	62320	Joining us, though, of course, as always, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
62320	63320	Hello.
63320	64320	How you doing, Loki?
64320	65320	Good.
65320	66320	All right.
66320	68120	Before anybody asks, yes, we have a new video card, okay?
68120	69360	We're taking care of it.
69360	70800	Old video card, yes.
70800	74580	We'll talk about it a little more during the housekeeping segment tonight, but we're excited
74580	78840	here because in studio right now, we're playing the Final Fantasy 13 demo, and actually streaming
78840	79840	it on Justin TV.
79840	81600	And yes, I know we're not the first to do it.
81600	84640	You know, I feel like there's some people out there, like, that were in the main all
84640	87520	games chat room earlier doing the whole, Samsons did it, thing.
87520	88520	You know what I mean?
88520	89520	Okay, we get it.
89520	91920	But, like, you know what?
91920	95480	You know, and this may not be as big for you guys, but for me, like, it's one thing to
95480	99980	watch it on YouTube and watch somebody else play it on Justin TV, but to, like, actually
99980	103080	see it on my little TV here in the garage is, like, wow.
103080	104080	Wow, that looks nice.
104080	105080	Wow.
105080	108200	Because, like, you know, it's not pixelated at all or anything like that, so it's pretty
108200	109200	nice.
109200	111920	So if you haven't seen it at all for whatever reason yet, you can check out our Justin TV
111920	113440	channel while we're live.
113440	117020	If you are listening on podcast, hopefully there's some archived footage over there on
117020	118880	Justin TV that you can look at.
118880	119880	Yeah.
119880	123320	So, Loki, tell us about a little bit how you got this demo and how you ordered it and all
123320	124320	that, and why you did it.
124320	130120	I just imported the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, the Final Fantasy XIII
130120	136720	trial version, and I did it because, one, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII, and honestly,
136720	141280	this is probably the only way I could play it for, you know, a year until it comes out.
141280	144720	You know, I'm assuming spring 2010 for us.
144720	149280	And also, because I like Advent Children a lot, and I wanted to see the movie, you know,
149280	153480	all high def with, you know, extra scenes, so it's a win-win.
153480	157680	And because, you know, PlayStation 3 games are region-free, and because the Blu-ray movie
157680	162360	is the same region for both- You know, it just wouldn't be OLR without
162360	163360	tech problems.
163360	164360	Sorry.
164360	165360	Yeah.
165360	168920	So it's the same region, you know, for Japan and US, you know, why not?
168920	174120	And plus, the movie itself actually has the English dub track in it, so...
174120	175440	It works.
175440	176440	And it's pretty awesome.
176440	180720	I actually watched more of the movie than I have played of the demo, so I've only played
180720	182520	about 10 minutes of the demo right now.
182520	183520	And so far?
183520	184520	So far.
184520	185520	You like it?
185520	186520	Yeah, it's gonna be good.
186520	188080	I mean, it's got a lot in common with Final Fantasy VII.
188080	194600	Starts off with the train, sort of futuristic, you know, there's, you know, a lot of battle
194600	195600	stuff going on.
195600	197160	I don't know, it just feels very VII-ish.
197160	200960	But which, well, which Final Fantasy game have they been able to hoard unlike any other?
200960	201960	VII.
201960	202960	Exactly.
202960	203960	Yeah, and they're gonna hoard this like crazy.
203960	207960	But you know what though, it's without a doubt gonna be the best RPG that's ever gonna grace
207960	210320	the PlayStation 3 and the 360.
210320	214000	That's, without a doubt, it's gonna be the one that's gonna be on these systems.
214000	217720	Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the PS3, I can guarantee it.
217720	218720	Huh.
218720	221760	Well, it'll probably be on, I mean, because they're gonna hoard, you know, XIII out for
221760	222760	a while.
222760	223760	They've got like three, two versions.
223760	225040	With Versus and everything?
225040	228040	There's still Versus, and then all the other ones they're gonna put out.
228040	231520	XIV probably won't be out for a long time, and by that time there'll be probably a new
231520	232520	system.
232520	234280	XIII won't be another MMO.
234280	235280	Like XI was.
235280	238520	No, I don't think it'll be part of the series if that's the case.
238520	239520	Who knows?
239520	240520	Speculate, speculate, speculate.
240520	242520	But we gotta get XIII out first.
242520	246160	It's been years in the making, but I'll tell you what, just from the little bits and pieces
246160	247160	I'm seeing.
247160	252960	And this is old, I mean, this footage, or the game itself, this is all back from December
252960	256260	2008, is, you know, how far along it was.
256260	261520	So now, it's not even gonna resemble this by the time, it was kinda like, you know,
261520	265600	the VIII demo, you know, because the VIII demo came out way early, and then, you know,
265600	269040	VIII came out, and it was, you know, quite a bit different, so.
269040	272760	Well, Loki's gonna do his best to kinda go back and forth from actually playing the demo
272760	274480	to doing what he needs to do on the show.
274480	278480	It's gonna be very difficult tonight, because Dark Sakura's not here, so it's just Loki
278480	282240	and I here to cover the news tonight, but he'll play the game as much as he can.
282240	285960	But if we have stragglers come into the Justin TV room that aren't really familiar with this
285960	288480	show, if our regular listeners would help them understand.
288480	291720	Yeah, haven't figured out what we wanna do with audio, if we wanna do half Final Fantasy
291720	296040	13, half us talking, you know, because we can only, you know, do one channel at a time,
296040	297040	or whatever.
297040	298040	Probably half and half is good.
298040	299040	Half and half?
299040	300040	Half and half is good.
300040	301040	Alright.
301040	302040	Alright.
302040	303040	And then...
303040	304040	Yeah, I mean, that's it.
304040	308680	I mean, the movie itself looks awesome, and the HD, oh, it's sweet.
308680	311600	Well, what else has been going on in your gaming week, Loki?
311600	312600	What other stuff have you been playing?
312600	316560	I finished Grand Theft Auto Lost in the Damned.
316560	318680	I was playing that online a bit.
318680	321760	There's actually a lot of people cheating out there, you know, apparently I'm not the
321760	327100	only one that knows how to modify the 360 version, and a lot of people just don't seem
327100	333280	to care about being very obvious with it, so whatever, you know, that's fine.
333280	338240	And then, I've been playing, I'm trying to think of what else I was playing here.
338240	344920	I tried, what was it, I downloaded the demo for Outrun, but I haven't gotten a chance
344920	346720	to play that yet.
346720	350200	I was actually looking at some of the, like, XNA games that they had on there, the community
350200	354960	stuff, and there was not a lot that I'm interested in, but there's a few that I was gonna try.
354960	357480	I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet.
357480	366240	I did on the DS, I tried giving Bob's game another try, and no, it still sucks really
366240	367240	bad.
367240	371040	In fact, it sucks even more than the last time I played it, and it's just so poorly
371040	372040	put together.
372040	373040	That's it.
373040	382080	And I tried a little bit of, what was it, Trackmania DS, and that was fun.
382080	385000	And you know, last week we played Muramasa, the DM Blade.
385000	389040	You know, that game actually, I'm thinking I'm not gonna pick it up, you know, when it
389040	390640	comes out in the US.
390640	395200	It's just not, I don't know, it, not quite how I pictured it.
395200	397200	Wasn't that what we were looking at last week at the board show?
397200	398640	Yeah, but it was the Japanese one.
398640	401120	I mean, usually I'll pick it up when they come over here.
401120	407200	But you know, not really, it looks good, but it's just not something I can see myself putting
407200	411280	a lot of time into.
411280	415160	Then I'm trying to think of what else I played.
415160	416240	That's pretty much it right now.
416240	417240	I have just a lot of stuff.
417240	422440	I got into the Fat Princess Beta, which if we have time, I may show some of that.
422440	425240	I don't even know if that plays offline or not.
425240	428120	I haven't got a chance to play it yet, just downloaded it.
428120	433600	And then, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it for right now for games.
433600	434600	It's just been busy.
434600	435600	Alright, sounds good.
435600	438960	Why don't you unpause the demo and let the folks see a little more of it while we're
438960	439960	gonna hook up the audio again.
439960	440960	Okay, sounds good.
440960	443240	And I'm gonna talk a little bit about my gaming week and we're gonna do something a little
443240	447400	different tonight because it's just Loki and I, just the two of us, us two here holding
447400	448400	down the fort.
448400	449760	We're actually gonna do something different tonight.
449760	452000	We're gonna let our Skype line be open all night long.
452000	455480	Usually we only will take Skype calls at the end of the show, but tonight you guys are
455480	457640	truly in the passenger seat.
457640	461640	You will be able to call in and if you wanna, you know, the nice thing about this is that,
461640	465760	you know, I guess one thing we can say we do differently is that if you wanna call in
465760	470280	and see Loki do something in the demo, you can actually call in and he'll do whatever
470280	471280	I guess you wanna do.
471280	473000	Like if there's a menu you wanna look at or what have you.
473000	474960	I don't know, for what it's worth.
474960	476960	But also we want you guys to participate in the show tonight.
476960	480880	So we're gonna actually invite a listener to call in and tell us how your gaming week
480880	481880	was.
481880	483800	So I put the number there in chat, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
483800	490080	In the meantime, my gaming week, actually not totally eventful.
490080	492080	I'm still on my Wii Fit plan.
492080	495760	It's been two weeks since I started actually taking Wii Fit seriously and I'm trying to
495760	497680	get in as much of it as I can every day.
497680	500880	I did go through like a two or three day streak where I didn't play, you know, at all just
500880	501880	cause I had other stuff going on.
501880	507080	But I've been trying to get in a good 15, 30, one day I got like 45 minutes in on Wii
507080	508080	Fit.
508080	512140	So I'm gonna keep trying to do that on Wii Fit and hopefully get to my goal weight of
512140	514140	losing I think like four pounds or so.
514140	518280	But in the meantime, I lost a whole pound in the past two weeks on Wii Fit.
518280	519280	Woo hoo!
519280	520280	And a little DDR.
520280	523980	Also, I played a little bit of World of Warcraft and checked out the new patch.
523980	525480	I'll tell you more about that in just a minute.
525480	526480	But we got a call on the line.
526480	527480	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.
527480	528480	Who's this?
528480	530480	This is Leo Shen.
530480	532480	Hey, Leo Shen.
532480	534600	How you doing, Leo Shen?
534600	536360	I'm doing fine yourself.
536360	537360	Good!
537360	541360	Now this is, I believe this may be the first time in OLR history where we have invited
541360	544000	this open to the listeners to tell us about your gaming week.
544000	547600	So Leo Shen, be the first listener and tell us what kind of games you've been playing
547600	548600	this week.
548600	552760	Well, I played a little bit of Arcana Heart 2.
552760	555640	I tried to give it another shot on the PS2.
555640	559120	It's a piece of shit.
559120	562520	Now Arcana Heart, is that the all chick fighting game?
562520	564720	That's the all girl fighting game.
564720	568480	Now I remember, I think you were in chat last week during the Bork show and you were telling
568480	572400	people that this game was shit and you were not a big fan of it.
572400	575000	I seem to remember the first one had such a big cult following.
575000	579320	Why is this one not as good as the first one?
579320	583920	It's got major slowdown and it was a pretty bad port.
583920	585260	Really?
585260	586560	It's a port of an arcade version?
586560	589040	Yes, it is.
589040	590040	Interesting.
590040	591040	Hmm.
591040	592040	So it's just a bad port.
592040	593040	What is it?
593040	594040	Pixelated?
594040	595040	Does it run crappy?
595040	596040	Is it just not fun?
596040	598880	If you can put your finger on what it is, what is it?
598880	606040	Um, let's see, whenever, okay, all the old characters are fine, but when you try to use
606040	612840	the new characters, their frame rate slows down majorly and it pretty much makes the
612840	617720	game, like, you can play it, but it's just not fun waiting for it.
617720	618720	Hmm.
618720	621200	I'm looking in chat and the hitstun agrees with you.
621200	623680	The PlayStation 2 port of Arcana Heart 2 is awful.
623680	627200	No, I guess that means there's probably not going to be an Arcana Heart 3.
627200	632120	If it was in the arcade and on PS3, maybe.
632120	633120	Maybe.
633120	635360	Anything else you've been playing this week?
635360	640160	Actually, I've been playing a lot of Street Fighter IV because I just received my tournament
640160	643280	edition Mad Cat stick.
643280	645920	How does it play with the new stick?
645920	647920	It plays amazing with the stick.
647920	648920	Nice.
648920	651680	How much of an investment was that for you?
651680	660840	Well, I play a lot of fighters and I'm thinking that this could serve me well in BlazBlue,
660840	667000	King of Fighters XII, and Tekken 6, so I picked it up.
667000	668000	Very cool.
668000	671520	Wow, so you're very busy with fighting games.
671520	674960	Is that like your primary genre of games you enjoy?
674960	680280	Well, um, not a, I play all sorts.
680280	685760	Personally I've been playing a lot of Eroge, which is Japanese pornography games, so they're
685760	686760	fun.
686760	687760	Nice.
687760	688760	Sounds like fun.
688760	689760	Are you a role-playing game fan?
689760	691720	Are you excited about Final Fantasy XIII?
691720	692720	No.
692720	693720	No.
693720	700360	Alright, well then, I guess I'm not going to ask you about the, wait, but you did like
700360	702200	Lost Odyssey?
702200	704000	I'm liking Lost Odyssey a lot.
704000	708000	Well, it's Final Fantasy-ish, but, you know, Final Fantasy is not for everyone.
708000	710000	I don't like Final Fantasy at all.
710000	711000	Alright.
711000	712000	That's fair.
712000	713000	That's fair.
713000	714000	Alright, well we're going to let you go so we can finish up our gaming weeks and get
714000	715000	into the news.
715000	716000	But have a good one, buddy.
716000	717000	Thanks for calling.
717000	718000	No problem.
718000	719000	You too.
719000	720000	Alright.
720000	721000	Enjoy those fighting games.
721000	723880	And now, I'm actually, I'm a little bit distracted by this Final Fantasy XIII demo, so what is
723880	724880	this?
724880	725880	This is that one new character that was announced.
725880	727680	Yeah, and he has a chocobo that lives in his afro.
727680	730640	The little chocobo that lives in the dude's afro and he just kind of like let it go.
730640	734120	But I'm looking, I'm watching this, it's like, this is all like the in-game engine, isn't
734120	735120	it?
735120	736120	Yeah.
736120	737120	Oh my gosh.
737120	738120	Wow.
738120	739120	That looks nice.
739120	740120	Alright, well we're going to let you go then, so why not?
740120	741120	We'll take this call.
741120	742120	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
742120	743120	Who's this?
743120	744120	It's GS68.
744120	745120	Hey, GS68.
745120	746120	How you doing?
746120	747120	I'm okay.
747120	748120	Uh, what's on your mind?
748120	749120	How was your gaming week?
749120	750120	My gaming was alright.
750120	766580	I played Star Soldier R and um, the
766580	773580	game was pretty good, so I played a little bit of Para Para Paradise, which is kind of
773580	774580	like a mix.
774580	775580	Wow, so you've had a pretty busy week.
775580	776580	So even after all these years, you're still playing Para Para Paradise.
776580	777580	Um, yeah, whenever I get a Milpitas golf plan.
777580	780620	Like on Friday, I had a male friend and a female friend with me and they encouraged me
780620	783900	to play, so I played around.
783900	785660	Why do you think that series ended up dying?
785660	788460	For those who don't know, Para Para Paradise, I guess you could say it's like DDR with your
788460	789860	hands for those who don't know.
789860	790860	Yeah, basically.
790860	795780	But there's this whole like, it's that mixed with country line dancing, except it's not
795780	797580	country, it's techno music.
797580	802740	Like that's the best way I can explain Para Para to those who have no idea what it is.
802740	807740	Yeah, one thing is, especially, two things I really like about why like it's easier to
807740	811500	maintain the machines because instead of stepping on pads, you just move your hand center sensors
811500	814980	so you're not wearing out the sensors.
814980	819980	And then also it, not only is it easier to freestyle, but the game actually encourages
819980	822240	you to freestyle.
822240	825740	We had a guy locally used to play Para Para Paradise, so it was very good at the freestyle
825740	829580	but he didn't do like the Para girl type moves.
829580	831820	He did this weird rave dancing thing.
831820	834640	Do you remember that guy with the little hat and everything?
834640	835640	He was really good at that stuff.
835640	836640	He would do breakdancing stuff.
836640	838380	Yeah, he'd do like breakdancing to Para Para Paradise.
838380	842540	I'm like, that's Para freestyle to me, you know, like, it was pretty cool.
842540	846220	Because you know, I think Para kind of got teased a little bit over here because it's
846220	849780	such a girl game or what have you, but you know, it's fun.
849780	850780	Fuck it.
850780	855300	I remember myself as more manly for playing that game.
855300	859420	I mean, because, you know, most men would not bother with that game.
859420	862860	That's just interesting, the cultural differences from there to here, so.
862860	863860	Alright.
863860	864860	I know, well.
864860	867420	Well, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
867420	872740	Yeah, I gave, yeah, I got Bear, I played the Bear Knuckle 3, the Japanese version of Street
872740	878740	Jump Rage 3 with the English patch, so it was much more comprehensive, and I actually
878740	883060	get to play on the real normal difficulty instead of the American normal that's really
883060	884540	Japanese hard BS.
884540	885540	Hmm.
885540	890100	So, so, wait, then Japanese normal is like easy mode.
890100	895340	Yeah, there are a lot of changes to the American version, like, all the difficulties got bumped
895340	901380	up by one, for example, on the US version, easy is the equivalent of normal on Japanese
901380	908900	version, and what really sucks about it is that if you play on easy on the US version,
908900	914660	the game ends on stage 5 with a bad ending, which I think is retarded.
914660	920220	Alright, well, excuse me, I just coughed, sorry to hear about the bad, ahh, sorry to
920220	924060	hear about the bad ending, my god, if not, if it's not the computer breaking, it's me
924060	928100	breaking here at OLR, alright, sorry, anyway, sorry to hear about the bad ending of the
928100	930900	game, we're going to get back to our gaming weeks, but thanks for the call, buddy, have
930900	931900	a good one.
931900	932900	Alright.
932900	934860	And keep dancing the Para Para no matter what anyone else says.
934860	935860	Alright.
935860	936860	Alright.
936860	937860	Bye.
937860	940700	Alright, we're going to close off the Skyblind for just a little bit so I can finish my gaming
940700	941700	week.
941700	944780	World of Warcraft got a new patch this week, the 3.1 patch, which I checked out and played
944780	948940	with a little bit, there's a couple new upgrades in this, one of the new upgrades is Uldular,
948940	952820	which is a new endgame raid that they have in the game, which, you know, is really for
952820	956620	the high end players that have finished Karazhan, finished Eye of Eternity, which actually is
956620	960860	me, I would fit into that category, but since I was gone for so long, I haven't really been
960860	964500	in the group of players to go in there yet, also, they like to raid on like Friday and
964500	967940	Saturday nights, so I'm like, dude, those are the two nights I don't want to raid, those
967940	969900	are the nights I want to go out and have fun, because it's Friday and Saturday nights, it's
969900	970900	the weekend.
970900	975220	So, yeah, I just really haven't gotten around to raiding the new content yet, but I did
975220	978300	check out some of the other new features they have, such as the Argent Tournament is one
978300	982500	of the new things they have, which is basically like a joust-like game, a jousting-like game,
982500	985640	I shouldn't say joust-like game because I didn't think of the old Atari 2600, but a
985640	991820	jousting-like minigame that they've put into WoW, which is decent, but it's very buggy
991820	996140	right now, and it's having a lot of lag and bug issues, and some of the WoW and Blizzard
996140	1000020	folks have been taking a lot of heat from the fans for not testing this patch thoroughly
1000020	1003260	enough because they're having a lot of problems on the main server.
1003260	1006060	People have been getting stranded in the Ulduar dungeons where they've been locked out of
1006060	1009820	their characters, you know, people have been having problems, I was having problems today
1009820	1013780	with the jousting in Argon Tournament, you're supposed to do like, you want to collect five
1013780	1018060	emblems every day, and that's the most you can collect, and then you can advance quicker
1018060	1020820	through the levels, so I'm trying to collect my five every day, and while I was trying
1020820	1025660	to do my fights to get one of the emblems, the game was just, like, I was losing when
1025660	1030100	it was halfway through the fight, so it was kind of buggy, so that was disappointing a
1030100	1034440	little bit, you know, but you kind of cut your losses in that way, Blizzard's pretty
1034440	1038160	good about compensating people for time, they already comped everybody a free day because
1038160	1044380	patch day was so borked in, you know, everything that was going on, so, you know, this is just
1044380	1047700	kind of par for the course with MMOs, but damn, you have your rabid fans who just get
1047700	1051020	pissed every time they roll out some new patch and something's broken, they're like, I can't
1051020	1055340	believe these people, blah blah blah blah, it's just kind of like, jeez, you know, go
1055340	1060020	outside then, it's gonna bother you that much, so, so you've been playing the Final Fantasy
1060020	1064580	XIII demo, I've been talking to some people, and I'm just still impressed how the, this
1064580	1067900	is all kind of the in-game engine, looking at this, but I haven't gotten to see a lot
1067900	1073220	of battles, but how is the battle system? It's pretty cool, basically, so like, there's
1073220	1077620	a battle system, it's transitioned into this, you have a little bar that's like your AP
1077620	1081660	bar or whatever, and you can pick attacks and they have different, like, you know, lengths,
1081660	1086740	so this one attack will do, you know, one, I can do three normal attacks, and it'll do
1086740	1093900	just kind of like a little hack and slash thing, or, for example, I can do, uh, Viagra,
1093900	1098420	which will do all three, and then that attacks everything.
1098420	1102620	Huh, now how do you, how do you know, how are you understanding the Japanese in this?
1102620	1105700	You don't know Japanese, do you? No, it's just trial and error.
1105700	1109020	Trial and error, I guess that works. Yeah, especially if you're trying to find
1109020	1114780	a cure spell, it's like, uh, where is that? I'm like, uh, maybe it's this menu. One of
1114780	1119260	these other menus, I think it's, if I remember correctly, I think that's attack, skill, and
1119260	1123580	I think that's, uh, white magic, maybe. You can probably guess it's very similar to
1123580	1126540	the layout of most other Final Fantasy games, too, like your top command's always gonna
1126540	1128600	be attack. Yeah, I mean, you can just do, like, three
1128600	1132780	different things. See, I don't even know what I just did there, but.
1132780	1136340	So it's interesting, because having played a lot of Final Fantasy XII, I'm, I'm kind
1136340	1141260	of, it looks like, in a way, they've taken a step back to not even XI, because XI was
1141260	1145580	so different, but X, this is more like Final Fantasy X's battles, but with a little bit
1145580	1146580	of that. Um, no, I think it's supposed to be, like,
1146580	1151180	XII, because you can actually avoid battles, you just have to, you know, not walk into
1151180	1153820	the creature. So it's kind of a hybrid of X and XII.
1153820	1156660	Something like that, I guess. Strange. Very strange.
1156660	1158860	Hmm. All right, well, if you want to join us and
1158860	1161980	chat with us, chat.orangelaungerated.com is the place to be, we'll be reading comments
1161980	1163580	from chat all night, we'll also have the phone lines open.
1163580	1168800	I am trying to keep a little eye on the JustinTV chat, but I'm not always the best at balancing
1168800	1172880	two chat rooms, especially when we're down a host tonight, we're all very, very busy
1172880	1176980	in multitasking right now here in studio. But we will do our best to try and get through
1176980	1180900	the show tonight, let's start to get into some gaming news, but first I want to talk
1180900	1184900	about some housekeeping tonight. Obviously last week's show was very borked,
1184900	1189040	if you were here for it, we had a video card die in the middle of the show. We did get
1189040	1193340	back up and running, we had to make some small changes, we're not on a widescreen monitor,
1193340	1197760	which I'm hating because I got so used to the real estate screen space on a widescreen
1197760	1200140	monitor, but that's all right, I'm dealing, it's better than nothing, it's better than
1200140	1203980	last week. And we have a recycled video card plugged
1203980	1207140	in the computer, which apparently Loki was using as a doorstop.
1207140	1212140	Well, the computer was a doorstop, yes. The video card is just sitting there.
1212140	1215620	That's hilarious. But hey, now we're getting some use out of it. But this is what I wanted
1215620	1220580	to say, it has come to my attention that the listeners, a lot of the people that were listening
1220580	1226500	last night, or not last night, last week, actually ended up taking up a collection because
1226500	1231860	of, and I don't know if it was inspired by my frustrations and venting that was going
1231860	1237220	on that night with all the problems and what have you, or what it was, but regardless,
1237220	1241100	the listeners took up a collection, they collected something like, I'm not even kidding, $250,
1241100	1246020	$280 I think they got, almost $300, they've bought us a new studio computer, some type
1246020	1249820	of refurbished thing I think they got on Newegg, they've got us a new studio computer that's
1249820	1251340	on its way. Well, that's awfully nice.
1251340	1252820	I know, I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.
1252820	1255660	It's not a Mac. No, it's not a Mac, it's not a Mac. I'm like,
1255660	1260580	guys, you didn't have to do that, we just needed the video card, we're fine. But at
1260580	1264060	the same time, now that we know there's a third one coming, we're kind of like, okay,
1264060	1267740	well, come to think of it, there is a lot we could do with a third computer. We could
1267740	1271980	probably, we could have one in the house, so we could stream more from the TV in there,
1271980	1275860	we could have a satellite computer at Dark Sacras for nights that we want to broadcast
1275860	1280340	from her house, there's things we can do with it.
1280340	1286120	Or Loki can tear it apart, I don't know. No, I'm not going to tear it apart, I'm just,
1286120	1292380	it might come in handy with Skype later on. Oh, okay, okay, sure, sure, yeah. We can do
1292380	1294740	some fancy things with Skype. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, yeah.
1294740	1301540	Sounds good, sounds good. I'm liking this idea. Alright. So, great. And actually, Brad
1301540	1305300	from Pod Culture in the chat room is clarifying, it's a lot of new parts as well, it's all
1305300	1309700	new parts. And all the chatters are being very nice. ActDef says we didn't have to,
1309700	1314700	but we wanted to. You guys are very, very nice. I mean, I'm almost at a loss for words,
1314700	1318420	like when I read about it. You know, my reaction is just like, guys, you really don't, I mean,
1318420	1322100	we kind of pride ourselves on the fact that we've done this for seven years and really
1322100	1325220	not made a lot of money off of it. I mean, you know, thanks to-
1325220	1327220	I wouldn't think we've made any money off of it.
1327220	1330980	Thanks to, well, thanks to another very generous donation we had a couple of years ago on Christmas,
1330980	1334740	you might remember, we got to do some travel the next year and do some shows that we wouldn't
1334740	1339380	normally do. And I'll, actually, I want to say something about shows in a minute. But
1339380	1345420	yeah, so it's just been, just very thankful and very floored and just really shows you
1345420	1350380	the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio and it's just amazing and just, I'm
1350380	1352380	very thankful. So thank you.
1352380	1356900	They say that I'm going to fill it full of porn. That's wrong. I have a PC at home and
1356900	1360460	a PSP to fill full of porn. I don't need any more porn on this computer.
1360460	1362620	They're saying Loki will have to put it together, which is fine.
1362620	1363620	That's fine.
1363620	1366540	Yeah. And we, and I think there was, we're going to put the old drives in it so we don't
1366540	1368740	lose any of the shows and all that. So we'll figure it out.
1368740	1369740	That's fine.
1369740	1372500	I have to call Rama. He's been trying to get ahold of me and I just have been so busy trying
1372500	1376340	to get everything together. So we will have more to come.
1376340	1377340	We'll put it to good use.
1377340	1380700	Yes, we will. We'll find one way or another, we will definitely get good use out of that
1380700	1387660	machine. So very excited. All right. Let's see. What else I want to mention? Speaking
1387660	1393500	of travel, I am going to be attending after being requested to do so for about the past
1393500	1399100	three years by various listeners. It is true, which you may have heard. I am going to ASAN
1399100	1404420	anime central in Chicago. Not only am I going, I'm going to be doing a panel there. It's
1404420	1408460	called, so you think you can podcast and I'm going to take my, yes, I'm going to take my
1408460	1413460	seven years of podcasting experience at well radio slash podcasting experience and talk
1413460	1418420	about how, you know, if you are a independent gamer, independent anime fan, it's not going
1418420	1421900	to be just about video games, just about fandom. If you have a fandom, you want to make a podcast
1421900	1426940	about how do you get started? How do you find an audience? How do you do that? So I'm very
1426940	1432520	excited to go there. I have friends and so I might be making a cameo at the Bamani panel
1432520	1437100	as well, which I'm very excited about because Eddie, my buddy who runs a big, big website
1437100	1441620	called Bamani style.com, you may have heard of it. He is runs that panel and is hoping
1441620	1445520	to have me do a cameo so that I'm excited. I really want to do that. Unfortunately, dark
1445520	1451180	soccer and Loki not able to go now because the wife won't let Loki go and I still have
1451180	1457780	travel budget. You know, yeah, we're doing the E3 thing just because I'm using my tax
1457780	1461320	return to do it. So that's something that was paid for by anybody. I got paid for by
1461320	1467700	my work because our work gave us each $1500 trips, basically. So I'm using this to go
1467700	1474980	to LA and we're staying at a nice hotel, E3, and then the slum hotel in Disneyland. But
1474980	1478980	we're going to go do that. I have to find something for the wife to do while I'm at
1478980	1483700	E3 though. I was going to get her in but, you know, I thought about it and, you know,
1483700	1487300	even if I could get her in, which wouldn't have been, you know, exactly the most up and
1487300	1495140	up ways, she would have been bored out of her mind. Yeah, yeah. But yeah. Bobby is in
1495140	1498420	chat right now. Our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf does a show before us on All Games Radio.
1498420	1501840	I have considered going to ASEN just to crash Rob's panel. That's very sweet. That's alright
1501840	1505800	because I was going to go to a DragonCon and crash yours. But then I guess they have now
1505800	1509860	PAX and DragonCon are the same weekend or whatever. PAX is looking very likely this
1509860	1514620	year as well. I think we're all in the mindset of let's get past E3 first, then we'll talk
1514620	1520980	PAX. Yeah, I'm not going to PAX. I know I definitely want to go. This will be the last
1520980	1525180	trip I take for a long time, unfortunately. Fair enough, fair enough. You got to do what
1525180	1529660	you got to do. Personal life first. Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news because
1529660	1534180	the Justin TVers are like, are you going to unpause the damn game or not? Sorry, I can't
1534180	1538500	multitask like that. I probably could. It's Orange Lounge Radio. Does it say Final Fantasy
1538500	1542860	13 television? No, we're just trying to do both tonight. Sorry. Alright, no that's alright.
1542860	1547500	So there was a rumor. Don't apologize, Logi. There was a rumor from Ars Technica that said
1547500	1553580	they had a source that was claiming that Patapon 2 would be a download only, that it would
1553580	1560700	not have a physical UMD, that it would actually be just a code basically that would come in
1560700	1568220	a case and it would be available the same day as it's available on the PSN. Now this
1568220	1576300	actually brings up a lot of bad things. One, okay we didn't know that, at least at my work,
1576300	1580520	until I asked about it and they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to mention that to you. Which
1580520	1586020	sucked. And two, because we have stores that rent PSP games, now they can't rent that.
1586020	1590420	So they cancel all their orders off, which honestly is not that many. But still, it's
1590420	1596220	annoying. So basically here's what you're going to get. You're going to get this case,
1596220	1601420	it's going to have a voucher in it. It's going to have a printed manual. And it will be $20.
1601420	1607500	Now if you don't give a crap about your printed manual, you can download it for $15. Honestly
1607500	1612300	I think $5 for a case that you're basically going to throw away in a manual is a rip off
1612300	1619260	to me. But this is something that they're trying, that they're testing out apparently.
1619260	1625140	I have a feeling though that this is not going to be a test. Especially if that PSP 2 rumors
1625140	1628900	or whatever, 4000 or whatever you're going to call it, happen to be true and there is
1628900	1636060	a no UMD port in the new upcoming system, then all of the PSP games will be like this.
1636060	1641680	Or at least they're going to have this option so that you can, those who may not have this
1641680	1646580	new system will be able to download it or be able to play it on the original system
1646580	1647580	as well.
1647580	1650900	Yeah, that sounds like a little more than a test to me. This is letting the middle man
1650900	1657300	down gently is I think what this is about. Don't you think? I mean this is very successful
1657300	1660620	which I actually don't think it's going to be. I don't think it's going to be that successful.
1660620	1661620	I don't think so either.
1661620	1663300	I don't think this is going to sell any more than the regular arcade title.
1663300	1667060	Honestly I think if they were smart they would not put it in stores and just leave it as
1667060	1670800	a download and that's it. Because I think they're wasting money putting it in stores
1670800	1677060	because really if you're an informed buyer, an informed consumer, you're going to realize
1677060	1682500	that, huh, it's $5 cheaper online. Why the hell would I pay for it in the store?
1682500	1687380	They've done this before with PS3 games where it's the same price online as it is in the
1687380	1691940	store or you get a little bit more with it. For example, Warhawk, you got a Bluetooth
1691940	1699220	headset and you got the game and some other crap. That's a little bit different. But if
1699220	1703420	it's just going to be the same price online versus buying in the stores, why do I even
1703420	1705020	bother buying it in the store?
1705020	1712140	What about, is this for grandma, mom, relative who just wanders into the game store and thinks
1712140	1716500	this looks like a good family-friendly title to buy the children?
1716500	1721360	Maybe, but at the same time it also might be for the people that had pre-orders on it.
1721360	1730300	I don't know. At the same time, this worries me in two ways. One, if it's not successful,
1730300	1735260	if it turns out more people decide to download it online than buy it in the store, they're
1735260	1739260	like, hey, look, the online download thing works just fine. Let's just do it that way
1739260	1741260	and not put it out in the store.
1741260	1744980	If it does really well in the store, then they're going to realize, hey, you know what?
1744980	1748720	We don't need a UMD in there. We can just go ahead and have it as a download title.
1748720	1753260	And guess what? If they buy it as a code, they can't sell it used. There are no used
1753260	1755860	copies. It's all new all the time.
1755860	1761940	If you want to comment on this, we are open all night tonight. Decipher in chat says they're
1761940	1765980	not really wasting money putting it into stores as it will let people who didn't know about
1765980	1769740	the online store find out about it and how to use it. And Cheeseburger says this could
1769740	1772700	be for a gift. Those are coming from our chat room, chat.orangewonsradio.com.
1772700	1776900	But they could easily do a gift online or something with a voucher and that kind of
1776900	1779340	stuff. I mean, that can be done. I don't know.
1779340	1784260	Grandma can't exactly go on the PlayStation store. You know what I mean? They know, oh,
1784260	1788300	my grandson loves video games. I'm going to go to GameStop and buy a game. Oh, this pat-a-pawn
1788300	1791660	looks very nice and cutesy. I'll buy this, right?
1791660	1792660	I guess, yeah.
1792660	1796020	But I mean, I don't know how, you know, is it going to be enough? Is there really going
1796020	1802600	to be enough of that to justify this whole strange way of releasing titles? I don't know.
1802600	1805640	It's going to be a test and I have a feeling, though, it's not going to be just a one-time
1805640	1811460	test despite what they said. You know, I have a feeling it's going to be something that
1811460	1815520	we're going to see a lot more of.
1815520	1818500	Because, I mean, everyone's kind of going to the online digital stuff, especially now
1818500	1823100	with, you know, the iPhone app store, you know, doing well by itself. I mean, they're
1823100	1826860	realizing they don't need to sell stuff in, you know, a traditional marketplace.
1826860	1828900	Wait a minute. Are you trying to blame Apple for this whole thing?
1828900	1835420	Um, part of it, I guess. But it's not even so much Apple. I mean, look at, like, you
1835420	1839500	know, Xbox Live Arcade or even just an old PlayStation network. You know, they've figured
1839500	1843820	out that you can, you know, put stuff out just digital only and it still sells pretty
1843820	1844820	well.
1844820	1846660	Let's go to the lines. We have a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
1846660	1848660	Hi, this is Hack Def.
1848660	1852300	Hey, Hack Def. How you doing? What do you think about this? Patapon 2, digital release
1852300	1857980	only, but kind of $5 more if you want the case and manual in stores. What do you think?
1857980	1865060	Well, I think it's a good idea. Not necessarily in the United States, but in the whole world,
1865060	1869180	especially down in Mexico and other Latin American countries.
1869180	1872220	And for those listeners that don't listen to the show regularly, you actually are from
1872220	1876860	Mexico, so I'm kind of curious your perspective on this. Why?
1876860	1887020	Why? Because the PSN store in Mexico, it's barely updated on time. If we don't get all
1887020	1896140	the stuff, the U.S. gets, like, some games, demos, videos, and other stuff. So if the
1896140	1908620	Patapon 2 goes only download on the PSN, I don't know if it would get released on time,
1908620	1915100	but having to go to the store and having something you can use to download, it would be very
1915100	1916100	useful.
1916100	1920300	Loki, have you heard anything about what's going to happen outside the U.S.? Because
1920300	1924220	I would think, wouldn't these codes be region-locked on top of everything else?
1924220	1929860	They released it as a UMD in Europe. So this is only in Japan, I think they also released
1929860	1934100	it as a UMD. So it's only in the U.S. that they're trying this right now.
1934100	1943020	Most of the things they release in the U.S., it's brought over here, so that's why I'm
1943020	1944780	concerned about this.
1944780	1951340	Interesting. Huh. Well, I guess, I'll be kind of curious to see when this game's released.
1951340	1953820	Is this a game you're thinking of picking up, Acteft?
1953820	1961500	I don't have a PSP, but I tried the Patapon 1 demo on a friend's PSP, and I liked it.
1961500	1969100	And if I'm getting a PSP soon, probably will. I do want to get Patapon 2.
1969100	1973700	Well, if you do end up getting the PSP, or if your friend does it, I'd be kind of curious
1973700	1978020	how easy or difficult it is for you to do so. So you'll have to follow up with this
1978020	1979020	later.
1979020	1980020	Yeah.
1980020	1984820	And let us know how it goes. Alright, well thanks for the call, Acteft, and have a good
1984820	1985820	one.
1985820	1986820	Thank you.
1986820	1990380	Bye bye. Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're doing a little bit different and keeping it open
1990380	1994220	all night tonight for your calls if you want to call in at any time and comment on what
1994220	1995220	have you.
1995220	1999740	Let's go ahead and move on to another story and talk a little bit about Gears of War 3.
1999740	2004300	God of War 3. Every time I see G-O-W, I think Gears of War. It's actually God of War 3.
2004300	2007980	God of War 3, I guess there was a survey going on out there, and there's going to be a God
2007980	2011500	of War 3 Collector's Edition, and one thing that they've actually been exploring, putting
2011500	2016000	into this, per a survey that went out earlier this week, that there could be re-releases
2016000	2023380	of God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-Ray. Kind of interesting, right? Yeah. Also, a God of War
2023380	2027140	and God of War 2 cinematic movie compilation, which, you know, God of War obviously had
2027140	2030940	some pretty epic cutscenes and some great music in it, so that would be very interesting
2030940	2034980	to see a type of just cinematic compilation be released. Now, granted, these are just
2034980	2038980	things they're exploring. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen, but it's interesting
2038980	2044660	that they asked about it, because that would mean that they are talking that it's feasible,
2044660	2049500	right? And if it's feasible to actually be able to play PlayStation 2 games and emulate
2049500	2054320	them on Blu-Ray, then that means that they've built an emulator that runs in software, which
2054320	2058620	means that they can do an update that will be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2
2058620	2062420	games. But why would they do that if they can resell the game, just like Nintendo does?
2062420	2066740	Exactly, that's true, but I think that they would want to do it as a patch so that you
2066740	2071220	can, you know, have it on the system so that you can download PlayStation 2 games, just
2071220	2074900	like you can PlayStation 1 games. I have a feeling this is where it's going to go, and
2074900	2078100	I have a feeling they're playing this down right now, because that's going to be an announcement
2078100	2082060	that they're going to make. If this ever comes to fruition, I mean, it could be just all
2082060	2086660	talk right now, but... Well, and if a later comment from Sony is to be believed, this
2086660	2092940	is just all talk right now. There was actually a named Sony Computer Entertainment representative
2092940	2097340	that said, it is simply a marketing survey. The goal of it is to do focus testing. If
2097340	2100620	that was the number one requested thing, that would be something they would need to see
2100620	2106420	if it was technically feasible. But that is just a thought. That is retarded. I'm sorry.
2106420	2111280	They would not offer something if it was completely unfeasible. They would not do that. That is
2111280	2115700	just backwards thinking right there. I mean, you wouldn't say, hey, how would you like
2115700	2120540	it if we made a Blu-ray disc that made you popcorn, or something like that. I mean, they're
2120540	2125180	not going to offer something if it's not a possible option, or if it's not something
2125180	2128420	that they're currently working on. The problem is, they probably didn't realize that this
2128420	2132740	survey would get out to everybody, even though a lot of this stuff always happens, and so
2132740	2137340	now they're playing it down, because they don't want their surprises ruined. I'm sorry,
2137340	2144320	but I have a feeling if this is on this survey, that it's going to happen. They may not offer
2144320	2146500	that, but it's something that they're working on, obviously.
2146500	2150600	Well, don't these companies usually use an outside marketing vendor to do this type of
2150600	2154020	crap anyway? Just to say, the outside marketing vendor didn't just pull this out of their
2154020	2155020	butt.
2155020	2157420	I don't think that they would do that, because they're wanting to see, okay, we're going
2157420	2162100	to make this box set or whatever of God of War. Here's the components that we're thinking
2162100	2166940	about putting in it. Let's see what people want in there, and most people are looking
2166940	2170660	for, so we can cut our costs and not put everything in there. We just put the stuff that people
2170660	2175460	are mostly interested in. That's the whole purpose of that. You wouldn't put, say, a
2175460	2179940	God of War full-size statue or something like that, if that was not something that you were
2179940	2183980	really thinking about putting into this box set or something like that. You wouldn't have
2183980	2189860	an option for this stuff. I'm sure people would love to play God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-ray.
2189860	2193420	That would be pretty awesome. But if they're never going to be able to do that, then what's
2193420	2197740	the point of even wasting your time as that with an option, when it'll skew all the other
2197740	2201860	ones that are actual legitimate options? Which leads me to believe that they actually are
2201860	2205420	working on this, or they have it implemented already, and it's something that's coming
2205420	2209860	soon, that they're just keeping tight-lipped about, because it's going to be a big thing.
2209860	2215380	I will let you anything. There was a rumor from last E3 that they figured out a way to
2215380	2218700	have downloadable PlayStation 2 games, and if they've got an emulator built, of course
2218700	2222660	they're going to use it, because now you can reissue all those old PlayStation 2 games,
2222660	2226340	because a lot of them are out of print now, and let's start making a lot more money. You
2226340	2229860	can sell them for 20 bucks a pop. I would be so happy if a software emulator comes out
2229860	2233160	for PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility, because I do have a lot of PS2 games I would
2233160	2237740	like to play. Granted, I do still have a working PS2, but I'm running out of shelf space, for
2237740	2245060	Christ's sake. I have a 360, a Wii, and a PS3, and a cable box. I have a lot of crap
2245060	2248780	in my living room. And it also would be fine right now, too, because they dropped the price
2248780	2253360	of the PlayStation 2, and yeah, it might cut into their PlayStation 2 system sales, but
2253360	2257300	really at this point, who gives a crap about their system sales? There are 44 million units
2257300	2262380	out there. Who cares if it cuts down? You want to catch up with the PlayStation 3, so
2262380	2267700	hey, now we can say, hey, we're fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 stuff, and that
2267700	2268700	would be a big thing.
2268700	2272460	Here's something thought-provoking from chat. Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob, Sony can
2272460	2276740	make their buckage by selling the PlayStation 2 emulator as a purchase in the Sony online
2276740	2280700	store. Oh god, don't give them ideas. Don't give them ideas, because that sounds very
2280700	2285060	fusible. It really does. Hitstun says they could sell the PlayStation 2 emulator for
2285060	2287700	a hundred dollars and people would buy it. No, I draw the line.
2287700	2288700	They wouldn't do that.
2288700	2294140	I would pay, I would pay twenty. I would pay probably up to twenty. More than that, I'll
2294140	2296780	just say, fuck it, I'll bring the PlayStation 2 in the house if there's something I really
2296780	2301060	want to play. But for that convenience of being able to, like, get rid of my PS2 practically,
2301060	2306020	I might actually pay, like, twenty bucks. Just so you know. I don't know.
2306020	2312020	Alright, also Game Guru says E3 will obviously have Sony announce the end of the PlayStation
2312020	2315020	2. I don't think, I don't think that's necessarily true. They're still selling it.
2315020	2317220	They're never going to announce that.
2317220	2321740	I don't think they would ever come out on stage and say, and just so you know, we killed
2321740	2322740	the PlayStation 2.
2322740	2323740	They're not going to do that.
2323740	2325740	We took it out to the barn last night and put a hole in it.
2325740	2326740	They're still making money.
2326740	2329780	They're not, they're not ever going to do that. If the PlayStation 2 ever dies, which
2329780	2332700	it won't, they're still making PS1 games.
2332700	2333700	No they're not.
2333700	2334700	Some people aren't. Aren't they?
2334700	2335700	No.
2335700	2337700	They're still supporting. But, like, third-party developers are still supporting.
2337700	2338700	No.
2338700	2339700	Really?
2339700	2342620	Yeah, they saw PlayStation 1 support years ago. No, they're still making PlayStation
2342620	2346140	2 games. And, you know, there's, it's still doing pretty well for them.
2346140	2349420	Uh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Let's take a call.
2349420	2351140	Uh, this is Spazinator.
2351140	2356540	Hey, Spazinator. So PlayStation 2 games possibly coming to the PlayStation 3, would you pay
2356540	2357540	for an emulator?
2357540	2365540	Oh, yeah, definitely. Uh, as long as they don't go overly expensive with it, uh, actually
2365540	2372660	is a pretty good idea. Um, in a, in a, in a sense, you know, I agree with you, because,
2372660	2379340	you know, uh, you know, if you have multiple systems and don't tend to sell you all the
2379340	2386180	games, you know, hitting a backwards compatible system would be great. You know, less clutter,
2386180	2393940	you know, less wires, that kind of thing. And not only that, but, uh, you know, at least
2393940	2400380	with the original launch, you know, PlayStation 3, uh, you know, they were fully backwards
2400380	2405180	compatible with the Emulsion Engine. You can't really find those new anymore, which kind
2405180	2406180	of sucks.
2406180	2410140	No, I mean, you can't, you can't really find them anywhere, to be fair. I mean, when I
2410140	2414060	bought my PlayStation 3, I, I tried to look for a little bit for one that was backwards
2414060	2417260	compatible, but I just gave up. I was just like, forget it. I still have a PlayStation
2417260	2420780	2 I can use if I get that desperate. But I just, I want to be able to play a little
2420780	2423740	big planet already. You know, that was really the game that finally convinced me I needed
2423740	2425500	to jump on board with Sony. So.
2425500	2434140	Yeah, at least with me, I used to have, uh, the 60 gigabyte model, but as I had mentioned
2434140	2441420	before, last year, that was stolen. And, and unfortunately before, before the system was
2441420	2448140	stolen, I had sold my PlayStation 2, kind of thinking, well, since my system was backwards
2448140	2454500	compatible, why keep the PS2 around? Uh, now, you know, after the theft, I kind of regret
2454500	2461700	that because my new system is backwards compatible, but no, uh, but I figured, you know, if they
2461700	2467620	could do like some kind of update where they put Emily on it, you know, that'd be great.
2467620	2472940	You know, cause now I can go back and play all my old PlayStation 2 games over again.
2472940	2478900	And while I'm, uh, I have, he haven't even finished yet. So, you know, you know, I would
2478900	2484700	love to go back and play some of my games I haven't finished or play some of the ones
2484700	2488020	all over again, you know, a lot of them were classics.
2488020	2492140	I would love to see them kind of unlock. That would be a really sweet treat for Sony to
2492140	2495620	kind of give people is the fact that you could suddenly play all your PlayStation 2 games
2495620	2499060	again, but I don't know, the realist in me just thinks it's not happening. They're still
2499060	2503940	selling so many PlayStation twos. They realize that people have both. And, uh, you know,
2503940	2507100	Sony wants to live in this bubble. I think they, they literally think, I think there
2507100	2513100	are people there in the boardrooms that think, you know, w people should only have a PlayStation
2513100	2516460	2 and a PlayStation 3, and they can have them both. What do you, what do you mean? Xbox
2516460	2521940	three sixties and wheeze. Our customers aren't buying those. Don't you think that they couldn't
2521940	2526300	you imagine their suits and boardrooms that really think this? Yeah. I could totally see
2526300	2532820	this. Yeah. And to kind of touch on what you were saying before you took my call, you know,
2532820	2538660	then he had the, just dropped the price on the PlayStation 2. And he always right now
2538660	2544540	in the place station to sell and buried in the places, they should three, uh, you have
2544540	2550020	to, you want to boost, you know, they're, you know, pre-season three sales, uh, dramatically
2550020	2556220	they would, you know, make, uh, you know, uh, some kind of, uh, emulator available on
2556220	2565460	PSN, uh, ditch, you know, uh, the physical places, you know, two altogether and say,
2565460	2572980	you know, we want you to buy the system. You can play all your old games on it. You know,
2572980	2578940	you may have to pay for kind of fee for downloading, but you'll still be able to use all games
2578940	2585420	plus they'll buy all these new games and hopefully, you know, they'll see the, uh, their, you
2585420	2590260	know, uh, sales on PlayStation three increase as a result, you know? All right. Well, spasnator,
2590260	2592780	I think we can all agree though that wherever Sony's going to think they're going to make
2592780	2596740	the most money, that's what they're going to end up doing. Right. All right. Well, half
2596740	2601540	a good one. All right. Spasnator, wait real quick before you go. Uh, Final Fantasy 13,
2601540	2608900	you excited or don't care? I'm excited. Um, I'm definitely looking forward to getting
2608900	2614660	a, I've been a real big fan of the series for, you know, some years now. Um, uh, tell
2614660	2618940	I even played the original one on the NES. So I kind of looked, I'm looking forward towards
2618940	2624540	13 years. You know, from what I see a trailer and whatnot, it looks like a, they took bits
2624540	2629500	and pieces of, uh, different final fantasies, a little bit of seven, a little bit of 10,
2629500	2637420	a little bit of 11, 12. So, you know, I really haven't played a bad Final Fantasy yet. This
2637420	2640940	one could be pretty good. I think that's a good point. You know, despite the fact that
2640940	2644620	there have been weak Final Fantasy titles and it's all controversial, depending on who
2644620	2647780	you ask, like I say Final Fantasy eight was one of the weakest ones they put out in a
2647780	2653820	long time. Some people say I'm fucking crazy. Eight was one of the best ones, but none of
2653820	2658540	them were bad. Like, have you ever played a Final Fantasy game that was just bad? Like
2658540	2662660	if anyone's going to say any of them are bad, they're going to say 11 is bad, but because
2662660	2667460	it was just such, those aren't really part of the, you know, they're not actual Final
2667460	2670900	Fantasy. I realize Final Fantasy 11 is an actual Final Fantasy game, but it's a little
2670900	2675580	bit kind of out of Canada. The rest of the game is pretty awesome. I know, I know. Anyway,
2675580	2682420	Spazinator thanks so much for the call. Have a good one. Sure. No problem. Later. Um, yeah,
2682420	2686340	has there ever been like just a Final Fantasy game where you just picked it up and I'm talking
2686340	2690140	about, I'm not talking about your mystic quests. I'm not talking about your tactics. I'm talking
2690140	2695820	about Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 12 didn't seem, I don't know.
2695820	2699380	I never played 12, but it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in. It wasn't,
2699380	2703860	but it wasn't bad. I don't know. I never played it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on with
2703860	2708860	some news. We're like 45 minutes into the show where we've barely touched a third of
2708860	2714040	what we wanted to touch on yet. All right. Well, there's another Sony, or was a Sony
2714040	2719460	property back in the PlayStation 1 days, but Spyro the Dragon is actually going to become
2719460	2727980	a 3D movie. Apparently, the company that did Aragon is actually going to be putting out
2727980	2734220	a CG animated film and they have a movie poster for it and it looks interesting. I
2734220	2738100	mean, Aragon, granted, was not a good movie and I'd probably say the best part about that
2738100	2743420	movie was the dragon, so hey, why not? Let's run with it. Run with what was good about
2743420	2750020	it. That sounds interesting. No word on when it's going to be out yet, but hopefully soon.
2750020	2757100	I imagine this would be something targeted towards children, though. Probably, yeah.
2757100	2764660	So I don't know. It's neat. Hmm. And I'm looking at Deft in Chat says, wait, that's true? I
2764660	2769540	guess some things came out that maybe doubted the trueness of this. I think it's true. It's
2769540	2779760	on their website, so I don't know. Huh. I don't know. Alright, well, we will see in
2779760	2786220	just a matter of time. Meanwhile, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently
2786220	2792000	there are Star Trek costumes coming to PlayStation Home. Did you hear about this? Yeah. The link
2792000	2795580	to my story broke, but I do remember from reading it earlier in the week that there
2795580	2798940	was about, like, I guess to celebrate the release of the movie there's going to be some
2798940	2802180	new costumes coming to PlayStation Home that look like kind of the old classic Star Trek
2802180	2808700	costumes. That sounds about right, yeah. Now, you've actually paid for downloadable costumes
2808700	2812700	in home, right, Loki? Only the Santa Claus stuff, and that's the only costume that I'll
2812700	2816100	be wearing. Would you not pay for a Star Trek costume? I don't know if you're supposed to
2816100	2818660	be a fan of Star Trek. No, I am not a fan of Star Trek, at least not to the point of
2818660	2826140	where I'd buy a costume, or even a virtual costume. So folks in Chat would seem to like
2826140	2833820	that though. Actf says Star Trek costumes do want. Kurosaki87 says cool. Yeah. Well,
2833820	2837540	something else that's coming out available on the PlayStation Network, and also Xbox
2837540	2841780	Live Arcade. Konami announced that they're Gamers' Night, that they're going to be putting
2841780	2849180	out the third installment of Vandalhearts, their strategy RPG series. Now the new game
2849180	2853300	is going to be Vandalhearts Flames of Judgment. It'll be out on both the PlayStation Network
2853300	2858940	and Xbox Live Arcade. I think it's been the first Vandalhearts game we've had in a long
2858940	2865180	time. I want to say like the original PlayStation. I don't know if they did the PlayStation 2
2865180	2870660	game, but it's been a long time coming. So that's kind of neat. See, once again, figuring
2870660	2879140	out that the online digital distribution method is still a very viable business model. Interesting.
2879140	2884260	Indeed. Now this is part of what they announced that they're big Gamers' Night, right? And
2884260	2887620	I'm sure we'll have other stories from that a little later, but I guess that was probably
2887620	2891980	one of the pleasant surprise things they got into. Oddly enough, no DDR news. Unless they're
2891980	2898340	saving that for E3. Ooh, do you think that's good news or bad news? Neither. It's got to
2898340	2901540	be something DDR in the works, right? They're going to do like, oh look, holidays party
2901540	2908060	3, I bet you didn't see that coming, oh! Or like, you know, universe 4, I bet you didn't,
2908060	2912900	we surprise you. Well, something else that probably is not a surprise, probably about
2912900	2919140	as much of a surprise as, you know, I don't know. A silver DualShock 3 controller is on
2919140	2924220	its way out. It is from a listing that has showed up on GameStop's website. What's weird
2924220	2927100	though is that if you think about it, why would they release a silver controller when
2927100	2933580	there's no silver PlayStations? But why not? Because somebody will buy it, right? No. Oh.
2933580	2936940	It's probably going to be a silver system, I bet you. Do you know something I don't know?
2936940	2940300	No, I don't know anything yet. No, but I would assume that there's probably going to be a
2940300	2945500	silver system. A silver system that plays PlayStation 2 games again? Maybe? I don't think
2945500	2949340	they'll do that, but there'll probably be another bundle they'll announce or something,
2949340	2953900	maybe with God of War 3 or something. But if you remember, they did a gunmetal grey
2953900	2958460	one, I mean, that's sort of silver. Now wasn't there a white one also at some point? No,
2958460	2962060	not in the US, that was overseas. There's also been a silver one, I think, overseas,
2962060	2971500	so yeah. Well I guess there is a silver PlayStation 3 available right now in Asia, actually. So
2971500	2976380	we just don't have it here. But this controller would match that, so I don't know. Boy, Sony
2976380	2979980	really loves to mix and match the regions. I can't think of many companies that really
2979980	2983980	mix and match their regions like Sony does. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like with all
2983980	2988860	the weird colors and stuff, well I guess Nintendo kind of does it too. I don't know. Alpha
2988860	2992780	Nanogram in chat asks, why would they release a clear blue DualShock 2 controller if there
2992780	2996220	isn't a clear blue PlayStation 2? I mean, fair enough. I mean, there doesn't have to
2996220	3002140	be a silver PlayStation 3, but it's just kind of weird. The reason why I think that is because
3002140	3007100	there's one already in another region. It's not just, you know. Could they just be unloading
3007100	3012340	the extras from the other region, maybe? Very possible. I mean, I don't see why they couldn't,
3012340	3020020	but you know, I think that it's probably an indicator of something else though. That seems
3020020	3026940	to be the way Sony rules. Oh, if only E3 were tomorrow, but it's not. Well, let's take a
3026940	3030260	look really quickly at some release dates of some upcoming games. I'll go ahead and
3030260	3032940	start with Europe, because Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so I'll go ahead and read
3032940	3036860	the releases for Europe. This week, some of the games you have to look forward to in Europe,
3036860	3042300	Xenoclash coming out for the PC, Saints Row 2, Ultor Exposed coming out for the Xbox 360
3042300	3045260	and PlayStation 3. That's download content. That's download content. That's what I thought,
3045260	3051100	I was going to say. It was delayed, too. It sucks. Minion Everyday Hero comes out on the
3051100	3055740	Wii, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Little King's Story
3055740	3059900	on the Nintendo Wii, as well as the new play control version of Pikmin 2, and the Chronicles
3059900	3065460	of Riddick, Assault on Dark Athena, all come out on the 24th of this month over in Europe.
3065460	3070620	Again, those are Europe release dates. How about the US here locally, Loki? The US, whole
3070620	3076700	lot of not much. This week, really only one game that you need to worry about picking
3076700	3083940	up anyways, Excitebots Trick Racing. Supposed to be out on the 20th or tomorrow. That's
3083940	3089400	my gaming week right there, basically. There will be a version if you want to, if you're
3089400	3097340	ever so inclined with a wheel as well. Why? Honestly, I think it's stupid, but hey, if
3097340	3100260	you want to play at the wheel, go right ahead. I'm thinking of getting Excitebots, I'll have
3100260	3104980	to do some online. Oh yeah, it'll be awesome. I want to play Nelly. I told her, I'm like,
3104980	3109620	dude, you can start playing against other people. She's like, I don't care. It hurts
3109620	3117460	me. Some other stuff, there's a PZ game called Cryostasis. Also, Dynasty Warriors Gundam
3117460	3125860	2 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360 this week. I love horses on the DS, and
3125860	3131340	sadly enough, that's it. The week after that, there's going to be a bunch of crap coming
3131340	3137660	out on the DS, and then X-Men Origins, Wolverine. Looking at chat, by the way, this is coming
3137660	3140660	from Justin TV chat, because I'm trying to keep an eye on that, even though our main
3140660	3144340	chat room is at chat.orangelandrager.com. I know we have quite a few people on Justin
3144340	3148260	TV who have never listened to this show before, because of the Final Fantasy 13 demo. I want
3148260	3152180	to point out though, AkumaJP, one of our Justin TV chatters, actually responded to something
3152180	3158060	AlphaKananagram said earlier, there is a clear blue PlayStation 2 in Japan. That's seriously
3158060	3162180	part of the reason I love this show. Most radio hosts, we get pissed off when listeners
3162180	3167860	correct them on things, but I think we realize we can't be everywhere. We do something pretty
3167860	3171460	ambitious here by trying to keep in mind, yes, there are gamers in Europe. Yes, there
3171460	3176140	are gamers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, all those places. We have listeners throughout
3176140	3182060	the world, but we can't be all those places. We don't always know what colors and what
3182060	3187580	things you guys have, so you guys are always there to correct us. Love it. Speaking of
3187580	3191860	Japan, let's talk about some Japanese release dates. Sometimes Japan gets things way before
3191860	3196540	us, sometimes they get things way after us. One game that's coming out in Japan this week
3196540	3201020	on the Xbox 360, a game called Death Smiles, which is a shooting game that's actually getting
3201020	3204340	its own little arcade stick, and this game looks like a cute little Japanese shooter.
3204340	3207820	This looks like the type of thing that Dark Sakura would be all over. I know she's not
3207820	3213020	here tonight, but it looks like, this looks very similar to the one, god, what's that
3213020	3217760	game she loves on the Sega with the witch flying in the broom? It's like her favorite
3217760	3222880	game ever? I don't know. One of the chatters will know it. This looks very similar to that
3222880	3227500	where it's a very comic style and everything in the game is little like demons, like, you
3227500	3232300	know, little, I don't know, this game looks kind of neat actually. Death Smiles. That's
3232300	3236140	just a cute name too, by the way. That is coming out this week on the Xbox 360. There's
3236140	3241980	also an arcade stick coming out just for that game. Also in Japan, Tom Clancy's HAWX comes
3241980	3248980	out as well. Hawks, yeah. Hawks. Also on the Playstation 3 this week, Killzone 2 makes
3249180	3253880	its Japanese debut. Check that out if you are into that. On the Nintendo Wii this week
3253880	3257900	in Japan, Monster Hunter G, that's going to be a big one coming out over there, as well
3257900	3261500	as Tomb Raider Underworld finally gets its Japanese release. Those are the big releases
3261500	3266500	on the Wii this week. Coming out on the Playstation 2, Little Anchor. Also Tomb Raider Underworld
3266500	3273500	and a game called Kanuchi Kuroki Subasa no Shu comes out from Idea Factory, which looks
3273620	3280380	to be an adventure game, probably based on another anime if the box art is any indication.
3280380	3285900	On the Nintendo DS, we have Another Time, Another Leaf. That's what it's called. Kagami
3285900	3290860	no Naka no Tante comes out. Last Bullet is another game coming out on the DS this week,
3290860	3296620	as well as something called, I don't know what this is, DS Vision Dual Masters Box Set.
3296620	3300500	I guess it's some type of like dual master with the cards, like the actual cards, but
3300500	3304860	it's something for the DS. Kind of weird. I don't know what the heck this is. It's probably,
3304860	3309060	I don't know, maybe something for the DSi or something that you. That could be, oh maybe
3309060	3312780	something that scans the cards, like an Eye of Judgment type thing with the DS. Am I thinking
3312780	3318500	too far? I don't know. I'm totally guessing, so I don't really know if that's the case
3318500	3322940	or not. And thank you Chatters, you got it. Alpha Kananagram, was he first? No, Dark Tetsuji
3322940	3326620	said Cotton. Panorama Cotton was the game I was trying to think of earlier. That Death
3326620	3332420	Smiles looks a little bit like Panorama Cotton. Thank you guys. Sony PlayStation Portable
3332420	3337980	in Japan sees the release of Hoshigari Empusa Portable, which is coming out on the PSP,
3337980	3343820	which looks to be another little school kid adventure game coming out on the PSP. And
3343820	3348420	Chronicle of Dungeon Maker, Nantama. If you're into Dungeon Maker, that's coming out as well.
3348420	3352180	That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates. Let's do a few more news items. We'll
3352180	3359180	get into the Classic Game of the Week, and then we will get into a break here. So, Loki,
3359180	3363220	alright. Sorry, you gotta pause Final Fantasy XIII if you can. Or are you in the middle
3363220	3368340	of a battle? I was in the middle of a battle, but that's alright. Alright, good. So anyways,
3368340	3376460	there was some interesting stuff. There was a new action game coming from Square Enix,
3376460	3384220	and it's a little bit different than... Oh, this is the one I'm thinking of. Nevermind.
3384220	3390660	Vanguard Storm is the name of the game, and if you may remember a game back on the PlayStation
3390660	3397980	called Vanguard Hearts, I have a feeling it's a sequel to that. And no word exactly on what
3397980	3405540	it is, but apparently the May issue of the PlayStation official magazine made an announcement
3405540	3411620	that they're working on an unannounced title, so tie that in with that trademark for Vanguard
3411620	3417420	Storm. Probably what they're working on, a new Vanguard Hearts game, which would be pretty
3417420	3423260	awesome. It's interesting, we've heard kind of a flurry of stuff from Square Enix just
3423260	3425860	in the last year or so. I remember picking up Vanguard Hearts so I could get the demo
3425860	3431180	for Final Fantasy VIII. I thought that came with Brave Fencer Musashi. Oh, maybe that
3431180	3434780	was Brave. I thought it was both. Was it? I don't remember. Or maybe I'm mixing them
3434780	3437900	up. Maybe one of them had the VII demo or something. I don't remember. I don't think
3437900	3442620	they had a demo for VII. Yeah, they did. They did? Oh yeah, they did. Yeah, they had a demo
3442620	3449500	for VII. Really? Yeah. I know they did. Yeah, because it was just the... It might have been
3449500	3452580	multiple demos, because they used to do that where there was a disc. Yeah, I seem to remember
3452580	3456880	that. They'd have an early demo, then a later demo that had extra stuff or something. Just
3456880	3464420	weird Square-type stuff to do. Brave Fencer Musashi had the demo for Final Fantasy VII,
3464420	3471140	says Act Deft. Oh, maybe I did play that demo, because I'd pop Brave Fencer Musashi. I seem
3471140	3478940	to remember having that demo. I don't remember if I rented it or what I did. And then Henderson
3478940	3483080	Man, 77, says it was actually with Toeball number 1. Had the demo to VII as well. I'm
3483080	3486420	sure it was... I think there were a couple of demos that came out. It was so long ago,
3486420	3491920	though. Alright, anyhow. Phone lines are open, by the way. 1877 Game OLR. I know some folks
3491920	3495200	might want to call in to talk about this one, but there were some drums in the music game
3495200	3500720	world this week. That's right, some big drama between DJ Hero, Activision, and Scratch the
3500720	3505580	Ultimate DJ. Apparently, what happened? The developers of the people that are making Scratch
3505580	3510780	the Ultimate DJ, they have actually filed suit against VII Studios and Activision, forget
3510780	3515380	this, intentional interference with contract, breach of contract, and misappropriation of
3515380	3521740	trade secrets. Basically, you have a publisher who's suing the people that made the game,
3521740	3525980	because didn't Activision try to pick them up then? They bought them. They bought them,
3525980	3530860	and now this company's trying to say Activision sabotaged it, because Scratch got delayed,
3530860	3534600	didn't it? Yeah. You spoke very highly of this game, because you've actually seen more
3534600	3537940	of this game than a lot of people have, because the developers came to your work or something,
3537940	3542940	right? Yeah, well, the publisher came to my work, Genius, and they showed us a video of
3542940	3547940	the developer showing off the game, and it's really awesome. I mean, granted, it's not
3547940	3550760	the most original thing. Everyone's like, oh, Beat Me and You Rip Off, and yeah, it's
3550760	3556660	very similar to Beat Mania. The really separate is because the scratching's actually very
3556660	3560300	unique, the way you do the scratching system and stuff, and how it detects different tricks
3560300	3562780	and that kind of thing. Let's go to the phone. We got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch
3562780	3569180	Radio. Who's this? Death Wishing. Death Wishing. And I say, welcome to America. Welcome to
3569180	3573620	Sue Happy America. Where you can sue anybody for anything. Where you can sue your own people
3573620	3577880	that helped you get to where you are. You can sue the pants off of them. This is almost
3577880	3584580	like Coke suing Coke Zero for sucking. This is like Coke suing New Coke for sucking. This
3584580	3591580	is what it is. This is like suing your mom for getting your umbilical cord cut. But seriously,
3591580	3596580	though, if this is true, if everything that they're saying is true, basically, you know,
3596580	3601860	that Activision bought this company because originally they were going to sell it off
3601860	3605420	to Activision or something like that, and Activision's basically in cahoots with them
3605420	3609340	to delay this game so DJ Hero comes out. I just want to say, to be fair, to cover both
3609340	3613860	sides of the story, before we open up and let the listeners comment, Activision did
3613860	3617720	publish a statement after the fact a little later in the week that says they, quote, strongly
3617720	3622380	deny the allegations made by Genius Productions and Newmark Industries. The claims are disingenuous
3622380	3628120	and lack any merit. They're just trying to get petty. Well, I'm sure Activision has more
3628120	3631860	lawyers than Genius does, and so, unfortunately, I don't think anything's going to happen.
3631860	3635460	I think they're going to announce DJ Hero and show it off at E3, and it'll probably
3635460	3640180	come up before scratch, and it's unfortunate that this, you know, game will come out, and
3640180	3645060	I think they could have given them a run for their money. I've noticed, though, that Activision,
3645060	3649220	whereas they should be called Activision Blizzard, and strange thing is I'm drinking Coke right
3649220	3653140	now, dude, just to be random, because I see Coke stuff in chat, but, uh, Activision Blizzard,
3653140	3657380	I've noticed they never want to sue. I can't help but notice they always seem to lose,
3657380	3663220	or they always get dropped. I bet you this one will be dropped because the judge is just
3663220	3670060	going to go, you guys are little children, get out. Can't we all just get along? No,
3670060	3675300	but seriously, though, basically, they're saying that, you know, Activision and Genius
3675300	3680240	met together, and they signed NDAs, and they showed each other each other's games, why
3680240	3684980	they did that is beyond me. I guess they were trying to sell them scratch or something,
3684980	3689220	and, you know, now they're saying that 7 Studios, since they have all this insider knowledge
3689220	3692500	of how the game works, and, you know, we're developing the game, that they gave that knowledge
3692500	3697300	to Activision, breaching their contract, and at the same time, because they were behind
3697300	3700780	schedule anyways on everything, you know, they weren't meeting their quotas, and they
3700780	3706560	were demanding more and more and more and more money, that now they're basically kind
3706560	3713560	of dragging their feet so that, you know, the Activision game gets out first. They're
3713560	3718960	still little babies. Death Wishing, okay, you're saying they're babies, but why? Explain
3718960	3727460	a little bit here. Who do you think is the good guy in this scenario, and why? This is
3727460	3735420	hard because they're both kind of just freaking out, in my opinion. I don't know. It's really
3735420	3743040	hard, but it's like, one guy is suing because he's being sued, and then the other guy is
3743040	3750700	suing the side company, I forgot what they're called, but, uh, because they, it's like,
3750700	3756940	in a way, I kind of see this as false claims. Do you think it's really important which one
3756940	3762140	of these games gets out first? Uh, right now, yeah. This will be important. This will, which
3762140	3767040	one gets out first will probably be the more popular one. But wasn't Guitar Hero out before
3767040	3771000	Rock Band? I mean, granted, Guitar Hero is more popular, I guess, in the long run, but
3771000	3776720	I think a lot of people recognize Rock Band. Actually, Guitar, uh, Rock Band's made much
3776720	3781480	more money than Guitar Hero has. In fact, I think there, wasn't the, Guitar Hero's fault
3781480	3788280	is behind, uh, Rock Band's, uh, sales. Yeah, but the problem is, I think, that it's all,
3788280	3793820	it's really the way people perceive everything, is if Scratch comes out first, say it came
3793820	3798400	out when it was supposed to, which would have been June, um, and it had, you know, a lead
3798400	3804040	on DJ Hero for at least three months or so, when DJ Hero comes out, everyone's like, hey,
3804040	3807680	that's just a rip-off of Scratch. You know, and it kind of... It's like Rock Band was
3807680	3812940	coming out. Yeah, exactly. It's, it, people perceive it, you know, they want DJ Hero out,
3812940	3817160	so people go, oh, that's just a crappy knock-off of DJ Hero, why would I want to play that?
3817160	3821440	You know, it's the thing is... The thing is, is Rock Band, though, was different, because
3821440	3824760	it did have a full band while Guitar Hero was just Guitar, so that's maybe why it sold
3824760	3828120	better, but these are the same games, you know, this is like saying Guitar Freaks is
3828120	3832720	better than, you know, it's like Guitar Freaks, you know, Guitar Hero. Well, and if you want
3832720	3836040	to be, if you want to put it that way, Guitar Freaks came out years before any of these
3836040	3841280	games did, and it's, uh, look at how wonderfully Rock Revolution did, which you could say would
3841280	3846040	be the new innovation of Guitar Freaks. That's not a funny joke, that's just sad. It's really
3846040	3849680	not. In fact, actually, one thing I did do with my gaming week, I didn't talk about earlier
3849680	3853520	in the show, I bought a new guitar, I finally have a wireless guitar that I bought, I ended
3853520	3857180	up buying a new Guitar Hero guitar because I had more friends that wanted to play Rock
3857180	3862800	Band, but I preferred the Guitar Hero guitar, I'm weird. So I bought that, but, oh my god,
3862800	3867400	stacks and stacks of Rock Revolution drum kit plus games for 30 bucks.
3867400	3874640	Poor guys. Poor guys. Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up part
3874640	3878560	A and get to our break, but anything else you want to say for our listeners?
3878560	3883080	People, I need a chat. Should I get Final Fantasy XI a line?
3883080	3887880	Oh god, you're gonna open a whole can of worms with that one. Um, you know what, they have
3887880	3890400	a two week trial now, my advice, try the trial.
3890400	3891400	Okay.
3891400	3892400	Alright.
3892400	3893400	Bye bye.
3893400	3899040	Bye bye. Alright. 1-877-GAMELR if you want to give us a call, but we do want to move
3899040	3902480	through some of the other news. Uh, Loki, you have another story for us.
3902480	3910200	Uh, good. Guitar Hero Van Halen has been spotted on the European rating system there. Basically,
3910200	3915040	the German ratings board has the game listed, and to be honest, I thought I've already said
3915040	3919480	this on the show, it's absolutely coming out. I mean, I don't think they've announced it
3919480	3923600	yet, but, um, it's been leaked out on all these different retailer sites and stuff like
3923600	3924600	that.
3924600	3927460	It's coming up again on the show because I saw it on about three different video game
3927460	3932200	websites from three different sources saying, oh, Van Halen, Guitar Hero's still being speculated.
3932200	3936840	It is fucking happening. It's already, god, how many people do you have to hear it from?
3936840	3941040	Really? End of August. What more do you want to know? I mean, seriously.
3941040	3944220	They're trying to keep it in their pants, tell E3, because they want to probably parade
3944220	3948840	Van Halen out on stage. Because they know that something big is going to happen with
3948840	3953180	the Rock Band Beatles thing. So they're trying, I mean, Van Halen is no Beatles, no matter
3953180	3958160	how much you want to argue. Um, but, they'll do whatever they can to put a dent in the,
3958160	3962780	because you know that is going to be the huge thing from, you know, EA, Harmonix is Rock
3962780	3963780	Band Beatles.
3963780	3969000	Exactly. But, I just, I don't, good for them if they want to put out another game, but
3969000	3973200	I just don't like their business model. I don't like how it's not downloadable content,
3973200	3977920	or that you can't load it into your Rock Band 2 game, you know, if it were a Rock Band,
3977920	3981760	you know, equivalent content. That they can't load it into like a Guitar Hero game or anything
3981760	3985640	like that. It's just all separate. And they do that because they want you to buy these
3985640	3990320	games. They want you to pay, you know, the $60 instead of, you know, whatever it would
3990320	3993560	be to download everything. Or if you might not want all the tracks or something like
3993560	3999680	that. Whatever. I mean, that's what they want to do, fine. And people buy it if they want.
3999680	4003400	But yeah, it's definitely coming. It's not like a, you know, they're calling it a rumor
4003400	4007800	because they haven't announced it yet, but, dude, I mean, seriously, everyone's saying
4007800	4011040	it's coming out. It's coming out. If it's rated, it's coming out.
4011040	4014400	They're just trying to keep, it's the world's worst secret right now because they're going
4014400	4020160	to, I was, I will bet you money they are parading Van Halen out on stage, or what's left of
4020160	4022120	them anyway, at E3.
4022120	4026360	I'm sure. It'll be during their conference or something. I don't know.
4026360	4030920	All right. Anyhow, Sing Star Queen is a game that I thought was supposed to come out some
4030920	4031320	time ago.
4031320	4032800	It was supposed to come out in March.
4032800	4036360	I have a friend who is very excited about Sing Star Queen because she loves Freddie
4036360	4040520	Mercury. I mean, how could you not? Right? I mean, what a fucking rock star. Just a great
4040520	4046000	band that I would also wouldn't mind seeing Guitar Hero Rock Band game made out of. However,
4046000	4048720	they are making a Sing Star game out of it, or I guess you could say it's already been
4048720	4051240	made. Didn't this actually come out overseas already?
4051240	4052240	I think so.
4052240	4056760	Well, we are finally going to get it on August 18th is when the game will come out on PlayStation
4056760	4061840	2 and PlayStation 3. Just like Sing Star Abba, the PlayStation 3 version has five more songs
4061840	4066160	than the PlayStation 2, so 20 and 25 songs each.
4066160	4070440	By the way, just on a side note, Sing Star also got a big update, or I think is getting
4070440	4075560	one this coming week, where they're finally putting trophies in the game. And apparently,
4075560	4079960	if you go in and read some of the trophy descriptions, they talk about unlocking trophies in PlayStation
4079960	4083960	Home. So you've got to wonder if that's right around the corner as well. I wonder if that's
4083960	4087280	going to be one of the things they parade out at E3, is that finally all the trophy
4087280	4088280	rooms are open.
4088280	4090120	Well, it's about time they parade something they've been showing off for years now.
4090120	4094040	I would bet anything that's going to be an E3 thing too, if not just before. But yeah,
4094040	4097760	Sing Star is getting a big update. I guess the Sing Store is going to get a little bit
4097760	4098760	of a tune-up too.
4098760	4105160	Honestly, I haven't been in Home since it came out, basically. I mean, it's just no
4105160	4106520	interest whatsoever.
4106520	4110560	You know what? I've revisited it a couple times. I checked out the new Guitar Hero area.
4110560	4113720	I checked out the new Resident Evil area. It is kind of interesting to see what they're
4113720	4120600	building, but I still have yet to see... I know this sounds really harsh, but the point?
4120600	4125000	You know what I mean? I guess I'll go into the Guitar Hero area to play the little Guitar
4125000	4129560	Hero mini-game, which was kind of dopey. It was just basically Simon Says. It wasn't even
4129560	4135960	like Guitar Hero. But I mean, I couldn't see logging into these places to actually try
4135960	4139000	to talk to people. But I guess there's an audience for it. Because, you know, every
4139000	4142520	time I go in there, it seems like there's quite a few people on it, using it. I mean,
4142520	4149440	it's not like Home is empty. There's lots of people just dancing away in the town square.
4149440	4155440	I know. But yeah, I'm with you. I don't get the point. But whatever.
4155440	4160440	I do and I don't. I get the point. I just don't think it's what we all were hoping it
4160440	4163360	would be. Which, I don't know.
4163360	4166580	It's not revolutionizing anything, I don't think, right now.
4166580	4170280	I'm very curious to see, though, because I believe... Wasn't Namco supposed to put some
4170280	4173720	stuff into PlayStation Home? Or at least that's happened overseas. But it hasn't happened
4173720	4174720	here yet.
4174720	4176280	Yeah, they have their games that you can play and stuff.
4176280	4179760	I would kind of like to see what happens when that gets enabled. Because now we're starting
4179760	4184200	to talk about a point. You know what I mean? Having some of these games that you actually
4184200	4189080	get in Home. Curious. Curious.
4189080	4194120	So this is kind of interesting. Apparently a lot of people got the first look at the
4194120	4202740	new Rock-A-Bam Beatles game. It actually came out. They had special footage that was being
4202740	4209880	broadcast at Coachella. Paul McCartney's new performance that he did. And basically when
4209880	4216580	they're playing Got To Get You Into My Life, they had behind them some actual footage from
4216580	4219120	Rock-A-Bam with the digital artists singing and stuff.
4219120	4222560	You know how they do at concerts. They have images playing behind the band when they're
4222560	4226240	singing or what have you. So Paul McCartney at this... In Coachella, I don't know how
4226240	4232200	many of you guys listening have ever been. The last time I went was in 2002, I think.
4232200	4237200	Maybe 2003, I went to Coachella. And it's huge. I went whatever year Bjork and Chemical
4237200	4242560	Brothers were headlining. It's just ginormous. Like, oh my god, so many people there. I thought
4242560	4247080	I was going to die during Bjork because there were just so many people there.
4247080	4251000	So obviously this was not a small concert to be debuting this in front of. And you know
4251000	4255520	everybody talks about Coachella. It's kind of like, since there is no Lollapalooza, Lilith
4255520	4259720	Fair. Well, I take that back. I guess they do a Lollapalooza in the Chicago area. But
4259720	4262960	there's no big tours and things like that. This is one of the big festivals people talk
4262960	4268240	about in this day and age. So this is no small concert.
4268240	4271960	Very interesting. Although they have this thing at the middle of nowhere. You know about
4271960	4275440	Coachella? They do it at this big polo field that is literally in the middle of nowhere.
4275440	4279120	It's in Indio, California. So you have to drive like two hours outside of L.A. to get
4279120	4282900	there. It is literally in the middle of frickin' nowhere. But I guess that's so people don't
4282900	4290180	complain about the noise. So anyhow. Also, something about the Beatles game is going
4290180	4293120	to have multiple microphones and harmonizing. There's a rumor, yeah.
4293120	4295160	Huh. You think that'll actually turn out to be?
4295160	4297160	Eh, maybe. That might be kind of fun.
4297160	4302880	I'm still trying to figure out why it's $250. I wouldn't spend too much money on it.
4302880	4303880	Didn't they finally announce it?
4303880	4307080	They announced what's in it, but it seems like there's stuff missing, to be honest.
4307080	4312540	Because it's like a bass and drum or something like that. Microphone and mic stand. That's
4312540	4319840	not $250 worth unless that bass guitar is really awesome and that drum says really awesome.
4319840	4325920	Alright, well earlier we talked about SingStar. SingStar, their biggest competitors are probably
4325920	4331680	the Lips franchise, which has had mediocre success, and Karaoke Revolution American Idol.
4331680	4336560	Well, it was announced at Konami Gamer's Night this week that Blitz Games is developing a
4336560	4340400	reboot, I guess you could say, of the Karaoke Revolution franchise. We're calling it a reboot
4340400	4342920	because they are calling it simply Karaoke Revolution.
4342920	4344240	At least right now, yeah.
4344240	4348720	It's a game being developed for the PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii. And it's going to have
4348720	4352720	50 recordings on the disc. You're going to be able to have a pretty comprehensive character
4352720	4358000	creator mode in it, and you'll have customizable venues apparently and original music videos
4358000	4360160	for all the songs. That's kind of cool.
4360160	4364560	Apparently they're going to have song and item download content in the game, very similar
4364560	4371040	to Rock Band. However, it is Karaoke Revolution. It is singing only. What's kind of interesting
4371040	4374960	though is that I noticed right away, the first thing I noticed, I don't know if you noticed
4374960	4379280	this, where did American Idol go? Because that was one thing Konami was very proud of
4379280	4382760	a couple years ago. Do you remember there was a Codemasters American Idol game that
4382760	4386640	was just atrocious? Like you just hit buttons or something. It was really terrible. I think
4386640	4390080	it was Codemasters. I'm sorry if I misappropriating that. But that game came out when the show
4390080	4393920	was first out. And then a couple years later, Konami got the franchise because they were
4393920	4398500	one of the first to go into this Karaoke genre with Karaoke Revolution. They had a couple
4398500	4403420	of those games, which ironically, Harmonix, had developed for them. And they had pretty
4403420	4408020	good success with it, so they came out with American Idol Karaoke Revolution. But that's
4408020	4412760	nowhere to be found now. So does this indicate they lost the American Idol franchise? They're
4412760	4416880	not interested in it, which I would have a hard time believing, or what? No, I doubt
4416880	4423120	that. I think, if anything, what was kind of neat about it is that they also had...
4423120	4430600	it's all Master Tracks now, too. It's not covers. That is one big difference, I suppose.
4430600	4436600	So that's kind of cool. And then you can also create your own characters in this. You know,
4436600	4441760	like customize actual characters and stuff, with sliders and all that fun stuff. So really
4441760	4446920	detailed there. But yeah, they're kind of trying to reinvent themselves with that. Why
4446920	4451460	not like DDR or something? I just don't understand. By the way, they're also saying this setlist
4451460	4455920	will be very party-centric, and it's going to have a drop-in-and-out duet mode. Doesn't
4455920	4460160	that sound exactly like what they did in Lips? Also, though, there's going to be online play,
4460160	4464240	it sounds like, which I can't think of a lot of other games outside of the Rock Band Guitar
4464240	4468440	Hero games, the karaoke games that do this. Does Lips do that? I don't know. Lips is
4468440	4475440	the one karaoke game I haven't played, because I have SingStar. SingStars online is the SingSpace,
4475440	4481940	or whatever they call it. The community download people videos making asses themselves, dancing
4481940	4488720	around in Star Trek outfits and stuff to the various songs, which is actually kind of funny,
4488720	4495560	some of it. SSJ-100 Matt is hoping for a Karaoke Revolution Susan Boyle edition, because she's
4495560	4504560	all the rage this week. I dreamed a dream. Well, you know what? You can always recreate
4504560	4509960	her character in American Idol. Maybe if the Avatar creation is very good, you'll start
4509960	4514240	seeing that. And who's to say that they won't come out with an American Idol game? Because
4514240	4521240	usually those typically come out in the spring, or the winter, between November and February.
4521240	4525440	And honestly, this new karaoke game could possibly come out in October, and then they
4525440	4530200	announce a new game, and then it comes out later. I don't think they're going to drop
4530200	4535120	American Idol anytime soon, but I think it's too early for them to announce the new Karaoke
4535120	4539400	Revolution American Idol games coming out when they just released one. It was a few
4539400	4543600	months ago, but still. And remember how Paula Abdul wasn't actually
4543600	4547640	in the Karaoke Revolution American Idol games? They had a third judge named Laura. They had
4547640	4553120	Randy and Simon and Laura. Yeah, she wasn't the newest one though, I
4553120	4555360	think. Well, now they could just have Kara, who's
4555360	4557520	the actual- Get rid of Paula off the show.
4557520	4560320	I mean, everybody's saying just get Paula off the regular show anyway, because she talks
4560320	4561880	too damn much, and just have Kara be the third judge.
4561880	4564920	She's also high on something. Methamphetamines?
4564920	4568320	Meth, I don't know. Say, hey!
4568320	4574240	I saw the colors that you were singing! What? It's like, stop talking!
4574240	4582240	When you were singing Ring of Fire, I felt fire, because you were just flaming up there
4582240	4586520	on stage. You were so flaming. I was like, I should get a fire extinguisher,
4586520	4590920	because he's on fire! But then I was like, no!
4590920	4592320	Have you actually been watching American Idol? Yes.
4592320	4596120	Because I know the wife makes you watch it. She likes watching it, and it's okay, but
4596120	4600360	we always skip the results show, because that's a big waste of time.
4600360	4605160	We just read online who loses, and honestly, you already know who's going to win now, anyways.
4605160	4610720	But seriously, she is smoking crack or something, and a lot of times, now because, for whatever
4610720	4614960	reason, their producers suck so bad that they can't keep the show on time, even when they
4614960	4621400	cut it down to only two judges talking per performance, Paula wastes so much damn time
4621400	4626200	about, you know, talking about whatever she's talking about. No, I was like, staring her
4626200	4631920	down, like, what the fuck did you just say? Oh, and yes, I'm just on TV now, playing a
4631920	4637200	trailer for Final Fantasy Versus, because apparently I got killed in 13, and so, I don't
4637200	4640600	feel like replaying half an hour of demo again. Good job.
4640600	4644040	Alright, so check that out. What, are you going to switch to Fat Princess a little later
4644040	4645040	here? Yeah, probably.
4645040	4646040	Alright. Second half.
4646040	4647720	Well, hey, you got another story you gotta cover, and then we're going to get to the
4647720	4650200	classic game of the week, which you don't even know what I'm doing tonight, unless you
4650200	4652520	took a peek, but I think you'll like the game I picked tonight.
4652520	4653520	I didn't.
4653520	4654520	We'll see. We'll see.
4654520	4662880	Anyways, so we've got a, this is kind of cool, they're going to have Video Game Live at E3,
4662880	4667800	you know, I remember last time we went, I think they did, was it the Final Fantasy concert,
4667800	4671920	you know, whatever they called that, Voices or something, but yeah, Video Games Live,
4671920	4679320	going to be at the LA Greek Theater on June 4th. I almost thought about going to this,
4679320	4685600	but then June 4th is my wife's birthday, and that might not be good.
4685600	4692280	She definitely may not like that. Nice. Hitstun in chat says, wait, it's a $70 fucking demo
4692280	4699320	and you can't even save? No. Bummer. I kind of want to go to Video Games Live at E3, just
4699320	4703120	because I know they're going to really pull off the stops for that one, but I don't know,
4703120	4707000	it just may not work out, I may be kind of, there's a very strong possibility I'm actually
4707000	4711600	going to Vegas, like, that same weekend. Huh. Kind of funny. That was interesting. What?
4711600	4715960	I noticed at the end of the Final Fantasy Versus 13 trailer it said, PlayStation 3 only
4715960	4721120	worldwide. I didn't realize it was coming out in the US. Yeah, of course Versus is coming
4721120	4725380	out in the US. I thought it was Japanese only. No, it's been coming out in the US, but it
4725380	4729440	still is reiterating that it's not coming out on the 360. Eh, whatever, I don't care,
4729440	4733940	big deal. It's not going to like, you know, break my heart if I have to buy one of them
4733940	4739520	on the 360 or one of them on the PS3, or both on the PS3. I really don't care at this point,
4739520	4745080	so. Alright. Well let's get into the classic video game of the week. We like to close out
4745080	4748560	part A every week of our program by taking a look in the archives and digging through
4748560	4753480	the archives and finding a game that speaks to us as a classic that you all should be
4753480	4757340	playing. Usually DarkSakura does this and picks a game from the archives, however, she's
4757340	4761880	not here tonight. Again, for those that joined us mid-show, she is celebrating her birthday,
4761880	4766560	which actually is today. I would say how old she's turning, but she'll probably punch me
4766560	4771380	if I did that, so you'll just have to... It starts with a three. That's a whole set. She's
4771380	4776320	turning three. Congratulations, DarkSakura. She's gonna act her age for once. Yes, because
4776320	4782440	she's at Disneyland today. Acting three. So that's where she's at. So I'm filling in,
4782440	4786280	I believe the last time we did this, Loki did Twisted Metal, so it's my turn, and I
4786280	4790560	picked a game. I did? I don't even remember anymore. Yeah, you did. I tried to go back.
4790560	4794320	Maybe I'm being unfair. I don't know, but I picked a game I thought you would also like,
4794320	4798800	Loki. This is a game I remember. I wanted to pick a Commodore 64 game, because you know
4798800	4804200	I love the Commodore 64, but I found a game that was not only on the Commodore 64, but
4804200	4809160	it was actually ported to the Nintendo as well, and the game is called Spy vs. Spy.
4809160	4814080	Did you ever play this game on the NES? No, I'm aware of it. All right, Spy vs. Spy is
4814080	4816960	the game I picked for the Classic Game of the Week. It's actually kind of like the series.
4816960	4821600	Now, Spy vs. Spy, of course, is the, you know, you might know this from the Mad Magazine,
4821600	4824640	the comic books, you basically have a black spy and a white spy that are out to kill each
4824640	4829720	other. Well, here's what makes the game kind of unique, Spy vs. Spy. It was a game that
4829720	4833320	actually came out on the Commodore 64 first. They actually ported it to the NES later.
4833320	4838200	It came out on a handful of systems at first, but it was actually one of the first games
4838200	4842240	that had split-screen multiplayer, because you actually would have the white spy on the
4842240	4846000	top and the black spy on the bottom, and basically you were trying to kill each other. That was
4846000	4850320	the game. Let me tell you a little bit more about the game here, pull up some more information
4850320	4854360	I have on this. I actually own this game and the sequel, which I'll talk about in a minute,
4854360	4859360	on the Commodore 64. But, yeah, this was a game that was published by Firstarstoff, where
4859360	4865160	it came out in 1984, and it started off on the Atari 8-bit computer systems, Apple II
4865160	4869080	and Commodore 64, which probably would have been the most technically powerful out of
4869080	4874000	those systems. It actually had split-screen simultaneous two-player gameplay. What you
4874000	4877360	basically do in this game, you want to kill your opponent as many times as possible, but
4877360	4880840	while you're trying to do that, you're trying to collect items to get out of the little
4880840	4884600	compound. You're basically in a little compound looking thing, and you're trying to collect
4884600	4890420	various items, and get out of there, be the first one out of there. Whenever you perish,
4890420	4893920	you drop all of the items that you have, and you have to sit out of the game for a few
4893920	4899020	moments while your person you're playing against gets to free run. Now here's the thing that
4899020	4901960	makes this game kind of cool. While you're running through the embassy collecting items,
4901960	4905820	Not only do you if you run into the other player can you start beating each other up with a stick?
4905940	4911720	but you actually set traps for the other player because what you're doing is trying to dig through things to find the pieces like the
4911720	4913380	You know passport and everything you need to get on the plane
4913380	4920180	But you can actually set a bomb a spring a water bucket and like a time bomb you can actually set these things and blow
4920180	4922440	Up your opponent if they search the wrong thing
4923100	4929700	Unless you have a remedy you can find umbrellas and things to counter so it's like this really fucking elaborate game of pop
4929700	4935120	Rock paper scissors is what it is basically this giant game of rock paper scissors that's going on
4935220	4937680	What's kind of cool about this game though what I always liked about it
4937680	4943740	Is that you know because it is split-screen multiplayer on the same screen part of winning the game was?
4944120	4949640	Memorizing what your opponent was doing on the lower screen and the bigger the compound the harder it is to do that because you know
4949640	4954180	We're talking about an old computer system where a lot of the rooms looked the same
4954180	4959840	It was just the colors would be different and so on so there's the guy taking off in the plane. He actually won there
4959840	4962540	You go let me show you or not show you because it's radio
4962540	4965920	But let me play for you a little clip of the NES version of the game that came out a little later
4965920	4969660	And you can hear like the souped-up music that was in this version of the game which by the way
4969660	4974720	They say is coming to the Europe virtual console very soon if it hasn't already
4975880	4981080	But also very similar you know was a Nintendo game that had the same same screen multiplayer
4981080	4985080	I was always thinking this would be a fun game for them to put out on Xbox Live or the DS
4985280	4988760	With like with like but like four players, but not have
4989280	4993640	Everybody have their own screen you could still see what everybody is doing on the same screen because that was part of that
4993640	4997280	That's how you win the game you have to memorize what your other people are doing and where they've set the traps
4997480	5001980	It's kind of interesting by the way there was a spy versus spy game that came out later on the Xbox
5001980	5006140	But it was like a 3d reimaging. That's not the game. I'm talking about definitely not the game
5006140	5010860	I'm talking about I'm talking about the old-school Commodore 64 game. There was a couple of sequels released for this game
5010860	5013720	There are actually two sequels released. They were not released on the NES though
5013720	5016240	So I don't think quite as many people know about these games
5016240	5019520	But I'm gonna play a little bit of music from the second one which I actually own this game
5019520	5023060	It was spy versus spy to the island caper and yes
5023060	5025620	That means they left the building and they actually went on to an island
5025620	5028680	But the interesting thing about this is that you were no longer in rooms
5028980	5033880	But you were in giant horizontal lines like imagine you had giant rectangles
5033880	5036500	So you still could go up and down between the different rectangles
5036500	5042000	But you know you had more side scrolling going on and this time you were digging in the ground and you could set bombs you
5042000	5047180	Could set like rope traps that would hang you from the tree you could set napalm coconuts that you know
5047180	5049300	The other spies would dig up pretty cool stuff
5049300	5053480	That was the second game that came out and there was a third game that came out and I didn't even own this game
5053480	5056280	But I did play it once it was called Arctic antics
5056320	5061480	So basically the antithesis of being on the island would be being on the North Pole and it was the same type of thing except
5061480	5066440	You had a body heat meter and you could regenerate it by being an igloos whatever but kind of interesting
5066440	5071680	that the you know the series went on for quite a while on the computer and then got rebooted a few years later, but I
5072000	5077740	Remember playing this with friends when I was like eight or nine years old and having fun with this because this is you know
5077740	5082280	This is a great trash-talking game when you're in the same room and just just the sound you make
5082460	5085820	When two people kind of discover each other in the same room, which is like
5086340	5090880	To start hammering on the joystick trying to kill the other spy good times good times
5090880	5096840	So that's a classic video game of the week spy versus spy on the Commodore 64 is where I remember it
5096840	5101280	Most fondly but a lot of you probably are more familiar with it on the Nintendo Entertainment System
5101640	5105460	So there you have it classic video game of the week. I'm surprised you never played that Loki
5105460	5110100	I thought for some reason you had said in an earlier show you'd actually played it once so that was part of the reason I
5110100	5112800	Picked it because it definitely seemed like a you type of game
5113600	5119280	If that makes sense, I guess it makes sense. All right. Anyhow, we are gonna take a break here on orange launch radio
5119280	5122720	We're gonna come back and we have plenty more of the show to get into Xbox 360
5122720	5125200	We haven't even talked really about the 360, but we have news about
5125800	5130280	the warranties for the e74 errors talk about bionic commando and
5130600	5133980	Sega games coming to Xbox Live Arcade. Do you really need them?
5133980	5137760	I know we'll talk about that when we come back all that and more including your chat and your phone calls
5137760	5139840	We come back with more of orange lounge radio
5139840	5153840	And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this lovely Sunday evening April the 19th of 2009 where we're back for more of orange lounge radio
5154440	5161000	Myself Rob Roberts and Loki joining you tonight not dark Sakura. She's off. She's at Disneyland having a gay old time with her girlfriends
5161680	5167100	Not that kind of gay old time, but she's her in about five other girls all giggling girls all went to
5167100	5170220	Disneyland and I did see on her Facebook
5170220	5175860	She updated a picture from Space Mountain and they're all screaming and throwing up metal signs and all that kind of stuff
5175860	5178300	So it looks like they're having a fun time, but not here tonight
5178300	5181100	But Loki and I are holding down the fort and boy dark Sakura
5181380	5183380	Picked a hell of a night to miss I mean it is her birthday
5183380	5187260	So I understand but we got Final Fantasy 13 demo here in house, which we're checking out here
5187260	5191980	And I'll tell you what, it's much different to be looking at it than watching it on YouTube. You know what I mean?
5191980	5195060	It's pretty cool. It's much different to be playing it too. Yes, it is Loki
5195060	5198500	Well, you know I haven't really touched it, but Loki. How have you been enjoying it? It's okay
5198500	5201340	I mean it just gives you an idea what the games can be like obviously
5201340	5204940	I can't understand any Japanese. I can read all the translations for it, but
5206220	5210380	It's neat. You know I'm looking forward to playing the actual game when it comes out
5211100	5213300	Later all right well
5213300	5216740	Let's get back into some gaming news Loki and by the way just in case you're just joining us
5216780	5219220	Partway through the show if you're joining us on all games radio
5219580	5224020	We are doing something a little differently tonight our skype line is open all night long if you want to comment on the stories
5224020	5225620	We're talking about one eight seven seven game
5225620	5233020	Olr or our username on skype is orange launch radio Justin TV if you're joining us there because we have Final Fantasy 13 in our description
5233020	5235020	And some people are finding us that way
5235340	5239820	You are going to hear a bunch of people talking because we are taping a radio show as we've done every week for the past seven
5239820	5243360	Years it just happens. We have this uber hot hot demo in studio right now
5243360	5246100	But if you guys want to give us a call too as long as it's on topic
5246100	5249180	We don't care one eight seven seven game, Olr. We'd love to hear from some new people
5249380	5253480	Let's give them some top topics to talk about we haven't even hit on the Xbox 360
5253480	5259680	And there's been a lot of news in Microsoft's world this week right Loki. Yeah this week. They announced that they're gonna start supporting
5260880	5265240	The e74 errors in their three-year Xbox 360 warranty
5266160	5268540	you know you may remember that before the
5269240	5277160	Announced that they're going to increase the warranty to three years for red rings or the red light of death. I guess or our ODS and
5277160	5284080	You know those are basically general hardware failures well people are like well
5284080	5290280	What's an e74 error? And they're like that's a general hardware failure. They're like was that the same thing as like say
5291160	5293480	The red you know lights of death or whatever
5294120	5296120	Well, no, but yes
5296560	5298280	so
5298280	5303760	You know basically yes, it's basically the same thing as you know the three rings of death
5303760	5307440	Let me go to the phones real quick because we do have a call coming in hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
5308080	5311600	Hi, this is called anthro. Hey golden. How's it going good?
5311600	5315800	We're talking about Xbox 360 in the e74 era have you been a victim of this I?
5316480	5320220	Know I I be honest with you. I wish I just had an Xbox 360
5320220	5324760	Yeah, that's what the next console. I want to get but I to be honest with you. I'm 17
5324760	5329480	I still don't even have a part-time job, so that'll be my first target is to get a 360 well
5329480	5334360	It's good to have goals, so to what do we attribute this call then tonight like?
5335360	5340880	What I want to talk about yes, what are you calling it about? Oh, okay? Yeah about that um I?
5342200	5344200	Was I wasn't gonna bring it up in let
5344760	5351480	Loki chose to bring it up again the Bob's game fan. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to open up a fight, but
5352000	5357040	If I'm if I'm correct to bring up a point Rob you guys are trashing on it
5357040	5360520	But you said you don't like to judge things based on demos
5362640	5369200	Yes, and no I mean I here's the thing I'm not trashing the game because I haven't played the game Loki's
5369200	5373040	I guess somehow played or whatever I have not played the game, so I'm not trashing the game
5373040	5377440	But the designer is a butt nugget like I don't like reading about him
5377440	5381520	I don't like hearing about all his antics going on on the blogs going on right now
5381520	5385620	I think he's kind of an attention whore, and he's doing a decent job at it. I mean props to him
5385620	5388040	I just don't want to buy into it, so yeah
5388040	5390840	I do have a little steam cloud that's being brought up right now, but whatever
5390840	5395080	It's every gamer gets a voice so if you want to bring it up then fine, but look
5396600	5400000	No, I know I'm just saying you know and I don't really want to talk about him on the show
5400000	5402480	I'm sorry I even mentioned. I played the demo again, but
5403380	5406800	Really, I mean yeah, you shouldn't judge a game based on the demo
5406800	5409400	but the demo gives you a good idea of how the game is gonna be and
5410840	5415320	You know that's how you base. You know when you play a demo for a game. That's basically what it is
5415320	5419920	it's to get an idea what the full game is going to be so you can make a decision whether you want to purchase it or
5419920	5424400	Not and based on what I've seen so far. It looks very amateurish
5424440	5431920	It's not very good gameplay, and there are some really annoying parts that just would drive me crazy, and I
5432560	5439160	Not plan on picking it up ever if it even ever comes out, and I could definitely see why Nintendo wouldn't want to
5439920	5443960	You know if it were up to them to publish the game or something I would see them
5443960	5447600	Not picking this up most definitely. I mean there's avenues
5447600	5451320	He can go through there's like for example a company called graffiti interactive that
5451480	5455720	They've put out a game or they're about to put out a game if it ever comes out
5457040	5459040	black sigil
5459200	5460880	the
5460880	5462880	Say the mark of the exile or something like that
5463760	5465960	it used to be a homebrew game and
5466760	5470960	They developers worked on it, and they made an actual full-fledged
5470960	5474880	Ds game, and it looks okay, it looks like a pretty good RPG
5475080	5479800	But that's the way you do it you go through one of these smaller companies to publish your game until your game is you know?
5479800	5485560	Hot shit, you know if it comes out, and it's really awesome then cool, but honestly based of what I see if this game
5486000	5492480	If this is a half an hour worth of his game say and you know his full games like you know hundreds of hours long
5492480	5497720	Or something like that. I could not see myself playing this game for another 30 minutes let alone hundreds of hours gold anthro
5497720	5500080	Let's let you make a counterpoint because obviously you feel differently
5500080	5502600	What do you want to say well well?
5505360	5508400	Okay, I'm gonna throw the echo in and stuff
5510160	5514460	Sorry, this is getting really distracting you guys kind of I can hear myself right now
5514600	5519160	Make sure your speakers are turned down there in-house or whatever sometimes. We have those issues on Skype
5519160	5524280	I have I have a headset. I'm just gonna keep talking like nothing happened. Basically. I don't know
5524280	5528160	I'm gonna wait till a full review comes out for the game first and
5528160	5532780	If people say it sucks, then then I'm going to probably leave them
5533360	5539160	Very I'm just it's my opinion fair enough, and you know that's cool, but here's my my question to you
5539160	5542300	What do you think about all the antics such as the?
5543000	5546960	leafing of the Nintendo store and the locking himself in the room I
5549240	5551240	Think that was a little overboard and
5551240	5558400	If it really well even if it really was an act it got it got all these people like to create drama on the internet
5558400	5562640	And not that I should really care what people in the internet think but yeah, it's kind of I
5563440	5568240	Can see what where he was trying what he was trying to do is trying to be original, but?
5569000	5573880	The echoing went away, which is good, and it, but I think he's trying to see how it was trying to be original
5573880	5578880	But I think he also got a lot of people falsely worried over something that really didn't even happen
5578880	5582760	So I guess I can see where that came from the game for itself though. I
5584200	5587000	Think it's my it is my kind of game
5587000	5591680	I I'm just interested in alone in the fact that it's it was made by one person
5591680	5596180	And it took that long and not much effort, so I am going to probably give it a try
5596880	5598880	But it was made by one person
5599520	5603720	So you gotta say that again look yeah, I had us muted. I was gonna say let me put it this way
5603720	5608680	It looks like it was made by one person. I mean it shows and that is not a compliment all
5609680	5613300	Right both anthro. We got to let you go, but you know what that's fine. No fine
5613300	5617680	And this will be the last hopefully that we get to talk about I just wanted to put my opinion
5617680	5618960	I was thinking about that
5618960	5623120	The whole time that you guys have been talking about this ever since you first started. That's fine
5623120	5627800	You know what we don't mind being called out, so thank you for the call and have a good one
5628240	5629840	Okay, all right later
5629840	5635080	It's the show where every gamer has a voice even if you're a Bob fan even if the guy is kind of a what?
5635080	5637080	Did I say butt nugget which the chat room see?
5638280	5642360	Cuz I'm so mature all right, so 80s. Did you finish your talk?
5642360	5647680	I don't think you quite finished the Xbox 360 e74 thing do we talk about the warranties are now extended
5647680	5652120	Yeah, they're basically extended it basically if you had a failure
5653560	5655960	You know recently I guess they're going to
5655960	5663720	Refund you know you your money by July 1st 2009 and you can claim
5663720	5665720	I guess you'll need to claim
5666840	5668840	Your repair something on
5669360	5671880	xbox.com support before November 1st
5672840	5677120	But so you have some time to go and if you were one of those people that got screwed didn't we have a caller that?
5677120	5677920	Was in that predicament
5677920	5681480	I want to say we got a call about this somebody got an e74 error and had to send it back and they were pissed
5681480	5686000	Cuz it's gonna cost $100 so a god. I hope you're still listening to the show go
5686520	5691200	Back and get your money back. I'm gonna take another call before we get into the next story. Hi. You're on orange launch radio
5691200	5693200	Who's this?
5693240	5699560	Breath law breast law I am so glad you called in because I did not get a chance to talk about the contest
5699560	5702120	Did you hear about the train wreck that was our show last week?
5703200	5709160	I we actually went over it on under sedation alive last night. Oh god, and I can only imagine
5709160	5713960	Oh, and I please don't tell me Travis has a recording. Please don't tell me Travis is recording
5714840	5719960	Well, it's Travis. What do you expect? Oh god. Alright, so so okay. Well quickly what happened on under station life
5720600	5724760	Well, we just went over it cuz I hadn't heard it and I just heard you go off and I'm like wow
5724760	5727760	I have never heard or I'll go off like that. That was a little surprising
5728160	5732720	You know, I thought like I saw the context of the conversation that sparked and I'm like
5732720	5734920	I might have done the same thing in this situation
5734920	5736360	So yeah, I gotta say though
5736360	5740840	I did listen to the playback because there is an archive of it somewhere I'm not gonna advertise where but um
5740840	5745560	I I just I laughed my ass off literally laughed my ass off at how Loki just
5746000	5750080	Didn't miss a beat and after I stormed out of the room Loki was just like, okay
5750080	5756080	Well, let's get back in in the news. Like I just I was just laughing so hard at that like Loki
5756080	5760600	So I didn't have a Perrier water. I mean for those of you don't know I was there a couple years ago
5760640	5764580	He needs his Perrier water or he gets grumpy. Shut up. Oh, alright
5764580	5768540	But well, what did you call it to talk about tonight? Let's get out of the way first
5769580	5772740	Well, I was obviously a director program at soccer con
5772740	5777020	I'm on the executive board and that was this past weekend and I had a fantastic time and
5777380	5781220	I actually gave Rob a call Thursday night because we had our
5781700	5785180	Industry guest autograph session and I had brought with me to this session
5785780	5792060	My personal copy of Dance Dance Revolution supernova for the PlayStation 2 and for those of you who have heard me
5792060	5797780	Fanboy about the con for the past year. One of the guests was smile DK
5799540	5801060	And
5801060	5802280	That's big for D
5802280	5806620	I like I know they're like some of our listeners are not gonna know who the hell that is and then there's gonna be other
5806620	5809500	People that are like, oh my god, that's like the DDR band
5810420	5816040	Basically the people who know who smell DK as were the people who voted DDR into the sweet 16 orange on radio March Madness
5816040	5818040	However, I digress. Yes
5818040	5821700	Um Veronica and uh, Hannah
5822920	5827000	Both signed the copy of DDR supernova in the colors scheme of the game
5827000	5830640	so one signatures in black ones in red and I have it and
5831400	5833400	I don't want it
5834280	5836380	How rude I know
5837120	5842360	So well and also what was really cool about it is not a lot of people knows
5842360	5844960	Let's listen to it. So I've been on a cane for about five six months
5845840	5847400	so
5847400	5850180	Smell DK actually signed my cane. Oh, wow
5851080	5854000	You're on a king there. What the hell happened to you? Are you okay?
5855000	5856440	well
5856440	5860460	You're going with a BMW and I didn't win. So I'm sorry to hear that
5861160	5865240	It's all good. But actually here in the coming weeks here on orange launch radio
5866080	5871680	Rob or myself or somebody will be organizing a contest and the prize will be this signed copy of Dance Dance Revolution
5871680	5878080	Supernova signed by smile DK which for if you're like a Bamani fan. This is a huge collector's item
5878520	5880520	This is this is priceless
5881200	5885200	It's it's really awesome. And um, I I do have to say that I
5886880	5892160	Mean I've been with the con for five years and this is the first time actually gave a crap about a guest being there and
5892480	5894480	The girls are so nice
5894480	5901480	Let me give you a little sample if you have no idea who smile DK is. Here you go. So
5911280	5913280	Happy you'll barf
5913840	5915840	Yeah, I
5916240	5920860	Mean and yeah anybody who's played even a lick of DDR is sort of smile DK
5920860	5926500	But we're gonna be coming up with a contest here in the coming weeks to give this away to one lucky listener
5926500	5930220	So I'd hope to do it tonight, but with everything else that have been going on with last week
5930220	5935140	We didn't get to it, but it would definitely probably next week or the week after but it'll definitely be something not just for life
5935140	5936860	But for podcast listeners
5936860	5943700	Yeah, it will be awesome. I will say definitely keep an eye on orange lounge radio.com. We will be thinking of something
5945980	5949980	Also, I in my incredibly late to the boat review
5949980	5952700	I finally got to play fallout 3 and
5953300	5959020	And I have to say it is one of the 10 greatest games I've ever played. That's a pretty shining review
5959020	5960700	Why do you like it so damn much?
5960700	5962420	well
5962420	5965600	It's basically oblivion for one. It's oblivion without the suck
5966420	5971100	Wait a minute. Wait a damn. Yeah oblivion does not suck, sir
5971100	5976100	I'm sorry Rob if you want to if you want to compare it tomorrow wind it it's it's a horrible game
5976100	5982660	Whatever. All right. All right, whatever. Well and no and the the older school series has progressively gotten better
5982660	5985340	and then oblivion just kind of took the series in a nosedive, but
5986900	5993980	It was just the combat system was fun, you know a little if you're listening to the radio stations and you're walking around that's hilarious
5996140	6000260	The story kept kept me going it was really one of the it was the first game
6000540	6004940	Since like I was back in my ps1 days is like a Final Fantasy fanboy
6004940	6008780	Where I stayed up till 4 in the morning to play the freaking game Wow
6009420	6011860	Was that because you were still on a high from Sakura condo?
6012460	6015540	No, this is before soccer con like, okay
6015540	6020380	I I've been on an unemployment spat and I that's over with but um, I've
6020900	6026740	basically my week my weeks have been consisted of playing Wow or some video game and I played fallout 3 for a week straight and
6026740	6028740	Then beat it
6028940	6032440	But uh, yeah, it's it's seriously that good
6032440	6038640	Well that I have yet to play the game. I feel so out of touch, but one of these days I'll sit down with it
6040080	6045200	Yeah, DMN bring us back on track here a little bit if you can because we got to get back into Xbox 360 news and
6045200	6050520	Back into the show, but we've been talking about how the warranties were just recently extended for the e74 errors for Xbox 360
6051160	6054880	I don't know if there's any any comment you have on that whole thing, but
6055640	6061280	I'm not I actually cannot comment on it. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot where you're at now. All right
6061280	6066920	That's fine. Sorry Rob. Do you kill joy? Let me well, how about Final Fantasy 13?
6066920	6072360	Can you say anything about Final Fantasy 13 and and the hype surrounding it since that's something we're demoing on Justin TV tonight. I
6073160	6075160	I will say from the footage I've seen
6077160	6083760	This game better live up to the hype or I am I'm not touching a Final Fantasy game from from 13 on
6085000	6087000	It looks like it might be pretty hot
6087000	6093720	Because 12 12 was a step up because I think the series has progressively gone down since 8 I hated 9
6093720	6098960	I hated 10 don't get me started about 10 to if I say anything bad about 11, you're gonna hang up on me
6099920	6101400	and
6101400	6103680	12 12 was a step in the right direction. It was a good game
6103680	6108040	It brought it back to the fantasy roots and kept and the game kept being fun
6109040	6114320	So I have high hopes for 13, but if 13 is a disappointment, I'm I'm done with Final Fantasy
6114320	6116880	All right, fair enough. All right
6116880	6120160	Well Dman, we're gonna let you go so you get back into the show and have a good one
6120160	6122760	And we'll definitely be hearing from you in the coming weeks and your own show
6122760	6124760	Give it a plug real quick for you. Hang up on you
6125080	6130400	under sedation live every Saturday here on all games at 8 Pacific 11 Eastern if you like
6131440	6133000	vulgarity and
6133000	6139360	Geekery and whatnot and laughs be sure to tune in dick fart jokes sci-fi talking boobs pretty much, right?
6140080	6142500	Yep. All right. Sounds great. Have a good one Dman
6142500	6147620	Hey later, buddy. Bye our breasts Lowell. I keep forgetting he changed his name officially
6147620	6150140	It's like you know, everyone still calls Prince Prince after he changed his name
6150140	6155100	All right back into some news back as some gaming news bubble bobble is actually returning to the Xbox 360
6155740	6157980	Bubble bobble is apparently coming out
6157980	6165780	I guess it's Taito bringing this out bubble bobble neo is the name of the game and apparently this is discovered on some foreign release
6165780	6171140	Date list is from Germany's video game rating board. It's actually for Xbox Live arcade
6171140	6176180	They're thinking I want to say didn't we have a story on this a while ago where we heard that this is coming out for
6176180	6182460	Arcade I thought I don't remember that. I thought I remember we were a while ago. Oh, yeah, we were I think so
6182460	6185500	this is probably just a port of it for Xbox 360 and
6186020	6190340	There's probably a PlayStation 3 one around the corner as well. It makes sense. I'm sure it is
6190420	6195980	Yeah act deaf in our chat room chat that orange lesser day comm says bubble bobble neo. You are the one
6196500	6200140	Get it old-school joke, by the way. I saw a matrix reloaded for
6200140	6204020	Six dollars on DVD at Suncoast the other day. Yeah
6204740	6210420	Those older catalog tiles are cheap and one more comment from dark Tetsuya Rob, but can you get past level 30?
6211380	6215100	They will never live that down and rightfully so Christ. Yeah
6217180	6223220	Well, Jonathan blow the creator of the hit puzzle game braid has
6224100	6228660	Revealed that there's a hidden level editor within the PC version
6228660	6236460	Apparently, he's been kind of teasing it. He says one more people have played a slash finished the game
6237260	6240140	There will be an update to unlock it
6241340	6244620	You know, it says basically a level editor will allow players
6245260	6247580	to extend the life of the puzzle title with
6248100	6254340	The potential to add up to another full game worth of puzzles Wow, and you can also implement
6254340	6260020	New things into it including importing your own images from Photoshop. What's manics?
6260700	6262700	You know stuff like that. So
6262780	6267580	That's gonna be pretty neat. I wonder is this something that you know, will you be able to share levels with other people?
6267580	6271340	Maybe I'm sure you probably could that's a bummer that the Xbox 360 crowd missed out on that
6272020	6275580	Yeah, that kind of sucks. But you know, there could always be that happens, I guess
6276100	6283180	Alright, uh, let's see to also talk about Xbox 360 bionic commando is gonna be getting a multiplayer demo very soon coming to Xbox live
6283180	6288460	As in this month if you want to check that out no word about the PlayStation 3 version of the demo yet
6288460	6293060	But apparently you will get a full 8 player bionic commando multiplayer demo
6293060	6297140	The map is called vertigo that you're gonna get technically the map is built for 16
6297340	6303420	But of course, this is just a demo they're gonna limit it to 8 that is coming out later this month in April both team
6303420	6308020	That's deathmatch and capture the flag mode. So that should be interesting
6308020	6311820	I mean, I don't know how I feel about these, you know, I love old-school bionic commando
6311820	6315980	But I'm not sure if I'm gonna be into it as a first-person shooter type game, but we'll see
6315980	6318860	I definitely want to give it a shot. I guess that's the whole reason behind a demo, right?
6319060	6321940	Yeah, so check that out when it comes out a little later this month
6322020	6327900	I'm very interested in the demo demo looks all the game looks awesome. So yeah, I definitely give it a try
6328100	6329780	You know as we heard from the caller earlier
6329780	6332420	I shouldn't base my whole opinion on the game off a demo
6332420	6337780	But here's one of those cases where it's like it's definitely gonna sway me like either it's gonna show me that I'm interested in this
6337780	6342380	Game whatsoever or that I just know I can sit this one out and just I think no
6342380	6345620	I think you can't you can't review a game based off of demo
6345620	6348700	I mean you can't just say okay this game's gonna suck because of the demo
6348700	6352260	But at the same time it gives you a good impression of how the game's gonna be it
6352940	6360220	Usually a demo I've never seen a demo that was just absolute crap and the game was just awesome. You know, so I
6361220	6362820	Don't know it usually
6362820	6367060	It's a good indicator of how the game's gonna be I gotta read some comments from chat before you get into the next story
6367060	6371740	Loki some comments from chat SSJ 100 Matt says on the braid story in the level editor
6371740	6375380	the real question is why haven't hackers found the code for this feature already and
6375860	6381980	Death wishing says Photoshop levels Oh God penis land platformer. Yeah, you know, you're gonna see plenty of those levels on YouTube
6381980	6385660	I don't know why people haven't found it yet. Maybe they weren't looking for it
6385660	6388820	Maybe part of its missing and that's what's in the patch maybe
6389660	6391660	Maybe it's a whole Resident Evil
6392060	6394980	You know multiplayer type situation
6394980	6396980	Um
6397060	6399940	Interesting enough this we've been hearing you
6400940	6407020	Constant rumors of some old-school arcade games from Sega coming to Xbox Live arcade
6407060	6413000	well now there's a little bit more confirmation about it including achievements that have basically been
6414020	6421740	Appearing online my gamer card has dug up achievements for altered beasts comic zone and shinobi all three of those
6421740	6429380	Tiles belonging to the you know, kind of classic arcade collection that's been available or will be available online
6429820	6431740	so
6431740	6437580	You know, it's interesting those they didn't mention anything about Sonic 3 Gunstar Heroes and Phantasy Star 2
6438420	6442780	But you maybe those are coming later on but at least these three probably soon enough
6443900	6450140	Now, why would I care though if I already have that other collection? I don't know it just this seems kind of useless
6450140	6454860	I mean, you're wrong. These games are pretty rad. But well, it's the same reason why they release, you know
6454860	6460940	Pac-man on Xbox Live arcade one, you know, it's available in you know, the Namco collection as well
6460940	6463380	You know, it's just another way for people who died
6463380	6467380	But I mean Pac-man is like ten dollars and that collections like, you know, 30 or 40
6467420	6471860	You're talking about this collection is 30 bucks and you get what like 25 30 games
6472380	6479140	40 40 games or some shit. Okay, so I think it's like $40 40 games, whatever versus being like five dollars for one individual game
6479140	6483060	That's a huge difference huge difference. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean
6483380	6487720	It's this just doesn't make sense. This is for definitely the impulse buyer or something, right?
6488140	6491300	Maybe achievement horse. Oh, I guess achievement horse
6491300	6495900	Well, they were unless they are going back and altering the actual code of the games, but I highly doubt that
6496580	6498660	Yeah, I doubt it. I'm sorry
6498660	6501740	I thought Xbox got a little stricter on what they were gonna let get on the the
6502260	6506220	Service and they weren't just gonna let all these old ports get on there, but it seems like that's what's happening
6506220	6508220	We
6508860	6509900	They
6509900	6514740	Go where the money is, I guess I guess I guess if they can even make $20 off it. It's worth it
6514740	6515620	I guess
6515620	6520700	All right. Well anyhow, we're gonna get in the part of the show where you get to interact with us through the email
6520940	6525860	This is a good way for the podcasters to get involved when they can't listen live mailbag orange launch radio calm
6525860	6528380	Let's open up eat old mailbag. Let's see what's in there
6531700	6534460	Again we always invite your emails and mailbag orange launch radio calm
6534460	6538540	We've got a shitload to get through tonight because we haven't been able to do it for a week or so
6539180	6542260	First email tonight is gonna come to us from James
6543100	6546020	Patrick is the username. I've recently moved to Taiwan
6546020	6549180	I was wondering how easy is it to mod a 360 to play import games?
6549260	6552180	Can I mod my 360 be region 3 and play online?
6552700	6556620	Games that release over here are much cheaper about 40 to 45 dollars after conversion
6556740	6561820	Depending on the store in the current exchange rate plus a lot of the Asian versions over here are marked saying the manual and game
6561820	6565540	Is in English I'd like to buy these games since the cheaper price tag adds up fast
6565540	6569820	I'm not experienced with modding, but I know Loki is basically I'd like to have a region 3 360
6569820	6572480	Plus I have a lot of American games don't want to have two of them any advice
6572780	6577820	There's no way to have a region free 360. You can either buy region free games or you can
6579220	6587080	You know get a mod chip and change your region of your 360 to be an agent Asian region free now 360. That's it
6587080	6592680	Next question comes from stir lock. Hi guys stir lock here from Sonoma County. Hey, that's almost a neighbor of ours
6592680	6597400	Howdy, I've been great wine by the way. I've been listening for a couple years now and love the show
6597400	6601040	I want to thank dark Sakura for mentioning mentioning the FC mobile last week
6601040	6604640	I picked one up and it totally rocks despite the button layout being a bit strange
6604880	6611000	Nothing beats playing Mike Tyson's punch-out on the bus. Anyway, keep up the great work PS. Where can I find brilliant to rave?
6611000	6615080	I've been looking for a while and can't seem to find it anywhere what he's mentioning you guys is
6615080	6621080	A song that was played in the live only segment of our show because obviously we can't play licensed music on the podcast
6621080	6625080	But there was a remix of an old song from DDR called brilliant to you
6625080	6630080	But the song was brilliant to rave that's from the new diverse system film diverse systems
6630080	6633080	Where can they order that if they want to get that diverse dot?
6633080	6635080	JP
6635080	6637080	Next email comes from Robert M
6637080	6642080	The first question was for Jamie about samurai showdown anthologies. I can't answer that sadly. She's not here
6642080	6648080	Secondly is the Sanrio character officially named Hello Kitty or she just named Kitty and her franchise is Hello Kitty. Just curious
6648080	6653080	I believe the franchise is Hello Kitty, but I don't know as much I think it's she's called Hello Kitty
6653080	6657080	I'm yeah as much as I claim to be the whore of
6657080	6664080	Sanrio I actually don't know maybe one of our chatters knows, but I'm pretty sure it's still Hello Kitty
6664080	6669080	Anyway, he continues on with some follow-up emails. Sorry to hear about Rob Smith
6669080	6674080	He continues on with some follow-up emails. Sorry to hear about Rob's video card and hopefully the idiot who made that comment is banned
6674080	6676080	I can't seem to get in chat myself lately
6676080	6680080	Which may be related to a Java era on my end since I can't seem to get into chat room for Bobby shows either
6680080	6684080	If I want to make a donation to help out and don't really want to use PayPal for whatever reason
6684080	6687080	Where can I send a check because I'm really looking forward to hearing next week's show
6687080	6693080	It sounds like the other listeners took care of that and that's a very generous thing to offer hang on to it
6693080	6699080	I'm hoping in in the coming weeks we can have other ways that you guys can throw money at us if you really really want to
6699080	6703080	That we'll put to good use. I know we've been talking shirts for like three years
6703080	6708080	I really want to make that happen in the near future. It's just it's just time and everything else going on
6708080	6711080	Hopefully soon, so we'll let you know
6711080	6718080	Also, there was one other follow-up email that came in
6718080	6724080	I apologize if I was out of line stating that the chatter who asked why Rob bothered trying to run out of the show again should be banned
6724080	6728080	As I said I wasn't in chat, so I have no context of the comment just Rob's reaction
6728080	6730080	I absolutely understand that in a stressful situation
6730080	6734080	Especially as one as serious as computer failure such criticism is most unwelcome and hurtful
6734080	6738080	I have no intention of defending his comments, but I can't say I have the right to condemn them either
6738080	6740080	That said I still hope the situation with your hardware improves
6740080	6745080	I find not being able to listen to my favorite podcast to be as frustrating as you not being able to get it running
6745080	6748080	If I'm able to contribute a small donation, et cetera, et cetera
6748080	6750080	So thank you very much for the kind words
6750080	6755080	And you know it looks like we're all in good shape now and everything's hunky-dory happy
6755080	6758080	And you know it was just it was just a bad week
6758080	6762080	Some weeks are good weeks and some weeks are bad weeks and let's just leave it at that
6762080	6765080	An email from Cheeseburger asks
6765080	6769080	I was wondering if there is an Xbox Live OLR clan name like the OL Army
6769080	6772080	Or at least a motto that all OLR listeners can have
6772080	6776080	Why yes we do have one, the OLR clan is the OL Army
6776080	6777080	That is the official clan
6777080	6779080	We have a Steam community available
6779080	6782080	If you look a lot of our clans are right there on OrangeLaunchRadio.com
6782080	6785080	If you look on that little left side there's a box that says like
6785080	6789080	God it has all the other logos of the other sites
6789080	6791080	And it's like OLR around the net or something like that
6791080	6793080	And I can't remember the name of it
6793080	6795080	Son of a gun I'm going to OrangeLaunchRadio.com right now
6795080	6797080	Extended Play that's what it's called
6797080	6800080	And it has links to a lot of our communities we're in including the Steam community
6800080	6802080	Yes the OL Army motto is
6802080	6804080	Loki, do you know it?
6804080	6805080	Don't be a dick
6805080	6806080	Don't be a dick that is the OLR motto
6806080	6809080	Because if you're going to play games online with listeners of our show
6809080	6810080	Please don't be a dick
6810080	6813080	Because there's enough of those there out on Xbox Live
6813080	6815080	People that are just absolute jerks and all of that
6815080	6820080	So if you want to be in the OL Army you need to swear that you're not going to be a dick
6820080	6822080	Alright next up from
6822080	6826080	Let's see this listener goes by
6826080	6831080	It's not signed, oh it's Spazinator in the email address
6831080	6833080	Hi everyone I thought I would email you folks some questions and comments
6833080	6836080	Well more of a recommendation than a comment but I won't get into semantics
6836080	6840080	Since you three have professed the love of all things DDR on numerous occasions
6840080	6842080	Well hold on
6842080	6844080	Hold on I wouldn't go that far
6844080	6848080	We used to all love DDR but DDR got really stale in the past few years
6848080	6850080	I just want to clarify that
6850080	6852080	So we don't love all things DDR
6852080	6856080	I think there will always be love for DDR because without it we would have never met
6856080	6859080	But that doesn't mean we love each and every game that comes out of the franchise
6859080	6861080	Perhaps you can explain something to me
6861080	6863080	What exactly is the reasons that you get into these games
6863080	6865080	I get stuff like Rock Band and Guitar Hero
6865080	6869080	But the idea behind pushing arrows to music I've never heard of before doesn't seem very interesting
6869080	6870080	Well to me anyway
6870080	6872080	Oh that was just fun
6872080	6874080	I know it was just fun it was such a different type of arcade game
6874080	6877080	I mean you moved you know what I mean
6877080	6879080	Like it wasn't just you stood there
6879080	6882080	And for me here's the thing also and maybe it's just me
6882080	6884080	I suck at fighting games
6884080	6886080	I was never very good at them
6886080	6889080	I wasn't very good at a lot of the types of games like shooter games that were in the arcade
6889080	6892080	But when it came to the music games like I was pretty good at it
6892080	6895080	You know what I mean like it was the type of game I could get into and be good at
6895080	6897080	Because I was into music in high school
6897080	6899080	And I know Jamie has a musical background
6899080	6901080	I know Loki likes to mix music
6901080	6905080	He's a big fan of music and has like music as a hobby you could say
6905080	6907080	I think that's one common thing we all have
6907080	6909080	Not to say you're not into music
6909080	6913080	But definitely I think it's something that enables us to be into DDR so much more
6913080	6915080	I think would be a big part of it
6915080	6917080	Makes sense fair enough
6917080	6918080	Yeah
6918080	6920080	Have any of you played Comet Crash yet?
6920080	6923080	If not I recommend picking it up from the PSN store
6923080	6926080	It's another tower defense game like Pixel Junk Monsters
6926080	6929080	It has more of a sci-fi feel and you can send vehicles on the offensive
6929080	6931080	Whereas PJ Monsters is purely defensive
6931080	6934080	Personally after playing this game for a week I would recommend getting this title
6934080	6937080	For my last subject question and on a semi related note
6937080	6940080	Have you played Ragdoll Kung Fu yet?
6940080	6942080	If so what are your impressions of the game?
6942080	6943080	Haven't played it
6943080	6945080	Haven't played it yet, it looked okay
6945080	6946080	Is it worth getting?
6946080	6949080	From what little I've seen it looks like a cross between the Super Smash Brothers games
6949080	6952080	And parodies of classic Hong Kong Kung Fu movies from the 60s and 70s
6952080	6954080	Is this a fair assessment?
6954080	6957080	I heard it wasn't as fun as it seemed really
6957080	6962080	Since neither of us have played it we'll have to ask the chat room if there's any follow up comments on that one
6962080	6965080	Lastly
6965080	6969080	I want to read
6969080	6971080	He sent another email later in the week
6971080	6974080	That went into this
6974080	6979080	I've come across some rumors or speculation from another websites and podcasts within the relatively near future
6979080	6982080	PSN will either be receiving more PS1 titles for download
6982080	6985080	Or at least a minimum we will hear some kind of official announcement of some kind
6985080	6988080	That will reportedly occur no later than E3
6988080	6991080	Furthermore it's been suggested that if new PS1 games do become available
6991080	6994080	This batch will be some of Capcom's classic PS1 titles
6994080	6996080	Oh I hope Mega Man Legends is in there
6996080	7000080	I thought I remember seeing something from Capcom and more PS1 games
7000080	7004080	Well I remember seeing something about Marvel vs Capcom 2 achievements on 360
7004080	7005080	Remember that
7005080	7009080	Also another rumor suggested that in tandem with the release of Capcom PS1 titles
7009080	7012080	An upgraded version of SNK vs Capcom 2 will be coming out at the same time
7012080	7014080	Oh shit I hope that's true
7014080	7016080	That's one fighting game I can get into
7016080	7018080	That is like one of my favorite fighting games ever
7018080	7021080	It's been suggested that SVC2 will
7021080	7023080	Wasn't it Capcom vs SNK?
7023080	7029080	Anyway we'll get the same HD remix treatment as Super Puzzle Fighter and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo did before this
7029080	7033080	As I've stated these are still just rumors until some kind of official announcement is made one way or another
7033080	7037080	But this does give us something to possibly look forward to if proven to be true
7037080	7038080	That would be cool
7038080	7039080	Interesting
7039080	7043080	Let me read this last thing because this will be the last email here for me about tonight
7043080	7045080	Also from Spaznator
7045080	7049080	As you probably already know PS3 owners at their discretion can install another operating system on their system
7049080	7051080	Usually Yellow Dog Linux
7051080	7053080	What benefit does this ultimately give you if any?
7053080	7054080	What's the appeal in doing this?
7054080	7058080	Does this ultimately give you open source equivalents to like Microsoft's Word, Excel and so on?
7058080	7062080	I already know I won't be able to play Linux supported PC games due to RAM limitations
7062080	7063080	That's a given
7063080	7065080	Furthermore should I decide to take the proverbial plunge
7065080	7067080	Where can I buy the disc to install Linux?
7067080	7070080	You don't buy the disc you can download it off the internet
7070080	7072080	You can burn an ISO that way
7072080	7075080	You could buy, they have Linux that's available
7075080	7080080	I one time bought it at Best Buy because that was back when I was on dial up
7080080	7086080	And if I remember correctly I think I was doing that because of something about installing some sort of mod or something
7086080	7088080	On a PlayStation 2 or something, I don't remember what it was
7088080	7094080	But yeah, basically you would download it off the internet and then burn your own disc
7094080	7097080	Now that doesn't answer though, why?
7097080	7099080	Why? To tinker with
7099080	7105080	That's really the only reason, I mean you're going to be able to basically run a few things
7105080	7107080	Probably like some emulators and stuff like that
7107080	7110080	You're not going to be able to run any big games or anything
7110080	7112080	But it's basically just to tinker with
7112080	7117080	I'm kind of getting the impression that if you would be interested in this you already know
7117080	7121080	You know what I mean? Like if this is something that would really interest you, you already know this would interest you
7121080	7122080	Right?
7122080	7123080	Yeah
7123080	7127080	Alright, if you're the type of person that wants to try and put Linux on a toaster and all this shit then you already know
7127080	7131080	And it also stops people from trying to hack the system to put Linux on it
7131080	7132080	By just opening it up?
7132080	7133080	Yep
7133080	7140080	And that's a really fair response, you know, Sony kind of bowed down to the hackers in that regard I guess, I don't know
7140080	7142080	Alright, well there you have it, that's our mailbag
7142080	7146080	If you want to send us some more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7146080	7148080	Let's get back into some gaming news, we have a few more
7148080	7149080	Loki
7149080	7151080	Yes, this was fun
7151080	7157080	I got an email from my boss regarding this game because he saw a little thing on MTV about it
7157080	7165080	But apparently there's a developer putting out a, well right now it basically exists as an Unreal 3 mod
7165080	7167080	But a game called Ghetto Golf
7167080	7173080	Basically they describe the game as kind of combining Happy Gilmore with Friday
7173080	7177080	And the game itself looks very interesting
7177080	7183080	Kind of cool actually, this was actually a full fledged download for Unreal Tournament 3
7183080	7191080	And I don't think it's available yet, but if it was, I would probably pick up Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 to at least install this
7191080	7197080	Because you remember they do run, those mods will work on the PS3 version
7197080	7202080	But as of right now it's basically just a mod
7202080	7209080	But it's kind of cool though because it kind of combines combat with golf and, I don't know, it just looks neat
7209080	7212080	It's different
7212080	7217080	Interesting, but no idea if there's any release because they still need somebody to pick it up basically right?
7217080	7223080	Yeah, basically it says right now Ghetto Golf exists as an Unreal Tournament 3 mod
7223080	7230080	Illphonic, the publisher, the developer wants a publisher to support its development into a standalone download game
7230080	7234080	For Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam
7234080	7238080	But apparently you can check out the Ghetto Golf
7238080	7242080	It's GhettoGolf.illphonic.com
7242080	7248080	And you can check out the game's official website which has nothing other than a splash screen saying coming soon
7248080	7256080	But I don't know, I would like to download this at least if it's available and try it out as a mod
7256080	7263080	I love their website which is awesome, it's got three links here
7263080	7266080	The business, upcoming shit, and contact us
7266080	7268080	Nice, very professional
7268080	7272080	By the way, ActDeft in our chat room right now brings up a really good point
7272080	7275080	I don't know if maybe somebody else said it but I noticed ActDeft is posting the link
7275080	7281080	Kind of a follow up to the question we got in the email bag about where can I join an OLR army or how can I be part of an OLR clan
7281080	7286080	In case you forgot, in the midst of all the avatars and all this on Xbox 360
7286080	7293080	OLR does have an official gamer pic that actually is available for download officially through Microsoft on the gamer marketplace
7293080	7299080	And now with the whole online integration, ActDeft is posting a link in chat right now
7299080	7301080	You can just click on that and it will put it in your queue to download
7301080	7305080	It is free and it's part of a gamer pic collection of a bunch of all games radio shows
7305080	7312080	So you get all games interactive, Bobby Blackwolf and some of the other video game outsiders and some of the other shows that are on the network
7312080	7316080	All have a little gamer pic that you can wear with pride on your little gamer card
7316080	7320080	Because everybody has a freaking avatar so now it's unique to not have an avatar
7320080	7324080	You know what I mean? So check that out if you would like
7324080	7329080	Meanwhile I want to move into another story here real quick about the game Demigod
7329080	7335080	I did not, I barely know anything about this game but I know it was a game put out by Stardock
7335080	7340080	And I know that they were trying like a new kind of thing where they weren't going to try to combat piracy so much in this game
7340080	7343080	But here's the thing, I don't know if this came back to bite him in the butt or what
7343080	7350080	But apparently he went to the blog and said that 120,000 people connected to this game on launch day
7350080	7353080	Only 18,000 were legitimate customers
7353080	7359080	And here's the thing too about, this was a compound problem basically
7359080	7364080	Can I say this real quick though? Is that they had tested this for 50,000 players at peak times
7364080	7367080	They were not ready for this type of load
7367080	7377080	Yeah and it also hurt them the fact that the game was released by Gamestop early because they broke street on it
7377080	7384080	And of course they claim it's Stardock's problem for not telling them it had a street date which is a load of crap
7384080	7388080	But according to them that's why and so because it leaked out there early
7388080	7395080	Not only did they have to basically stay Easter weekend to get the servers online and that kind of stuff
7395080	7402080	But also hacker groups got a hold of the game earlier and so now less people
7402080	7410080	Now that it's available for download before the game actually really comes out everywhere else
7410080	7415080	A lot of people just said screw it I'm just going to go download it because I really want to play this game
7415080	7417080	Which is too bad
7417080	7422080	That's a bummer because Stardock was really taking a risk by not putting copy protection on the games
7422080	7425080	And to kind of have it come back and bite him in the ass kind of sucks
7425080	7433080	I mean yeah well now gamers can't bitch if you know the Stardocks next game has some sort of DRM on it
7433080	7437080	Well too bad you guys didn't buy the last one so oh well
7437080	7441080	Alright so you know I don't know but this whole situation just gets us a little bit angsty
7441080	7461080	And just seemed like the appropriate time to drop in a regular segment we do here on the show called the FUs of the week
7461080	7466080	Now DarkSakura isn't here tonight to start us off but I'm sure if she were here she would say something along the lines of
7466080	7472080	God I hate traffic on the way to LA and there was this one driver who really pissed me off and blah blah blah
7472080	7474080	FU to stupid drivers
7474080	7477080	I'd say FU to stupid parents because she's at Disneyland obviously
7477080	7479080	That could be too
7479080	7481080	Alright well Loki what's your FUs of the week
7481080	7490080	FU to a sore throat that I have right now because I hope I'm not getting sick because I don't really like being sick right now
7490080	7491080	That sucks
7491080	7496080	FU to candy for being so delicious I've been sitting here and I've eaten like 30 little butterscotch disc things
7496080	7501080	And I thought that was the type of candy that like 70 year olds are supposed to enjoy but I love those little butterscotch discs
7501080	7505080	I don't know what it is I got like a giant bag of them for a dollar at Walmart
7505080	7509080	And they're so addicting and I know I'm going to break all my teeth on them but I don't care
7509080	7511080	FU to candy for being delicious
7511080	7513080	Well that was a short FU segment
7513080	7517080	Alright well Loki has some news about the PSP
7517080	7523080	Yes I do, the PSP of course you may remember that there was an exploit that came out
7523080	7526080	Another TIFF file overflow
7526080	7529080	You would think that they would figure out not to do that
7529080	7535080	Or to at least protect against that because almost every single version of the PSP has been broken that way
7535080	7548080	But apparently the new PSP 3000's there is a TIFF exploit that they're now kind of working into a new version of the HEN operating system or homebrew enablers
7548080	7550080	What basically they call it
7550080	7561080	So the HEN will now be, they're going to be stripping it down, the enabler and they're going to be adding some features of the M33 custom firmwares
7561080	7568080	And it will allow you to boot up homebrew regardless but maybe restrictive to certain applications right now
7568080	7577080	So looks like they're not coming out with a new firmware yet but they are going to be adding a program that will allow you to run homebrew on a PSP 3000
7577080	7585080	Which is the first step to an actual custom firmware being installed onto this new system so it's only a matter of time
7585080	7592080	You just can't stop them, you just can't stop those hackers from getting in the PSP
7592080	7596080	Even when the PSP 2 comes out, I'm sorry, it's not going to be un-hackable
7596080	7597080	Even when it's all digital download?
7597080	7602080	Even when it's all, it doesn't matter, this is all digital file so it doesn't matter
7602080	7612080	Alright, well anyhow, MotionPlus on the Nintendo Wii, don't expect that your old Wii games are suddenly going to support MotionPlus
7612080	7619080	Apparently you might be thinking, wouldn't it be great if they would release a patch that would patch some of my old games to support MotionPlus
7619080	7624080	Well, here's the thing, I guess it's according to Game Daily who ran a report on this
7624080	7629080	With a nearly two month span of time between the accessory release and the game's arrival at retail
7629080	7634080	We expect that Nintendo will release patches that will make the new accessory work with your already existing library
7634080	7637080	And the first would be of course Wii Sports
7637080	7645080	But a fat chance, Game Daily, according to Nintendo, quote, the Wii MotionPlus accessory is only for games that are designed to make use of its abilities
7645080	7651080	But also something to consider, the Wii really can't patch its games, if you think about it
7651080	7654080	It can patch the firmware, but they can't really patch the games
7654080	7662080	Yeah, they don't have anything built in to where it will read a common area of the Broadway CPU
7662080	7666080	A very thorough article on this, by the way, at HackMii.com
7666080	7674080	Yes, and unfortunately because of all these restrictions and stuff on where the games can read data from
7674080	7680080	It would be physically impossible for them to release any patches whatsoever
7680080	7685080	So that's how you get problems like missing Switches and stuff in Tomb Raider or Underworld for the Wii
7685080	7689080	And there's nothing they can do about it, because they can't patch their game afterwards
7689080	7697080	Way to be forward thinking Nintendo, in fact they basically say that all in all the Wii software stack is designed with little to no future proofing
7697080	7704080	There's basically zero provisions for any future updates, even obvious things like new storage devices or game patches
7704080	7712080	What's worse is that this will affect compatibility mode of any future Wii successor
7712080	7724080	Just like the DS titles won't get any WPA support on the DSi, effectively making the DSi's WPA mode useless if you want to use DS titles online
7724080	7730080	And it says the DS Wi-Fi drivers and configuration stack are built into every game
7730080	7733080	Well don't worry, that's why you'll have new new play control
7733080	7736080	For your favorite games like Metroid and Pikmin
7736080	7747080	It's just really sad that such a company that thinks ahead that really is innovative can be so uninnovative at the same time
7747080	7752080	It's like they're so far ahead and they're so far behind at the same time
7752080	7754080	Oh well
7754080	7758080	Alright, we've got a couple more stories for you guys and then believe it or not we're getting towards the end of this show
7758080	7766080	We'll open up the Skype line one more time in just a minute to take your kind of potpourri any thoughts you have after a couple more stories here
7766080	7768080	And then get ready to close out the show believe it or not
7768080	7778080	Yes, well you may remember that there was a lawsuit with the NFL players and basically EA and the NFL and all that stuff
7778080	7788080	Basically they were entitled royalties for using their likenesses and stuff like that in games. This is basically retired NFL players
7788080	7795080	They've already received 28 million dollars in a settlement before
7795080	7801080	But now they're going to be targeting John Madden and EA exclusively
7801080	7810080	And apparently I guess a whole other mess to try to get some more money
7810080	7819080	Granted they should be guaranteed some money for having their likenesses shown but I don't know
7819080	7821080	Whatever
7821080	7823080	Money money money
7823080	7828080	Just another sue happy thing or do they have something legitimately to complain about?
7828080	7830080	EA is profiting off these names
7830080	7833080	That's why they pay license fees right?
7833080	7840080	Yeah, according to Cleveland Browns Bernie Parrish on a blog he put
7840080	7850080	The retired NFL players who were used in Madden EA video games will be suing Madden and EA for using us in those games without compensating us
7850080	7864080	We will probably not use the attorneys who obtained a 28.1 million dollar verdict for us against the NFLPA for scrambling retired players' identities in those video games
7864080	7875080	The jury found it a grossly fraudulent action taken so that they wouldn't have to pay retired players
7875080	7883080	In my opinion Madden should have been included in our licensing suit against the NFLPA and so should EA
7883080	7889080	So basically hey we won against the NFLPA but you know what we think that there's some more blood to take out of them
7889080	7892080	So we're going to try suing them as well
7892080	7894080	Good lord
7894080	7898080	We'll see what happens. We'll keep you posted with any further developments
7898080	7903080	I just have to laugh at this random comment that came up in our chat room chat.orangelandraday.com
7903080	7910080	Kurosaki87 says OMG Beyonce is playing Rhythm Heaven on DS on my TV. I actually saw that same commercial
7910080	7913080	I don't remember what it was during but I've seen that same thing
7913080	7920080	So Nintendo is still using the kind of female big names like you know
7920080	7927080	Because Carrie Underwood was in a DS commercial before right? Was there somebody else? Some other kind of chick you'd see on Lifetime?
7927080	7934080	I mean you can't say Beyonce is for women only though because tons of dudes think she's hot because she is
7934080	7936080	You know I don't know
7936080	7942080	Yeah they had a bunch of you know what was it
7942080	7944080	Lisa Kudrow thank you for deciphering that
7944080	7949080	Yeah Lisa Kudrow and I don't remember the other ones but yeah it's just
7949080	7953080	I guess if a woman is playing the game it must be okay for all women to play the game
7953080	7958080	She's just crazy in love with the game
7958080	7961080	Alright one more story for you guys and we're going to open up the skype line
7961080	7966080	1877 Game OLR and this was a story that made a lot of people say Woot this week
7966080	7972080	Of course the popular sales site woot.com which if you've never been there that's when you can buy just a piece of random somethings
7972080	7974080	For a very very low price
7974080	7979080	Now often times these random somethings are like refurbished or they're you know
7979080	7984080	They're kind of altered you know they're fixed up in some way but you can still get some damn good deals on there
7984080	7989080	I have never bought a damn thing from woot.com but I have a friend that buys stuff from there quite frequently and gets pretty good stuff
7989080	7994080	Well one thing they sold on woot this week and sorry but you guys missed it because it was yesterday's woot
7994080	8003080	Microsoft Xbox 360 with 20 gigabyte hard drive and HDMI $139 plus $5 shipping
8003080	8009080	So you could have bought a 360 with the HDMI and a 20 gig hard drive $145 shipped to your house
8009080	8010080	That's a good deal
8010080	8016080	That is a fucking great deal and even comes with a controller and yeah they're sold out
8016080	8020080	Now granted these are refurbished systems so you have to not be bothered by that
8020080	8025080	But honestly when you put that next to what $199 for an arcade system with no hard drive
8025080	8027080	That's a pretty great deal I think
8027080	8031080	So unfortunately they're all gone sorry guys who are listening right now
8031080	8036080	But I did want to mention that because one interesting thing about that is I noticed the word of mouth on that one really spread
8036080	8042080	And that sometimes happens with the woot deals like if you don't check the site every night then once the blogs go wild with it
8042080	8048080	Then they're gone you know that's what I saw like probably like 50 tweets on my personal Twitter
8048080	8054080	From people retweeting Major Nelson posting about it which I'm sure just made it spread like wildfire when he posted it
8054080	8056080	I'm sure he did
8056080	8062080	Although I finally de-friended Major Nelson this week and it's nothing personal but I de-friended all the celebrities on my Twitter
8062080	8069080	Because I'm just sick of the celebrity Twitter thing like I think god damn one of our listeners said it best who I follow on Twitter
8069080	8073080	I think it was Justin or Justin with some bazeros said something like
8073080	8081080	I think when Ashton Kutcher hit a million users that was I don't remember the exact tweet I apologize
8081080	8088080	He said something like that was the shark that we all just jumped over when he hit a million users and all that garbage was going on
8088080	8093080	You know like Oprah getting on Twitter too I mean you know now I'm just like okay this is garbage
8093080	8102080	I feel awful because I actually followed that stupid just or the whole Twitter to a million because I wanted to be in Sims 3
8102080	8107080	I did to an extent too but I instantly de-friended him once it was over and I wasn't the millionth person
8107080	8115080	I haven't done it yet just because they haven't announced who won that yet and I don't want to compromise anything
8115080	8121080	To be honest though I understand what he was trying to do with it but at the same time I didn't give a shit
8121080	8129080	It was like oh this is the new wave of media basically anybody can go on here and have their voice heard and stuff
8129080	8135080	At the same time I'm like I don't want all you having your voice heard because I really don't give a shit what you have to say
8135080	8137080	But at the same time I guess you don't have to friend them
8137080	8143080	I guess at first it felt like ooh I'm a little closer to these celebrities but they're not reading what you have to say
8143080	8147080	Do you think Oprah gives a shit about what you just did you know what I mean?
8147080	8155080	Well they don't care but it's something like they're actually responding back to you like if you Twitter Ashton Kutcher and he responds back to you
8155080	8159080	It's Ashton Kutcher responding back to you and not like some PR guy
8159080	8166080	It's basically you know these guys are so into this crap you know that they're doing it on their phones and that kind of stuff
8166080	8172080	It's interesting but the problem for me is that Twitter doesn't have a lot of the customization tools that it needs right now
8172080	8176080	And Twitter is having so many problems on the back end you know what I mean?
8176080	8180080	Like they're just having so many problems with being able to handle the server load
8180080	8185080	Like even today I've been trying to post Twitter updates about how our show has been going on our own Twitter at OLR
8185080	8188080	And I can barely get through because the site's just been down down down
8188080	8194080	Like I might add more celebrities and put them on a separate filter and I guess there's plugins and stuff that'll do it but I don't know
8194080	8200080	It's kind of like staying ahead of trends basically you know everybody gets a MySpace page
8200080	8205080	Twitter's gonna go the way of Friendster they're gonna be screwed because they could never keep up with the demand
8205080	8210080	It's basically like you know okay people get a MySpace page and oh my god that's the cool shit you know
8210080	8213080	I've got MySpace page you know we're one of the first people to do it
8213080	8218080	You know I can say that everybody's like oh my god I gotta get on MySpace because that's the thing to do
8218080	8222080	And then everybody follows and then we move to Facebook oh everybody's got you know face book now
8222080	8226080	And then everybody's like oh what's this Facebook stuff? Let's do some reporting on it
8226080	8230080	You know and then like Twitter is like what the hell is Twitter? Let's do some reporting on it
8230080	8234080	It's like oh my god are you people so not in touch with everything?
8234080	8237080	And I guess there are a lot of people out there that just don't know what the fuck's going on
8237080	8241240	as the show we have to get on everything you know exactly that's been part of how
8241240	8245240	we've stayed relevant for seven years you know we would never we would not
8245240	8249800	have the listenership we have now if we do we're not on podcasting right when
8249800	8253040	iTunes launch to store if that makes any sense yeah all right hey how we got a
8253040	8258640	phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi you're on orange
8258640	8264840	launch radio who's this caller if you can hear us your cast is a piece of
8264840	8269680	crap I'm sorry to hear that hello for crying out loud that I listen to the
8269680	8273620	whole conversation I'm minding my own business I'm enjoying the conversation
8273620	8282560	and then Comcast drops me out for that five seconds I'm so sorry well they got
8282560	8287840	hit when they got hit with a fail whale what can we say introduce yourself hi
8287840	8293200	orange on radio land it's Jason hi Jason one of our fearless web team people with
8293200	8300520	the fabulous deep man owned by Comcast again as it's been so often lately what's
8300520	8306400	on your mind buddy the quote you were looking for was I think a plus K Ashton
8306400	8310960	Kutcher's Twitter handle I think a plus K is the shark and when he hit a million
8310960	8314760	we all jumped over him on water skis is exactly what I was looking for I would
8314760	8319880	have read it myself but Twitter would not fucking load for me and then on an
8319880	8323140	unrelated note I said something that I think was kind of interestingly along
8323140	8326740	the same line it's interesting that Twitter's last great hurrah was Obama's
8326740	8330480	election and now that everyone else is following suit everyone's complaining
8330480	8335560	it's it's just surprising to me that it's a problem now I would have think I
8335560	8339680	would have thought that the political all of the political madness for that
8339680	8342760	whole year and a half primary an election would have been where everybody
8342760	8345820	started complaining it's a problem because Twitter can't fucking handle it
8345820	8350400	it's telling Twitter is the new Friendster I swear to God this is exactly
8350400	8353600	you're gonna see so many similarities somebody's gonna take the Twitter model
8353600	8359000	they're gonna do it better and they're gonna be the new Facebook Facebook
8359000	8361600	themselves does not become new Twitter cuz that's what they're trying to do
8361600	8366920	with their latest update everybody says that and I guess like I said like I've
8366920	8370960	said before I guess I just don't use it enough to really know I don't use
8370960	8373840	Facebook as much as a lot of other people I know and that includes people
8373840	8379440	like co-workers and stuff which I'm kind of surprised that use you know Facebook
8379440	8384000	as much as they do I don't use Facebook quite a you know what I do on Facebook
8384000	8393040	more than anything else play yes I play blitz that is the number one thing I do
8393040	8396920	on Facebook seriously and once in a while I'll upload a picture comment on a
8396920	8402200	picture upload your Hawaii pictures yeah and all of that it's a good it's a
8402200	8405640	great way to share pictures I'll say that but yeah otherwise Facebook is
8405640	8409600	great for bejeweled that's about it I don't like all the other crap on there
8409600	8413400	are so many applications like you know and once in a while I'll take a quiz I
8413400	8417560	don't know I you know what I love LiveJournal I love LiveJournal I've loved
8417560	8421120	LiveJournal for so long I think it's the out of all the social networking sites
8421120	8425000	I've ever been on LiveJournal was my favorite like four years ago and you
8425000	8429880	need to put your 175 bucks $175 permanent account to use well yeah that
8429880	8434000	and well just the fact that you know just all these other sites that have
8434000	8436880	come into play have kind of made LiveJournal go downhill a little bit
8436880	8443080	especially twatter has really ruined LiveJournal and I I miss I miss the hey
8443080	8446120	days of LiveJournal I missed LiveJournal circa four years ago and people have
8446120	8450040	more to say on it but you know LiveJournal now is just a repost of all
8450040	8453880	your Twitter posts and that's not on my friends list I found a code that filters
8453880	8457360	that shit right off of there cuz I wait so fucking sick of it you know what I
8457360	8463760	mean I got so fucking sick of it anyway sorry I cut my Jamie cut hers I don't
8463760	8467520	mind the LJ cut people but I had people that would have like 20 pages of tweets
8467520	8471400	and it's all nonsensical because it's your applies to people but when I read
8471400	8475360	it on Twitter it filters that that's the thing I hate about Twitter the most it's
8475360	8477720	like all these replies and stuff and you're trying to figure out what the
8477720	8481680	hell they're talking about and it's just I don't know I understand the whole
8481680	8485840	people want to archive it or all this stuff but please go in figure out how to
8485840	8490800	change your settings make them private posts if you just want to archive it but
8490800	8494360	I just well it doesn't matter I filtered it out I think live journals have an
8494360	8497400	easier way for just click a button and you I won't see Twitter crap on my
8497400	8500480	friends page anymore that would be the greatest thing LiveJournal could do but
8500480	8503600	they'd have to stop firing their staff in order to do that hey let's talk video
8503600	8507240	games Jason what kind of video games you've been playing this week Ryan's
8507240	8510440	hovering over my shoulder and she told me she had a question so I'm gonna start
8510440	8516240	with that real quick sure so I want to know why is it that when Jason calls
8516240	8521280	through Skype he gets through first time when we're driving and I'm trying to
8521280	8526920	call from my phone we can't get through at all I haven't the foggiest idea it's
8526920	8530760	just okay here's the thing I can tell you this much back in the day Skype used
8530760	8534520	to every time we'd get a call it would open up multiple tabs for each call we
8534520	8537560	were getting so I would see 20 tabs up on the screen and the great thing about
8537560	8540960	that is I could see who was calling in and this way we could share the love a
8540960	8543680	little bit like if there was a person that was calling in every week I
8543680	8546520	wouldn't take their call one week so that somebody else could get through
8546520	8550820	that's only fair right now ever since about a year ago Skype changed something
8550820	8554240	and I've I have combed the settings up and down this is something they did on
8554240	8558080	their end where I only get one tab at a time now so whoever gets through gets
8558080	8562100	through and locks everybody else out and the natural delay with the phones I can
8562100	8565600	even attest to of course if it has been somebody yeah and phones just have a
8565600	8569960	natural delay if it's somebody who's really been on the show a lot lately and
8569960	8573760	like me there's other well but it and other people are trying to get through
8573760	8576720	I'll just consistently hang up on the person's that way somebody else gets
8576720	8580960	through I don't like to do that but I just I want everybody to have a chance
8580960	8584960	you know it's only fair right every gamer every gamer gets the voice exactly
8584960	8588040	but tonight's setup has actually been very nice having the people sprinkled
8588040	8590360	out throughout the show I don't know if this is something we'll do long term but
8590360	8594520	it's something we're considering in fact with a third computer dot dot dot
8594520	8600960	we're thinking of ideas so is it that it actually comes up and shows you a phone
8600960	8604280	number when somebody calls from like a cell phone yes it will show me a phone
8604280	8607160	number and I almost always take the phone numbers because they're usually
8607160	8612800	new people that haven't called before gotcha almost always almost I don't
8612800	8616000	want people thinking they can circumvent it by calling on the phone because I
8616000	8619160	know my head and those people like me whose ISP decides to suck and they have
8619160	8621960	to go to the phone instead I mean I don't want people thinking like I pick
8621960	8625480	and choose I don't but like if the same if the if a person was on like the last
8625480	8628520	three weeks in a row I try not to take their call a fourth week you know what I
8628520	8634520	mean so just to show me the traffic's coming in to warrant the need to ignore
8634520	8637480	them in favor of somebody else exactly exactly but if it's a slow night we'll
8637480	8640960	hear from anybody so all right well Jason speaking of which I want to share
8640960	8643080	the love and let some more people call in thank you so much for your call though
8643080	8647440	as always wow she completely took my question oh no okay Jason quickly please
8647440	8650960	please go ahead we got we got we got sidetracked with Twitter talk go ahead
8650960	8654640	yeah blame Twitter Twitter's the I will blame Twitter fuck Twitter
8654640	8660120	wearing Comcast I was just and of course now that we've had this whole tangent I
8660120	8664840	completely forgot all of my details somebody in chat earlier you we were
8664840	8668520	talking about all the Nintendo all of the Nintendo update stuff this that and
8668520	8671880	the other and then somebody in chat talked about Nintendo where games go to
8671880	8676600	die that rang really true right now because I really want to play Fatal
8676600	8682760	Frame 4 I really want to see what they did with that game but the problem is
8682760	8686160	apparently if you if you did see it in the news they are not going to bring it
8686160	8688760	to our region or at least that they haven't announced it yet and they're
8688760	8693240	saving it for e3 because they have to have something to announce at e3 yeah
8693240	8697200	the the whole licensing snap food like that thing seems kind of weird for I
8697200	8700400	don't think it's licensing at all I think it's like okay look at this it's a
8700400	8704920	game that's done that all they have to do is localize of course they want the
8704920	8708560	easy way out okay that's what Nintendo does is the easy way out that's that's
8708560	8712800	all they do nowadays so if there's a game that people want a lot you know
8712800	8717520	maybe mother of three of course but you know that's a different reason all
8717520	8721080	together but still I have a feeling that they could be announcing this at e3
8721080	8727320	because they're like hey look see core core game nice I would be so pleased if
8727320	8731200	it were especially if I was there but then again likes to disappoint as well
8731200	8737040	so you know it's hard to say well put and a small plug there is a Facebook
8737040	8742360	group trying to get emails to Nintendo to try to get it localized we've been
8742360	8746040	going on the scorns of social media we need not your Facebook chatter here oh
8746040	8752360	what the hell let her give it out don't do emails do actual letters yeah cuz
8752360	8759880	that'd be more effective yes that's been uh other than that I admit and very I
8759880	8768320	admit the sadness that I finally broke down a lot of that last night we'll have
8768320	8771360	to have a pickle party at some point Jason I really do have to let you go now
8771360	8774080	those who get some other callers but thank you and Ry as well for calling in
8774080	8780280	okay yes everybody just a note to the Justin TV folks our phone calls don't go
8780280	8784960	through to Justin TV I don't know why that's weird well I sometimes they work
8784960	8788560	sometimes it just remember it's a simulcast guys we actually they should
8788560	8792240	they should be unless it's it see the problem is I think is it's mono and I
8792240	8795200	think it's coming in one side or the other and I don't know which side so I
8795200	8799240	tried flipping it but it if it's I could try flipping it again don't worry about
8799240	8803880	it don't worry I mean honestly Justin TV is not the focus I know they think they
8803880	8807120	are it's the thing so if we hear it of the speakers it's just split from the
8807120	8810280	speakers so all right we got another hello hi you're on orange launch radio
8810280	8819640	who's this hey this DS master 26 hey DS master 26 what is on your mind not much
8819640	8825040	just came across one of my old favorite enemies from my childhood that's no
8825040	8830800	longer on the air in America though still in Japan hmm
8830800	8837200	Sailor Moon what did you want to do what you want to talk about with Sailor Moon
8837200	8844120	yeah it's you know it was actually kind of like one of those crossovers between
8844120	8849320	like Harry Potter meets the Power Rangers try how my friends kind of put
8849320	8854720	it sort of but do you think the soil on the hand that would make a good game do
8854720	8858480	they have Sailor Moon games I've had multiple Sailor Moon games in Japan
8858480	8862720	they'll have been brought over here right no I think they have had Sailor
8862720	8866800	Moon games come out over here but the thing is it's not a popular franchise
8866800	8869320	anymore it's just like for some reason when I'd also thought it was a great
8869320	8873920	idea to put out was it wacky races the cartoon series that ran in the 80s and
8873920	8879840	originally came from like the 60s I mean come on I wouldn't I would support a
8879840	8883200	Sailor Moon game if it was the live-action Sailor Moon because the when
8883200	8887480	the cat is actually a stuffed cat that's pretty amazing so maybe we could get
8887480	8891600	some like old-school say get CD style live-action Sailor Moon games I would
8891600	8899760	support this yes sure would I and you know besides that I've been hearing a
8899760	8905200	whole lot about that rack band unplugged for PST you know the question is well
8905200	8910760	let's have download content if it does I'm almost thinking of splurging for
8910760	8915520	that 32 gigabyte memory stick which is probably gonna drop me 600 bucks it will
8915520	8918560	have a rock band source so yeah there will be download content for sure there
8918560	8921400	definitely will be download content but you probably won't need it just drive
8921400	8925240	that big I mean I don't download every song that comes out on rock band that
8925240	8928920	that would be a little bit much don't you think
8929680	8934760	probably but then again if there's a lot of good songs from a certain I say like
8934760	8942120	I'd probably get the whole album it's on there and because I'm already kicked off
8942120	8950080	that Nintendo is kind of this shafted for the Metallica content for guitar
8950080	8956960	hero is us we owners we only get three tracks from the death magnetic album
8956960	8961520	while you use 316 ps3 owners not hate in here but you guys are getting the full
8961520	8967400	album fall as we owners here getting shafted sort of for the guitar hero
8967400	8973480	Metallica content that does suck that's why the we should honestly part of me
8973480	8977840	thinks that we shouldn't even have rock band and guitar hero because you're not
8977840	8980840	really getting the same game but at the same time you all know what you're
8980840	8986440	getting into with the we but it's it's the weed is not up it does not have the
8986440	8989920	power of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 when I say power I mean storage space
8989920	8997840	as well you know what I mean yeah even though I have like an extra 2 gig micro
8997840	9002920	SD that can transfer into a normal IC card which I'd really love to fill up
9002920	9006720	with other stuff I mean I always figured out how to get my virtual console
9006720	9012240	palace and everything on to there and what you can copy from I figured I had
9012240	9018320	to do from the Wii memory finally figured that out but it's a pain the
9018320	9028280	butt though but isn't we fit awesome hard drive we fit stinks and we played it
9028280	9031840	once never played it again yeah here's the thing about we fed I learned you
9031840	9034760	really do have to be committed to it in order for it to work I just want to
9034760	9037200	throw I just want to throw that in there because it seems like it's one of the
9037200	9040920	only you know good things about the Wii right now all right DS master we gotta
9040920	9042880	let you go because we're gonna wrap up the show but thanks so much for your
9042880	9046200	call well one more thing before I let you guys
9046200	9053360	all right my favorite and my lines Boone prism tower and rock on keep the good
9053360	9059280	shows guys thank you here wow all right that's gonna do over the
9059280	9062400	skyline tonight we're gonna close up shop on the skyline so that we can get
9062400	9065880	through some last-minute stories and get to the end of the show look at this boss
9065880	9069840	is so cheap it keeps tossing me in the air is this further than you got last
9069840	9072760	time that's the same place I got last time you know it's probably one of those
9072760	9075560	things where it's giving you hints too but they're always like giving me hints
9075560	9079320	at all it's just cheap I heard I heard someone else that was talking about the
9079320	9084400	demo they got tossed in the air 26 times fine it's just it's being cheap hey
9084400	9089600	that's that's why it's a demo so they can fix that crap so anyways some stuff
9089600	9094200	we we didn't talk about here but the ESRB has rated Ghostbusters and two
9094200	9099120	other Atari DS titles for the DSI now you may think oh well that's not that
9099120	9104000	big deal because if you think about it you know it DS games playing the DSI
9104000	9111680	well does it is a big deal because DSI games are only for the DSI basically
9111680	9118040	they're DSI where or DSI special enhanced versions of the game so those
9118040	9122320	three games Ghostbusters and plus and the chase Felix meet Felicity the
9122320	9129560	thought is perhaps Nintendo is going to start allowing publishers to put up full
9129560	9133640	copies of their games on the DSI where store to download and the be honest as
9133640	9139000	the person that has downloaded his fair share of games for the DS and ROM form
9139000	9144200	to play on you know things allow that sort of thing they aren't that big so I
9144200	9150040	could see something like this happening so interesting and it says no Atari of
9150040	9153000	course has responded back saying unfortunately no official word from
9153000	9159360	Atari we'll let this stay a rumor for now so hmm announcement at e3 basically
9159360	9164880	there's gonna be a new shiny force game coming out from Sega although you may
9164880	9167920	not guess what platform is actually coming out on it's actually being
9167920	9173000	brought to the arcade shiny force cross is the brand new game it is going to be
9173000	9181040	an RPG oriented game but it is more a turn-based strategy I guess and it's
9181040	9186360	weird though it's actually played on cabinets linked via Sega's all dotnet
9186360	9195440	net platform and apparently it's only in Japan so that kind of sex then also the
9195440	9200040	first round of songs picked for guitar heroes smash hits have been announced
9200040	9204320	and these were all based on people's votes the first round that they've had
9204320	9207640	can I just say though who cares fuck this game I mean this is just the
9207640	9210880	further milking of the franchise not I'm not saying that to you personally Loki
9210880	9214240	but just when I read the story I just rolled my eyes I was like God I
9214240	9218000	understand you know these game that these songs are being re-released with
9218000	9223160	the full band and what have you but my god it's just like can you hear them
