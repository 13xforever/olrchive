00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco, here!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, April 26, 2009.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Could a popular MMO be coming to the iPhone?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Microsoft promises a barrage of games for Japan.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the first details are announced for PAX 2009.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Leading in through the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, welcome back, DarkSakura.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I left my lungs at Disneyland.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, how was Disneyland?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh my god!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It was Disneyland, right?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, it was fun, and they have a new game, which I will touch on in my gaming week.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think I might know what you're talking about, so I won't talk about it too, but it's the same one I remember.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh my god!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright, and also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He was picking off pickles off of his double cheeseburger.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why, are you not a pickle fan? Did you specifically ask no pickles and they gave you a different one?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, I never do, because then that means they have to take longer.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, I see. So you just pick them off?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Interesting. I kind of do the same thing with tomatoes, actually.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Alright, and hello to you. How was your week? Everything good?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It was busy.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alright, and joining us in the studio tonight, we have some special guests with us tonight.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Say hello to the doctor.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm the doctor.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are you? How have you been? You've been a little while since you've been here.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's been like a couple weeks, but yeah, I'm doing really good.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Woo!

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A couple weeks is a long time, and Rice Princess is here too.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't think I can get the mic all the way over there, but say hello to Rice Princess is here.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hi.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know if you can hear that at all.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They are controlling the game that's playing right now on our Justin TV feed.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We don't have a new game, which is a little erratic tonight.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I apologize, guys. It's running off of Wi-Fi, so it's a little bit eh.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But they are playing right now Rescue Rangers on the 8-bit Nintendo.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Since we didn't have anything new to show tonight, we decided to have an old school night.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They are not. They're playing it on the Dreamcast.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, yeah, they're playing it so that they can switch to other games if they want to play something else really easy.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Loki was not able to bring Excitebots tonight, which we were hoping to look at.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What happened, Loki?

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, I knew. I wasn't going to take it away from my wife.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She's been playing it constantly, so, you know, she'd be pissed off.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's past the wife test?

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, it's past the wife test.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All right, well, we'll hear a little more about your gaming week in just a little bit.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But let's get into it. How was your gaming week?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We'll start off with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I actually didn't play much of anything because of, you know, school.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I did go to Disneyland, and I played, I'm going to call this a video game,

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
because really it's sort of like a midway game meets a video game,

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
was the new Toy Story ride over at California Adventure.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's so much fun. I went on that one. I went March, yes.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, now I have to lead up to this.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was convinced, well, I had said the next time I go to Disneyland,

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was going to go on Tower of Terror.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I sat between Tiara and Marissa,

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and Marissa kept saying that I would like, that I would be okay on the drops

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and that the part that would scare me would be the lead up.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, the lead up was the fun part, and the drop freaked me the hell out,

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to the point that the only thing I could say on the entire ride was,

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not doing this again, or I hate this, or something like that.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then I didn't make any more noise until I was off of it

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and almost throwing up when I got outside.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because I will tell everybody right now, my fear is falling.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Not high places, not motion, it's falling.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Tower of Terror is really freaking scary.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have been in an elevator when it fell two feet before,

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so no, Jamie doesn't do this.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I was actually so freaked out that I was actually going to go on

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
California Screamin', and I was actually relieved when the line was closed.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And, by the way, I want to give a shout out to Pete and Jasmine,

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
who hung out with us and were really awesome while we were there.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But, okay, back now to the story.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So they're like, let's go on Toy Story.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're like, okay, let's go on Toy Story.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So Toy Story, it's like you wear 3D glasses,

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
like the same kinds you wear at the Muppet Show thing.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then you stop in front of these screens, and you have these guns

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that are the pop gun that you pull the big string on over and over again,

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and you fire out 3D ammunition at targets on the screen.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're basically having to flick your wrist back and forth

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
as fast as possible to pull the string.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So men are better at it.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, men have a distinct advantage at this game.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I made a good score.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Actually, I've got my score because I wrote it.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I took a picture of my score.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you really good at flicking your wrist back and forth real quick?

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, you know, I am married.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But what kind of games are you playing with?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like I remember there was like a ring toss game and a pop-up balloon.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I love the army men game where you have to shoot down the army men

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
as they jump out.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But there's also the pie toss.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's just shooting plates.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The plate one was fun, except the ride stopped,

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
so we were shooting plates for zero points.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was practicing my aim.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And it was just really cool.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There were all sorts of little mini games to do on it.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But my score for the first time playing it was 114,400.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And on top of that, you know what my animal was?

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It was a beaver.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And as Game Guru says in the chat,

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
they're putting it out on the Wii as a Wii game.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are they?

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And it will be in 3D.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Dude, yes.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's kind of awesome, I have to say.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I have to tell you, Rob,

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
did you notice this when you came out of the ride?

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is it?

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When you walk out of the ride, if you look to the left

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
where the little desk and everything is and the room setting,

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it shows the cutout box.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's the ride that you're on.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's like a paper box you set up in Inside Midway.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And if you look at the wallpaper that's inside the ride,

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
it's got little tabs and stuff

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and instructions for where you stick everything,

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
like old paper doll houses.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's an old Midway ride, like a child's Midway ride.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's pretty cool.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, it was a great ride.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So real-life gaming, basically, this week.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So it was a lot of fun.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then I came back and real-life intruded itself.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Loki did mention the chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com,

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
if you want to join us live for this chat.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And of course, there was that comment from Game Guru earlier.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Also, DarkTetsuya,

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I still want that Mr. Toad's Wild Ride racing game.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That would be pretty awesome.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Only if you go to hell.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SSJ100Matt says...

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, in the game, not you go to hell.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How dare you tell our listeners to go to hell, DarkSakura?

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're gone for a week and you think you run the world.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I do.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SSJ100Matt says they need to have a Rad Racer remake that's 3D.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just like the first one.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright, so DarkSakura played Disneyland for a gaming week.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I played lots of Excitebots trick racing.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In fact, I finished the Excite race mode,

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and now I'm in Super Excite race mode.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And it's really...

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, it's about as hard as the first game.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Now, the game is really awesome itself,

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but I don't care for some of their changes that they made.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Like, they have these stunt bars, basically,

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that you have to grab and you can swing around.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They're gold ones that you swing around a few times

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and then you just launch off and you get stars.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then every track has a red bar

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that you have to swing around and spin ten times.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I guess they're kind of neat,

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you know, to keep with the whole trick racing thing,

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but I think it should be optional because

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the red bar kind of breaks up the whole race.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're going really fast, really fast,

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and then you go swing around this stupid bar ten times

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and then you boost off of it again.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know, it's just a minor annoyance.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But other than that, the game's pretty fun.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you're a fan of Excite Truck, you're going to love this game.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Definitely the way to go.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They have all the original tracks, actually,

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
from the old Excite Truck game in this one,

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
except they're kind of tweaked a little bit.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But all the original tracks are in there,

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and plus they have a bunch of new ones.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And also, what was I going to say,

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
no support, unfortunately, for custom music,

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
which kind of sucks, but the music that's in the game

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is not as annoying as the last game.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I don't know, it's pretty hard,

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but most of the Excite Truck games,

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if you're going to try to actually S-rank the courses,

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
then yeah, you're going to have to play it a few times

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to actually be able to do it perfectly.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But it's fun, lots of air.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, I remember another gripe I had about that.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There's an icon that you can get that looks like a wrench

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that puts you into leg mode, as they put it.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And in order to run in leg mode,

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you have to shake the controller back and forth.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You kind of have to tilt it like a seesaw.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, that's great, except for the fact that you have to

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
actually use the controller to steer,

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
so you're kind of going all over the place.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So I don't really agree with the decision to control it that way.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe even tapping A or just shaking the controller

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
like normal would be cool, but whatever.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's the way they did it and kind of get over it.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But yeah, the game's really weird.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I made a Super Sandwich, so it's awesome.

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Other than that, I played Rhythm Heaven on the DS,

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
which is definitely a fun music microgame collection,

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
very similar to the WarioWare stuff

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because it's made by the same people.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The thing is, though, is it's very strict on accuracy.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So if you're not accurate in that,

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or if you're just a little bit off,

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's going to penalize you big time.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So that kind of sucked, but fun game overall.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The other thing that I played, more Grand Theft Auto,

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was actually messing around with the PC version again,

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
editing some stuff, and I got cars to bounce into the sky

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
really far and come down and explode,

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
so that was kind of fun.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I downloaded the new download content for Saints Row 2,

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so hopefully I can get to play that this week.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And yeah, that's pretty much it, I think, for my gaming week.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All right, sounds pretty good.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Nothing else? Anything you're looking forward to in this next week, Logie?

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Nope, not this week.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Nothing coming out really worthwhile, at least.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Basically, yeah, it's just X-Men Origins,

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
which doesn't look bad.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's just not something I'd plan on picking up unless I get it for free.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And the other game I was waiting for, unfortunately,

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I delayed to the end of next month, so I had to have Fuel,

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
which was originally supposed to be coming out in two weeks,

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but now it's not until four weeks.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
All right.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's see, we'll get to the Doctor and the Rice Princess

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and their gaming weeks momentarily,

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
except now they're playing what?

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You switched guides. You guys have been switching games.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I saw Contra flash by for a minute,

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but now you're on, what, Double Dragon 2?

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
All right, fine.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's pretty easy.

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I haven't been playing a whole lot this week besides World of Warcraft,

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because they had the new patch not that long ago,

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
so I had to check out Ulduar.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I finally got to check out this week,

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
although we didn't get very far.

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We wiped on Razor Scale,

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
which is the second boss in there after a couple of attempts,

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
but I thought the Flame Leviathan fight was a lot of fun.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They've really incorporated vehicles now into the raids,

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
which is kind of interesting

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
because the first fight you actually do on the vehicles,

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and it's kind of cool because I was driving around on a motorcycle,

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and having to pick up the people that were getting launched from the cannons,

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
yes, you can launch yourself from a cannon onto the back of the boss to fight it,

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and then the boss throws you off,

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and you have to get picked up in a motorcycle

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and get carried back to the cannon.

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So it's really intricate.

265
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's kind of neat what they've done in Warcraft with this,

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
although I can say that, but at the same time say,

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know, I wish this boss wasn't a mandatory boss

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
because the lead up to it with the vehicle stuff

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
that takes about 20, 30 minutes to get through is kind of annoying.

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I would only want to do that once.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I would want to have to do the clear every time to get to Flame Leviathan.

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think that's going to get annoying, but okay, whatevs.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've also been leveling an alt, so it's been a pretty wildtastic week.

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I haven't really been touching the consoles that much.

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I played a little bit of Outrun,

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but not enough for me to say a whole lot about it besides,

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
thankfully there's a cartoon arcade-style racing game on Xbox 360

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I enjoy right now because pretty much all we've had otherwise

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
is more realistic type of racing games, and that's really it.

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There hasn't been a whole lot otherwise.

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Rock Band 2, I've been playing a lot of Rock Band still.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That game's getting a lot of value even today.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So that's really it for my gaming week.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The Doctor, Rice Princess,

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
anything you guys have been playing in your gaming week

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
besides what you're doing right now? The Doctor?

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No, not really. I've been making movies.

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You've been making movies, dirty movies?

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Of course dirty movies.

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So nothing that you've been really playing lately.

291
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I know you're a big Nintendo fanboy.

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is there anything you're looking forward to on the Wii?

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Definitely the Wii Motion Plus.

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
All right. Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

295
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What have you been up to?

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Playing well.

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How's your Warcraft week going?

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's Noble Garden, so that's it.

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's right, there's a new holiday.

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is a new holiday in World of Warcraft, right?

301
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What do you do in the Noble Garden event?

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Explain to our listeners Rice Princess.

303
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Put the damn game on pause.

304
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's the Easter stuff that they couldn't update in time

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
or something, I don't remember.

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All right, she's busy playing Double Dragon.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
All right, you go around and you hunt for eggs.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I kind of thought it was stupid.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I played it for about five minutes.

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I thought it was stupid.

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're full of crap.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are you saying I'm full of crap?

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
All right, Rice Princess is screaming at me.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
She has no microphone.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There you go.

316
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here in just a moment.

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Again, if you want to join us live, chat.orangeontrader.com

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
is the place to be.

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You can also follow us on Twitter at OLR,

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and we're looking at your tweets during the show.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And thanks to you guys who have been saying stuff

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to kind of help plug the show.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I saw some retweets from Act Deaf and Gold Anthro.

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thank you guys very much over on Twitter.

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Also, housekeeping, housekeeping.

326
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm very excited.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
In a couple weeks, I will be in Chicago.

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I am going to Anime Central, ASEN for short.

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to this convention,

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and I will be doing a panel Friday at 4.30 in panel room 7?

332
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Consult your program.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So You Think You Can Podcast is the name of the panel,

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and I'll be talking about my seven years of experience

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
that I have in internet broadcasting

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and talking about how Orange Launch Radio started as a podcast

337
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and what you can do if you're curious about starting a podcast

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
or maintaining a podcast or selling your podcast, et cetera, et cetera.

339
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So I'm really excited to be there.

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I know we have a lot of listeners in that kind of area around Chicago

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and the Midwest that go to this convention,

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so I'm excited to finally meet a lot of you.

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So please come to the panel if you're going to be there Friday at 4.30,

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Anime Central.

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Also, next week on the program,

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you heard us tease this a little bit last week,

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but next week on the program,

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
we're very excited because we're going to be giving away...

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right, that's Smile DK.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We have an autographed copy

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
of one of the Dance Dance Revolution games on,

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I believe it's Supernova 2,

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Dance Dance Revolution, autographed by Smile DK

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that we're giving away on the show next week.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So that should be pretty awesome.

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Live or podcast, either way.

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So you can listen to that and win it live.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was signed at SakuraCon.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Thanks to the awesome breast lol for getting that for us.

360
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So next week on the show, if you want to tune in live or in podcast form,

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and I'll give you more details next week,

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you'll have two weeks to do it.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Question from chat.

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Will you be recording the panel at ASEN?

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If I can.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not really about Orange Lounge Radio, though,

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so I don't know if we'll put it on the podcast feed if we can do it,

368
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
but maybe like a bonus thing.

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I would love to tape it if we can.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If nothing else, I'll have someone videotape it,

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I can dump the audio or something.

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We'll figure something out.

373
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Also, I want to say this.

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is very, very, very, very, very, very, very important.

375
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want to say a huge thank you to all the listeners.

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't know if everybody in studio saw,

377
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
but there is a bunch of boxes sitting in the house.

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's a new used computer.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What do I mean by new used?

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a refurbed computer.

381
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The listeners pulled together money.

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know if you remember our meltdown on air two weeks ago

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
when everything broke, but the listeners pulled together

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and got us a new computer that we can use for the show.

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sweet.

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's very, very exciting.

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We weren't able to put it all together for tonight.

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you, guys.

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, I mean, obviously, huge, huge amounts of thanks.

390
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Obviously, with us having probably a little break in a couple weeks

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
with me being off in the Midwest,

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
we'll probably have a lot of time to put that together

393
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and get it up and running

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and hopefully have some fun new stuff for the show.

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So thank you, guys, so much for that.

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's very exciting, very, very exciting.

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, now I feel like I have to get naked or something.

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No, I'm kidding.

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
All right.

400
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you for everyone.

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let's see.

402
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually, they say it's all new parts in chat.

403
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to be honest.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I haven't cracked open the boxes.

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I've just got them all,

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
so I don't really know what we do and we don't have yet.

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I just know it's computer bits, and the whole computer is there,

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
so I want to say thanks again, everybody.

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All right.

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't think there's anything else, really.

412
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You follow us on Facebook, MySpace.

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Does anyone use MySpace anymore?

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Anyone?

415
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't think so.

416
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Stalkers.

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, if you're there, you can get us on Orange Lounge Radio there.

418
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But we're not on Craigslist because that's where the murderers are.

419
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's the one social site that we're not on is Craigslist.

420
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know.

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Maybe we should have an O.L. Army on Craigslist.

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I bought my first Xbox 360 in Craigslist.

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, okay.

424
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But didn't you have to pay a huge markup for that?

425
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Nice.

427
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Also, one other announcement I know that needs to be made

428
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
before we get into tonight's gaming news.

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Loki mentioned something on his Twitter this week,

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and I'm not sure if all the listeners got an opportunity to see this

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
because not all the listeners are on Twitter.

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why don't you share what your announcement is, Loki?

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, my announcement is that my wife is pregnant with twins.

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Congratulations.

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Wow, that's pretty amazing.

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So, December.

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We're on Hanukkah.

438
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, actually, because it's twins.

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Twins are usually delivered earlier, so Hanukkah, Thanksgiving-ish.

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Wow.

441
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, congratulations.

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's so awesome.

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And obviously the show will continue.

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Get her a doula.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The show will continue, you guys.

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if Loki's going to be out for a little while, we'll figure something out.

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, I was thinking Skyping it or something,

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
because obviously I'm not going to leave my wife home alone with two kids

449
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
by herself for the first few weeks or so.

450
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We will figure something out.

451
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We've got plenty of time to figure it out.

452
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm going to leave my husband alone with my kid.

453
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not even a worry right now.

454
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

456
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And the other thing, too, is we're going to be getting a house, actually.

457
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, my gosh.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We've already had our offer accepted.

459
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We did the walk-through on yesterday, and it looked good.

460
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So we're assuming.

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't think anything's going to go wrong,

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
because we know what condition the roof is in, basically.

463
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So probably, yeah, we'll be probably moving into a house by the end of next month.

464
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, my gosh, I didn't know the house was that far along.

465
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, that's great, especially with twins on the way.

466
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes, definitely.

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I've never known anyone that had twins, so that's kind of fun.

468
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's fertility drugs for you.

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Small word of advice, check your pipes in the house.

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, we have an inspector.

471
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And Nellie should check her lady pipes, too, for the twins.

472
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Comments, of course, lots and lots of congrats in our chat room.

473
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're in there, Loki.

474
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I won't read them all for you, but some of the funnier ones.

475
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Amaze Satsuma says, Loki is about to have eight crazy nights.

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think there's going to be more than eight of those.

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Frisbee says you should try and make it happen on the 20th of November.

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Lol.

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Can I say the names?

480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The babies will come out when they come out.

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know.

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Nellie doesn't want to do the one anymore.

483
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Originally, she was really fond of the name Max.

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And I was like, OK, that's cool.

485
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm all, how about naming the other one Sam?

486
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And she's like, OK.

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I was like, Sam, Max, sweet.

488
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If you name your twins Sam and Max, I'm going to laugh for a week.

489
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I might literally die of laughter if you name the twins Sam and Max.

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
She doesn't want to name the one Max because she doesn't want to name the baby.

491
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Actually, Max has to be the longer version of the name.

492
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And Maximilian, you know, that would be kind of...

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You don't know if they're going to be boys or girls yet, do you?

494
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No, we don't know.

495
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So it could be Maxine and Samantha.

496
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

497
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That would be cool.

498
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We don't know.

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, we're not going to know what the sex of the babies are for a few months.

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Because she's only like eight weeks along right now.

501
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Right, right.

502
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We know early because...

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Actually, we didn't know it was going to be twins until last week.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because we had to go in because she had cramping in her side or whatever.

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And so she wanted to make sure everything was OK.

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And so they did ultrasounds and stuff.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And they saw...

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
First, you know, the woman didn't see any heartbeats at all.

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And then they found one.

510
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And then we went to radiology.

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then they found a second one.

512
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They're like, OK, there's two.

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So, yeah, I mean, it's still a ways off.

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We actually have our first real doctor's visit in two weeks.

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So we get to see them slightly more growing up, I guess.

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But, yeah, not until...

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But remember, there's still tadpoles.

518
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Not until, like, you know, August or so.

519
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We know the sex of them.

520
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We're going to find out for sure.

521
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room says,

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sam and Max would be better than Ratchet and Clank as names.

523
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So there you go.

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's true.

525
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And, chat, he is not really going to name them Sam and Max

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
just to get a goddamn gift from the makers of the game, OK?

527
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I wonder, though, if I...

528
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
These are children you're talking about.

529
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When I have mine, if I name it Richter or Annette,

530
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
if Konami would give me a present.

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, she really will name the damn kid Richter.

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Konami will give you a present, all right.

533
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They'll sue you.

534
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Dan and I decided, like, ten years ago,

535
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
before I ever even thought of wanting children,

536
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that if we had a boy, his name was Richter.

537
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
No, she, OK, she keeps...

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
My wife keeps suggesting the name Mason.

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And I'm like, Mason is a stupid name.

540
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I have a friend named Mason.

541
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Mason's my little brother-in-law's name.

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
God, everybody names their kids Mason.

543
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Wait a minute, he might actually listen to this show, you ass.

544
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm sorry, it's a horrible name.

545
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And no, Mario doesn't work because we're not Italian, so...

546
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
All right.

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We'll figure out names later.

548
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You know what's funny is that I have toyed around

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the idea of naming a boy Strider,

550
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but it has nothing to do with the game, I swear to God.

551
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's just a name I like.

552
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Not from, oh, forget it.

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
All right, we need to stop naming children after video games.

554
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Let's get on to the gaming news.

555
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
God, we're like 20 minutes into the show,

556
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I haven't touched on a lick of gaming news.

557
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.

558
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes, there's more drama going on with the whole

559
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Scratch the Ultimate DJ game.

560
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
First, Scratch actually was awarded their restraining order

561
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
against Seven Studios, and Seven Studios was basically

562
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
told to give back the controllers that they had been

563
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
holding hostage, I guess, and also all the development

564
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
materials and that kind of stuff.

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So that's kind of cool victory for Genius there.

566
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then a weird chain event also led to Seven Studios

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
now countersuing, saying that it was actually Genius's fault

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that they were behind schedule, and it was a...

569
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know, they had put them back several months

570
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
because they couldn't get licensed music,

571
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
or they couldn't provide licensed music for the game

572
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and not obtain publishing approval.

573
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So, I don't know, and apparently the game is still not

574
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
cleared for launch on the PS3 according to them.

575
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So we'll find out what happens there.

576
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm sure this is not going to be going away anytime soon,

577
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
which is very disappointing because I have a feeling

578
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
this is going to delay the release of this game

579
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
if it even comes out anymore now.

580
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I'm sure DJ Hero will not be affected by this at all.

581
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh well.

582
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes, because DJ Hero is being put out by the bigger company,

583
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
so regardless of quality, it will come out regardless.

584
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And regardless of whether they find Activision accountable

585
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
for any wrongdoing whatsoever, it's still...

586
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
They have oodles of money to pay off any lawsuits

587
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
that could possibly happen.

588
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They basically get what they're hinting at

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
they're trying to get.

590
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because at least I figured, hey, Scratch might not be

591
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
the more popular game, but at least if it's out first,

592
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
it has a fair chance.

593
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But now it's like, I don't know.

594
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I still think it'll do okay, but I'm wondering if we see

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
anything called DJ Revolution or something coming out.

596
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's going to be crap.

597
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Come on, Konami, don't disappoint me.

598
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Alright, well, I guess we'll see what further develops of this.

599
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm sure to be continued, there's plenty more to have

600
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
on counter suits, appeals, et cetera, et cetera.

601
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I've seen the controller, it looks awesome.

602
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Of course, it's not done, but it looks awesome.

603
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Alright, well, kind of going on a completely different note,

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
obviously we were talking about Warcraft a little bit

605
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in the opening of the show tonight.

606
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This is interesting, there's rumors going around the internet

607
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
about a World of Warcraft app on the iPhone.

608
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Apparently, somebody had ported Second Life to iPhone

609
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
a little while ago, and now apparently there's this little movie

610
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
circulating around the internet that actually shows

611
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a jailbroken iPhone that is running World of Warcraft.

612
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Kind of interesting.

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And there's kind of this no comment going on

614
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
when asked if it's officially or whatever,

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that the company is apparently negotiating with Activision,

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
et cetera, et cetera, to try and get this going.

617
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think this is kind of a load of crap.

618
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't think Warcraft, I mean,

619
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I think people are kind of jumping to conclusions.

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They see this and they assume,

621
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
oh, Warcraft must be on its way for the iPhone.

622
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Come on, how stupid would Warcraft be on the iPhone?

623
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You can't take a game like World of Warcraft

624
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and put it on the small scale of the iPhone.

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You can't.

626
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You could.

627
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay, but you could in the same way,

628
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
you could install Linux on a toaster to say you did it.

629
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's it, but why?

630
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Not necessarily.

631
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Basically what you'd do is you'd create a specific version

632
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
of the game for the iPhone.

633
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It would still be the same game,

634
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but the models would be a lot lower res.

635
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So when it shows a model for whatever,

636
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Dark Elf or something, it's going to look different.

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Here's what I think they should do.

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If they're going to have to do anything with this,

639
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
what they should do is they should go,

640
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
you got to go all the way back to,

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't know if you remember,

642
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Final Fantasy VIII on the PlayStation.

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
If you had that little thing that was only out in Japan,

644
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and I forget the name of it,

645
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
but they had, that's it, PocketStation,

646
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
you could link with the PlayStation.

647
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You could raise your chocobo on the PocketStation,

648
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and then that would affect some chocobos that you had in game.

649
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Maybe something like that where you have a spinoff game

650
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
where, I don't know, you do something in it

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and it affects your character.

652
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You can get loot that you can actually use in the game,

653
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or enchantments or something that you can actually use in the game.

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Something to enhance the World of Warcraft game

655
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
without throwing off the balance.

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It wouldn't work because someone would hack it to be able to do that,

657
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
to automatically give them a lot of whatever it is.

658
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Then they wouldn't necessarily be like,

659
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
maybe like new pets or new mounts

660
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and things that are not going to throw off the balance of World of Warcraft.

661
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The best part about the chocobo game and Final Fantasy VIII on the PocketStation,

662
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
because I actually owned a PocketStation for a while,

663
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I still have it somewhere. I don't even know where it is.

664
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Rice Princess and the Doctor right now are playing 8-bit Nintendo

665
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
through a Dreamcast emulator.

666
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Dreamcast, the VMUs, that was huge.

667
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They had little games that you could do on the VMUs exclusively.

668
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
With the PocketStation though, the best part about it was

669
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
is the game would play itself.

670
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
If you turned on a PlayStation and just let it sit there for five days or whatever,

671
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
just let it plug in so that it wouldn't turn off,

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
you'd come back and you'd have all this loot. It'd just be there. Done.

673
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So I don't know. They'd have to be very careful with the balance of the game,

674
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but it's not like Blizzard's never made major changes to their game.

675
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Second Life, I mean...

676
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I could see something with vehicular combat, like on the iPhone,

677
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
like a little side game, but I don't know.

678
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know. I believe it's not like a hoax or anything, I don't think,

679
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
because they're not showing that it's awesome framerate or anything like that.

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But I could see if they could port it to the iPhone, I think it'd be pretty big,

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
because definitely portable World of Warcraft would be awesome for somebody, I'm sure.

682
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think there's no point, you know what I mean?

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You can't party, you can't group.

684
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It would just be slow, it would be clunky.

685
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think it would devalue Warcraft.

686
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think it would devalue World of Warcraft to put out a subpar game on the iPhone.

687
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But that's why you would have to not necessarily make it look worse,

688
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
but dumb down the textures a bit so that you can cram what was in the actual PC game onto this platform.

689
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That way you wouldn't have all the massive lag and that kind of stuff that you would experience.

690
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's just basically more stripped down.

691
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I just think it's devaluing Warcraft.

692
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If I were to show somebody, like, oh, here's World of Warcraft on my iPhone,

693
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
somebody's going to look at that and go, this looks like crap, I don't want to play this game.

694
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay, well the other option is, and I'm not sure if they've actually installed Second Life on there,

695
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
if it's just streaming it from a PC or something like that and then using this interface to control it.

696
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Maybe that's what this is.

697
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or maybe they should just stick with the mobile authenticator and that's it.

698
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's a good use of the iPhone, the mobile authenticator.

699
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I heard they don't even sell the keychain authenticators anymore in favor of the mobile authenticators.

700
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So what I have here on my keychain from BlizzCon that my friends brought me back

701
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
is going to be a collector's item that I actually use.

702
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So, pretty cool.

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The question being asked, what is an authenticator?

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's like, what do they call those, VPNs?

705
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Like a lot of companies use them, you have a little thing on your keychain.

706
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You press this button, it generates a number based on the seed that's on the sticker on the back of your card.

707
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And so when you want to log, and that number changes every minute.

708
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So it basically uses the seed and the time to generate a number.

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And if you want to log into WoW, you have to have the keychain with the number.

710
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or somebody can't log in. It helps protect your account from hackers, basically.

711
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So, there you go.

712
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Looking at comments from chat, Brad from Pod Culture says,

713
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Sky, you could have an iPhone app for WoW.

714
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Here you do your single player quests and gather loot and or items for your character.

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I still think it would be a lesser game than what you have on the PC.

716
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I mean, I don't know. I mean, granted, okay, you have a lot of iPhone games that are lesser versions.

717
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But I mean, Blizzard has resisted porting this game to consoles because they don't want a lesser version of the game.

718
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I cannot see that they're going to bend the rule for the freaking iPhone.

719
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's take a lesser game and put it onto the iPhone.

720
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Let's take Ultima Online or something like that and put it on there.

721
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean, iPhone should be able to handle Ultima Online.

722
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Or like, I don't know, Fancy Star Online would be kind of cool.

723
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I think there's other things you could do. I just don't think THE World of Warcraft game is going to fit on an iPhone.

724
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Let's move on. I think we have more Warcraft news, right, Darksacra?

725
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, yes. You addicts. You've been thrown another boom by PopCap.

726
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Now, there's a new command in World of Warcraft that I'm sure Rob has used.

727
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's slash peggle.

728
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes, yes, yes, more yes. This is amazing what has happened this week.

729
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's freaking peggle.

730
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah, you type it in and you can play peggle, challenge each other, and have peggle duels.

731
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You can have your friends do an enormous battle.

732
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can have a time limit, not a time limit.

733
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Also, you can do peggle loot.

734
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So you can decide who takes the loot instead of doing the roll command.

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But you also have World of Warcraft themed backgrounds and points for using a special peggle talent tree.

736
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And it's fucking peggle and fucking World of Warcraft.

737
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And honestly, just reading about it or hearing about it right now does not do this justice.

738
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like, just how awesome this marriage is.

739
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
My soul cries.

740
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No, I mean, really, you have to see it.

741
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean, it's like, they really have adapted the game Peggle for free, put it into Warcraft,

742
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and they have these all new stages that are based off the WoW levels.

743
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
They've made this talent tree, which is a WoW thing, but they made it about Peggle.

744
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You can do duels through the game.

745
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I mean, it's pretty odd.

746
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Rice Princess, I know you've been playing the hell out of this.

747
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I kicked your ass at a duel the other day.

748
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
No, you didn't.

749
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, I did.

750
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Nuh-uh.

751
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It wasn't me.

752
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I have the screen cap to prove it.

753
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No, it wasn't me.

754
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, all right, tell them about Peggle.

755
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's great.

756
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's really awesome.

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What do you want me to say?

758
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Ew, you're eating clove gum? That's gross.

759
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Talk about the game, Rice Princess.

760
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, it's really fun.

761
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I love it.

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Like, I love how the levels are based on...

763
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What?

764
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What?

765
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I love how the levels are based on actual places in WoW.

766
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Like, they have the pictures in the background, and all the Peggles are arranged, like, kind

767
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
of like in the regular Peggle.

768
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And by the way, for those that have never played Peggle before, it's like Plinko as

769
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
a game.

770
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Kind of.

771
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
From The Price is Right, kind of.

772
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

773
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You have to, like, shoot at these little pegs and make them go away, and they bounce on

774
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
each other and stuff like that.

775
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And it sounds like the most mediocre boring game ever, but it's so fun.

776
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's very addicting.

777
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You'll spend, like, hours playing it.

778
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Trust me.

779
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So, yeah.

780
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's really awesome.

781
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So, good times.

782
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Very good times with this.

783
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Totally good times.

784
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, just the marriage of two crack games.

785
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But what I like about it, like, I'm not going to sign into WoW just to play Peggle, but

786
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
it's really great, because sometimes, especially, like, I'm leveling an alt right now, so I

787
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
don't have a mount.

788
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't have a flying mount or anything like that, so when I'm using the flying taxi system,

789
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
it takes four minutes to go from one place to another.

790
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Peggle's a great distraction to pass the time.

791
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And it's integrated into the game.

792
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Four whole minutes, Bob.

793
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's great.

794
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I know.

795
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It takes a long time to fly in WoW when you're low level.

796
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It does.

797
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Four whole minutes.

798
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I know.

799
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
At least it's not Final Fantasy XI, Christ, where it would take you, like, you didn't

800
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
even have, like, you had to wait ten minutes for the airship to show up, then you get on

801
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the airship, take a ten minute ride, and then it might be remotely near where you're trying

802
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to go.

803
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, that's why Final Fantasy XI's ridiculous.

804
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm sure it's gotten a lot better.

805
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's more realistic, though.

806
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I think they have more, uh, yeah, it is more realistic, but I think they have more teleport

807
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
spells and stuff now to help ease that up.

808
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't give a crap it's still a crappy game.

809
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Alright, shut up.

810
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Alright, anyhow, so yes, Peggle is in WoW, and it's, uh, the amazing part is it's free.

811
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But what a great thing for PopCap's brand.

812
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I mean, everybody's talking about it this week.

813
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Everybody's talking about Peg Crack.

814
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We got sucked right in just like everybody else.

815
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So, there you go.

816
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Um, yes.

817
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So, something not Peggle-related.

818
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Um, but actually, oddly enough, it's something related to what's going on on Justin.TV.

819
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
The Dreamcast!

820
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes, uh, Sega isn't making Dreamcasts anymore.

821
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
However, you can still purchase them.

822
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In fact, ThinkGeek is now offering, um, brand new Dreamcasts for $100.

823
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
$99.99.

824
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And, um, yes, and it includes, of course, uh, it's a version 2.0, um, with the web browser version 2.0,

825
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
including Sega Swirl and a demo disc.

826
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And, um, yeah, awesome.

827
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Brand new Dreamcast.

828
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I remember when I got my Dreamcast, I wanted it at an all-nighter at QZAR.

829
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was like, Dreamcast? I don't want this.

830
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But then I got, I got games for it, and I'm like, sweet, it has Power Stone.

831
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's awesome.

832
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I didn't even think new Dreamcasts existed anymore.

833
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's the crazy part to me. Like, where did they find new Dreamcasts?

834
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Where did they find these?

835
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know.

836
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Maybe in a warehouse?

837
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I guess so. Like, just collecting dust somewhere.

838
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I do have to say, though, the article on this is amazing for, uh,

839
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
showing the last Sega to Sanchiro commercial when the Dreamcast came out.

840
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I would really recommend picking up a Dreamcast.

841
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
If you have some extra money and you want a great system

842
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
with a lot of homebrew available out there,

843
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
you know, I realize the legality of some of this stuff is questionable,

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
but, I mean, the Dreamcast is a great, great system.

845
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I mean, it has good games anyway.

846
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And make yourself a boot disk and you can play in the import.

847
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
No problem. I mean, they're easy.

848
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There's some real classics on Dreamcast.

849
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm sure many classic games of the week that Dark Soccer has picked

850
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
have come from there.

851
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Uh, Space Channel 5, Sonic Adventure, you know,

852
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
there's just great, great games on Dreamcast.

853
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So, check it out if you don't already have one of these.

854
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Um, speaking of old stuff...

855
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, they're sold out.

856
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Are they all gone?

857
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Probably because the blogs all picked up the stories. It's gone.

858
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Maybe they'll...

859
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Console sold out.

860
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Maybe they'll get more in the future.

861
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Um, speaking of old retro stuff,

862
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
old Sierra games, and I'm talking, like, Leisure Suit Larry 1,

863
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Police Quest 1, Space Quest 1,

864
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
apparently there's a new website where you can actually play these games

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in your browser, but it's kind of cool because the games run in Flash,

866
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
but there's this weird, like, multiplayer element

867
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
where you can watch other people solve puzzles,

868
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and there's a new right-click menu system in the game.

869
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
If you want to check this out, the website is called sarian.net.

870
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
S-A-R-I-E-N dot net.

871
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And so it's just kind of like a walkthrough of these classic old school Sierra games.

872
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So if you were a Sierra game fan like I was back in the day,

873
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
then you definitely want to check that out.

874
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
They only have those three games right now,

875
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the Leisure Suit Larry 1, Police Quest 1, and Space Quest 1.

876
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
No word when my favorite of the old Sierra games,

877
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
which would be King's Quest 4, is going to make the list.

878
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So check that out.

879
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Moving on with some more gaming news, over to Dark Sakura.

880
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Well, I'm sure some of our regular listeners remember me talking about

881
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
getting a FC Mobile, which is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.

882
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Now there is a new one, which I am going to be getting and selling my old one.

883
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's the FC Mobile 2, and it comes with stuff and things.

884
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
As in, it comes with controllers,

885
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
wireless controllers, and a light gun.

886
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
A wireless light gun that's pretty good in relation to the old NES Zapper.

887
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So when you have it basically using the TV tuner mode and using it as your Nintendo,

888
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
you have actual controllers. You do not have to use the system.

889
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So it's going to be out in May.

890
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It will be $60, and it will have a black version and a white version.

891
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And I'm going to have one.

892
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Mine will go up for sale. My old one.

893
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The end.

894
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
This is so interesting how the old school Nintendo stuff is making such a comeback,

895
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
thanks to, in part, this whole FC Mobile stuff.

896
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So it's kind of cool.

897
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
How much money do you think you're going to end up spending on all this crap?

898
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Not much. It's only $60. It should be cheaper elsewhere.

899
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Hitstun in our chat room right now says,

900
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah, this week I bought an FC Mobile, tried it, realized the fucking A and B buttons were backwards,

901
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and returned it for a refund.

902
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, they're fixing that.

903
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
All in about a half hour's time.

904
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
They're fixing that.

905
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
They've reversed the A and B buttons to where they should be on the new version.

906
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Does that have anything to do with the fact that in Japan, most games do have it flipped?

907
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Or is that just, no, it really was messed up?

908
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I think that they based the old FC Mobile off of the Famicom Mobile.

909
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The U.S. one was based off of the Japanese one,

910
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
but I think that the U.S. release one is going to actually,

911
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
they were saying that the button should be corrected for American audiences.

912
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Alrighty.

913
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And I got a hug in chat for mentioning King's Quest IV.

914
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's like the quintessential Sierra game. I'm sorry.

915
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That is the best.

916
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If anybody were to ask me what old school Sierra game should I play

917
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to check out why these games were so awesome,

918
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because there's like 20 of them out there in all these different series,

919
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I would say King's Quest IV is the one you should check out first.

920
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I like King's Quest better than Space Quest IV.

921
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I like Space Quest IV.

922
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh yeah.

923
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Really?

924
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, I do. I like Legion Suit Larry too,

925
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but I think King's Quest is more accessible for everybody.

926
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You have to have a certain sense of humor to like Legion Suit Larry.

927
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So there you go.

928
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Alright, well, more news.

929
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We've got release dates coming up.

930
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes.

931
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Well, this ought to make Jamie happy.

932
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's been confirmed that next week on the, or not virtual console,

933
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
on Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual On will be coming out.

934
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes, on April 29th, you can expect Virtual On out on Xbox Live Arcade.

935
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Apparently, though, it is going to be priced at 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.

936
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So?

937
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That is so for me.

938
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It's Virtual On.

939
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm totally getting it.

940
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live.

941
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Once wins six.

942
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Because there's Virtual On.

943
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Or an adapter.

944
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
An outrun.

945
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Adapter, so I can use my Dreamcast twin sticks.

946
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Random Xbox Live Arcade.

947
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
One thing I did play actually this week as well was Lode Runner.

948
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I did check that out because I have fond memories of that game on the Commodore 64.

949
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Personally, I don't think that game has aged very well.

950
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They've tried to make it look nicer,

951
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but I think the core game itself has not aged very well.

952
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah.

953
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I think it's a game that's better left in my memory on the Commodore 64.

954
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't want to base the review off the demo,

955
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
but as I was checking it out, I was kind of going,

956
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
this is one of those things that I remember a lot more fondly when I was younger.

957
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
They have nice new graphics.

958
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's like they put the same old game in this nice new packaging,

959
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
but it's still the same old game that I think is better left in the 80s.

960
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So there you go.

961
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
All right.

962
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Let's go to some release dates.

963
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Over to Japan first.

964
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
We'll start tonight with some of the releases on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

965
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Coming out on, I believe, what is their release date?

966
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I think April 30th.

967
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
X-Blades is coming out on the Xbox 360.

968
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That's really the only big game coming out this week.

969
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, you also have X-Blades from Ubisoft,

970
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
as well as versions of NHL 2009 coming out there as well.

971
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii,

972
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
you have GQO Powerful Major League 2009

973
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and Mahjong Kakuto Club Wii come out as well.

974
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's kind of a slow release week, if you can imagine.

975
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That's cool.

976
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
PlayStation 2 has a game called NHL 2009,

977
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
as well as Tiernanog is coming out as well.

978
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Wasn't that a song in DDR?

979
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
No.

980
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, it is. It is.

981
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's a game based off the Mystic Knights of Tiernanog.

982
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's what it is. Huh?

983
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I was going to say it's Celtic mythology.

984
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's what it is.

985
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's a role-playing game.

986
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This actually looks kind of cool.

987
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That neato.

988
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's on PlayStation 2 of all systems.

989
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So that's coming out from SystemSoft this week in Japan.

990
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That looks to be the most exciting thing I've seen yet.

991
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Going to the handhelds,

992
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
we'll see if there's any big handheld stuff coming out this week.

993
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That might explain why the lineup is kind of weak on the consoles.

994
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We do have a Dragon Ball Z game coming out,

995
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
as well as WarioWare Myself comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

996
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And Shinobi Retsuden 3 comes out as well.

997
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And let's see.

998
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's all on the DS.

999
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And on the Sony PSP.

1000
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh, there you go.

1001
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Persona comes out this week on the PSP.

1002
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That must be the big game that's coming out this week.

1003
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
As well as a version of Tiernanog on Sony PSP.

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You fail at Blaster Master.

1005
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's kind of cool.

1006
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
All right.

1007
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So they're playing Blaster Master on Justin TV right now,

1008
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
but having a hard time with the Dreamcast controller.

1009
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
There you go.

1010
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
All right.

1011
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Let's move on with more release dates.

1012
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I have two.

1013
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We have on the 1st of May, which is May Day,

1014
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
which is a fertility holiday.

1015
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Ooh.

1016
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We have Gardening Mama on the DS.

1017
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We have Marbles Balance Challenge on the Wii.

1018
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That's it.

1019
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
This is a slow week.

1020
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I think the Marbles Balance Challenge I think is a WiiWare game.

1021
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They're too busy practicing fertility, right?

1022
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Dancing the maypole.

1023
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
This week there's not a whole lot coming out as well in the U.S.

1024
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Starting off Backyard Baseball 2010 coming out on the PlayStation 2,

1025
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
but you might as well skip that game because it sucks.

1026
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The Aquarium World, which is apparently a port of the DS Aquarium game,

1027
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
also sucks.

1028
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Please avoid that one.

1029
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Horrible game.

1030
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Elite Forces Unit 77 coming out on the DS.

1031
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Still horrible, but okay.

1032
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Velvet Assassin coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

1033
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That one's supposed to be okay.

1034
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Dynasty Warriors Strike Force on PSP.

1035
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Maybe here, I think this is the wrong date,

1036
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
but Klonoa on the Wii is supposed to be coming out.

1037
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yay!

1038
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I think it's the week after, but we'll go with that I guess.

1039
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Super Robot Tyson OG Saga Endless Frontier,

1040
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
which actually looks pretty cool.

1041
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's coming out on the DS.

1042
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Tournament Pool coming out from Destiny Air,

1043
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
which means that must suck.

1044
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's on the Wii.

1045
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming out on the DS.

1046
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Okay.

1047
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Is it like Imagine Fuego?

1048
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
No, not quite Imagine Fuego.

1049
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And then finally, probably the bigger game of the week,

1050
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and this is sad, but X-Men Origins Wolverine.

1051
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And if you happen to be buying it on the 360,

1052
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and on the PlayStation 3, the Uncaged Edition,

1053
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
which means it's slightly more violent,

1054
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
will be coming out in pretty much every system out there.

1055
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And then also some more crap from Destiny Air.

1056
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Party Pigs Farmyard Games on the Wii.

1057
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And that is it.

1058
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That is your week in games.

1059
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Why is it such a crap week for games?

1060
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I guess we're just...

1061
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
April's usually light, that's why.

1062
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We're all busy doing it.

1063
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I guess everybody's prepped for the summer or something.

1064
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Alright, well, at least online looks to be a little more exciting

1065
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
if you look at the stuff that's available on Virtual Console

1066
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and those types of places.

1067
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
One thing that's coming out in Japan anyway,

1068
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
sadly it's not here yet, but maybe someday,

1069
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
the Wii Video Service is going to be launching in Japan on May 1st.

1070
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Here's the cool thing about it.

1071
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You will be able to connect with your DSi.

1072
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Notice how it doesn't say your DS, but your DSi.

1073
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's called the Wii No Ma Channel,

1074
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and it's coming out from May 1st.

1075
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's being launched by Nintendo,

1076
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and Dentsu is their publisher partner.

1077
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, it makes sense that you couldn't do the DS

1078
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
because you can't download anything to the DS.

1079
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Well, you can't download programs.

1080
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, to the regular DS, yeah.

1081
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Couldn't you download a movie to the regular DS,

1082
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
close it, and have it later? I don't know.

1083
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
As long as you don't turn it off.

1084
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I believe it uses flash memory for the demos.

1085
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Let me tell you a little bit more about how it works.

1086
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Basically, when you go into this app,

1087
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
it looks like a little family room,

1088
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and eight of your Miis will show up gathering in this room.

1089
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
If you go into the TV in the room,

1090
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
you'll get to do the download service.

1091
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
There will be both free and paid content.

1092
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They haven't announced what's going to be in it yet.

1093
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
One of the demo videos uses this nature footage,

1094
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
so I don't know if they just have some stock video

1095
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
to kind of show the program off or what have you.

1096
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
If you go on a house plant, you go to the sponsor area,

1097
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and you get some free trials of stuff from advertisers,

1098
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
so I don't know, like a sponsor area.

1099
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know how that ties into videos, but there you go.

1100
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You will also be able to use this on the DSi.

1101
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
There's going to be a free app called Doko Demo Wii No Ma.

1102
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's called Anywhere, translate what's it to, Anywhere Wii No Ma,

1103
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and you'll be able to download the video from the Wii to your DS,

1104
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
as well as redeem coupons.

1105
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And apparently in one of the demo videos,

1106
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you get a fast food restaurant coupon that you get from this channel.

1107
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You'd get it to your DSi, and then they scan it on your DSi

1108
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
at the restaurant to redeem it.

1109
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Kind of neat. A little different.

1110
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
There's a trailer out there on the internet if you want to check that out,

1111
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
but it isn't Japanese, so there you go.

1112
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Do you think they'll have something like this out here soon?

1113
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Too much trouble for us lazy Americans.

1114
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I don't think you'll have quite that cool functionality

1115
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
like the fast food restaurant thing I was describing,

1116
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
but why not the video service?

1117
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because then that would mean that they actually are going to embrace online

1118
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
for the U.S., and that's never going to happen.

1119
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But wasn't Japan always kind of holding them back?

1120
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Well, no.

1121
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Look at the one company that's braced online better than anybody else

1122
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
is an American company, Microsoft.

1123
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes.

1124
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And Nintendo is a Japanese-run company.

1125
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I know, and Sony has been always having to run to catch up

1126
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
with the online stuff.

1127
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
At least they're willing to give it a shot.

1128
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
After all, their systems did have support for online network games.

1129
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Granted, the GameCube did as well,

1130
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
but honestly, how many games really used it?

1131
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Like, two.

1132
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I don't know. I don't think we'll see this.

1133
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean, after all, they haven't even brought the normal video download service

1134
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
to the Wii yet, so why the video streaming?

1135
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I just don't see this as something they're just going to do,

1136
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
because it doesn't really...

1137
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean, it adds, I guess, functionality to the Wii,

1138
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
but really they don't need it,

1139
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
because people want to buy Wii Sports,

1140
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and hopefully Wii Sports 2 or Wii Sports Resort.

1141
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
All right. Well, we'll see if they give this a shot in the U.S. or not.

1142
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Probably not.

1143
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Anyway, moving on. More news.

1144
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, in other news, this is actually a statement made by American McGee,

1145
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and I fully endorse this, you know.

1146
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
They're asked about the trend of using user-made content,

1147
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and American McGee was saying that it's actually extortion of the users

1148
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
to make the content.

1149
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You know, they're basically using the users to make the game.

1150
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
They just make the properties to go with it.

1151
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
He thinks that there should be some kind of reward out there

1152
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
for gamers who make the content, which I agree with.

1153
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I think that would be a good idea.

1154
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You know, or at least contests and things like that.

1155
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But it's really just, you know, partially laziness on part of the programs.

1156
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I think it actually, there's the immersive element of having people,

1157
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
you know, the players provide content,

1158
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but at the same time, yeah, they should be rewarded for it.

1159
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
When I was first hearing this story,

1160
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I couldn't help but think maybe it was a dig on LittleBigPlanet,

1161
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
because that's a game that relies so much on the user-created content.

1162
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's the big sell of the game.

1163
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You know what I mean?

1164
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
LittleBigPlanet is the best game I played last year completely.

1165
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Certainly better than those American McGee, you know, the Grim Fairy Tales games they have out right now.

1166
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
No, I don't agree with, you know, his statements at all,

1167
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because if you think about it, that's like saying if I buy a pencil and I do a drawing,

1168
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
should the company that provided me with the pencil, you know,

1169
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
they have to pay me for the drawing they made, because...

1170
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But are you going to go back and use the drawing afterwards?

1171
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
What do you mean if I'm going to use the drawing?

1172
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Or let other people...

1173
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Is the pencil company going to sell your drawing, basically?

1174
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Are you going to...

1175
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yeah, but they're not selling their online content.

1176
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Are you going to be drawing up for common use so that anybody else on the internet can use your piece?

1177
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Then don't make anything for it.

1178
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I mean, that's the thing.

1179
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's like if you're going to be all butthurt about people using your, you know, stuff that you made,

1180
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
then don't make anything.

1181
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The point is that the games rely on user-created content.

1182
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
No, they don't, because they actually have their own standby levels,

1183
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and if you never touched online, it wouldn't matter anyways,

1184
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
because you still got a full game's worth of stuff.

1185
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
To be fair, I'm using LittleBigPlanet as an example.

1186
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We don't know exactly what kind of game he had in mind either.

1187
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh, he's full of crap.

1188
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I mean, his game, Grim, is...

1189
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm sorry, it's not that great.

1190
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But, whatever, you know, he thinks he's an expert because he's developed, you know, two game series.

1191
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Ooh, let's bow down to you.

1192
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh, wait, how was your Bad Day L.A. game?

1193
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh, that's right, it wasn't very good.

1194
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I mean, maybe if he had some user-created content, it would have made that game worth buying,

1195
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but, I don't know, it's just...

1196
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm kind of in the middle here.

1197
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Like, I kind of understand what he...

1198
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I do agree that if companies are going to use your stuff,

1199
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
you should get rewards for that, you know what I mean?

1200
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You should be able to...

1201
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
They could even go as far as compensation, you know what I mean?

1202
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I think that there should actually be contests.

1203
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You know, content contests.

1204
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And Sony does kind of reward, like, they give the crowns in Little Big Planet if you're super popular.

1205
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The trophies are based off the popularity of your levels.

1206
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Little perks, nothing big.

1207
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They should have, like, real prizes.

1208
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Real stuff.

1209
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah, that's what I think.

1210
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Alright.

1211
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
If you guys have a comment, chat.orangelandrader.com is the place you can leave us a comment on this.

1212
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Or you can always send us a tweet.

1213
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
At OLR is the place you can go as well.

1214
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Some comments from chat right now over at chat.orangelandrader.com.

1215
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Leo Shen says, hopefully that new Alice game will be good.

1216
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I keep forgetting, they are working on a new Alice game, aren't they?

1217
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
They're working on an Alice movie, too.

1218
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Well, Alice in Wonderland.

1219
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
He was supposed to be working on an Alice movie as well, but...

1220
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I don't know.

1221
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's just...

1222
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's just because he...

1223
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
For whatever reason, we hold these game developers up really high, and then they start getting a big head.

1224
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And thinking that they can comment on everything.

1225
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And granted, yes, they can make comments on everything, but then people...

1226
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We comment on everything.

1227
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It's just people don't give a shit what we say.

1228
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
They don't get posts everywhere.

1229
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
No one goes and posts our comments in a blog, and they'll present it as gospel on the industry.

1230
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I mean, it's just one person's opinion.

1231
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Just like his opinion.

1232
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
He thinks that people should be compensated.

1233
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Well, great!

1234
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
If he ever creates a game that has user-created content, then I want him to see him compensating everybody.

1235
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Since he's made such a fuss over it.

1236
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So...

1237
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Whatever.

1238
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1239
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Loki?

1240
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Advent Children Complete, the brand new Blu-Ray box set that came out in Japan last week,

1241
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
has actually been doing very well.

1242
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
In fact, it's sold over 274,000 copies.

1243
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And the demo itself has actually pushed the PS3 to the top of the charts.

1244
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Because, yes, people do actually want to buy this box set for the game.

1245
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And, yeah, that's fine.

1246
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
The movie's awesome, too.

1247
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But I think it's definitely...

1248
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I mean, they must be pretty confident in it.

1249
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
After all, they did release a special edition PS3 in Japan with this box set.

1250
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So, you know, people love their Final Fantasy VII.

1251
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Even though it's really probably the Final Fantasy XIII demo that's driving all of this?

1252
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yes.

1253
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I mean, how many of those came to America?

1254
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I mean, I haven't heard of people importing a game as much as I've heard of this.

1255
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like, I seriously know.

1256
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I know you imported it.

1257
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
One of my friends on LiveJournal imported it.

1258
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I know Bobby imported it.

1259
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And I don't...

1260
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Like, I haven't heard of that many people importing anything else.

1261
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You know what I mean?

1262
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Like, maybe one of you would import another game from Japan.

1263
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But, like, all of you guys got that Final Fantasy XIII demo.

1264
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You know, I think that you import...

1265
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You know, and it's probably maybe only, like, a thousand or two thousand of that is imports.

1266
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You can't say the whole bit is.

1267
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But that's still...

1268
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It just kind of shows you the popularity of it, if that makes sense.

1269
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yes, it does make sense.

1270
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So, it's pretty popular.

1271
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And I'm sure, like, if, you know...

1272
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII actually comes out over there on PS3 and stuff,

1273
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
people will be importing that bitch.

1274
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Oh, yeah, because it'll be region-free.

1275
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, it'll be region-free.

1276
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It'll be a few months early.

1277
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then they'll buy it again in the U.S. because we're all consumer whores, right?

1278
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yep.

1279
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That's right.

1280
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Already thinking about it.

1281
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
There you go.

1282
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm kind of curious.

1283
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Chat room.

1284
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
What kind of game...

1285
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Because I see Act Def Comments has imported three games.

1286
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What are some games, chat room, you've imported in the past year?

1287
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because, you know, when you...

1288
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And the reason why I ask is because it costs a lot more money when you order import games from Japan.

1289
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So, I'm kind of curious, those of you in chat.

1290
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Give me some ideas.

1291
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
What kind of games have you imported in the past year?

1292
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We'll say year or two.

1293
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Within this current console cycle, you know, what kind of stuff have you imported?

1294
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Is that the only thing you've imported during this cycle?

1295
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Nope.

1296
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I imported Smash Brothers Brawl.

1297
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I also imported...

1298
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't know why I imported this, but I imported Wangen Midnight on the PS3.

1299
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1300
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Because it was not like the arcade one, for sure.

1301
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No, it was not, unfortunately.

1302
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
There's some other games.

1303
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I thought about importing Africa, never got around to it.

1304
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Just because it can't run over the animals, and that's just not fun for me.

1305
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There's another RPG that came out over there.

1306
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I think it's Dark Souls or something like that.

1307
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That's actually all in English that I thought about importing.

1308
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But I haven't even played the PS3 games I have now.

1309
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Like, I have Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 that I still haven't played anything.

1310
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You know, I haven't even gotten past, like, the first level in...

1311
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Well, I passed the first level, but not the second level in Resistance 2.

1312
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I don't know.

1313
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I thought about getting a Japanese Xbox 360,

1314
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
because I haven't figured out a good way to region-free my 360,

1315
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
since most of the games that come out in Japan aren't region-free on the 360.

1316
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But that's pretty much it.

1317
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah, just those three games.

1318
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Let me read some comments from our chat room about the imports,

1319
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
the games that have been imported.

1320
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Act F says he's imported Happy Sky, Gya Kuten Saiban 2, and Street Fighter's Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.

1321
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Why can't I talk tonight?

1322
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Dark Knight says 2DX Red.

1323
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Liu Shen says 2DX Poppin' and Oz.

1324
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
GS68 says kitsui Death Label, Poppin' Music 13 Carnival,

1325
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
DJ Max Portable Black Square.

1326
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Jason says, current console cycle, I haven't.

1327
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Gold Anthro says, I've never really imported a game ever.

1328
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I don't have the extra money.

1329
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
There you go.

1330
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Some of the comments from things that have been imported in the current cycle.

1331
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Funny enough, none of them said the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

1332
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

1333
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
All right.

1334
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Hey, PlayStation Home, another popular destination on the PlayStation 3.

1335
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
There is an update coming for PlayStation Home.

1336
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There's going to be a new Disgaea Lounge,

1337
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and apparently in this new Disgaea area, you'll be able to play like a Disgaea test.

1338
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There'll be a card game, some type of block game available as well.

1339
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And of course, prettys.

1340
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Little pretty penguin people that you can see in this area.

1341
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Also, some other stuff coming to home this month.

1342
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Street Fighter IV Avatar items.

1343
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You can start Street Fighter IV within Home.

1344
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And Uncharted Waters Online.

1345
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Cruz del Sur is supposed to come out as well,

1346
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
which offers some new home items within Home.

1347
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So there you go.

1348
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's all coming to PlayStation Home.

1349
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Haven't been home in a while.

1350
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Neither, but, well, I guess only a couple weeks when I say a while.

1351
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So, you know, there you go.

1352
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's all coming to PlayStation Home this month.

1353
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Well, that's special.

1354
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Very, very special.

1355
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Well, how about some different PlayStation 3 news?

1356
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
This is definitely a reason that is if you

1357
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Sorry, the mics died for a minute.

1358
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It was my fault.

1359
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Live radio, boys and girls.

1360
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Did that work? Did you hear that microphone?

1361
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yes, sorry.

1362
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Roar!

1363
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Okay.

1364
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
If you have a problem, you can take it up with me.

1365
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Anyway.

1366
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So for fans of the PlayStation 3,

1367
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
there is a very good reason to have

1368
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Arkham Asylum on that system,

1369
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
because you get to play the Joker.

1370
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
The Joker is cool.

1371
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Reviews so far of the game have been pretty positive,

1372
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
so I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

1373
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But there's really, though, no comment on

1374
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
if you're going to be able to use him at all

1375
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
on Xbox 360 or PC.

1376
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You, basically, though, the way it's going to work

1377
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
is that you'll go on to the PlayStation Store

1378
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
to purchase him, but he's only playable on the challenge maps.

1379
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Mr. J.

1380
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Huh.

1381
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I wonder if Xbox 360 will have their own little special character.

1382
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
If it's Catwoman, I gotta go with 360.

1383
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I gotta say.

1384
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I don't know, because Joker is Joker.

1385
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I want Harley.

1386
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah, you don't know.

1387
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Like, maybe there's still going to be a special character on the 360

1388
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
that's going to be, you know, everybody's going to want that, too.

1389
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I mean, obviously, the Joker's the big-ass deal with the movie and everything,

1390
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
but, you know, I don't know.

1391
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Me, personally, I love Batman for years and years.

1392
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
This will probably come out on the 360

1393
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
after a certain amount of time.

1394
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's just, you know, sweeten the deal,

1395
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
because you've got to sell some PS3 units since there's not as many systems.

1396
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Only if one of the Joker's attacks is the magic trick.

1397
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is Mark Hamill, Joker, so probably not.

1398
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That's right. X-Link is reminding us in chat that Mark Hamill is doing the voice.

1399
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh, my God.

1400
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

1401
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Mark Hamill is the best voice actor ever for Joker The End.

1402
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's also the guy with the same guy that's doing the voice

1403
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
from the animated series for Batman as well,

1404
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and I think they have the writer doing the actual story of the game, too.

1405
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's nice.

1406
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Too bad they can't get Eartha Kitt for Catwoman,

1407
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
because she's, you know, dead, but that would have been great.

1408
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
For what I've seen in the video trailer for it,

1409
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I think they have the same voice actor for Harley Quinn, too.

1410
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yay! God, I love Harley.

1411
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I just think that she's great because she was totally made for the animated series,

1412
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and fans loved her so much that she made it into the comic universe.

1413
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Well, I hope the game's as good as the hype,

1414
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
because everybody's getting excited about it.

1415
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Nobody's played the game yet.

1416
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Actually, some people have had their hands on early copies to review it,

1417
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and it did get some pretty good reviews.

1418
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Eurogamer really, really liked it.

1419
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
They were just excited because they had early copies.

1420
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Well, Sony was teasing an electrifying announcement

1421
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that they were going to make on April 27th

1422
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,000
regarding Uncharted Drake's Fortune 2 and also Infamous.

1423
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
However, like any other secret announcement that they have,

1424
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
it got ruined by Best Buy.

1425
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So apparently part of the announcement,

1426
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
at least we can assume it's part, if not all, of the announcement,

1427
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
if you buy your copy of Infamous,

1428
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
you will get a downloadable demo,

1429
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
as well as access to Uncharted 2 among thieves,

1430
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
the multiplayer beta, one that launches in June.

1431
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So much like Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta,

1432
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
you'll get to do a similar type of thing with Uncharted 2.

1433
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And of course, everyone's thought was,

1434
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
hey, not only will you probably be able to play the Uncharted 2 beta,

1435
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
but maybe the Infamous character is going to be an unlockable in Uncharted 2.

1436
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So that might be another theory as well.

1437
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But we'll hear the official announcement on the 27th,

1438
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and everybody act surprised.

1439
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Sorry the surprise got ruined by Best Buy, Sony.

1440
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
This sad trombone's for you.

1441
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I know. We love sad trombone here on Orange Launch Radio.

1442
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We should make that official thing, that when this type of stuff happens,

1443
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
we give them a sad trombone, and that's whatever.

1444
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
The sad trombone of the week.

1445
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's right, the sad trombone of the week.

1446
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
All right, we got one more story for you that won't be a sad trombone,

1447
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
for some people are going to be very excited to hear this,

1448
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
but apparently Kojima is swearing there's not going to be another Metal Gear for a while.

1449
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But one of the other games he's looking at possibly revisiting,

1450
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Zone of the Enders.

1451
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That's right. Apparently they are interested in making a Zone of the Enders 3,

1452
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and this came up during one of the Metal Gear Solid 4 podcasts.

1453
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's been six years since Zone of the Enders, the second runner.

1454
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
But apparently Kojima is interested.

1455
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
He wants gamers to email them if they're interested in seeing it happen.

1456
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
So if you want to add to the email barrage I'm sure they're getting right now,

1457
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
go check that out, the MGS4 podcast, and you can send them an email.

1458
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So I'm sure they're getting bombarded with them because since this hit the internet,

1459
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
everybody's probably emailing saying, yes, Zone of the Enders.

1460
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And we have some folks in chat room that are getting very excited about hearing

1461
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
the Zone of the Enders stuff as well.

1462
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So I don't know, are you guys interested in Zone of the Enders 3?

1463
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yes.

1464
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Sure, why not?

1465
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
As long as Sana sings the song.

1466
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
All right, well let's get here to the end of part A,

1467
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
we're going to get into part B in just a minute here,

1468
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but before we end part A we have to get to a segment we always do here

1469
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1470
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Every week we like to dig through the old dusty gaming archive of video games

1471
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and pick out a classic video game that you kids should be revisiting.

1472
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
We're revisiting a lot on Justin TV tonight actually.

1473
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It looks like Rice Princess is playing Willow right now.

1474
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Good times, that's a good pick.

1475
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That's a previous classic game of the week, that's already been done.

1476
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
We have a brand new classic game of the week tonight,

1477
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and Dark Soccer is back, I picked one last week,

1478
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
but Dark Soccer is back to pick one for you guys.

1479
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,000
We did Spy vs. Spy, an old Commodore 64 game that they ended up on the NES,

1480
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and it had two sequels that a lot of people don't know about

1481
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
because they were only on Commodore 64,

1482
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
but one of the very first games ever to have same screen multiplayer.

1483
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
That's what makes it unique.

1484
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
All right, anyhow, that's so last week though.

1485
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Let's get into this week and the classic game of the week this week.

1486
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

1487
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The game of the week is Klonoa, because Klonoa is great.

1488
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Let's have some music, Rob.

1489
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yes, this is from the PlayStation 1 version of Klonoa.

1490
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Let's check it out.

1491
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Explosions.

1492
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I love music in this game.

1493
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm going to choke on the cue.

1494
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:44,000
This is not the best music ever.

1495
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You can still just see how nauseously cued this game is from music.

1496
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
There you go.

1497
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well, it starts off nauseously cute, but how many people has actually played the damn game?

1498
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Basically, you start off in a world called Phantomile.

1499
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Klonoa lives in this little village called Breezegale.

1500
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
He lives with his grandfather.

1501
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:18,000
He goes and visits Dreamworld, where he has to go and save different people.

1502
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Basically, he meets up with his buddy named Q-Pal,

1503
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
who lives in a ring that Klonoa found in the forest.

1504
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That's where Klonoa gets his power from.

1505
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
He basically has to go and rescue this girl named Lola,

1506
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:53,000
who is a...well, actually, wrong one, because he has to...no, I think it's Lola that he has to...was he rescued?

1507
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Anyway, he has to rescue some chick.

1508
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I thought it was either Lola or Lirina, one of those two.

1509
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:13,000
He has to go through and actually rescue this priestess who was captured by Gaudius, who is the main bad guy.

1510
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:23,000
He thinks that dark remotions should reign and that you should accept it as much as you do the light.

1511
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
However, he's just doing this to do it.

1512
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:38,000
As you go through the game, you're having to...I really don't want to spoil things too much,

1513
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
but as it goes through, you have to go through the different stages and fight the different bosses.

1514
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
The game plays sort of pseudo-3D.

1515
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It plays on a 2D platform, but you've got some three-dimensional elements thrown in,

1516
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
like hitting stuff that goes into the background to pop eggs to get more jewels to power your stuff up with,

1517
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
or you can also rescue these different people that live in different places.

1518
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
You've got these people that look like Klonoa in the first level,

1519
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and you have these people that look like moon things in the next level,

1520
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
but you have to go through and actually rescue people as you go along and fight the enemies

1521
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
by picking up the smaller enemies and throwing them at the bigger ones

1522
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
or using the different properties.

1523
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
There's ones that fly, and you have to grab them, and they'll fly you upwards a little bit.

1524
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's a ton of fun. We actually did get a sequel over here in the U.S.,

1525
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
which was Klonoa 2, Limitee's Veil.

1526
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It used a cel shading for the game.

1527
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Actually, this is where those other characters came in.

1528
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I'll be perfectly honest. I haven't played the first Klonoa in a long, long time,

1529
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
so I don't really remember all the people's names except for Joka and Gaudius,

1530
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and I remember his grandfather, which was very sad, and I guess that happens to him.

1531
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Joka, though, sucks. Sucks a lot.

1532
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But Klonoa 2 had the platformer levels and different types of boss battles

1533
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and time attack challenges and water parks and things like that, too.

1534
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But the thing about this game, about actually both of the games, I'd say,

1535
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
is that for as cute and light as they look, and, you know,

1536
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
it'd be a game that a little kid could play and not really understand the darker elements to,

1537
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
it does have a ton of darker elements.

1538
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I mean, really, this game gets downright freaking depressing.

1539
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Just depressing. I mean, the further you get on in the game, you're like,

1540
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
oh my god, can this get any more screwed up? And then it gets more screwed up.

1541
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1542
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Now, did you happen to pick this game this week because there's that Wii version coming out very soon,

1543
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
or just coincidence?

1544
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Well, I was thinking about it, and what I did now when I pick a classic game

1545
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
is I looked at my own collection, which usually takes me quite a while.

1546
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But I happened to see Klonoa there. I was like, oh, Klonoa's coming out this week, so I might as well pick it.

1547
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But there's also other versions of the game, too.

1548
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
There's a Klonoa 2 Dream Champ tournament that came out in Game Boy Advance in Japan.

1549
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And it actually did come out over here quite a bit later.

1550
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
There's also Klonoa Moonlight Museum, which came out in Japan on WonderSwan,

1551
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
which I might have.

1552
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
But there's also Klonoa Empire of Dreams that also came out for Game Boy Advance.

1553
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And there's actually in 2002, there was Klonoa Heroes Legend of the Star Metal,

1554
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
which is an action RPG.

1555
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So you can actually play through the game as an RPG.

1556
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
For other things, Klonoa had a cameo in MotoGP in Alpine Racer 3.

1557
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Klonoa and another character, Goonps, were a playable pair in Namco X Capcom, or VS Capcom, or whatever.

1558
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And they had their moves from Klonoa Heroes.

1559
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:34,000
You can also see Joka, Janga, and the moves as enemies, and also Lolo and Lalakusha,

1560
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
who was another priestess, as non-playable characters.

1561
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And in Tales of Symphonia, you could put Priscia in a Klonoa costume.

1562
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:54,000
There's also Shipputen Goku Kaze no Klonoa, which was a really just comedic manga about Klonoa,

1563
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
who was a kid who wanted to be a superhero.

1564
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And really, that's it.

1565
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean, it's just a fun, fun, fun game.

1566
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It's really, really... it can get difficult, because you have to think ahead with the puzzles.

1567
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
You have to always be keeping your eyes open.

1568
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But it does build up in such a way that the learning curve really is a bit more kind.

1569
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
In fact, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the website I used to have a long time ago.

1570
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It was called the Anime and Video Game Alliance.

1571
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes, this was a long, long time ago.

1572
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But one of my banner characters was the picture of Klonoa.

1573
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I've liked this game for a very long time.

1574
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Definitely a classic, one that I know some of our listeners love.

1575
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
They love that you picked this tonight.

1576
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
So there you have it, Klonoa, your classic video game of the week.

1577
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh, wait, did you play the conversation track?

1578
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah, I played it in the background already.

1579
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh, sorry. Well, if we can go back to the beginning of that one.

1580
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I will try, yes.

1581
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
The other thing I wanted to bring up is that they have sort of a made-up language,

1582
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
which I tried to see if they were speaking Japanese or something.

1583
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And, of course, given the voice actors, it borrows a lot of elements from Japanese, but it's not quite.

1584
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It actually reminds me of La La Naya.

1585
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Here, watch this.

1586
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Gotta go that way.

1587
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Boo-rah, jerk.

1588
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I got that back, daddy.

1589
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Cute.

1590
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
All right.

1591
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But I don't know if I've ever talked about La La Naya before,

1592
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
but for anyone who was a little kid in the 80s who watched The Great Space Coaster,

1593
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
it was this walking line that would walk along, and it was done by an Italian illustrator.

1594
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And the line drawing would talk to the illustrator and interact with him,

1595
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
but he spoke sort of a pidgin Italian, and that's what this reminds me of.

1596
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So, obscure reference there.

1597
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
All right.

1598
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Klonoa.

1599
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Klonoa, your classic game of the week.

1600
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
We also did Dan and I used to walk around going, wa-roop, just because.

1601
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
All right.

1602
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio,

1603
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
but we will be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1604
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
We've got more stories to talk about in Part B, some Xbox 360,

1605
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
some Penny Arcade Expo news we have as well, and plenty more.

1606
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1607
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening,

1608
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
April the 26th of 2009.

1609
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

1610
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and then we put out the podcast at some point.

1611
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
All right.

1612
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining you for this lovely Part B here of Orange Lounge Radio.

1613
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Dark Soccer is here as well, Loki, special guests tonight, The Doctor and Rice Princess,

1614
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and we've been joined by somebody else.

1615
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I thought she was Fart Princess.

1616
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Is she Fart?

1617
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
No, I think she went back to me.

1618
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Are you Ice Princess or Fart Princess?

1619
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Are you Fart Princess or Rice Princess?

1620
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Or are you Great Princess?

1621
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
She's Rice Princess again.

1622
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
She's Drunk Princess.

1623
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
She took some gas acts, so she's now.

1624
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah, right now she's Drunk Princess, actually.

1625
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We're taking wine tonight.

1626
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
A lovely, lovely Zinfandel.

1627
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
It's wine candy.

1628
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yes.

1629
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
It's wine and belly flop night.

1630
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
All right.

1631
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So we have another guest who joined us part way.

1632
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
A challenger has arrived.

1633
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
A new challenger has arrived.

1634
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Who is our new person never been on the show before?

1635
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
This is Mellie Wellie.

1636
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Mellie Wellie.

1637
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Hello.

1638
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Hi, Mellie Wellie.

1639
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
How are you?

1640
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I am good.

1641
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm not loud enough.

1642
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
That's all right.

1643
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It takes a little getting used to.

1644
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
You have to practically scream in the microphone to be heard around here, but that's all right.

1645
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Quickly, Mellie Wellie, what kind of video games do you enjoy?

1646
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I actually enjoy Flash games.

1647
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
The reason that it took me a while to get here is because I was playing the new Gemcraft

1648
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
prequel.

1649
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Oh, what's Gemcraft?

1650
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I've not heard of this.

1651
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It's like a tower defense game, but you use gems in the towers, and it's actually really

1652
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
nerdy, but it's a lot of fun.

1653
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Those tower defense games are pretty crazy awesome, though.

1654
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
There's a big Final Fantasy one right now that's new.

1655
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So there you go.

1656
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Very cool.

1657
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Have you played, what is that, Don't Shit Your Pants?

1658
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
That's my favorite Flash game as of late.

1659
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
No.

1660
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That's the one I like.

1661
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I think I heard you guys talking about it a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had a chance

1662
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
to play it.

1663
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
That's the one I reckon it is.

1664
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Is that why you're not wearing any right now?

1665
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
No, there's a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants.

1666
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
What's this, Rice Princess?

1667
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You play this every day?

1668
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yes, I play the Don't Shit My Pants game every day, because I successfully don't shit my

1669
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
pants every day.

1670
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I'm talking about the Flash game, Rice Princess.

1671
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Not real life.

1672
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Oh.

1673
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
There you go.

1674
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
All right.

1675
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Anyhow, all right.

1676
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So yeah, that's a great Flash game.

1677
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I recommend that.

1678
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And then of course we talked about in part A, you probably missed it because you were

1679
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
on your way over here, but we were actually talking about some of the old school Sierra

1680
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
games, like the very first Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry are now Flash games available

1681
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
on the internet that you can play somewhere.

1682
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I might have to find Leisure Suit Larry.

1683
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
They have that.

1684
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Leisure Suit Larry 1 is playable, so check that out.

1685
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
All right.

1686
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Anyhow, also the chat room is always joining us every week.

1687
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Chat.orangelaundry.com.

1688
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Dan Shadow in chat.

1689
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I just barely beat the first level of the FF Tower defense game.

1690
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Yeah, that game's kind of hard, actually.

1691
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Let's see.

1692
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I Like Old People asks, is Rob actually not wearing any pants?

1693
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
That's the name.

1694
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Why are you laughing?

1695
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yes, it's true.

1696
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Rob is not wearing any pants.

1697
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
No, I am too, wearing pants.

1698
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, no, you see, because he just got some new Hello Kitty undies, and he's got to show

1699
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
them off.

1700
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Shut up.

1701
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Rob is dancing in his panties.

1702
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Shut up, all of you.

1703
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That's a good chat name.

1704
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I like that name.

1705
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I like Old People.

1706
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Oh, then we still have to get Rob some panties.

1707
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I like Old People, too.

1708
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
In fact, I was very saddened, by the way.

1709
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I do want to mention at some point that I'm very saddened to hear about Bea Arthur.

1710
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Though, I mean, really, like, really ruined my day yesterday.

1711
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I was having a great day, and then I heard, I did a charity walk yesterday morning.

1712
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It was great.

1713
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I was slightly amused that she was mentioned on the Deadpool bugle, because Deadpool is

1714
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
obsessed with Bea Arthur.

1715
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Too soon.

1716
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Too soon.

1717
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
She was 86.

1718
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I know, but she just died.

1719
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Show a little respect.

1720
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
All right.

1721
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Anyhow.

1722
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I'll tell you what's funny, though.

1723
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
What?

1724
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
You missed, because you missed class.

1725
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Anyway.

1726
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm sorry.

1727
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
She's in my typography class with me.

1728
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
We were doing brainstorming about doing our play on words thing project that we have coming

1729
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
up.

1730
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And one of the words that came up just by accident was mod, and we started talking about

1731
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
the TV show just a little bit, and then the next day, dead.

1732
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
OMG, dead.

1733
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
That happened with Ricardo Montalban.

1734
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,440
We were listening to Montalban, which is our cage match winning song, the night before

1735
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,500
and watching the Rich Corinthian leather commercial, and then he died the next day.

1736
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,000
Also, that looks like a penis.

1737
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Okay.

1738
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,160
I think what you're listening to is that secretly Dark Sakura is the grim reaper.

1739
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,360
I could very well be.

1740
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,120
Are you the grim reaper?

1741
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,320
Do you want to find out?

1742
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,680
I will reap you with my grim reaping equipment.

1743
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:19,320
I was trying to find the intro to mod on YouTube somewhere so I could actually play it, but

1744
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,800
the best thing I could find was I found this here.

1745
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,880
No, I found something different.

1746
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,960
The family guy one is on there, but I found Rosie O'Donnell singing it.

1747
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:39,960
All right, that's enough.

1748
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,600
I'll tell you what, though, here's your B. Arthur trivia for the night.

1749
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,600
Oh, God.

1750
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,680
The show mod was a spinoff of all in the family.

1751
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Yes, it was.

1752
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,280
The show Good Times was a spinoff of mod.

1753
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,280
There's your trivia.

1754
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
Really?

1755
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
Yes.

1756
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,280
Now you know.

1757
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,280
And knowing is half the battle.

1758
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,280
Now I know that...

1759
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,540
What was the show with Urkel?

1760
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,960
Family Matters was a spinoff of Perfect Strangers.

1761
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,960
No.

1762
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,960
Full House.

1763
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,960
No.

1764
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,960
Full House.

1765
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,960
No, the mother and...

1766
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,960
God damn it.

1767
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,960
I will go throw down on this.

1768
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,600
Family Matters was the elevator person on Perfect Strangers.

1769
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,080
Yeah, and then the Full House baby was on the other show, so shut up.

1770
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,080
You shut up.

1771
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,080
Maybe they were all related.

1772
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,080
All right, anyway.

1773
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
Hi.

1774
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,080
We actually talk about video games, not just ABC Friday Night Lineup.

1775
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,080
Hey, we're not talking about food.

1776
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,080
That's right, and...

1777
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,360
But Rob, it's Friday night, and the mood is right.

1778
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,360
Shut up.

1779
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
I hate you.

1780
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,680
Gonna have some fun, show you how it's done.

1781
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,680
T-G-I-F.

1782
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,480
Okay, what the fuck, Alpha Kinanagram.

1783
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,200
Why do you...

1784
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,920
Why don't I have a Jamaican accent?

1785
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,160
Why do you ask this weird question?

1786
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,160
All right, I want to point this out, though.

1787
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,600
But this Cleo is not the Reaper.

1788
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,600
It's...

1789
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,120
But she's not Jamaican.

1790
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,340
I have something very important I need to point out, though.

1791
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:12,240
It is not actually T-G-I-F without...

1792
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:18,400
Everybody sing along if you know it.

1793
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
I only know the chorus.

1794
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,400
We have a fast forward.

1795
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,400
I don't know this part.

1796
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,400
Yes, I want everyone at home to sing it.

1797
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,400
Step by step was amazing.

1798
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers.

1799
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,720
Dude, Suzanne Somers, the makers of the summer-sized diet.

1800
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,640
They did tell the baby what lesbians were.

1801
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,640
That was pretty cool.

1802
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,960
Step by step, day by day.

1803
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,960
God, these intros were epic.

1804
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,960
This is a two-minute-long intro for the show.

1805
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,400
This is the writers had to put in less...

1806
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,240
Oddly enough, that's two minutes longer than my interest in the show.

1807
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,080
So, Loki, how about you say...

1808
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,320
Loki, video games, so we get sick of TV and we turn on a video game.

1809
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,720
Loki, goddamn, save this show, please.

1810
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,160
And what would be called the complete opposite of step by step?

1811
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,080
There was a new Fallout game announced.

1812
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:12,800
This one will be taking place in New Vegas, or I guess post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, which

1813
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,260
we can only expect to be awesome.

1814
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:19,440
And it's apparently not a sequel to Fallout 3, but it's just another game in the Fallout

1815
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,680
universe.

1816
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,920
In this one, do you start out as a fetus?

1817
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,120
Maybe.

1818
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:31,000
I think it's actually going to go through the whole chain of evolution.

1819
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,280
You start off as an amoeba.

1820
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,160
It's half spore, half Fallout.

1821
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Yeah, you have to make your way to the grand.

1822
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,160
Well, I mean...

1823
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,160
You start out as a baby.

1824
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,160
What?

1825
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,160
What?

1826
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,160
Doctor, we can't hear you if you're not saying it in a mic.

1827
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:47,040
No, it's just because Melanie was shaking her hand, and I was like, oh, but no, but I was

1828
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,880
like, no, but you started out as a baby, which I thought was dumb.

1829
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,760
A lot of people like the intro to Fallout, that you're a baby, because you can press

1830
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,080
a button to make a baby noise over and over.

1831
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,120
I wonder if you can press a button to shit.

1832
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,120
Shut up.

1833
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,120
All right.

1834
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,200
For the record, this is the shit show, not the fuck show.

1835
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,200
All right, look.

1836
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,200
What was I saying?

1837
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,480
I don't remember what I was saying, because I'm drinking wine.

1838
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,680
Yeah, a new Fallout game.

1839
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,680
Obvious.

1840
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,680
Hello, hello, Obvious.

1841
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,680
Of course this is going to make me fall again.

1842
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,520
Sequel, the successive selling game?

1843
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,520
Just old.

1844
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,520
Yeah.

1845
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,560
Is that Final Fantasy XIV coming out some day?

1846
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,640
Oh, how about a new Mario game on the Wii?

1847
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,400
Oh, maybe a new Zelda game in the works?

1848
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,520
I think they're all happening.

1849
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,480
Metroid Prime 4, you betcha.

1850
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,480
So anyhow.

1851
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:37,800
They need to do Metroid Primal, where Samus is a cat woman.

1852
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,180
This is going to be an interesting show, because I haven't eaten much today, so only a little

1853
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,960
bit of wine that I'm drinking so far is kind of having an effect.

1854
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,960
I had cake.

1855
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,960
I want cake.

1856
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,960
The cake was not a lie.

1857
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,560
It was made deliciously.

1858
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,040
Doctor, you keep asking me to take my pants off.

1859
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,040
I'm going to do it.

1860
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,040
Just you wait.

1861
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,040
No!

1862
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,520
For the love of God and all that is holy, keep your pants on!

1863
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,160
Which in Jamie speak means, please take your pants off right now!

1864
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,160
Take off your pants and hide them on your head.

1865
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,320
Everyone on the internet, on the entirety of the internet, should be thankful that A,

1866
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:13,320
this is a radio show, and B, that Justin.tv only shows video of our games now.

1867
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,320
Aren't you glad you came tonight?

1868
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,960
We're in slideshow mode tonight anyway.

1869
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,960
Yes it does.

1870
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,960
Anyhow.

1871
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:20,960
Oh, Microsoft.

1872
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,960
Hi, Microsoft.

1873
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:27,520
Microsoft, with their pants on, had a press conference in Japan this week, and they were

1874
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,720
saying, hey, Japan, we didn't forget about you, in fact, we've got 31 games that are

1875
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:36,800
on their way for the Xbox 360 out here, including some big games that you guys are excited about.

1876
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:43,220
Magna Carta 2 in August, End of Eternity, which is a new RPG from Tri-Ace, also Mass

1877
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,840
Effect is going to be making its way to Japan on May 21st, and I know that's a long time

1878
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,200
since our release of it, but they've translated it apparently for Japan.

1879
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:58,440
Also virtual on Mega Man 9 for Japan in June, Space Invaders Extreme, King of Fighters 2002,

1880
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,120
just lots and lots of new games coming out in Japan.

1881
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:08,240
They also added Pachinko to Mass Effect, which is pretty cool, because every game needs Pachinko.

1882
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,240
That's a complete lie.

1883
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,560
A little Pachinko mini-game.

1884
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,360
I thought that was the Wii that had that, Pachinko mini-games.

1885
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,360
Alright.

1886
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:20,240
Anyway, so there you go, 31 new games coming to Japan, and with that, 31 more Xboxes sold

1887
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,240
in Japan.

1888
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,240
That's it.

1889
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,240
31?

1890
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,240
Mm-hmm.

1891
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,240
In a row?

1892
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
31 flavors, and then some.

1893
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,240
Oooh.

1894
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,240
Alright.

1895
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,240
More news, please.

1896
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,760
How about GTA IV?

1897
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,760
How about it?

1898
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,040
It's, I mean, it's getting...

1899
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,880
It stinks!

1900
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,000
The peasants are revolting, yeah, they stink on ice.

1901
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Anyway.

1902
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
GTA IV is getting an Xbox 360 Elite bundle.

1903
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Get that off my foot.

1904
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Sorry.

1905
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's where it landed.

1906
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Pass on down.

1907
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
New cup!

1908
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Move down!

1909
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Anyway.

1910
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And no, we didn't go with the teacups, Rob.

1911
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,200
Did I mention Jamie's been drinking, too, so if this show gets really, really random,

1912
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,200
I apologize in advance.

1913
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,200
And it'll be just me.

1914
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
The alcohol's gonna be burned off in about five seconds.

1915
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,200
True.

1916
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
It is wine.

1917
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:18,040
Anyway, there is going to be, later this year, a Grand Theft Auto IV bundle that is going

1918
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:25,400
to be for $399, and we have no idea what it's gonna look like.

1919
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:30,160
It's basically just like how there's a new bundle that's been announced this week that's

1920
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,160
coming out.

1921
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,160
It's got a picture of the games on it.

1922
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,800
With, well, that's mocked up, but with Fallout, or not Fallout 3.

1923
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,240
Fallout 2 and Halo 3 that's gonna be coming out, they're gonna be doing this kind of every

1924
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,400
few weeks.

1925
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,620
This one, they're speculating, is gonna come out maybe around the time of the new expansion

1926
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:48,080
for Grand Theft Auto IV, sometime in the fall.

1927
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,480
That's actually what I was going to be saying.

1928
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,440
Well, you stopped talking, so I didn't know.

1929
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,440
My turn.

1930
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,440
Go.

1931
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,440
I'm done.

1932
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,440
All right.

1933
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,440
Let me finish!

1934
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,440
Let me finish!

1935
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,440
Are you finished?

1936
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,440
Yeah, I'm finished.

1937
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:07,200
All right, well, something else that's coming out, and this can't be good in any way, because

1938
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,240
it's Driver.

1939
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:17,580
Ubisoft has trademarked a new Driver game, and, you know, I'm just, I guess it can't

1940
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:25,880
get worse than, you know, it is already, but it's apparently Driver 5, they recruit, and

1941
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,680
assuming that it's coming to the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we are recruiting you to play

1942
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,680
our shit game.

1943
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,800
I hope it's not as bad as all the other Driver games, except for the first one.

1944
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,820
The first game was awesome, second one was okay, third just went down into the pooper,

1945
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,680
and then the rest just sucked from there on out.

1946
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,040
Oh well.

1947
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,680
But then again, I kind of want to play it, because I liked how crappy they were.

1948
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:58,360
All right, well, yeah, you liked how crappy the Driver games were, right?

1949
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:03,240
Yes, I actually thought about picking up Driver 3 again, just to play, because it's just that

1950
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,240
bad.

1951
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,240
How crappy it is.

1952
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,800
Yes, I have to remind myself.

1953
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,800
All right, sounds good.

1954
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,440
Lego Rock Band, we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago that it was rumored, but

1955
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:21,040
fuck, we all knew it was true, and it was finally officially announced, Lego Rock Band

1956
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,840
is happening.

1957
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,960
It's happening holiday of this year, as it was announced.

1958
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,440
Lego Rock Band is going to be coming out on the Playstation 3, the 360, the Wii and the

1959
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,120
DS, and there's screenshots to prove it, and yes, it's Lego people in a rock band.

1960
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,680
Mid-November.

1961
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,960
By the way, some of the songs that will be included in the game, Song 2 by Blur, Carl

1962
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,880
Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting, Europe with The Final Countdown, Good Charlotte with Boys

1963
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,800
and Girls, and Pink with So What.

1964
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,320
So these are kind of like, I guess they're saying more kid-friendly songs, although I

1965
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,320
don't know.

1966
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,320
Blur.

1967
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,680
Pink isn't the most kid-friendly artist in the world, she has some pretty nasty songs,

1968
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,680
you know what I mean?

1969
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Blur.

1970
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,680
You and Your Hand, hello, have you ever heard that song?

1971
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,680
Blur.

1972
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,760
I know you like Blur, but we don't know yet if you're going to be able to import these

1973
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,280
songs into the other games, probably not, if they're trying to keep a kid safe, they're

1974
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,620
probably going to keep the game segregated, don't you think?

1975
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:17,560
It's also being published by Warner Brothers, Warner Games, and not EA, so there's another

1976
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,280
problem with that too.

1977
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,480
I would hope that you'd be able to import them because I would like a little bit of

1978
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,880
Kung Fu Fighting or Final Countdown in Rock Band 2, but I don't know.

1979
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,960
It doesn't sound bad, if the song list is good, I'd pick it up.

1980
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,140
By the way, in this game as well, apparently you're going to be able to collect pieces

1981
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,840
in the regular mode where you build cooler vehicles and go to new venues by building

1982
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,100
the pieces.

1983
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:44,680
There's an extra easy setting for children, I'm assuming, and apparently there will now

1984
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,640
be challenges in this game, you'll be able to destroy a giant robot, summon a storm,

1985
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,760
and demolish a skyscraper, all with your drums and guitar and vocals.

1986
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,760
Awesome.

1987
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,120
It means you battle with the power of rocking out?

1988
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:03,000
Still no word, however, on whether or not it's going to be able, you're going to be

1989
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,120
able to do the whole exporting of the songs and all that.

1990
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,120
So there you go.

1991
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,120
That's it.

1992
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,720
I could save the world for the power of my walking out.

1993
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,720
Can you now?

1994
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,720
Yes.

1995
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,720
You want to see?

1996
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,720
No, that's okay.

1997
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:22,240
Actually, I can't show anyone because then they'll have to kill you all.

1998
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,260
This makes me happy.

1999
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:28,640
This makes my insides quiver with delight.

2000
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,640
What am I?

2001
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,640
Ew.

2002
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,440
I was talking about my liver.

2003
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,440
I was talking about my liver.

2004
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,720
I think I just burped.

2005
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,840
You made my liver quiver.

2006
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,840
Hey, Justin TV's complaining it's boring because there's no games going on.

2007
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
Play something.

2008
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,840
Is anyone going to play a video game?

2009
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,840
Damn it.

2010
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,840
Stop complaining.

2011
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,840
Jesus Christ.

2012
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,560
Play a goddamn game, Rice Princess.

2013
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,560
Play something easy.

2014
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
It'll keep them entertained.

2015
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,560
I can't.

2016
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,560
It's all hard.

2017
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,560
Irene.

2018
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,880
I can try to play a game, but I'm doing the show.

2019
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,360
I'm drunk too, so I don't know if...

2020
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,360
No, I'm not drunk.

2021
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,360
Dr. Mario.

2022
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,360
Little buzz.

2023
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,360
Just play.

2024
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,360
Rob's Wiener.

2025
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,480
Don't play Rob's Wiener.

2026
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,480
Don't do that.

2027
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,480
Hug what?

2028
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,480
In lap?

2029
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,480
Phone?

2030
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,480
What?

2031
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,480
Oh my word.

2032
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,480
We're translating.

2033
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,480
Okay.

2034
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,960
Xbox Live Arcade.

2035
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,760
Well, SNK people are doing drugs and they're doing happy drugs that make me happy and want

2036
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,760
to do drugs...

2037
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:21,760
Wait.

2038
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,760
Wrong way.

2039
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,760
Anyway.

2040
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:30,400
A game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, which is called King of Fighters Sky Stage.

2041
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,400
Aw.

2042
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,200
What are you doing to me?

2043
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,200
Stop it.

2044
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,200
He's doing a shoulder.

2045
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,060
I'm being raped during the show, I want to point out.

2046
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,060
Shoulder rape.

2047
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,720
I was just raped live on air.

2048
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,920
Because you took your pants off.

2049
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,120
I did not take my pants off.

2050
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,120
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2051
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,600
How many of us are not wearing socks and shoes?

2052
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,480
Myself, you and Loki.

2053
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,160
Mississippi or G.

2054
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,160
Shut up and read your story.

2055
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,120
Anyway.

2056
01:32:56,120 --> 01:33:00,520
The game is coming out called King of Fighters Sky Stage, which is your King of Fighters

2057
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:07,440
characters flying around and shooting stuff out of their hands.

2058
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,680
They're bullets.

2059
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,160
They're shooting people.

2060
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,940
This article is actually really freaking wrong because this has been done before in a game

2061
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:20,360
called Psychic Storm that I actually have on Turbo Duo.

2062
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:25,960
But yeah, you're flying around and you're shooting shit with the power of your psychoticness.

2063
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,040
Or if you're Kyo, then it's fire.

2064
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,120
Are we going to see Mai's tits or not?

2065
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,120
That's the big question we want to know about this game.

2066
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:37,920
The only characters that I'm seeing in the screenshots here are Kyo and Athena.

2067
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:45,720
And Athena's shooting, it looks like eggs out of her head, like pink and white eggs.

2068
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,520
Wow.

2069
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,440
She's shooting dots, Dippin' Dots at people.

2070
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:53,800
Kyo is shooting fire.

2071
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:57,280
And as we all know, fire makes everything better.

2072
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,920
What are you playing, Rygar?

2073
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,680
Out of all the games she could play, she's playing Rygar?

2074
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,680
Really?

2075
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,680
Really?

2076
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,040
Dan was playing Rygar the other day on MAME.

2077
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,520
Yeah, that was the cool Rygar was the arcade one.

2078
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
This one's the...

2079
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
The tickle monster...

2080
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,880
Yeah, you need to be playing Karnov.

2081
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,880
No, I'm just kidding.

2082
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:16,880
I actually really like Rygar.

2083
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,880
I'm just kidding.

2084
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,400
Hey, just stop tickling me on air!

2085
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,400
It's not funny!

2086
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,400
Leave me alone.

2087
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,400
Rob.

2088
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Alright, what?

2089
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,400
Rob.

2090
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,400
What?

2091
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,400
Rob.

2092
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,400
Rob.

2093
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,400
What?

2094
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,400
Rob.

2095
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,400
Stop it.

2096
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,400
Bob.

2097
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,400
Bob.

2098
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,400
What?

2099
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,040
Do you know what a crappy show this is tonight?

2100
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,040
Because you holler not to get on top of it.

2101
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,040
This is an awesome show!

2102
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,040
This is a poopy show.

2103
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,280
It's only poopy if you take off your pants.

2104
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,960
I swear to God, one more time and the pants are coming off.

2105
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,520
Irene is not shitting her pants.

2106
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,520
Rob.

2107
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,520
Rob.

2108
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,520
Rob.

2109
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,520
Rob.

2110
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,520
Rob.

2111
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,520
Rob.

2112
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Rob.

2113
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,520
Rob.

2114
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,520
Rob.

2115
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,520
Rob.

2116
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,520
Rob.

2117
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,520
Rob.

2118
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,520
Rob.

2119
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,520
Rob.

2120
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,520
Rob.

2121
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,520
Rob.

2122
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,520
Well, that's my sort of stupid story.

2123
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,520
Do you have one?

2124
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,520
I know.

2125
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,520
Loki, please save the show.

2126
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,520
Yes.

2127
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,960
Muramasa Demon Blade lost its publisher earlier this week.

2128
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,440
Which is not good.

2129
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,760
But at least it picked up a new one.

2130
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,700
And that new publisher would be Ignition Entertainment.

2131
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:27,840
However, because the publisher changed, the game will now be coming out in September instead

2132
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,840
of June.

2133
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,180
But hey, at least it's still coming out.

2134
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,280
And it's actually kind of fun.

2135
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,280
I wish I knew what was going on. So English might help with that.

2136
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,280
English is useful. It is useful.

2137
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,280
Is this the same game you had here a couple weeks ago?

2138
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,280
Yes. And I thought it was like coming out like next week

2139
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,280
or something. It already had to get pushed back because of that? No, it wasn't coming out like next week

2140
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,280
it was coming out in June originally.

2141
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:01,280
But yeah. So it came out in Japan already.

2142
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,280
Alright. A game that has not come out yet is Street Fighter 4.

2143
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,280
On the PC, not the consoles obviously, but

2144
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,280
Street Fighter 4 has not made its way to the PC just yet. Apparently there is a PC version

2145
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,280
in the works. You've probably heard about it before. Apparently the game is actually

2146
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,280
going to be bundled with fighting sticks. Maybe. They haven't said one way or the other if it will

2147
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,280
for sure or not yet. However, it has been announced on the official Japanese

2148
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:29,280
Street Fighter 4 blog that they will be announcing the PC version's release

2149
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:33,280
date on May 1st. So yes, I am reporting

2150
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,280
an announcement of an announcement of a game that's already out.

2151
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,280
I mean really. Really. I'm blinking audibly

2152
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,280
but the mic can't be picked up.

2153
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,280
Is it really worth this much hype for the PC version of the game?

2154
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,280
Don't get me wrong. I understand there are some PC gamers. Street Fighter 4 is a great game.

2155
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:57,280
There is an audience of people very happy about this. But really, we need a release date

2156
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,280
for a release date. Come on. Get off your high horse

2157
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,280
Capcom. Just tell us the date. Just tell us the date.

2158
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,280
Stop making people wait.

2159
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,280
Articles like this make me angry and when I get angry, naughty music plays

2160
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,280
and it brings on a segment called The Effies of the Week.

2161
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:31,280
Music plays

2162
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,280
I do want to point out Leo Shannon in the chat makes a good point. If Street Fighter 4 is out

2163
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,280
on the PC, nude mods. That might be worth it. Alright, DarkSakura

2164
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:43,280
your Effies of the Week.

2165
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,280
I'm attracted to being way too much from Disney. I have way too much shit to do.

2166
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,280
Fair enough. Way too much shit to do. All before Friday.

2167
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,280
Uh, Loki. I'm Fe2, the squirrel

2168
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,280
that is bothering my cat because the squirrel has figured out

2169
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,280
that we have bird seed on the porch and so I decided to try

2170
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,280
to dig out all the sunflower seeds that are in there and my cat

2171
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,280
can't get to it so it frustrates the hell out of her.

2172
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,280
I put more bird seed on the porch. But it's still funny.

2173
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:19,280
But yeah, since she can't give an F.U. because she's a cat

2174
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,280
F.U. bird seed. Meow meow meow meow meow meow. Exactly. Meow meow

2175
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,280
Meow. Uh, my F.U. of the week goes to

2176
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,280
this program. Belly Belly, what's your

2177
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,280
F.U. of the week? My F.U. of the week goes to going to a celebration

2178
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,280
party, getting really stupid and doing something really stupid.

2179
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,280
That's never fun when we wake up in the morning and go, that was

2180
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,280
stupid. Uh, Rice Princess

2181
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,280
the doctor, do you have any F.U.s? Come over here and say them on the mic.

2182
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,280
F.U. Rob for not being pantless.

2183
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:59,280
Uh, yes Rice Princess. F.U.

2184
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,280
is shitting in your pants. That can be

2185
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,280
a day ruiner right there. Alright. Good lord.

2186
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:11,280
Let's try to change the tune of the show a little bit

2187
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,280
by going on into a classier segment, I hope. Because it's the part

2188
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:19,280
where we let the listeners take over for a little bit and direct the show with their emails.

2189
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,280
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

2190
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,280
Dark Soccer is going to open up the mailbag and jump on in and

2191
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,280
hear from you guys, the listeners. Then I'll need a ton

2192
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,280
of sanitizer. Oh my god. Anyway, first email.

2193
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,280
This comes from Rini.

2194
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,280
This is to chime in briefly on the recent feature they should have put

2195
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,280
on the DSI that would have made Rob buy a DSI. Loki commented

2196
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:51,280
that the music player sucks because it only supports AAC. In reality

2197
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:55,280
AAC is superior to MP3. AAC's main strength is that it

2198
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,280
can achieve the same quality of sound that MP3 would have at higher bit rates and

2199
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:03,280
smaller file sizes. The whole albums in MP3 will decrease in megabytes when

2200
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:07,280
they're converted to AAC. If there's something to bitch about

2201
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:11,280
DSI sound, it's that it really

2202
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,280
accepts M4A, MP4, and 3GP files

2203
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:19,280
because they're the container for the AAC audio. For what it does

2204
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,280
the DSI music player is actually competent feature-wise for a basic music player.

2205
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,280
There's no real playlist function, but who uses those on a portable

2206
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,280
device? I have an iPhone. Just to

2207
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,280
put this out there and not really make a big deal out of it, for anyone undecided on purchasing

2208
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,280
a DSI, take it from someone who owns one. You're buying into potential.

2209
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,280
I'm sure there's tons of things that Nintendo can do and I'm hoping they'll

2210
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:47,280
go through with some of the nearly 40 trademarks that were discovered

2211
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:51,280
shortly after the Japanese unveiling. I'll link that later.

2212
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,280
But if you need a GBA slot

2213
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,280
and don't want the fancy crap, get a light. The camera is shit. The browser is a

2214
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:03,280
last resort, but the DSI shop sounds great and

2215
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,280
I want to see what developers can do with the upgraded processor, larger memory,

2216
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:11,280
and the camera for gamers.

2217
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,280
There's also more. There's a PS.

2218
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:19,280
I apologize. I'm still not sold. I mean, we need to see more.

2219
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:23,280
PS. Warriorware snapped is an insult both as a game and to the series.

2220
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,280
Don't spend 500 points free or bought on a game. You'll only play once.

2221
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,280
I didn't. PPS. Skye, when the next class

2222
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:35,280
update for Team Fortress 2 comes out, you're getting my invite for a free weekend.

2223
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:39,280
Team Fortress 2 has classes attuned to your play style, can't aim for shit,

2224
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:43,280
or maybe you've bought the orange box for $10 from Steam's weekend sale. And it's today.

2225
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,280
I wish I had. No, I already have Portal. That was the game I wanted most in there.

2226
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,280
I suck at Team Fortress.

2227
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:55,280
That's why you get the special classes. We'll see.

2228
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:59,280
I'm just really horrible at first-person shooters. Words do not do my

2229
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,280
suckage justice, if that makes sense.

2230
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,280
Unless you don't want to throw up every time you play one. That would be me.

2231
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,280
Or even watch someone play one shoot. More email.

2232
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,280
Hi, LLR! Hi, happy listener.

2233
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:19,280
I just thought I'd mention a few things. First off, there was a glaring error in the email

2234
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,280
I sent you last week, specifically in regards to some of the Capcom games

2235
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:27,280
with PSN. I had mistakenly said SNK vs. Capcom 2

2236
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,280
instead of Marvel vs. Capcom. To my credit,

2237
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,280
once I did catch the error, I left you a voice message, but I guess the message was overlooked accidentally.

2238
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:39,280
I don't do the voicemail, so whatever.

2239
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,280
I just want to correct that bit of news

2240
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,280
for a fellow listener's sake more than anything else.

2241
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:51,280
By the way, if you three haven't already, try picking up Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection.

2242
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:55,280
Yes, I have it. I picked it up a few weeks ago, partially due to Bobby Blackwell's recommendation.

2243
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:59,280
In a nutshell, it's 40 games for 30 bucks. You really can't get much better than that

2244
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:03,280
unless Sega pays us to take their games. Sarcasm.

2245
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:07,280
If I had to recommend one version

2246
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,280
over another, I'd have to pick the PS3 version, although fundamentally the same.

2247
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,280
The 360 already has many of the games within the collection on the Xbox Live Arcade.

2248
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,280
Nods are most of us have at least some of them.

2249
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:23,280
How about multiple copies of each?

2250
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,280
Really, there's no sense in getting two copies of the game for the same system.

2251
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:31,280
Yeah, there is. As with the PS3 version, this marks the first time

2252
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:35,280
some of these games make an appearance, plus they have trophy support.

2253
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:39,280
Let's face it, Sony really needs to ramp up trophy support.

2254
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,280
I'm sorry, typos are...

2255
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:47,280
Only downside to either version is that neither would have online co-op.

2256
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:51,280
It's not a deal breaker by any means, but it would have been a nice feature nonetheless.

2257
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,280
Sorry this email ran so long, I'll try to keep future ones a tad shorter.

2258
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,280
This email was brought to you by your local 7-11, home of the Street Date Broken Games,

2259
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,280
20 year old hot dogs, Slurpees, back galley crack dealers, and hookers.

2260
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,280
Who is this from? It's from Spazinator. Hi, Spazinator.

2261
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,280
Dude, I don't want a hooker. 7-11 is pretty awesome, actually.

2262
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:15,280
Just so I can smack one. Slurpees are amazing. Just so I can smack a bitch.

2263
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,280
Anyway, last email. This is from

2264
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:23,280
Jacob.

2265
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:27,280
Hey, OLR. I have not been in chat or called in before, but I have been

2266
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,280
a regular podcast listener for a couple of years now. The show gives me some laughs

2267
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,280
and a decent update on the gaming world. I wish I could game more like I used to,

2268
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,280
but life demands a great deal of time. Oh fuck, yes it does. Preach. Truth.

2269
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,280
But I do try to keep up with some games that interest me.

2270
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:47,280
Mirror's Edge was a great concept, but way too short. I'm sick and tired of

2271
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,280
shooters and have been playing Street Fighter IV. Dead Space was

2272
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,280
made precisely for me, and

2273
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:59,280
I fell in love with it instantly. Do you guys think EA will let the

2274
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:03,280
team give it a sequel? I really like Gears and constantly wonder why the

2275
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:07,280
OLR team bashes it. I don't think I've bashed it. I just don't care about it.

2276
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:11,280
I would say I bashed it. I respect the game, but I am terrible

2277
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:15,280
at first person shooters, so that's why you don't hear me talk about it much. I think

2278
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,280
I might have said something on a previous show where I just didn't get that into it, and I think the reason

2279
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,280
why is just, you know, I was not a big fan of the whole cover, because

2280
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,280
I'm only decent at first person shooters like Quake Live or Quake 3, where

2281
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,280
I can just run out there like a crazy motherfucker and just blow away everybody.

2282
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:35,280
But Gears of War is all about the stealth and hiding and cover, and I get that

2283
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:39,280
if you're a shooting game fan. I get why that's alluring. I get the strategy

2284
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:43,280
involved in that. I get where the game is there. It's just not for me, because I suck

2285
01:45:43,280 --> 01:46:11,280
at first person shooters really bad.

2286
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,280
Thank you, Jacob.

2287
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:21,280
I'm gonna make the same recommendation I do to a lot of people at 360.

2288
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,280
Rez. Rez. Rez, especially if you're like a, you know,

2289
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,280
kind of like a motion game that's always moving. I think Rez is, like, you know, you want

2290
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,280
an outside the box type of game, I think Rez is a good start. If you don't already have it.

2291
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:37,280
There's also plenty to download. Like, I mean, if you want to go old school, you do have Castlevania

2292
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:41,280
Symphony of the Night, and you've also got,

2293
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,280
I haven't played it, but I know a lot of people recommend Braid.

2294
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,280
I like Braid a lot. I definitely recommend Braid. But, you know, that's kind of, like, if he hasn't already got that,

2295
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,280
if he's been listening to this show any amount of time or following the game blogs, as he probably does,

2296
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:57,280
I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have that. Well, just to follow up, did you actually read the list

2297
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:01,280
of, to the earlier email, did you read the list of

2298
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,280
DSI

2299
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:09,280
patents? Not the full list, no. Oh, lord.

2300
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,280
There's quite a number of these. There's actually a trademark for 3D Picross.

2301
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,280
You already have that.

2302
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,280
That's already out. Is it? DS Navi, DS Phone, DS Plus,

2303
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:25,280
DS Point, DS School, DS Speak, DS Shop, DS Shopping, DS Trainer,

2304
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,280
DS Time, DS Walk. That doesn't mean they're making all these things. I know, but I just think it's funny.

2305
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,280
Protecting their rights, you know what I mean? I think it's funny.

2306
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,280
Just what they, it's gotta be that they have some ideas for it.

2307
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,280
One of them is DSI Sushine, which is DSI communication.

2308
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:45,280
So, I think it'd be cool.

2309
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,280
Alright, well if you want to send us a mail, email, sorry, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send

2310
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,280
us our mail. Mailbag, Orangelaunchradio.com. I hope we hear from you next week.

2311
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,280
But please stop sending spam. Christ, we have to clean up so much

2312
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,280
spam out of that box. In my personal box. I have so much spam.

2313
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:05,280
Spam needs to die in a fire. I love Shadowgate, by the way, which is the game that's

2314
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,280
I don't even know if Justin.TV's working anymore. I kind of suck at Shadowgate.

2315
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,280
This is the game that Eddie's playing right now. Good times. Do you have to go in the door and everything's on fire?

2316
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,280
Alright. Well,

2317
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,280
there's some interesting, we knew this was coming, but

2318
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:25,280
it's getting more official day by day. The court has approved the Square Enix

2319
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,280
bio of Eidos. So, assume we'll have

2320
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,280
Square, Square Enix, or

2321
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:37,280
I don't know how to, too many companies to combine together.

2322
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,280
Squito, Squinodos.

2323
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,280
Squitodox, there we go.

2324
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,280
But anyway, so that's actually supposed to be happening pretty soon here.

2325
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,280
That's neat, I guess.

2326
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:57,280
Maybe we'll see some better games come out from them.

2327
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,280
Maybe Tomb Raider. What has Eidos done for us lately? I

2328
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:05,280
say, fuck them. Tomb Raider.

2329
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:09,280
What has Eidos done for us lately? I say, fuck them.

2330
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:13,280
We need a new cute name for them, though. Squinixdos.

2331
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:17,280
Squinodos. Squinodos.

2332
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,280
Okay. Well, they also own Taito, so. Squinodos Taito.

2333
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,280
I don't, this is getting too... Taito!

2334
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:29,280
Squitox. Just call it Square. Square Idots. Square and Friends.

2335
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,280
I like that. Square and Friends. I like that.

2336
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,280
This Square is a lie. Well, alright, I don't know if, you might have to think of a name for this merger,

2337
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,280
but apparently, Warner Brothers Interactive is contemplating

2338
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:45,280
a purchase of Midway, which as you know, has just been hemorrhaging money

2339
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,280
and they're in the news every week about how just, you know, in crappy shape the company is

2340
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,280
in. We'll call that a clusterfuck. Those poor guys. Warner, by the way, lost

2341
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:57,280
the Eidos bid to Squinix, so Warner apparently is

2342
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:01,280
now looking at possibly picking up Midway. It's an anonymous source, it's tipping

2343
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:05,280
that's leaked to all these blogs. Warner is pretty confident that they will get Midway.

2344
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,280
They are ready to put the money on the table. Possibly the whole

2345
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:13,280
30 million bucks to pick up Mortal Kombat and stuff,

2346
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,280
I guess. I don't know what else Midway's got, besides

2347
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,280
their pretty cool collections and things.

2348
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:25,280
That's what they get. They could be making, you know,

2349
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,280
instead of, well, not pinball tables because Williams abandoned us, the bastards,

2350
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:33,280
but they could be making, you know, tons of slot machines, but no.

2351
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:37,280
What if that means we'll have a

2352
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,280
Mortal Kombat vs. DC 2? Ooh. Because doesn't Warner

2353
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:45,280
and DC kind of have a thingy? Yeah, Warner Brothers. There you go.

2354
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,280
We'll see. Moving on, a little more news, then we're going to get to the

2355
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,280
Skype line in just a little bit. Well, how about

2356
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:57,280
something that should make everyone happy?

2357
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,280
PAX details! And everyone said yay!

2358
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,280
Yay, I hope I can afford it this year. September 4th,

2359
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,280
in Seattle, we will be having PAX, and they are going

2360
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,280
to have over 60 exhibitors. That means, again, Microsoft,

2361
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:17,280
Nintendo, Valve, Blizzard. Sony isn't on the list,

2362
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,280
and who cares? They weren't there last year. Oh no, they were there last year.

2363
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:25,280
That's right, that was the first time we played LittleBigPlanet. That's interesting, they're not on the list

2364
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,280
yet. Also, they're going to

2365
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,280
have Freezepop, Jonathan Colton, yay!

2366
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:37,280
Would you have to do another MySpace photo? So we're all the same shit as last year?

2367
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,280
Well, some different people. There's MC Frontalot, of course.

2368
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,280
Anamanaguchi, who was there last year, Metroid Metal, and

2369
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:49,280
Paul and Storm. So not everyone there is listed, but...

2370
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:53,280
Like, four of those bands were all there last year, which is fine. They're all great.

2371
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:57,280
Don't get me wrong, it's all great bands. This time, I'm going to go see Jonathan Colton, and none of you can

2372
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,280
stop me. Alright, you go on with your bad self.

2373
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:05,280
Because he's awesome!

2374
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,280
He has cool hair. I hope we can afford to go to PAX, we'll see though. E3 is coming up

2375
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:13,280
though. By the way, OLR will be at E3. At least myself

2376
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,280
and Loki, DarkSakuras, and maybe at this point, but we're all confirmed. I'm broke, so if someone was to pay, then I'll go.

2377
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,280
Well, good luck. We're all broke.

2378
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,280
But E3... I already got my confirmation and my tickets

2379
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:29,280
and my stuff, all booked. You got your ticket? Oh, like flight tickets?

2380
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:33,280
I have my flight, I've got my Disneyland, shit, I'm ready to go.

2381
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,280
You're good to go. Ready to rock.

2382
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:41,280
So, let's see. There's some interesting stuff going down with

2383
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:45,280
Gamefly. Apparently, they are filing suit

2384
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:49,280
against the United States Postal Service over breakage rates

2385
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:53,280
and preferential treatment. Their complaint is that

2386
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:57,280
basically the USPS has adapted a new practice

2387
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,280
of manually pulling out the DVD mailers of both

2388
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:05,280
Netflix and Blockbuster online for special processing.

2389
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:09,280
However, Gamefly has tried to get the same kind of treatment, but it has been denied.

2390
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:13,280
And also, they've noticed that there's

2391
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:17,280
quite a bit of in-transit breakage and also theft.

2392
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,280
And they're not too happy about that. And they've actually tried to take some

2393
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:25,280
measures to fix that. I wonder if the Postal Service is hiring.

2394
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:29,280
Change the color of their mailers and stuff like that, but

2395
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:33,280
it's still a problem. What color are their

2396
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,280
mailers? Are they bright neon green and orange? They used to be orange, and now they're white.

2397
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,280
No wonder they stick out, you know? Well, they're probably trying to save money

2398
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:45,280
on the ink. I'm surprised Netflix doesn't have the same problems with those

2399
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:49,280
very distinctive red envelopes. I'm sure they do, but games are more valuable than

2400
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,280
movies. Would you steal games if you worked for the Postal Service?

2401
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,280
If I wanted to be fired and arrested, yeah.

2402
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:01,280
Just curious. I didn't know you should. No, I probably wouldn't, because

2403
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:05,280
you know, it's too easy to find them online.

2404
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,280
Alright, hey, we've talked a little bit about DJ Games coming out later this year.

2405
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:13,280
Of course, with the whole dispute going on with Scratch and DJ Hero. There's a

2406
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,280
DS game, actually, that's going to be incorporating DJing that's come out.

2407
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,280
It's coming from a French developer called Game Life. They have just announced a game this week called

2408
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:25,280
DJ Star, and it's coming out this year for the Nintendo DS.

2409
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:29,280
It's going to be published by Deep Silver in Europe and Australia, and in this game you're going to start

2410
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:33,280
as a DJ, and you gain experience, and you start as a lowly club DJ, and

2411
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:37,280
finally you go stadiums with tons and tons of people. You are going to mix

2412
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,280
over 40 famous tracks in different genres, and you can actually save

2413
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,280
your creations on the DS card, and you can trade your creations with

2414
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,280
your friends on wireless communications. It's also coming out over here also

2415
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:53,280
by Deep Silver in July. It was supposed to be coming out in two weeks,

2416
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:57,280
which sucks, but, you know, now, later on.

2417
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,280
Interesting. I'd be curious to check this out. I want to hear more about it

2418
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:05,280
and what the game is in it, because I didn't hear a lot about what the game is. It's just that you can

2419
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:09,280
mix stuff. Well, what's the game? That's what I kind of want to know right now.

2420
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:13,280
It's hard to tell. We'll see.

2421
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,280
Anyway, a few more stories, then we're going to get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

2422
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:21,280
our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. XLink would like to point out

2423
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:25,280
that the penalty for stealing mail is up to five years in jail and a $250,000

2424
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:29,280
fine. I didn't say you should steal mail. I was just curious if, you know,

2425
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:33,280
people apparently are getting away with it. So, yep.

2426
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:37,280
Let's move on. DarkSakura. Um, do you want a gun?

2427
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,280
Not really, because I'm one of those people that I'm afraid if I had a gun in my house, I'd shoot myself with it

2428
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:45,280
somehow. Like, I'm seriously deathly afraid that if a gun is in my house

2429
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:49,280
I will be killed with it. That's why you need to take gun safety courses. No, but I don't,

2430
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:53,280
that doesn't necessarily mean I will be the one killing myself with the gun. I would like to think I'm not

2431
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,280
that stupid, where I'm like, oh, gee, I need to get out my gun and dust it.

2432
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:01,280
La la la, dust the gun. Ooh, fuck, I just shot myself in the face. Dust it with live ammo in it.

2433
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:05,280
That's kinda retarded. I just feel like I'm, I'm, I'm the stupid

2434
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:09,280
person that would do that. Or that I'm also paranoid if I had a gun in my house and somebody would break into my house

2435
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,280
know where my gun is and shoot me with it. Like, I'm just, I know it's my, probably an irrational fear

2436
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:17,280
I have a fear of a gun in my house. I was actually just trying to say that as a lead into the story.

2437
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,280
Sorry, I'm buzzed.

2438
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:25,280
Anyway, um, a, uh, a middle school kid

2439
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,280
brought in a gun and caused, um, the

2440
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:33,280
school to be locked down, but you know what he brought it for? He brought it to trade

2441
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:37,280
for PSP. Sure, trade for PSP, rob for

2442
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:41,280
PSP, it's all the same. He swiped it out of his, um, dad's collection, the gun

2443
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,280
was unloaded, but he did bring ammo with him, and he was gonna trade it.

2444
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:49,280
Um, so, also his dad said a second gun was missing

2445
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:53,280
and the kid's locked up in juvie right now, so, stupid child.

2446
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:57,280
Um, how did he get the gun? Stupid father. I was gonna say,

2447
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:01,280
is it just, I mean, the parent's slightly depraved in your shoes. You leave this shit locked up!

2448
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:05,280
First, okay, first of all, if you're going to have

2449
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:09,280
a gun in your house, if you're going to have multiple guns, that's why you have a gun locker.

2450
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:13,280
That's why you make sure they are always unloaded,

2451
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:17,280
clean, with the safety on, and locked up in your damn gun locker, and if you

2452
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,280
keep a loaded gun by your desk, you make sure the safety's on. And I just wanna say,

2453
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,280
even though I have my rant that I will not have a gun in my house, that doesn't mean

2454
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:29,280
that somebody else can't have a gun in their house. There is a, like, this thing called the

2455
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,280
Tonsitution that allows you to have a gun in your house if you want.

2456
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:37,280
The Tonsitution? The Tonsitution, is that what I call it? Shut up!

2457
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:41,280
Look, my point is, you can have a gun in your house if you want,

2458
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:45,280
I choose to not have one in mine, and I'm allowed that choice.

2459
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,280
By the Tonsitution. I, by the way, do still think

2460
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:53,280
that Penn and Teller said it best, that you take every woman in America

2461
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:57,280
and give them each a pink gun, and it's pink because they said so,

2462
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:01,280
and then it doesn't matter if they keep it, give it away, whatever, no one's gonna know

2463
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:05,280
who has the gun, and it'll make a safer society.

2464
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:09,280
Make guns that match handbags, yeah,

2465
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:13,280
perfect. Actually, I wanna have a gun. I really want a gun, but I would,

2466
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,280
but because you can't have a concealed weapon, I would wear it on a holster.

2467
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:21,280
Just everywhere you go, don't bring it here.

2468
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:25,280
I'd leave it in my car. Oh yeah, you can leave it in the car, there's no money in my house.

2469
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,280
Because I would be afraid, I would be shot with it. Like during a break or something, like you'd trip and fall and the gun would go off

2470
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:33,280
and shoot me in the foot, like I just, I have these horrible, hey Rob,

2471
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:37,280
look at me juggle these guns! Exactly!

2472
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,280
Like, Loki would be like, can I touch your gun, Dark Sakura?

2473
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:45,280
Bang! Shoot me in the face. Let me throw the gun at Rob, and hopefully it'll go off

2474
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,280
and shoot him. First of all, if I had a gun, I would not

2475
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:53,280
just... Ooh, look at my gun! Ooh!

2476
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:57,280
Look at this, it's loaded and everything, I'm gonna look down the barrel, rah!

2477
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,280
Why don't you put it in your mouth? My gun would be pink, my gun would be black and

2478
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:05,280
hot rod red. Ho ho, I'm Kurt Cobain.

2479
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:09,280
Like, I think I should, like, you know how some people are afraid of water, some people

2480
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:13,280
are afraid of heights? People are seriously

2481
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:17,280
afraid of water! People with green skin named Alfalo. We all have a friend that's

2482
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:21,280
afraid of water, like, swimming type water, and that type of stuff.

2483
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:25,280
No, but I mean, like, being surrounded by water, not drinking water,

2484
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:29,280
bodies of water, oh god, you guys are jerks. Alright, no, I'm talking about, I think I

2485
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,280
seriously have a fear of guns, being pointed at me.

2486
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:37,280
That's probably a rational fear, but it's actually

2487
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:41,280
a rational fear. No, I think it's irrational, I think

2488
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:45,280
that it's paranoid. It is! First of all, I'll tell you this right now, Rob, if you've

2489
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:49,280
got someone who has a gun, who is, who

2490
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:53,280
knows how to use it, and knows how to take care of it, you are not in any

2491
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:57,280
danger. I don't even want a chocolate gun, like that's...

2492
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:01,280
God, you're a baby!

2493
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:05,280
You're just now learning this? No, but I like saying it.

2494
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:09,280
I'll bring a chocolate gun into your house and it'll shoot you.

2495
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:13,280
It'll shoot you with yummy! You'll get shot with tastiness.

2496
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:17,280
I don't even like water guns.

2497
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,280
I'm not joking, I don't even like water guns. Rob, you would have, you would have hated

2498
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,280
you would have hated my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil.

2499
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,280
I had the Resident Evil one and I carried around two very

2500
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:33,280
realistic looking uzis. SH2100Matt says, so wait,

2501
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,280
was Rob freaked out when Loki brought his airsofts to the studio? Um...

2502
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,280
Ah! Ah! Kinda, actually, like, when he

2503
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,280
raises them up, I do get a little nervous. Yes, I don't want to get shot in the ass.

2504
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:49,280
Why do you think I don't go out to play? It doesn't hurt that bad!

2505
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:53,280
I don't like, why do you think I haven't gone out to play? I'm just gonna come in and shoot

2506
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:57,280
him one of these days so he can see, he can see how not bad it is. Why would you do that?

2507
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:01,280
That's it. Don't shoot Rob!

2508
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:05,280
Remember kids, don't shoot Rob. Rob is food. Shoot me in a

2509
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:09,280
video game all you want, because I know the difference. That's it, that's it. Next week, Nerf battle.

2510
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:13,280
This is not Nerf battle. This is not Nerf battle. Get Rob

2511
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,280
over the gun thing by shooting him with everything you can find.

2512
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:21,280
That is just gonna make it worse. For the

2513
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,280
record. Okay, no,

2514
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:29,280
I say I'll bring a Nerf gatling gun and shoot Rob

2515
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,280
in the ass. They have those. I know, I saw it, I wanted one.

2516
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,280
I have a Nerf revolver.

2517
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:41,280
Okay, I have to ask, I'm sorry, chat room, I haven't read from chat in a while and of course they're all

2518
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:45,280
teasing me right now, but what I want to know, am I,

2519
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:49,280
somebody in chat has to understand what I'm saying about guns.

2520
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:53,280
Like is somebody in chat willing to admit that they have a gun fear as well?

2521
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:57,280
Please, somebody. Just make it up so I don't feel so bad.

2522
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:01,280
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what my thing about the gun safety

2523
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:05,280
hysteria is, is that I think that the gun safety

2524
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:09,280
hysteria is bullshit, plain out bullshit.

2525
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:13,280
I think that

2526
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,280
people, if you were in an area where

2527
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:21,280
it is listed in big labels that no one there is gonna be able

2528
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:25,280
to protect themselves, we know what that says to a criminal mind,

2529
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:29,280
fair fucking game. If you were in a place where you

2530
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,280
know that anyone could be armed, are you gonna really try something

2531
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:37,280
unless you're phenomenally stupid? That's what I have to,

2532
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,280
people are phenomenally stupid, and if someone breaks into my house

2533
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:45,280
they deserve to get their ass shot. End of story.

2534
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,280
Maybe it's not guns I have a problem with, because like Cuzar is a lot of fun.

2535
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:53,280
It's projectiles I have a problem with, I don't like projectiles.

2536
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,280
I would not like that either, no. What if I had rocks?

2537
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:03,280
Can I read some comments from chat?

2538
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,280
Xlink says I have a gun fear, that is why I have a gun.

2539
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:11,280
Digital says everyone fears guns, sir.

2540
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:15,280
Brad says I don't owe one because I'm too damn hot headed.

2541
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:19,280
I like old people says yes Rob you are a pussy, well meow meow meow.

2542
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:23,280
Decipher says I hate guns.

2543
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:27,280
Reisman says you gotta say this over here, because we can't hear you otherwise.

2544
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:31,280
Someone's afraid of guns

2545
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:35,280
so he has a gun? If you're afraid of being shot with one you shoot

2546
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:39,280
before you get shot. That could be it, I could see that. I mean, but I'll tell you what

2547
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:43,280
the whole rationale, and see honestly, if you don't feel comfortable

2548
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,280
with a gun, don't have one. You live in America, that's your fucking right.

2549
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:51,280
Shake your hand ma'am, I'm with you on that, yes.

2550
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:55,280
At the same time, if you feel that you either want a gun

2551
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:59,280
or feel like you need to protect yourself, say that you live in a dangerous neighborhood,

2552
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:03,280
but say you've been living there for, like those older people who live in what was once a nice neighborhood

2553
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:07,280
that's gone downhill, who want to have some means of protecting

2554
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:11,280
themselves, then you can protect yourself.

2555
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:15,280
For example, I know a lot of women who carry a gun

2556
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:19,280
because, I mean let's face it, on a general level

2557
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:23,280
physically, men for the most part are stronger

2558
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:27,280
physically again than a woman, unless she's a

2559
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:31,280
black belt and can kick him in the face. But still, you have to deal

2560
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,280
with, it's the great equalizer.

2561
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:39,280
I think that as long as

2562
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:43,280
you, as long as you feel

2563
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:47,280
that you want to

2564
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:51,280
have a gun, you know, and of course live in America,

2565
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:55,280
get a gun, but make damn sure you know how to use it, make damn

2566
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:59,280
sure you know how to keep it safe, and make really sure that your kids can't

2567
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:03,280
get to it. I'm going to get a phaser. Dude, phasers are awesome.

2568
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,280
Always set on stun, and a light saber, but that

2569
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:11,280
wait, that can kill people, no just a phaser. And by the way,

2570
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:15,280
act deft, that's the second amendment, well first amendment is, yeah

2571
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:19,280
you have a voice to use it, second amendment is, god damn it, we can have guns if we fucking want them.

2572
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:23,280
S.S.A. I want to hear Matt ask, what about a marshmallow gun?

2573
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:27,280
Act deft says the OLR constitution second amendment

2574
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:31,280
don't shoot wrong. Yeah don't, I like that, that should actually be rule number

2575
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:35,280
one. Here's the thing, even the marshmallow gun, like it depends on what

2576
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,280
speed the marshmallows are traveling at, like if it's very slow speed, I'm okay with that because

2577
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,280
they're going to open my mouth, but if they're flying really fast, it could actually like, you know,

2578
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:47,280
kind of spank my butt a little bit if they hit me in the ass, I don't think I'd

2579
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:51,280
like that. You can spank my butt all you want, just

2580
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:55,280
don't do it with a fucking gun. Rob

2581
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:59,280
does not want to get pistol whipped in the ass. Okay, okay,

2582
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:03,280
we really are though. What happened to video games? I don't know, we were talking about

2583
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:07,280
we were talking about why the, I think it was because it was talking

2584
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:11,280
about why the butt head dad didn't have his guns locked up.

2585
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,280
So let's get back to video games, but

2586
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:19,280
speaking of the PSP,

2587
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:23,280
which we were talking about a while ago, they've added a new

2588
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,280
firmware to the PSP, 5.5, other than

2589
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:31,280
breaking homebrew stuff if you, you know, want to upgrade or whatever,

2590
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:35,280
it will also allow you to have a few other things, including the

2591
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:39,280
information board, which is already available right now on the Playstation 3 cross-media bar,

2592
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:43,280
and also they're going to add some internet security, if you happen to

2593
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:47,280
be a little kid, you can use the Trend micro security

2594
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:51,280
to block certain websites, and also filter out other

2595
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:55,280
things as well, including all that nasty porno, because

2596
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:59,280
the PSP is a gateway to porn. What if I want all that nasty porno? Well then

2597
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:03,280
don't enable the optional security. Oh, okay.

2598
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:07,280
So, and then also you'll be able to do an internet search for games directly

2599
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:11,280
from the cross-media bar as well, and they've included some memory stick improvements, including

2600
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:15,280
your ability to be able to create and access sub-folders

2601
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:19,280
on your Memory Stick Pro Duo for music, videos, and photos, which is awesome.

2602
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:23,280
Because, you know, folders

2603
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:27,280
make things nice and neat for all that porn that's on there.

2604
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,280
Is this what you're using your PSP for, is porn?

2605
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:35,280
Porn and RiftTrax audio samples.

2606
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:39,280
Nice. Oh, I'm so sad I missed the last little RiftTrax thing.

2607
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:43,280
Oh, it was awesome. Are you doing it again this week? Maybe I'll come. Uh, probably not this week, but we'll

2608
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:47,280
find a new one. Sad. Alright, well anyhow. Yes, Twilight is

2609
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:51,280
made much better with people making fun of it. I have not yet seen Twilight.

2610
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:55,280
Line. Anyhow, one more story for you guys,

2611
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:59,280
and then we are going to open up the Skype line. I'm almost a little afraid to open it up tonight,

2612
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:03,280
but we are going to open it up at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,

2613
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,280
Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with something else that's kind of related to the PlayStation Portable.

2614
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:11,280
It's about Skype, because you guys are going to be calling us on Skype soon. But it actually is not about

2615
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:15,280
the PSP. It's about the DS.

2616
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:19,280
You see, a Skype representative was recently speaking to the blog

2617
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:23,280
TechRadar. I almost said TechRadar, but it's TechRadar. Apparently,

2618
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:27,280
the technical possibility to have Skype on the DS is there.

2619
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:31,280
It's just not planned. The exact comment, quote, whilst we can't comment on

2620
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:35,280
any future plans to bring Skype. Oh my.

2621
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:39,280
Oh my god. We have had butts

2622
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:43,280
black. Wow, we just had a huge accident in studio.

2623
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:47,280
What the fuck? The doctor

2624
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:51,280
just got shot. What the fuck? He fell on his tailbone, shoving

2625
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,280
his spine through his trachea. Who brought the gun into my house?

2626
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:59,280
All over Irene. Alright, no. Oddly enough,

2627
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:03,280
his blood is rainbow colored. Doctor, could you please explain what just happened to cause

2628
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,280
such chaos? No, I just thought... Did I forget where the chair

2629
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:11,280
was? She moved the chair when he got up. Did she really do that old

2630
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:15,280
prank where the doctor went to sit down and Rice Princess pulled the chair back?

2631
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:19,280
Yes. Oh my god.

2632
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:23,280
It's because you unplugged your

2633
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:27,280
controller.

2634
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:31,280
I just... Can we just...

2635
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:35,280
Awesome.

2636
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,280
I know. I'm so done with this show. Alright.

2637
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:43,280
What was I gonna say about... Oh yeah.

2638
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:47,280
Quote, whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype to

2639
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:51,280
Nintendo's DSi, it would technically be possible. There it is.

2640
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:55,280
It's not gonna happen. Yeah, it's not gonna happen because Nintendo wants to do

2641
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:59,280
their own proprietary thing, I bet. They were already showing it... Shut up.

2642
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:03,280
They were already showing it a couple years ago at E3.

2643
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:07,280
Which means they'll never... Well, that was the whole... They have voice chat in other games.

2644
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,280
You know, this is a tech demo, but I don't think they're gonna ever do Skype.

2645
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:15,280
Well, if you feel so terrible, why did you

2646
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:19,280
pull the chair away?

2647
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:23,280
If I had a gun, I would shoot you in the foot right now.

2648
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:27,280
That's what I would do. No, you're right. I was scared of the gun.

2649
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:31,280
I'd be afraid that the gun would suddenly point at me while I'm trying to pull the chair. I'll shoot you in the face of the marshmallow

2650
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,280
spade gray.

2651
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,280
Alright. I'm... Fuck it.

2652
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:43,280
We're opening the Skype line. 1877 game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is

2653
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:47,280
OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2654
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:51,280
Hi, Legend of Zaku. Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind? Planet Chaos, may you help us?

2655
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:55,280
Nothing much, just chilling tonight, just trying to bear the stifling

2656
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:59,280
heat in New York City. We've had a weird weather week in California

2657
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:03,280
as well. It was like super duper hot one day, and then it was rainy and cold the next, and now it's

2658
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:07,280
hot again. Go figure. I don't get it. Yeah, apparently it was like 90 degrees.

2659
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:11,280
But yeah, just trying to snag some

2660
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:15,280
other deals, like the orange box for 10 bucks. Finally, I got that shit.

2661
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:19,280
What an awesome deal that was. Hold on. I have to read this comment in chat real quick, because it's

2662
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:23,280
funny. SSJ100Matt says, Irene is now Jerk Princess.

2663
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:27,280
There we go. Yay, Jerk Princess. Alright, I'm sorry, Zaku. So, yes,

2664
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,280
orange box is $10. It's the deal everyone's been talking about this weekend.

2665
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,280
Did you pick it up? I just picked it up

2666
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:39,280
like, what, 15, 20, like half an hour ago. I've

2667
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,280
yet to download it yet, but hopefully I'll be doing that tonight or tomorrow.

2668
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:47,280
Just waiting to see whether or not the SS's job of mine will actually extend.

2669
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:51,280
Well, so you've been working recently. Good for you. Congrats.

2670
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:55,280
Well, working temporarily, but you know, working for Uncle Sam for that time being.

2671
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:59,280
But yeah, besides buying orange box, I just indulged in

2672
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:03,280
DJ Max Technica location test today up in

2673
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:07,280
New Rochelle, not far from the Bronx. Tell us a little bit about DJ Max

2674
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:11,280
and the arcade for those that don't know much about it. Let's just put it this way.

2675
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:15,280
It's really hard to pick up, especially if you've been playing a lot of rhythm

2676
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,280
games. Unless you have a lead beat agents experience,

2677
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:23,280
it's going to be really hard to match the touching and everything.

2678
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:27,280
The whole aspect of the game is quickly forward.

2679
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:31,280
It took me a while to just pick it up, but then most of the time it was just

2680
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:35,280
failing the harder songs, because then when you touch certain things, you have to

2681
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:39,280
make sure you either touch it on that

2682
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:43,280
note right there on the screen, or you've just got to tap it

2683
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:47,280
a few times to the beat, follow the curse around.

2684
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:51,280
It's basically a bigger,

2685
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:55,280
it's a larger version of a lead beat agents. Put it that way.

2686
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:59,280
Interesting. I know you're a big fan of the Beatmania series

2687
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:03,280
and Beatmania 2DS. How does it compare to Beatmania for you?

2688
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:07,280
It's kind of different. I don't think it compares. It's just more like instead of using keys,

2689
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:11,280
actually hard keys, it's more using a lot more fingers.

2690
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:15,280
The fact that you have to touch

2691
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,280
every part of the screen wherever you have to.

2692
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:23,280
It's kind of like how Konami is doing with that game.

2693
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:27,280
The fact that you have to touch the screen

2694
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:31,280
to hit the notes, instead of having to hit a particular key on the screen.

2695
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:35,280
I know it's completely foreign, as I said.

2696
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:39,280
It takes a while for certain players to pick it up. I know I basically

2697
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:43,280
pissed away six bucks on that game at $1.50 a game.

2698
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:47,280
It was as much as I could today.

2699
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:51,280
I got to do it again, seriously.

2700
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:55,280
Anything else you want to share with our listeners before we move on to another call?

2701
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:59,280
Dynasty Warriors, Gundam 2, get it. I don't care what they say, just get it now.

2702
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:03,280
It's a lot better than the first one, multiplayer.

2703
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:07,280
Thank you so much, Zaku, for the call. Take care, buddy.

2704
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,280
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is

2705
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:15,280
OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2706
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:19,280
Hello, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is the guy that hopes Comcast is going to let him stay on the stream long enough.

2707
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:23,280
Well, welcome. I'm glad to see your audio is working tonight, too, Jason.

2708
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:27,280
I know you've been a long time listener to the show. Tonight's been a little crazy, hasn't it?

2709
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:31,280
No worse than I've heard before.

2710
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:35,280
Two quick things before the actual question.

2711
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,280
The new Dragon Ball game and the releases. Do you know that Dragon Ball Z is being re-released

2712
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:43,280
as a series in Japan? No, I did not know that.

2713
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:47,280
Well, that makes a ton of sense. It's freaking classic.

2714
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:51,280
Is it being re-related? Yeah, but everything is a classic, and they're not re-releasing everything.

2715
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:55,280
At any rate, Fullmetal Alchemist is being re-released as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

2716
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:59,280
Dragon Ball Z is being re-released as Dragon Ball Kai.

2717
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:03,280
They both started at the start of April, and

2718
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:07,280
both of them are a re-released series that are supposed to be more

2719
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:11,280
closer in story to the manga.

2720
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:15,280
Are they re-animated? To an extent, yeah.

2721
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:19,280
It's done like the Evangelion movies that are coming out, right?

2722
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,280
I have no idea. Well, with the Evangelion movies, they're pulled a lot of original

2723
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:27,280
footage and then added a new animation. I don't know about Dragon Ball Kai,

2724
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,280
but you can watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood at

2725
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:35,280
Funimation is broadcasting that subbed.

2726
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,280
Nice! Rama is saying re-released in HD with extra footage.

2727
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:43,280
Do you want? I don't know about Kai, but Fullmetal Alchemist.com

2728
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:47,280
has links. I've been meaning to watch it, I just haven't had the time.

2729
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:51,280
Random ask question, does this have anything to do with the recent Dragon Ball Z movie

2730
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:55,280
that came out to theaters? I don't think so, and I sure as hell hope not,

2731
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:59,280
because the movie looks like an absolute travesty, but then again, I never liked Dragon Ball.

2732
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:03,280
I have to say, I was one of the people that had

2733
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:07,280
fifth generation fan subs of Cell Game and everything.

2734
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:11,280
I will say, Dragon Ball Z on the Super Nintendo was the first import

2735
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,280
game I ever played, because they actually had a little place around here,

2736
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:19,280
an independent movie store before Blockbuster

2737
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:23,280
and Hollywood kind of stomped everything out that used to rent import games.

2738
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:27,280
It was kind of crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry Jason, what was your question?

2739
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:31,280
One more quick thing. WarioWare myself, let me guess,

2740
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:35,280
you play WarioWare games with yourself using the DSI camera? I think it is the exact

2741
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,280
same DSI game that we've already got over here, I'm fairly certain.

2742
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:43,280
I don't know for sure. The real question,

2743
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:47,280
I know that the only classic Sierra games I've played have been Space Quest,

2744
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:51,280
I've seen bits and pieces of King's Quest, but that's been about it.

2745
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:55,280
Why does the name Sarian sound so familiar? I know it's in the title, like Space Quest

2746
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:59,280
1 was the Sarian encounter, was that a race or something in that series?

2747
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:03,280
I'm assuming it's a race in the game.

2748
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,280
I'm sure they named the website after something that you see in one of those games.

2749
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:11,280
Yeah, I should go look at it, because that name is so familiar, but I just don't remember it

2750
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:15,280
from the series. But then again, it's also been upwards of five or six years since I've played it.

2751
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:19,280
I remember seeing the news about Sarian.net

2752
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,280
and I thought it was awesome, I still have yet to check it out. Again, the whole

2753
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,280
not enough time thing. Just want to point out the subtitle of the original Space Quest

2754
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:31,280
game is Space Quest the Sarian Encounter. Yeah, and I think I've heard it

2755
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,280
in a few other places throughout the series. I beat Space Quest 1,

2756
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:39,280
the VGA remake, but I don't know, I just don't remember it.

2757
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,280
I've mentioned a lot how interfaces like Home on the PS3

2758
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:47,280
don't work, because they're just an interface and there's nothing to do.

2759
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:51,280
But whatever they did to put the applications in

2760
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:55,280
Sarian.net sounds absolutely amazing. I mean, yeah

2761
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:59,280
it's the next step up of what Xbox Live is right now

2762
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,280
with the partying and all of that kind of stuff. Where even if you're not actually playing the game

2763
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,280
you can be around and congregate and do whatever

2764
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:11,280
in a game interface that's, I guess, familiar assuming you've actually

2765
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,280
played the game before.

2766
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,280
Space Quest, not so much. Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, yes, tons.

2767
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,280
I've played every single King's Quest game.

2768
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:27,280
And I've played every single Space Quest game. Oh, funny.

2769
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:31,280
Alright, well Jason, we've got to wrap up to get some more

2770
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:35,280
calls. Do you have any other quick thoughts? You talk too fast

2771
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:39,280
sometimes. I'm sorry, do you have any other quick, do you have any

2772
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:43,280
other quick thoughts for our listener? That's the second time I've been told that this week.

2773
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,280
It's my nature. Yeah, it is. But you're clear in your

2774
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:51,280
speaking so it's not a bad thing. I know, I'm like the Micro Machines dude.

2775
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:55,280
Alright, see you later Jason, thanks for the call.

2776
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:59,280
John Machido. Bye. Is that his name? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm like that guy. Maybe I should

2777
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:03,280
addition to be the Micro Machines. See, I do trip up on my words sometimes though and I talk really fast.

2778
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,280
I think it would be easier if I was actually reading from a script.

2779
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:11,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2780
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,280
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Oh, hey

2781
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:19,280
guys, what's up? This is Dan Shadow. Hey, Dan Shadow, what is on your mind? Greetings and

2782
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,280
celebrations. Greetings, I don't think we've had you on the show before. What's on your mind?

2783
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,280
Oh, shoot, nothing much. Hey, you guys were just talking about the guns and all the fun

2784
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:31,280
stuff and you made me think of this Penny Arcade

2785
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,280
comic that came out recently making fun of Rock Band Nirvana.

2786
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:39,280
Ha, I saw this, yes. I did see that.

2787
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,280
Did you take it down? I couldn't find it. It was posted on my friends list.

2788
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:47,280
Let me see if I remember which friend of mine posted it

2789
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:51,280
too. It wasn't that long ago. Why don't you describe the comic for our

2790
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:55,280
listeners who haven't seen it. Okay, so the first panel, they

2791
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:59,280
have the Rock Band box and it looks just like a Rock Band box that says Rock Band Nirvana.

2792
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:03,280
Second panel, one guy pulls out the guitar controller.

2793
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:07,280
Everything looks cool. Third panel, the guy has a weird little bass and he

2794
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:11,280
pulls out this giant shotgun controller and that's it.

2795
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:15,280
Yeah, because it's Rock Band Nirvana edition. I found the comic, by the way, on my friends page

2796
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:19,280
of LiveJournal and I linked it in chat. I don't know if they pulled it from the original

2797
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,280
Penny Arcade site, but it's still on their server. April 22nd was the day.

2798
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:27,280
Okay, sweet. Yeah, I tried finding it again and that was

2799
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,280
wrong, yet I couldn't help but laugh how bad it was.

2800
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,280
You know, it was to me one of those things where it's like, you know, sometimes

2801
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:39,280
we find solace in death through humor, like how people laugh at

2802
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:43,280
funerals and stuff like that. I don't think anybody, you know, it's kind of one of those

2803
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:47,280
oh wow, too soon, but I mean, you know, obviously it's been many, many years since

2804
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:51,280
that happened, but I think it's one of those things where

2805
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,280
if you can't laugh at it, what can you do, if that makes sense. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, totally.

2806
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,280
And didn't it come out on the anniversary of his death or something like that? Did it

2807
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:03,280
really? That would be kind of interesting. Well, I thought it was just topical because

2808
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:07,280
you know, they have the Rock Band Beatles game coming out with the Beatles paraphernalia. I just kind of

2809
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:11,280
talked it up to that. I didn't even realize there might be a correlation with the anniversary of Kurt Cobain's

2810
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:15,280
death or anything like that. Either way, it seems like the timing is great on all

2811
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:19,280
points. Yeah, so it was kind of one of those

2812
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:23,280
that's so wrong kind of things where you're just kind of like laughing through it.

2813
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:27,280
Yeah, totally. I told my friend about it and he just shook his head

2814
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:31,280
and laughed and walked away. Exactly. That's exactly what that kind of comic should be.

2815
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:35,280
Well hey, anything else going on in your gaming week? Stuff you've been up to?

2816
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,280
Oh yeah, definitely. I am very much into Valkyria Chronicles

2817
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:43,280
on the PS3. I'm loving that game. Is it really cool

2818
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:47,280
because I played the demo and I had a lot of fun with the demo and I kept telling myself I was going to

2819
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:51,280
go get the full game but I just never did. I think it's on sale now though so I might have to check it out.

2820
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,280
Yeah, totally. It's the next step

2821
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:59,280
in a tactics game that is much needed because when you think of

2822
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:03,280
tactics game, you always think of the same, nearly the same style from what Final Fantasy

2823
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:07,280
Tactics did. What is this next step that makes you so sold

2824
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:11,280
on this game? Well, it starts off and shows the overview map

2825
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:15,280
so you see all the pieces and then you get to move around in

2826
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:19,280
nearly real time. You still have your spaces or whatever movements

2827
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:23,280
people can make. The setting is fresh almost. It's very different. It doesn't have that

2828
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,280
everyone's kind of walking in place look to it. The animation is pretty good

2829
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:31,280
and just the way it works, I mean every unit likes other people

2830
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,280
or dislikes other people. Everyone has specialties so if this guy works well in the desert

2831
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:39,280
or if he likes to hang around chicks, you get the bonus.

2832
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:43,280
It's almost like a weak third person shooter but it works great in a tactical environment.

2833
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:47,280
You can take cover. You can have your snipers or you can have a tank.

2834
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:51,280
Everything works well together and the graphic style

2835
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:55,280
is very stylized, very fun. It is very stylized and to answer some questions

2836
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,280
in chat, it is a PS3 exclusive as far as I know. There is a demo on the Sony

2837
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,280
store that you can check out if it sounds interesting because yeah, I did like the whole

2838
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:07,280
like you were actually moving the pieces around and jumping over obstacles

2839
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,280
and things. It did feel kind of tactical in that way. It was awesome.

2840
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,280
I should really just suck it up and buy the full game.

2841
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:19,280
It's a very fun game and it's quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. I just can't put it down.

2842
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:23,280
Valkyria Chronicles is the game.

2843
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:27,280
Is it related to Valkyria profile? You're thinking Valkyria

2844
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,280
from Square. No, this is from Sega.

2845
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:35,280
It's a whole new thing. Yeah, Sega made it. A whole new thing.

2846
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:39,280
And new DLC coming out as well. Oh, so they're keeping it going. Wow, that's pretty cool.

2847
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:43,280
Well Dan, any other closing thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

2848
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:47,280
No, just saying hi.

2849
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:51,280
If you guys are around for E3, an offer is sold out but I can get you all into Disneyland.

2850
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:55,280
Well, that's a very generous offer. I know Loki is going to Disneyland.

2851
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:59,280
I don't know if he already bought the tickets. I already have the ticket vouchers. Sorry.

2852
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,280
Well, you know what? Maybe I'll take him up on that.

2853
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:07,280
If I could get down there, I'd be happy to, but I'm broke.

2854
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,280
I will keep in touch, Dan. I know you're on the Twitter, so I'll be in touch.

2855
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:15,280
Alright, cool. Nice talking to you guys. Alright, take care Dan. Thanks for the call.

2856
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:19,280
Speaking of Twitter, we're keeping an eye on things tonight.

2857
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:23,280
User Javier Altman says,

2858
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:27,280
Yeah, it's just footy monster.

2859
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:31,280
But I'm reading the usernames here.

2860
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:35,280
Magical Nathan simply gave us a yeah.

2861
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:39,280
Yeah. I don't know. Magical Nathan's username.

2862
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:43,280
ActDeft says, I hope Sky updates the podcast soon.

2863
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:47,280
Since this is a pretty hilarious episode. It will be caught up next week.

2864
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:51,280
I promise. We will be all caught up next week. We have to be for the contest.

2865
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:55,280
Or it's not going to work. I know. It's just, you know, when I'm drunk, nothing's funny.

2866
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,280
Alright, hi. You're on Orange Andrea. Who's this? It's Deathwishing again.

2867
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:03,280
Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind? Huh? What's on your mind?

2868
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:07,280
Um, first of all, I would like to say I have a great first person shooter idea.

2869
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,280
It involves you, and it would always be you running away from the battles.

2870
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,280
Where's the guns everywhere? Worst game ever. I'm sorry to tell you.

2871
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,280
It'd be a great game, because it'd be like little girly screams.

2872
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,280
Why are you making fun of me?

2873
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:27,280
Second, um, do you, um,

2874
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:31,280
think of Konami as a first person shooter developer at all?

2875
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:35,280
Konami as a first person shooter developer. Well, like, do you think of them?

2876
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:39,280
Because they're making a first person shooter game called Six Days in Fallujah.

2877
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:43,280
No, I've heard of the Fallujah game though. I have.

2878
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:47,280
I guess it's supposed to be some ultra realistic game, like from my herd.

2879
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:51,280
Yeah, yeah.

2880
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:55,280
Weren't they, like, actually interviewing veterans or something to figure this game out?

2881
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:59,280
And terrorists. Oh my gosh.

2882
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:03,280
I'm thinking, like, what's going to happen? Am I going to be playing, like, getting ready to do a breach and entry on Adoro,

2883
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:07,280
all of a sudden Contra, big alien thing flies out of nowhere?

2884
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:11,280
That wouldn't be very realistic now, would it?

2885
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:15,280
But I just can't understand it.

2886
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:19,280
Like, they're really kick ass, PS3 one, and then they're like,

2887
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,280
eh, forget it. No one wants to play a good game.

2888
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:27,280
Well, good games never last. That's true. That's kind of true.

2889
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:31,280
What kind of games have you been playing this week? Death Wishing?

2890
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:35,280
Well, I was at a cyber cafe yesterday, and I played

2891
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,280
a lot of, I played Street Fighter a lot, actually, with my

2892
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:43,280
death Asian friend who could beat me with the controller behind his back,

2893
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:47,280
and down the hallway, like a douche, showing off to everyone.

2894
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:51,280
Everyone's clapping, and I'm just like, you bitch.

2895
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:55,280
Isn't that crazy how people can do that? Like, I remember a story about

2896
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:59,280
there was a Soulcalibur player that could do that, too. Like, they were blind or something, and they could just

2897
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:03,280
whoop everybody at Soulcalibur. It was amazing.

2898
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:07,280
It's because they're Asian. Asians are better at any game that comes from Asia. Like, Starcraft!

2899
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:11,280
Did you say your Asian friend was deaf? Yeah.

2900
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:15,280
Or, when you have loss of a sense like that, all your other senses are heightened.

2901
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:19,280
Could it be because of that? No, I just really think the Asian race itself

2902
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,280
is just better at video games than anyone else.

2903
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:27,280
Rice Princess, as our token Asian in studio tonight, confirmed deny these said allegations.

2904
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:31,280
I can very much confirm. Very good. Uh-huh.

2905
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:35,280
You can send those cards and letters to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2906
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:39,280
I will be sure to forward them appropriately. Wow.

2907
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:43,280
Wow, wow, wow.

2908
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:47,280
And you're getting yelled at by GS68 in chat, who is also... I can tell, and I can just tell

2909
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:51,280
him, um, no, it's not a stereotype, because

2910
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,280
it's more of a fact, because I can't beat anyone at Starcraft that's...

2911
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:59,280
Anyways, Rob, I'll invite you to go

2912
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:03,280
paintballing with me sometime. Oh, I'm sure that'll be a joy,

2913
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:07,280
especially after what I said tonight. There'll be, like, a secret meeting while I run to the restroom

2914
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:11,280
or something before the thing starts. Okay, everybody, target Rob. He's the

2915
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:15,280
gun-a-phobe. And I'll just... I'll want to cry when the day's over.

2916
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:19,280
Alright, well, Deathwishing, thank you very much for the

2917
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:23,280
call. Have a good week, okay? Oh, God.

2918
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:27,280
Take care, buddy. Alright.

2919
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:31,280
That's going to do it for the calls tonight. Sorry if you guys didn't get through. Send us an email or a tweet

2920
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:35,280
or try again next week, you guys. Alright, um, by the way, I wanted to say this

2921
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:39,280
real quick before we get into the last-minute stories tonight, because I just thought of something I was reading.

2922
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,280
One page I go to once in a while is yahoo.com, and they have, you know, news

2923
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:47,280
stories that rotate on the front. There was a story on there the other day talking about how Grand Theft Auto

2924
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:51,280
4's sales figures have... Sorry, not 4. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars

2925
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:55,280
sales have been extremely disappointing. They went so far as to call it a flop,

2926
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:59,280
because it sold only, what, 87,000 copies its first week?

2927
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:03,280
Loki, I know you're a huge Grand Theft Auto fan. What do you think? Is this true? Are people judging

2928
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:07,280
this too early? Is it a flop? Was it a bad idea to begin with? Well, it's only

2929
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:11,280
been a... They're basing it off of the NPD numbers, which are only, you know,

2930
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:15,280
it's only showing two weeks of the sales right now, so I'd have to

2931
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:19,280
see what it looks like, you know, at the end of this month.

2932
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,280
I don't think it's going to be a flop. You know, like most DS games that come out, they sell over

2933
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:27,280
a longer period of time. You know, since it's more of a casual system, people

2934
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:31,280
are more casually, you know, wanting to pick up stuff. So,

2935
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:35,280
there's that, and then also the DS is really, really easy

2936
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:39,280
to pirate stuff on. So, you know, you have a lot of people that were, you know,

2937
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:43,280
pirating and that kind of thing. But, um, I think it's going to do well.

2938
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:47,280
I mean, like, even like Super Mario 64, a game that

2939
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,280
literally came out with, you know, the Nintendo DS is still

2940
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:55,280
selling well today. So, I don't doubt that this will sell well.

2941
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,280
Do you think it's maybe because the DS is more of a kiddie system in Grand Theft Auto?

2942
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:03,280
You know, how many really adult gamers admit to playing the DS

2943
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:07,280
regularly? Um, I don't know, but yeah, I can imagine that it is more

2944
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:11,280
a kiddie system, but also people are dumb and they'll buy their kids this stuff. I guess that's true.

2945
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:15,280
I guess that's true. Alright, last minute stories, anybody.

2946
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:19,280
DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight? Um, although it was kind of mentioned in an email,

2947
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:23,280
um, Marvel vs Capcom 2 is getting a re-release

2948
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,280
with, um, arcade sticks.

2949
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,280
Nice. Is it like an arcade thing? I remember hearing something about the

2950
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:35,280
achievements. I think Xbox Live. It's so rumored right now.

2951
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:39,280
Interesting. I know there was a, somebody posted to our show roll prep

2952
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:43,280
thread and I just, we didn't post it because there wasn't a lot there besides a countdown timer

2953
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,280
that they're saying is rumored to be the Marvel vs Capcom 2. So, anyway.

2954
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:51,280
Anything else DarkSakura tonight? What? Anything else

2955
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:55,280
for last minute stories? Flem. Alright, Loki. Um, there's

2956
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:59,280
a couple things. One, there's some new info for, uh, Star Trek

2957
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:03,280
DAC, which will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade in May

2958
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:07,280
and kind of looks a little bit like, um, Star Control, which is pretty cool.

2959
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:11,280
And then also, um,

2960
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:15,280
there's a rumor that there's going to be a new Clone Wars game coming to the PS3

2961
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,280
and Xbox 360. It's supposed to feature co-op as well

2962
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:23,280
and will be entitled, uh, Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes.

2963
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:27,280
I can see this coming out. I mean, they let the horror of this stuff out.

2964
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:31,280
And then finally, um, this is awesome. Coming to

2965
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:35,280
Virtual Console soon, Clay Fighters.

2966
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:39,280
No way! Yes, Clay Fighters.

2967
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:43,280
It has been raided by the ESRB.

2968
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,280
I thought Clay Fighters was already out in Europe. And Helga.

2969
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:51,280
Um, no, in the US. I don't know if it's out

2970
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,280
in Europe already. Wait, so, but if it's already out here, why is it being

2971
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:59,280
re-rated? No, it's not out here. It's coming out here.

2972
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:03,280
Oh. I don't know if it's out in Europe already, but it's coming out here

2973
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,280
because it just got raided by the ESRB. Yeah, Rob. Got it.

2974
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,280
Does this have the theme song, maybe?

2975
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:15,280
Hold on, I'm looking at YouTube to try and find...

2976
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:19,280
Aw, it just has the intro.

2977
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:23,280
Music

2978
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:27,280
Music

2979
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:31,280
Music

2980
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:35,280
I think it's off an emulation. Yeah, it's off an emulator or something. I can't find it.

2981
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:39,280
I'm not going to bother. Anyway, I got submitted a last minute story

2982
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:43,280
here real quick, and I remember reading about this this week. The plug has been pulled on

2983
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:47,280
Bioshock, apparently. Not the game, but the movie. It was to be

2984
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,280
directed by Gore Verbinski, who's famous obviously for the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Apparently

2985
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,280
the movie had been in pre-production, and the plug was pulled this week.

2986
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:59,280
This happens sometimes in Hollywood. This is a very Hollywood thing to happen.

2987
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:03,280
There it is. Apparently, they

2988
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:07,280
wanted to move the film outside the US to take advantage of the tax credit. It's not necessarily

2989
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:11,280
completely done with, by the way. It's just the game is in a quote-unquote

2990
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:15,280
holding pattern. In other words, it's been delayed a little while.

2991
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:19,280
There you go. Bioshock. You have to jump around. Oh, the game you're playing right now

2992
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:23,280
is Mylon's Secret Castle. You go in the little doors, and there's a little, like,

2993
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:27,280
go to the right, dummy. Can you keep going to the right?

2994
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:31,280
There you go. And you go in those little, like, you can go in there.

2995
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,280
Anyway, forget it. Alright,

2996
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:39,280
any other last minute stories, Loki? That's all I have. And that's going to do it for

2997
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:43,280
tonight's Orange Launch Radio. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2998
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:47,280
Wellie Wellie, I know you didn't get to say a whole lot here, but hopefully you had fun.

2999
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:51,280
And watching and participating when you did. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3000
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:55,280
I just lost the game. Sorry to hear that. Alright.

3001
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:59,280
The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3002
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:03,280
Yeah, everyone should go to the UOP Film Festival in May.

3003
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,280
Because, you know, our international audience can all make it to UOP. Yeah, because

3004
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,280
my engagement to Movie Merge is coming out.

3005
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:15,280
Princess Princess, do you have any final thoughts? In the mic, please.

3006
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:19,280
Thanks, Rob. Want to go to Disneyland for free?

3007
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,280
Come to LA in June with us.

3008
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:27,280
If Loki already bought his ticket, you can have his ticket. Alright, Loki, do you have any final

3009
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:31,280
thoughts for our listeners? Nope, I need a Cage Man song, but I'm finding

3010
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,280
one right now. My final thought is, the wine buzz

3011
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:39,280
is gone. That's kind of sad. It didn't last long. Dark Sakura, our final, final,

3012
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:43,280
final thought tonight. Give me money. Alright, thank you guys so much for

3013
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:47,280
downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio or listening to us live, however you do it.

3014
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:51,280
We really appreciate all the support of you guys. Remember, if you like what you hear here, and

3015
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:55,280
if you've stuck with the show until the very end tonight of all nights, I

3016
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:59,280
really applaud you, and you must really like what we're doing here. So please tell a friend or two

3017
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:03,280
about our show. That's how we get around is word of mouth. We don't have a big magazine or

3018
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:07,280
a big website that backs us. Nope, it's just a couple of friends who all met playing DDR

3019
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,280
doing this shit out of their garage for the past seven years. So, there you go.

3020
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:15,280
Dark Sakura? I actually forgot to put up the contest about winning my

3021
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:19,280
TurboGrafx. So now I'm just going to say that the 200th, actually, the

3022
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:23,280
300th person to follow me on Twitter will get it.

3023
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:27,280
Oh god, it's going to be one of those contests, huh? No, I'm just being silly. However,

3024
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,280
the 300th person will get something. Well, maybe we can, you know, because we're going to have the contest for this

3025
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:35,280
Miles Decay thing next week. Maybe we can do, like, contest week next week or something. We'll do it. Think about what

3026
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:39,280
you want to do for your contest. Contest week. Because we're going to do, I'll tell you off air. I'm just being a whore.

3027
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:43,280
Alright. Well, congratulations. Alright. Um.

3028
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:47,280
Dylin, you are a whore. Alright. Anyway, that's it.

3029
02:35:47,280 --> 02:36:09,280
Goodnight everybody. We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3030
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:21,280
Anyway, see you next week.
