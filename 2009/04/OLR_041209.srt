00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Hi everybody out there on the internet welcome to a special podcast for this

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,140
Sunday April the 12th of 2009. Let me try to explain quickly if possible

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,820
what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,300
like that tonight. The show started, we began taping as usual about six

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,260
o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time and about 30 minutes into the show

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,200
during part A tonight the video card on the system we used to tape the show

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,280
started freaking out and dying so basically the video card overheated mid

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,920
taping of the show and it caused a lot of stuff to happen basically we we lost

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,440
all of part A unfortunately we weren't able to recover what we had taped so far

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,360
so it's gone and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it and then

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,200
basically the computer we use to tape OLR is fucked. Now don't worry you guys

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,440
we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,400
so I don't want people like freaking out like oh my god is OLR dead no we're not

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,040
gonna let a stupid video card keep things down but it did screw us over

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
for tonight however what I've done I have two computers in the house it's

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,200
just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,480
or any of that sort so we're actually not broadcasting on all games right now

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,000
because it's not configured for that we're actually live on all games radio

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,840
or not not all games radio sadly however we are live on Justin TV and we're gonna

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,860
tape a mini show tonight Doc Sakura is here with us as always me and my lungs

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,360
and Dan was joining us tonight and I'm really sorry to Dan cuz it's very rare

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,320

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,640
what they missed on the podcast they just want at least to hear a little bit

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,160
about what's going on in the news this week so quickly let's talk about our

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,720
gaming weeks let's recap what's been going on in our gaming weeks this week

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:11,440
dark soccer I played shit Dan maim Loki I've been playing that Grand Theft Auto

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,480
for the lost and damned and recently during the show Arroyo Muramasa which is

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,000
Muramasa Dean blade on the week and I have been playing we fit surprisingly

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,840
enough I've been playing a lot of we fit I'm on a new little diet where I'm gonna

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,680
use we fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before e3

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,640
so okay so that was our gaming weeks let's move into what's going on in the

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,420
gaming world tonight housekeeping our show was completely borked to this week

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,960
and we apologize but that's live radio good bad and ugly all on live radio so

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,720
Loki start us off quickly with some news tonight okay so I'm gonna kind of let's

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:02,040
see here is interesting enough Sony is actually patented a PSP controlled car

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,560
which I don't really you know that's interesting I guess it looks like of

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,100
course you're not real car obviously it's more of a you know RC car type of

42
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,560
thing but that's kind of neat and apparently the patent looks like based

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,280
off the instructions on there it's like it's gonna have some sort of camera or

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,840
something like that on it and you can kind of control it using the PSP maybe

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,040
an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees will be interesting

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,000
they're actually because if you remember the Sony I will actually had you know a

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,600
camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter Egg features about is

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,520
you could actually control the eyeball with your PSP so this is something like

49
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,160
that I don't know it's kind neat maybe we'll see this at e3 I wonder if it's

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,640
just like I don't know this is what this is what this is I look at and go what

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,720
huh really like Loki do you think this is going to be something cool or do you

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,400
think this is like I have judgment this is probably not anything cool yeah well

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,120
we'll see the car judgment dark dark Sakura what what kind of story did you

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,920
want to cover tonight well there were a couple I was thought would be cool go

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:24,000
for it well just to do it in inch just to do it in short order there is gonna

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,760
be a Silent Hill shattered memories on ps2 and PSP and we we version you can

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,320
use a flashlight we talked about this last week though it's basically gonna be

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,520
a revamping I don't think we had confirmed that the we thing was gonna be

59
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,080
a flashlight but then they kind of confirmed it this week it's confirmed

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,640
that's awesome also silent scope is coming out iPhone which is pretty cool

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,360
the Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Beatles rock band version and each of the records is going to have a little

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,680
documentary with it and also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,280
collection to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,960
that record quality also Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,240
virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,200
and also there's gonna be a grudge game and I'm totally gonna get it yeah but

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,560
isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,160
you love I don't care I'll still play it all right well some things I wanted to

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,560
cover really quickly Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,720
we heard rumors about July last week on the show it looks like they've been

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,040
somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves they did a quick press

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,160
conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and then

74
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,720
an overseas release will follow the next month overseas meaning of course the US

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,400
in that circumstance Squeenix has created games for myspace they're

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,040
actually gonna they've created this new game called what's it called dive hunt

77
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,240
to dive to hunt sorbet's great adventure that's right it's a very strange kind of

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,320
not Final Fantasy it's Oh sorbet I said sorbet I don't know whatever this looks

79
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,880
very strange and not like any other type of game but what's kind of cool about it

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,360
is that it does use one of the moogles but the design from Final Fantasy 12

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,720
where they look more like rabbits so I thought it was kind of interesting but

82
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,600
yeah very interesting they're launching a game on myspace don't they know that

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,680
everybody went to Facebook by now no apparently not apparently not metal gear

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,240
is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed that that

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,840
is a trademark that happened the Konami is filed metal gear and tactical online

86
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
action apparently they are arcade games you know there was that shooter game the

87
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
Silent Hill shooter game this doesn't seem something that's completely

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,480
unbelievable to me I don't know there's also a game I saw e3 a few years ago

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,400
that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,440
yeah no problem with that though that was and a mirror it was in the mirror

91
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,280
Metal Gear look did you have anything else like do I talk to chat really quick

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,880
yeah there's some other stuff they put Honda put out a press release saying

93
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,320
that they're gonna be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live primetime which

94
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,720
what's kind of funny though is they're actually gonna have a plane away a

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,280
plane win campaign and while you're waiting in queue to play you know the

96
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,280
big primetime games you'll have to watch ads for the car and then it kind of

97
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,800
slipped out that primetime will be launching May 15th with that which I

98
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,640
think is kind of the bigger point of the story but somehow that slipped in there

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't know some other interesting stuff that's kind of just slipped out

100
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,520
there apparently perfect dark is going to be coming back to watch you coming to

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,100
the Xbox Live Arcade this was actually revealed in a teaser that they the

102
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,840
people at rare were showing off some of their premium themes for banjo-touille

103
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,320
and lo and behold in one the latest games there is an icon for perfect dark

104
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,680
in there for one of the I guess rare members that jug go so he had a lace

105
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,240
game he played as being one of those haha slipped out there that's kind of

106
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,680
funny and I'll see here Final Fantasy 7 has come out on the PlayStation 3 at

107
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,640
least the original game on the PlayStation Store however only in Japan

108
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,960
don't but if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account you

109
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,360
can actually purchase the game I guess if you have your way to you know pay in

110
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,440
Japan and it is the international version which does have the English

111
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,120
language available as well for it so that's kind of cool and finally Konami

112
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,160
is putting out a new military action game called six days in fluja and this

113
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,520
is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon

114
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,560
but either way it is coming out and you know I was kind of surprised this week

115
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,280
with Konami's kind of gamers night going on we didn't really hear anything about

116
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,240
the stuff that was there I bet you the embargoed stuff did we get him by one

117
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,960
year we went yeah but it was usually embargoed until the next day you know

118
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,000
this was on a Thursday last week I mean unless they're just doing everything

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,560
next week but I don't know I surprised just nothing really coming out other

120
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,280
than this and you know the iPhone games that kind of stuff but oh well and

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,360
that's pretty much all I've got oh oh one last thing is gonna comment on

122
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,640
there's a rumor going around that there was going to be elite systems coming out

123
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,520
for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it yeah that's true so those

124
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,920
will be coming by the end of this month and they're gonna be around for about

125
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,200
two months and that's it rock band unplugged is coming out June 9th I know

126
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,360
what I'm getting that's that's the week right after e3 did you see the video for

127
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,280
it it looks just like well not exactly like amplitude but they've got a four

128
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,360
different you know tracks you switch between and of course they're the four

129
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,000
you know the same bass drum and guitar I'm very excited in a naughty spot it's

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,200
proof that harmonix loves us it really is harmonic and we love harmonix for

131
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,680
giving us this game honestly really they just need to just do frequency and

132
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,440
amplitude for the PSP it's got to happen mm-hmm well doesn't really need to

133
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,880
happen anymore now I mean think about it well sure but I mean they should just do

134
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
it anyway because those games are both great and I can't find a copy of

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,640
amplitude it is very hard to find now yes even for me and I can find anything

136
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,880
I want to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this

137
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,160
was interesting about the whole you know digital stuff and downloads and things

138
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,120
like that Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games and I'm not

139
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
talking about like the tangible kind I'm talking about they actually have an

140
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
Xbox live store now you actually can purchase the games through Amazon calm

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
and I guess the way you do it you go on there you buy with your Amazon account

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,920
and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360 so this is kind of a way you

143
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,320
can get around using Microsoft points if you don't want to rumor is this coming

144
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,000
out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well and this means you would be able to

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,480
bypass Nintendo points and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in

146
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Sony's wallet which is kind of interesting if true rumor I was actually

147
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,520
wondering though if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon

148
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,440
sure that's what I told you earlier Amazon right now is the stripping the

149
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:56,760
the sales ranks off of the gay lesbian authors so that when you try to look up

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,440
a product you won't find anything from them it's really just to keep they say

151
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,200
it's to keep children from finding adult content yet run Jeremy's our biography

152
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,600
is still easily accessible his strip his ranks haven't been stripped so there is

153
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,920
a movement going to Google bomb them so just go to Google and type in Amazon

223
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,400
