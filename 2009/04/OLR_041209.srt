00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:03,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everybody out there on the internet.

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to a special podcast for this Sunday, April the 12th of 2009.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:14,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me try to explain quickly, if possible, what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything like that tonight.

4
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: The show started, we began taping as usual about 6 o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time.

5
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:29,512
[SPEAKER_02]: and about 30 minutes into the show, during part A tonight, the video card on the system we used to tape the show started freaking out and dying.

6
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:32,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the video card overheated mid-taping of the show.

7
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And it caused a lot of stuff to happen, basically.

8
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost all of part A, unfortunately.

9
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,724
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't able to recover what we had taped so far, so it's gone, and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it.

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically the computer we used to tape OLR is fucked.

11
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Now don't worry, guys, we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week.

12
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:55,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want people freaking out like, oh my god, is OLR dead?

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not going to let a stupid video card keep things down.

14
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did screw us over for tonight.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,443
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what I've done, I have two computers in the house.

16
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:07,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing or any of that sort.

17
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:10,770
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually not broadcasting on All Games right now because it's not configured for that.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,312
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually live on All Games Radio.

19
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:14,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Not All Games Radio, sadly.

20
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:20,035
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we are live on Justin.TV.

21
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to tape a mini show tonight.

22
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is here with us as always.

23
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my lungs.

24
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:27,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan was joining us tonight.

25
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really sorry to Dan because it's very rare he gets here, but you're here.

26
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,162
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you get for not listening live?

27
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard so much more of me.

28
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:34,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm awesome.

29
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:36,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's here as well.

30
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:38,043
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't played shit.

32
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:05,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan.

33
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:07,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Mame.

34
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:09,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

35
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:19,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost and Damned, and recently during the show, Arroyo Momomasa, which is Momomasa Demon Blade.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,500
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Wii.

37
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been playing Wii Fit, surprisingly enough.

38
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a lot of Wii Fit.

39
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:31,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a new little diet where I'm going to use Wii Fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before E3.

40
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that was our gaming weeks.

41
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move into what's going on in the gaming world tonight.

42
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:38,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping.

43
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Our show was completely borked this week, and we apologize, but that's live radio.

44
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, bad, and ugly, all on live radio.

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, start us off quickly with some news tonight.

46
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm going to kind of, let's see here.

47
00:02:56,702 --> 00:03:03,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting enough, Sony has actually patented a PSP-controlled car, which I don't really...

48
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,057
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting, I guess.

49
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like, of course, not a real car, obviously.

50
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,245
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a RC car type of thing, but that's kind of neat.

51
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:21,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the patent looks like, based off the instructions on there, it's going to have some sort of camera or something like that on it.

52
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:27,732
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can kind of control it using the PSP, maybe an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees.

53
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:40,241
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be interesting though actually, because if you remember, the Sony AIBO actually had a camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter egg features about it is you could actually control the AIBO with your PSP.

54
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:43,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this is something like that.

55
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's kind of neat.

56
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:46,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll see this at E3.

57
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:53,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's just... I don't know, this is one of those things I look at and go, what?

58
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:54,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

59
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

60
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Loki, do you think this is going to be something cool, or do you think this is like Eye of Judgment?

61
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,443
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably not anything cool.

62
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:04,104
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

63
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:04,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see.

64
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,246
[SPEAKER_01]: The Car of Judgment.

65
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:10,708
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what kind of story did you want to cover tonight?

66
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were a couple I thought would be cool.

67
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.

68
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:28,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just to do it in short order, there is going to be Silent Hill Shattered Memories on PS2 and PSP and Wii.

69
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,045
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wii version you can use a flashlight.

70
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,145
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this last week, though.

71
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:33,986
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically going to be a revamping.

72
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we had confirmed that the Wii thing was going to be a flashlight, but then they kind of confirmed it this week.

73
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,057
[SPEAKER_00]: It's confirmed.

74
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

75
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:42,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Silent Scope is coming out on iPhone, which is pretty cool.

76
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,625
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the Beatles rock band version.

77
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:55,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of the records is going to have a little documentary with it.

78
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:23,566
[SPEAKER_00]: and um also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc collection um to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in that record quality also um Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours um and also there's going to be a grudge game I'm totally gonna get it

79
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that you love?

80
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:29,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care, I'll still play it.

81
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:31,868
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

82
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:35,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some things I wanted to cover really quickly.

83
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates.

84
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,290
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard rumors about July last week on the show.

85
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like they've been somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves.

86
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a quick press conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and that an overseas release will follow the next month.

87
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Overseas meaning, of course, the U.S.

88
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:53,732
[SPEAKER_02]: in that circumstance.

89
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix has created games for MySpace.

90
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They've created this new...

91
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:01,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Dive2Hunt Sorbet's Great Adventure

92
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII

93
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:39,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed.

94
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,302
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a trademark that happened that Konami has filed.

95
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear and Tactical Online Action.

96
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they are arcade games.

97
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:49,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was that shooter game, the Silent Hill shooter game.

98
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,489
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't seem something that's completely unbelievable to me.

99
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:53,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

100
00:06:53,229 --> 00:07:02,635
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a game I saw at E3 a few years ago that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades.

101
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the only problem with that though, that was Andamiro.

102
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was Andamiro.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear.

104
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:12,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, did you have anything else?

105
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I talk to chat really quick?

106
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some other stuff.

107
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:24,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Honda put out a press release saying that they're going to be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live Primetime.

108
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:29,156
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of funny, though, is they're actually going to have a play-and-win campaign.

109
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:31,297
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

110
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:51,809
[SPEAKER_01]: XBOX Live Arcade

111
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy VII has come out on the PlayStation 3.

112
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:51,040
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account, you can actually purchase the game, I guess if you have a way to pay in Japan.

113
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the international version, which does have the English language available as well for it, so that's kind of cool.

114
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:09,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, Konami is putting out a new military action game called Six Days in Fallujah.

115
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:16,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon, too soon.

116
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,698
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, it is coming out.

117
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:25,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was kind of surprised this week with Konami's kind of gamers night going on.

118
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really hear anything about the stuff that was there.

119
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you they embargoed stuff.

120
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:31,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we get embargoed one year we went?

121
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but it was usually embargoed until the next day.

122
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,688
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was on a Thursday last week.

123
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unless they were just doing everything next week.

124
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:40,710
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

125
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised.

126
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Just nothing really coming out other than this and, you know, the iPhone games and that kind of stuff.

127
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:45,573
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

128
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:50,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well, and that's pretty much all I've got.

129
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one last thing I was going to comment on.

130
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:03,597
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a rumor going around that there was going to be Elite Systems coming out for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it.

131
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:04,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

132
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:10,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will be coming by the end of this month and they're going to be around for about two months and that's it.

133
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock Band Unplugged is coming out June 9th.

134
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:14,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I'm getting.

135
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the week right after E3.

136
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:17,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the video for it?

137
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:28,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like, well, not exactly like Amplitude, but they've got four different tracks you switch between, and of course they're the same bass, drum, and guitar.

138
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited in a naughty spot.

139
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proof that Harmonix loves us.

140
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:32,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

141
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:53,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very hard to find now.

142
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:54,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

143
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:55,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Even for me.

144
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:56,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can find anything.

145
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:04,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this was interesting about the whole digital stuff and downloads and things like that.

146
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:07,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games.

147
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking about the tangible kind.

148
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about they actually have an Xbox Live store now.

149
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually can purchase the games through Amazon.com.

150
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the way you do it, you go on there, you buy with your Amazon account, and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360.

151
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:26,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of a way you can get around using Microsoft Points if you don't want to.

152
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is this is coming out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well.

153
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:37,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And this means you would be able to bypass Nintendo Points, and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in Sony's wallet, which is kind of interesting, if true.

154
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:38,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

155
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:38,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor.

156
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually wondering, though, if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon.

157
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:43,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

158
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,908
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I told you earlier.

159
00:11:46,008 --> 00:12:00,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon right now is stripping the sales ranks off of the gay, lesbian authors so that when you try to look up a product, you won't find anything from them.

160
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:07,417
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just to keep... They say it's to keep children from finding adult content, yet Ron Jeremy's autobiography is still easily accessible.

161
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,478
[SPEAKER_00]: His ranks haven't been stripped.

162
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:12,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a movement going to Google bomb them.

163
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go to Google and type in Amazon rank.

164
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:15,939
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

165
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

166
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should do it at least five times.

167
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

168
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:21,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd you read about this?

169
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious.

170
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Several friends on LiveJournal.

171
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:26,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.

172
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we get on side rants on this show.

173
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passing on the word if you support, you know.

174
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check it out.

175
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go off until I know a little more.

176
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already gone off once tonight when we were live.

177
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me do a little more research on it before I lose my shit.

178
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a statement.

179
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,161
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, the information's out there.

180
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:47,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check it out.

181
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:47,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.

182
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.

183
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it for the news we were going to cover tonight.

184
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:53,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Again,

185
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I really apologize for the Bort podcast tonight.

186
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to do something though instead of nothing.

187
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: There was extreme frustration in studio tonight just with the whole Bort card and everything like that.

188
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:05,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But these things happen.

189
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:06,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It's live radio.

190
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to do it every week, but sometimes it's just not going to happen.

191
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:15,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys as always for your support for listening to our program and supporting independent podcasting even when it's not so great.

192
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is you guys, the chatters, the live listeners that send us emails and all that that really keep us going.

193
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.

194
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back next week with a proper

195
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 320.

196
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,225
[SPEAKER_02]: All we have to do is replace a video card.

197
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:29,866
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just do it.

198
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take us longer than an hour to do it tonight.

199
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will be replaced.

200
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, DarkSakura will not be here next week.

201
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be in Disneyland.

202
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But happy birthday.

203
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy early birthday.

204
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry your pre-birthday show was fucked.

205
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, please.

206
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:49,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Because tonight was so fucked up, why don't you come back next week and fill in for Jamie?

207
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:51,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

208
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys are lucky enough.

209
00:13:53,373 --> 00:14:00,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, maybe if we get enough love mail to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com He's got to read the mailbag.

210
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan has to read the mailbag.

211
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan can come in and BJ me next week.

212
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:04,226
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

213
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:05,167
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

214
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,029
[SPEAKER_00]: See, he can't be me.

215
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,592
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't even contain me.

216
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The great thing is I can wear her underwear.

217
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll grab some, put a pair on each leg.

218
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:16,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my lord.

219
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be awesome.

220
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room is asking... Y'all heard it too.

221
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:21,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.

222
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room is asking what your classic game of the week was.

223
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,316
[SPEAKER_02]: However, let's just roll it over.

224
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:25,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

225
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,839
[SPEAKER_02]: To the next week or... And if Dan comes next week...

226
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan just blew it.

227
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:35,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, where was the classic game of the week this week?

228
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, play me my music.

229
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:38,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

230
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,101
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic game was Tetris.

231
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:46,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know anything about Tetris, then get your head out of your ass.

232
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:47,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The end.

233
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:49,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'll make Dan this offer.

234
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:50,908
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not going to be able to refuse this.

235
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:55,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, if you come to the show next week, you can pick the classic game of the week.

236
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,666
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to pick Lifeforce.

237
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:02,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Lifeforce is, in fact, great.

238
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Lifeforce is amazing, but I think you've picked it before, DarkSakura.

239
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:06,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

240
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,410
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple weeks ago.

241
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:09,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to see.

242
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:12,693
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm talking.

243
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking over.

244
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in Parodius before.

245
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:26,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Show Dan the list and see if there's something he believes needs to be on the list and he can come put it on the list of classic games.

246
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, if you pick something that sucks.

247
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:31,614
[SPEAKER_03]: An omen.

248
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:32,255
[SPEAKER_00]: An omen.

249
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what that is, but I want one.

250
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:42,658
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, because our vows will till death do us part, so that'll be an ice pick to the face.

251
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

252
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: My face or your face?

253
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:45,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Your face.

254
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,821
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, let's just do an ice pick from OLR this week for Dan and Jamie fighting.

255
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,341
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great radio right here.

256
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice pick, yeah.

257
00:15:53,222 --> 00:15:55,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get Nelly to come in here and nag on you for a little while, Loki.

258
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:56,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be awesome.

259
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:57,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a great radio.

260
00:15:58,267 --> 00:15:59,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll call my ex and see what he's up to.

261
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:02,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, everybody, I love my boy.

262
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

263
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I feel bad.

264
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:14,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're always rah, rah, rah about the show and everything and probably disappointed with the way things turned out, but please tell us a little more about this game that you're playing.

265
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:15,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what it's about.

266
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:19,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know I'm not getting bored with it yet because it's in Japanese.

267
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, but it's... What is the name of this again?

268
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:25,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Oboe Muramasa, which is coming out over here.

269
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,940
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Muramasa.

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, back it up.

271
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:27,361
[SPEAKER_03]: This game looks...

272
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing this?

273
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:31,683
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a side-scrolling game.

274
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:43,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing in this, but like when that little thing comes up and I attack ninjas and then my sword breaks, I got switch swords and I attack shit like crazy and go all crazy.

275
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically a button mash because there's one attack button.

276
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do all sorts of cool stuff.

277
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's basically it.

278
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You get huge combos.

279
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:59,395
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like freaking Dynasty Warriors or something.

280
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it by the Odin Sphere guys?

281
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's by the Odin Sphere guys.

282
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:04,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar.

283
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,143
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't play Odin Sphere and you like those kind of fruitish Japanese action-adventure games, it's

284
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:12,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

285
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.

286
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we'll be back like normal next week.

287
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:22,144
[SPEAKER_02]: All we have to do is get a new video card and we'll be better again, hopefully.

288
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: If worse comes to worse, we do have a second computer here in the studio.

289
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,488
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to move the sound card over.

290
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,409
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be new OLR next week.

291
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:31,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, sans Jamie, but hopefully plus Dan.

292
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:35,155
[SPEAKER_02]: If Dan decides he doesn't want to come, we'll figure something out for next week.

293
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:40,040
[SPEAKER_00]: After all this time, I finally got you to use a font other than Times New Roman for show role.

294
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

295
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:43,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it all fell apart, Casino.

296
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:45,666
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

297
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:51,372
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot blame the show's lack of success on the lack of serifs.

298
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:53,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Shush.

299
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:54,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

300
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,375
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

301
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thank you guys so much for supporting us.

302
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Independent Radio.

303
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:03,838
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are great.

304
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the live chatters that have had to suffer through tonight's show.

305
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:11,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize to the podcast listeners.

306
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:15,524
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the downside of live radio is that sometimes your computer will decide to eat your show.

307
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happened tonight.

308
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:17,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Nom nom.

309
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it was delicious.

310
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:19,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Computer.

311
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it gives you diarrhea like eating an entire bag of marshmallow peeps.

312
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:27,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope, computer.

313
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,360
[SPEAKER_00]: That's disgusting!

314
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,042
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a terrible human being.

315
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:35,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

316
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

317
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,885
[SPEAKER_02]: No fancy intro.

318
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:40,465
[SPEAKER_02]: No nothing.

319
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out.

320
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, guys.
