0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	19000	Tonight, April 5th, 2009, Konami prepares to juggle two scary franchises,
19000	22000	most Oblivion DLC gets a price cut,
22000	27000	and have the release dates been leaked for highly anticipated Wii games?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	38000	We are that video game show dedicated to video games,
38000	41000	video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	43000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week,
43000	47000	as well as the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47000	48000	Yo, what up?
48000	50000	Good, how are you?
50000	52000	I survive.
52000	53000	You survive?
53000	54000	I survive.
54000	57000	And the souls of innocent children?
57000	58000	Yeah.
58000	59000	Okay.
59000	61000	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
61000	62000	Hello.
62000	63000	How are you doing, Loki?
63000	64000	I'm doing fine.
64000	65000	Excellent.
65000	68000	And are you trying to Techmaster Justin.tv right now?
68000	74000	Yeah, because Justin.tv is getting that wonderful network error at server error,
74000	77000	which usually means, I just don't want to work today.
77000	84000	So I'm trying to load Flash Media Encoder 3 to see if that works.
84000	87000	Now even though we're not a video show, so we don't usually show video,
87000	92000	but we've kind of found a good niche for Justin.tv is that when we tape live,
92000	94000	because for some reason, some people can't get to all games radio
94000	96000	because it would be behind a firewall or what have you.
96000	97000	So I don't know.
97000	101000	But we do this video of a particular game that we'll be playing,
101000	103000	and tonight's game is what, Loki?
103000	104000	Ninja Blade.
104000	105000	Yeah.
105000	106000	And we do that video and then we do audio of the show.
106000	109000	Now soon, we're going to upgrade and have a little switch box,
109000	112000	and then we can switch back and forth between the camera and the game,
112000	113000	and that would be super.
113000	114000	It would be even cooler.
114000	115000	What would that be?
115000	116000	Picture in picture.
116000	117000	Picture in picture?
117000	118000	I don't know about that.
118000	120000	Now you're talking money.
120000	122000	Switch box, like $19.99.
122000	124000	You'd be surprised.
124000	125000	It's not as hard as you think.
125000	126000	We'll see.
126000	128000	Maybe for the future.
128000	130000	Joining us tonight, we do have a special guest.
130000	134000	I'm actually very excited because I didn't think we were going to have a special guest,
134000	135000	but he just kind of showed up last minute.
135000	136000	Boy, I'm happy he's here.
136000	138000	Say hello to Casper the Gay.
138000	139000	Who is now the doctor.
139000	140000	Oh, the doctor.
140000	141000	That's right.
141000	142000	I forgot.
142000	143000	How long ago did you change your name?
143000	144000	About six months ago.
144000	145000	A long time ago.
145000	146000	All right.
146000	147000	Well, Casper the Gay doctor is here.
147000	148000	Basically, yeah.
148000	149000	All right.
149000	150000	It still works.
150000	151000	How are you doing, Casper?
151000	152000	Awesome.
152000	153000	I'm really good.
153000	154000	I'm helping everyone with their medical problems.
154000	155000	Okay.
155000	156000	Ghost.
156000	157000	Excellent.
157000	159000	You're wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt today.
159000	160000	Yes, and a hat.
160000	161000	See, I got the Hyrule symbol and a hat.
161000	162000	Oh, look at you go.
162000	163000	I'm nerded out today for the show.
163000	164000	You are all.
164000	165000	I'll ask you real quick.
165000	166000	Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.
166000	167000	Yay or nay?
167000	172000	Keep in mind, this is a Zelda fanboy right here.
172000	173000	Absolutely nay.
173000	174000	Absolutely nay.
174000	176120	What are they doing?
176120	179680	It's just a sequel to the freaking game that came out in the DS.
179680	180680	That's all it is in.
180680	183120	Just a gimmick and people think, oh my God, the whole game is going to be like that.
183120	186960	No, they're just showing you what new stuff is going to be there.
186960	187960	Which is a disaster.
187960	188960	All right.
188960	189960	Well, we'll see.
189960	193360	I still like the whole Lynx on a train.
193360	194360	That's what it should have been called.
194360	195360	Listen to Zelda.
195360	197120	Lynx on a train.
197120	201400	What they should have done is every time that he, in the original game, every time that
201400	206400	he got on the boat, they would play the Lonely Island I'm on a Boat song because that would
206400	208840	be awesome.
208840	211440	Because believe me when I say, Lynx effed a mermaid.
211440	217920	I'm on a boat, you guys, in Hyrule, you guys.
217920	218920	I don't know.
218920	220280	Do you think they're going to sell a lot of copies of that?
220280	221280	Probably.
221280	224160	I mean, it's a Zelda title, so I'm sure, but it'll probably be boring.
224160	228520	And if it sells a lot, then, you know, they're going to do a sequel, Spirit Tracks 2, Lynx
228520	237240	on a Boat.
237240	238500	That one I would actually buy.
238500	239500	If it had...
239500	241640	Bustin' Octorocks with Bob Boomerang.
241640	244800	If it had T-Pain as a character only, though.
244800	246320	Oh, hell.
246320	247920	All right.
247920	251080	Let's get to how we always like to start the show off with a little bit of how is your
251080	252080	gaming week?
252080	254320	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
254320	255800	I played stuff.
255800	262240	Actually, I played Pet Society on Facebook, which I've become oddly addicted to.
262240	263920	At least it's not Neopets.
263920	267100	Fuck no.
267100	271800	I played some more Cookie Wama on my phone, and then I didn't actually finish what I was
271800	274680	cooking, so whatever.
274680	276680	Mama fixed it.
276680	281960	And we ordered, we got something from Alpha eBay that arrived in perfect condition for
281960	282960	seven bucks.
282960	283960	The item was fine.
283960	284960	The box was nasty.
284960	288060	It had mildew and shit, but it was brand new.
288060	291320	We have a Capcom fighting stick for the Genesis.
291320	292320	Wow.
292320	293640	Why did you order that?
293640	296440	Because we have several Genes-i.
296440	297440	Geneses.
297440	300720	It was seven bucks, dude.
300720	301720	Why not?
301720	302720	Just impulse buy.
302720	304480	You didn't break it out to try anything with?
304480	306640	You didn't get old school championship edition or anything?
306640	308360	Well, we already have all that.
308360	309360	Alright, just checking.
309360	310360	Alright.
310360	311360	Oh, oh, oh.
311360	313360	And we got the FC Mobile.
313360	314640	Yeah, what is this all about?
314640	315640	The FC Mobile?
315640	316640	It's a handheld NES.
316640	317640	Uh huh.
317640	318640	That's really all it is.
318640	320320	I don't know how long the battery life is.
320320	323120	Dan played it more than me, but we played City and Legend.
323120	326260	The thing's gotta be somewhat big if you actually put an entire cartridge into it.
326260	329240	Is it about the size of an NES cartridge, the system?
329240	334100	About the width plus another two inches, yeah.
334100	337320	So it's not the Atari, like, where it has all the games inside it in the memory.
337320	338320	It's like...
338320	339320	You plug in your cartridge.
339320	340320	It's like a Game Boy, but it plays NES games.
340320	341320	That's amazing.
341320	342320	That's amazing.
342320	343320	It's called the FC Mobile.
343320	344320	They're like 40 bucks.
344320	345320	Wow, that's not bad.
345320	346320	And they're really light.
346320	349260	Is that because of the whole thing, like, the same reason they were selling the third
349260	353760	party NESs at E3 a few years ago, where it's something like the patent on the Nintendo
353760	357160	property expired, because it's been like 20 years?
357160	358640	Something like that, I want to say?
358640	362000	So would that mean that in a couple years we're going to start seeing like Super Nintendos
362000	364080	and Genesis start coming out and all these things?
364080	366640	You don't need to do a Genesis one, Rob.
366640	368800	I'm just saying.
368800	370240	Because of the Nomad.
370240	372840	Oh my god, Dan was hilarious, though.
372840	376720	Well, also the fact Sega repackages their games like 50 times over, but...
376720	380640	Dan was very hilarious about this, and if he hears it, he's going to be a little embarrassed,
380640	382640	but I don't care.
382640	387280	He was like, uh, I wonder if, um, if, you know, they're going to do a Super...
387280	390000	Because it was like you were just saying, if, you know, talked about doing a handheld
390000	391000	Genesis.
391000	394440	I was like, wait, wait, we have that, it's called the Nomad.
394440	399600	So I was like, yes, sweetie, pat, pat, pat.
399600	403400	Question from our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, because we are the show where every gamer
403400	406560	has a voice, so be heard, join our chat live on Sunday night.
406560	410280	Hitstun asks, how is the hardware, is the screen good?
410280	411280	Pretty good.
411280	412280	Pretty good.
412280	413280	I like it.
413280	414280	You don't have dead pixels?
414280	415280	No.
415280	416280	Well, that's good.
416280	417280	All right.
417280	420280	Well, let's move on then, if that's all that Dark Sakura has for her gaming week, we will
420280	421280	talk to Loki.
421280	422280	How was your gaming week?
422280	427360	Uh, first off, I'd like to mention, um, for our live listeners, Justin TV is up, I think.
427360	431800	Um, I don't know if it's working correctly, because I got a lot of errors that popped
431800	437200	up, so I didn't know if, uh, we were good or not, but it looks like we're good.
437200	438200	Okay.
438200	444880	Um, anyways, uh, I played a little bit this week, um, more Grand Theft Auto IV, Lost
444880	449560	in Dam, because we're still doing, you know, multiplayer and that, and, you know, my boss
449560	455640	playing the modded copy is still hilarious, uh, even though he can't win still with it,
455640	460600	but, you know, watching a bus rocket by and making a whoosh sound has got me cracking
460600	462080	up all the time.
462080	470080	Um, and then I played, uh, some WiiWare stuff, I actually played, um, Bit.Trip Beat, which,
470080	474640	it's okay until they thought, hey, it's a great idea, let's have, um, you know, little
474640	479760	blocks that are dark blue against a black background where you can't see them.
479760	485000	That's when I stopped playing the game, and, um, that was it.
485000	488480	Just FYI, Chad is giving us feedback that they can't hear us on Justin.TV right now.
488480	489680	They're not getting audio on there.
489680	491720	They're getting video, but no audio.
491720	492720	Eh, whatever.
492720	497480	You're just gonna have to run them both side by side, I don't know.
497480	498480	We'll figure it out.
498480	499480	We'll figure it out.
499480	501680	Eh, we're gonna, they don't have to do it for now.
501680	511800	Um, anyways, so, what else, let's see here, um, I also played another homebrew game that's
511800	515600	a demo for another game that I'd like not to mention on this show.
515600	521200	Let me just say it sucks as much as you would think it sucks, and the guy who made it is
521200	524800	a douchebag, and I think we know who we're talking about here, but we are not mentioning
524800	530520	his name, because that would be, um, wrong.
530520	537400	And then, um, my wife started playing Excite Truck again, to, in preparation for, uh, Excite
537400	543600	Bots Trick Racing, so, uh, very excited by that, um, she is.
543600	546080	And then, what else did I play?
546080	547560	I think that's pretty much it.
547560	550560	I got a lot of stuff that I was going to play, but I didn't get to play a lot of it.
550560	554680	Oh, I checked out that stupid, I think we talked about it last week, the Kamasutra DS
554680	555680	thing.
555680	556680	It's funny.
556680	557680	That's about it.
557680	560960	And then, um, yeah, that's it.
560960	567200	I have a Rhythm Tengoku, or, Rhythm Heaven, I guess, to try out, and then, uh, more, uh,
567200	569200	Pagel DS, because that's fun.
569200	572760	Uh, it looks like I may have fixed the audio on Justin.tv, because I'm a superstar.
572760	573760	You did?
573760	574760	Yes.
574760	575760	Because it got unplugged?
575760	578320	Uh, yeah, I guess somehow the little grey connectors weren't the ones in the converter
578320	580240	box, the regular ones were.
580240	581240	Oh.
581240	582240	Yeah.
582240	583240	I think we fixed it.
583240	585240	I don't know, nobody in Justin.tv is confirming, so, I don't know, we'll find out in a minute.
585240	586440	Wait, which one did you put in there?
586440	587440	Go look!
587440	588440	Alright.
588440	589440	This is terrible radio.
589440	592680	But we'll have you, uh, if the audio is working, we'll have you walk us through Ninja Blade
592680	593680	in just a minute here.
593680	597800	Uh, let me talk about my gaming week, though, which, um, you know, not too exciting.
597800	600120	Not a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week.
600120	601780	Just kind of revisited a lot of old stuff.
601780	606600	Like, I actually went back to the Wii myself, and went back to Wii Fat, and played that
606600	609720	for a little bit, because, you know, I wanted to see, I know I've been gaining weight since
609720	611960	I was, like, sick last year, and I wanted to see how much.
611960	612960	So now you weigh 20 pounds.
612960	613960	Oh, shut up.
613960	617640	Uh, so I went back and played that for a little bit, and, uh, EO was playing some of the old
617640	621800	school classics on there, like, uh, Legend of the Mystical Ninja and all that stuff.
621800	622800	Cool, cool.
622800	628720	And, um, let's see, went over to PlayStation 3, was playing a little bit more Flower, because
628720	631900	I remember there was that trophy that you get if you revisit it after not playing it
631900	633400	for a week, and it's been, like, a month.
633400	635680	So I wanted to go get that, and, uh, played some of the levels, and was showing it to
635680	638720	some friends, like, you know, look how pretty this game is, because it is a very pretty
638720	639720	game.
639720	643440	And went back to, uh, Home, because if there's one thing that'll always crack people up,
643440	646200	it's looking at the dancing in Home, because you can do the Cabbage Patch, and the Running
646200	649120	Man, and the Robot, and that's always good for a laugh for, like, five minutes.
649120	652080	But I decided while I was there to check out some of these new areas that we'd heard about
652080	655800	at Game Developers Conference, like, they have the new, uh, Guitar Hero Backstage area,
655800	659760	and the Resident Evil 5 backlot, which, you know, they're cute ideas.
659760	665120	Again, I'm having a hard time seeing the big picture of Home, like, all these things they
665120	669640	really wanted to accomplish, like, I just don't see myself logging into Home as, like,
669640	673320	a back-end system, as, like, the thing I'm gonna do when I get home, I'm gonna boot up
673320	677400	my PlayStation and go right into Home, and, you know, launch everything from there, because
677400	679760	it still feels a little clunky to me.
679760	684040	And when I say clunky, I mean the download speeds of the areas as you load them.
684040	687940	You know, yes, I realize you can download in the background and all this, but I kind
687940	689920	of wish the thing was a little more intuitive.
689920	694480	Like, if I was gonna start walking towards a particular map, it would be cool if that
694480	699840	map would start, you know, kind of loading, and it's kind of, a little, it's profiling.
699840	702860	There's a lot of, shut up, there's a lot of polish, I think, that still needs to be done
702860	706760	in Home, but it is getting slightly better and better at the same time.
706760	710540	You know, and just slightly, but I do see improvement in Home, and I think that has
710540	713260	to be acknowledged, because it is a pretty ambitious thing.
713260	717200	So is there a download yet that, you know, gives Home a point?
717200	721480	There are still more minigames popping up, like, the Guitar Hero area has a Simon Says
721480	722480	style minigame.
722480	728280	It's nothing that awesome, it's, you know, free, but it's free, you know, it's, again,
728280	730900	might I remind everybody, you don't pay for Home.
730900	736000	So considering it's a free thing, it's, you know, granted, they microtransactional a lot
736000	737960	of these clubs and things, but I have yet to pay a dollar.
737960	741560	And if you're not in Home, you're homeless.
741560	743760	And nobody wants to be homeless.
743760	746800	ActDeft in chat says, Home is second life without the crazy antics.
746800	749000	GameGuru says, the big picture of Home is make money.
749000	752200	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see where the more nickel and diming comes in a little later,
752200	754200	so, I don't know.
754200	758280	All right, let's see, what else?
758280	764360	In my gaming week, really not a whole lot else that I can think of.
764360	770200	Xbox 360, just playing some of the old arcade titles, Pagle, and so forth, but not a lot
770200	771200	of new stuff.
771200	772400	I did forget one game I played.
772400	773400	What's that?
773400	774960	Which is the game that we're playing right now.
774960	777920	But Ninja Blade, I played during the week, actually, because I haven't really gotten
777920	781480	a chance to play it since I got it.
781480	786080	It's fun, it's actually not too, sorry, if you heard an echo there, it's because I was
786080	788920	checking Justin.tv, where we do have audio, thank God.
788920	791760	Yes, because you unplugged something from your splitter coming out of your computer.
791760	792760	Whatever.
792760	795440	The way you had it hooked up there would have been fine, but they wouldn't have been able
795440	798440	to hear the music that we played during the little break.
798440	799440	All right.
799440	800440	Whatever.
800440	801440	Anyways, give us a quick walkthrough.
801440	806200	I know this is radio, and we'll try to keep the references to the video minimum, but kind
806200	807560	of walk us through this game a little bit.
807560	810840	You were talking about, I know, earlier, before we started, this big epic cut scene at the
810840	811840	beginning of Ninja Blade.
811840	813800	It's so over the top that it's hilarious.
813800	821560	The main character looks like he's the spirit, you know, Sans' crappy movie.
821560	824760	But it's actually very God of War-esque.
824760	831560	You basically kind of go through the game, you have multiple different weapons you can
831560	832560	choose from.
832560	836480	One that's a heavy weapon that's slow, one that's two blades that's fast, and then a
836480	839520	weapon that's just a normal katana that's kind of in between.
839520	842040	And you've got really fast moves and stuff.
842040	846720	There's a lot of these cut scenes that are interactive that they have quick time events
846720	852680	that you do, which I tend to screw up a lot, but that's all right.
852680	853680	The game itself is pretty fun.
853680	854680	So what's the flippin' point?
854680	855680	You say it's kind of God of War-esque?
855680	862680	Yeah, the point is you're this team of ninjas that are descending upon Japan because it's
862680	867760	being overrun by these mutant things that are basically turning people into monsters,
867760	871620	and so you're fighting off these monsters that are attacking Tokyo.
871620	873240	And it's just really over the top.
873240	876340	There's these dragon-looking creatures, like you're skydiving out of a helicopter to begin
876340	881280	with in the very beginning of the game, and you're actually cutting these dragons in half
881280	885920	and just kind of running down the side of buildings as they're collapsing.
885920	889560	Just really crazy shit.
889560	892260	So that's pretty much the game.
892260	893800	But you like these over the top, don't you?
893800	894800	Oh yeah, it's awesome.
894800	895800	It's defense force.
895800	901060	I do, but it's actually, you know, a lot of the games that are put out from software and
901060	904400	stuff like that, they're not that great.
904400	907960	But this is actually pretty good, and it's been pretty entertaining so far.
907960	911440	Even like, it actually looks like it's going to start me from the beginning because apparently
911440	914120	I didn't get far enough to save.
914120	918920	But all the more, you know, exciting, because I'm going to show you that whole skydiving
918920	919920	part.
919920	922840	Okay, this is a little cutscene that shows what happens, and some old man sees like some
922840	924480	chick that's been infected.
924480	926120	We don't need to see that.
926120	927120	Skip that.
927120	928120	Alright.
928120	933640	Alright, let me go to Caspar, sorry, the doctor, and we'll ask the doctor about his gaming
933640	934640	week and we'll come back to you.
934640	937040	Hopefully you're a little bit into Ninja Blade at that point, you can tell us a little bit
937040	938300	about the gameplay.
938300	941720	So, alright, the doctor, how was your gaming week?
941720	943160	It was pretty good.
943160	946640	Kind of like, there's not a lot of new stuff that I'm into at all.
946640	949720	So I just, you know, one of my friends came over and we played a party game, which, on
949720	951600	the Wii, imagine a party game.
951600	954000	Which was actually hilarious because, you know, this was one of my straight friends
954000	956440	and it was Raymond Raving Rabbit's TV edition.
956440	959440	I don't know if you guys have ever played that, but there's lots of crazy minigames.
959440	962120	Yes, we have played that, or at least I watched Loki play it.
962120	964680	The best minigame has to be the dancing.
964680	967960	It's kind of like DDR, where you have to move your whole body.
967960	972640	And watching my friend get into this, like, was hilarious.
972640	975120	It was, we were like cracking up, so.
975120	979080	But I'm with you, I mean, there's not a lot of new stuff on any system that I'm like,
979080	980080	woo!
980080	981840	So just kind of bored with a lot of the games coming out.
981840	985280	Well, I think too, we're in that period where summer's right around the corner and I think
985280	988120	we're going to start seeing a lot more releases in the summer, especially with, you know,
988120	989120	E3 around the corner.
989120	992400	A lot of companies have stuff in their pockets that they're going to be showing at E3.
992400	996080	So there's not a lot to get excited about just yet, except for the fact, you know, if
996080	999440	you're a DS fan, there's the DSi that just came out this week.
999440	1001080	That's really a big, big thing.
1001080	1003520	And you're a total Nintendo fanboy and you're very eh on the DSi.
1003520	1008840	It's, I mean, it's, to use a fancy word, it's, I mean, it's got the superfluous camera.
1008840	1011200	I mean, what does that even do?
1011200	1014200	That's just, that's no point to me.
1014200	1016000	Well, it takes pictures doctor.
1016000	1019600	Ah, I have a camera and I don't need another one.
1019600	1021800	Um, fair enough.
1021800	1028400	All right, well, so, uh, yeah, but we're watching, uh, we're also watching, uh, Loki here.
1028400	1034040	There are monsters and blood and swords and ridiculousness.
1034040	1036400	This looks a little like with that combo meter in the corner.
1036400	1038800	I'm reminded of one of those like dynasty warrior kind of games.
1038800	1043600	Apparently it's also twilight and you sparkle when you go into the darkness.
1043600	1046320	You sparkle!
1046320	1047320	Gold glitter flies everywhere.
1047320	1049800	I actually have not seen the sparkly vampires.
1049800	1050800	Oh, good.
1050800	1052800	You're not missing a mention.
1052800	1053800	Yeah.
1053800	1054800	So are we ready for the commentary?
1054800	1055800	Uh, Loki?
1055800	1060320	Well, I'm just, you know, basically right now they're just kind of teaching you the
1060320	1061320	basics of the game.
1061320	1062320	Oh, you can do jump attacks.
1062320	1065120	Oh, you can do like heavy attacks and yada, yada, yada.
1065120	1066120	Kill these guys.
1066120	1070760	So, um, but it gets ridiculous cause like you're like sensei or whatever is kind of
1070760	1074240	helping you out through the game and he gives you like these different weapons to use.
1074240	1077520	Meanwhile, like he's like flipping around and you know, throwing people like there's
1077520	1082840	a quick time event where I got to jump and I dodged that thing.
1082840	1087000	Well, so now it's all dragon's lair where you just press like a button and hit a button.
1087000	1088000	Interesting.
1088000	1089000	Yeah.
1089000	1092920	There's a lot of interactive cut time or cut scenes and quick time events and lots of stuff
1092920	1096640	that I miss because it's hard to read them on this TV, but that's okay.
1096640	1097640	Interesting.
1097640	1098640	All right.
1098640	1100400	Well, um, and I'm looking at a comment in chat.
1100400	1102720	For some reason, the Justin TV chat is borked tonight.
1102720	1105120	Like I'm not seeing anything in the Justin TV chat, so if you guys are trying to yell
1105120	1106280	at us there, don't even bother.
1106280	1107640	You've got to go to our main room.
1107640	1110640	Uh, but I do see Misty saying woop blood.
1110640	1112240	So very, very bloody game.
1112240	1115420	Can I get a woop blood?
1115420	1119240	That game you were playing the other week on the GameCube mad world, that was way worse
1119240	1120240	on the blood.
1120240	1121240	Yeah.
1121240	1123240	I was, I almost brought that again, but that's all right.
1123240	1124240	I like that.
1124240	1125240	I like this.
1125240	1128960	I like this setup for the show where we have the, uh, game that will be running during
1128960	1131000	the show and then someday we'll have the switcher.
1131000	1134280	So we'll go back to having the camera in studio when something exciting actually happens here
1134280	1139080	in studio, which is not that often, but slowly but surely we're starting to become orange
1139080	1140080	launch television.
1140080	1141080	This is kind of scary.
1141080	1143480	And the, and the interactive cut scenes, you know, that's in other games too.
1143480	1145840	I mean, you got that in a force unleashed.
1145840	1148800	I mean, which kind of makes it more epic because then you're like, you know, if they're really
1148800	1151740	complex battles, you can just press, you know, you have to do the certain combos.
1151740	1154920	So that looks cool.
1154920	1159160	Tiger client chat says basically OLR wants to copy FNG, which is a Friday night gaming
1159160	1161400	Bobby show here on all games radio.
1161400	1164200	No, we don't want to copy Friday night gaming.
1164200	1165200	He did.
1165200	1166200	They did their own thing.
1166200	1168760	They fixed stuff and on air and we don't really get into that kind of stuff.
1168760	1172240	And plus they have that whole gaming center thing where people like that, um, all games
1172240	1175320	interactive used to have back in the day where people could like walk in and out as they
1175320	1176320	want to.
1176320	1179480	And as soon as we taped the show at my house, that's not exactly going to be happening.
1179480	1182120	Although we have had perfect strangers show up here before.
1182120	1184800	I remember Mo, remember we, we didn't even know her before.
1184800	1188680	We sent her an email on YouTube and she came here and sung the show or sung the song on
1188680	1189680	the show.
1189680	1195000	So no, I, we, I mean, we do, you know, we've, we've done the same shit for what, seven years
1195000	1196000	now.
1196000	1198240	We're just slightly evolving a little bit as time goes on.
1198240	1202380	All right, let's get in the entire class as OLR could turn into a gaming center of more
1202380	1203380	guests show up.
1203380	1204380	I hope not again.
1204380	1205380	This is my house.
1205380	1209360	It's like, you know, at 10, 10, 10 30, I want everyone to get out.
1209360	1210360	So I'm another guest.
1210360	1211360	What about me?
1211360	1212360	Yeah.
1212360	1213360	But you're different.
1213360	1214360	Cause I know you.
1214360	1215360	I'm the doctor.
1215360	1216360	I'm different.
1216360	1217360	All right.
1217360	1222000	Uh, housekeeping tonight before we get into the gaming news, we're like 20 minutes into
1222000	1223000	the show.
1223000	1224000	We need to get into gaming news.
1224000	1225720	Uh, just a quick warning, kind of a disclaimer tonight.
1225720	1227440	It was April fool's week this week.
1227440	1231240	And while we think we've done a pretty good job of weeding the actual news stories from
1231240	1234920	the bullshit, there might have been some bullshit that snuck through, but I don't think tonight,
1234920	1237000	I think we got pretty much everything cleared.
1237000	1242160	Um, also, uh, don't forget to follow us on Twitter at username, OLR, or follow us on
1242160	1248720	a Facebook, OL army, or follow us on a live journal, a username, orange lounge.
1248720	1253560	Uh, also want to make a mention of orange lounge radio, March madness.
1253560	1258840	That's the thing that Breslull really heads up, kind of Spears it up for, um, the Saturday
1258840	1260680	night program here under station live.
1260680	1263100	And you know, we kind of give our commentary running on it.
1263100	1265000	It finally ended this last week.
1265000	1268780	Seems like it went on for a while, but considering you had like 64 games that had to get narrowed
1268780	1269780	down to one.
1269780	1272280	Um, there were no ties this year.
1272280	1277120	There was one clear winner in the final, no ties that we have to break.
1277120	1282600	Super Mario brothers three is your, uh, ultimate video game of all time per OLR March madness
1282600	1283600	this year.
1283600	1290160	Um, which once again beat chrono trigger chrono trigger was the runner up for the second year
1290160	1291160	in a row.
1291160	1292160	So there you go.
1292160	1293160	And no, I agree.
1293160	1296640	I mean, when I got that a virtual console was like just as fun as when I played it when
1296640	1297640	I was 10.
1297640	1300640	Um, you know, and I'm sure there's a lot of, especially the chrono trigger fanboys and
1300640	1303080	girls that are like, Oh my God, fuck my life.
1303080	1305920	I can't believe the super Mario brothers three would win.
1305920	1306920	But come on.
1306920	1311640	Super Mario brothers three is Epic in so many ways and really reached a much more broad
1311640	1313720	audience I think than chrono trigger did.
1313720	1314920	Don't get me wrong.
1314920	1316920	I'm not knocking on chrono trigger.
1316920	1318480	It's a fabulous game.
1318480	1320280	Definitely worthy of the runner up prize.
1320280	1325320	However, you can't get mad that a game like super Mario brothers three beat it.
1325320	1329920	If if rock band had ultimately won, I could see you cause that was in the final four.
1329920	1334240	I could see you getting mad if rock band, I would join you video games forever.
1334240	1339040	I would have joined you and I love me rock band, but it's like a, like a fine wine.
1339040	1340040	It needs to age a little bit.
1340040	1344800	It needs to age a little bit before it can truly be the ultimate video game of all time.
1344800	1346200	So all right.
1346200	1347200	Yeah.
1347200	1349660	Necessitic vampire in chat says it's just a poll.
1349660	1350720	It's just a damn poll.
1350720	1351720	Don't cry.
1351720	1352720	Don't cry.
1352720	1353720	All right.
1353720	1354720	Let's get into some gaming news.
1354720	1355720	Here's your game.
1355720	1359040	So you can start us off with some gaming news tonight about Sony.
1359040	1360040	Big press conference, right?
1360040	1363760	Well, it wasn't even a press conference is just announcement basically.
1363760	1370120	And the announcement was, Hey, we're going to drop the price of the PlayStation two.
1370120	1371120	And they did.
1371120	1378240	They dropped it by 30 bucks and now it's 99 99 the magic 99 99 and that is supposed to
1378240	1385320	spike sales and allow the PlayStation brand to grow even more, or it's just another way
1385320	1390200	for them to say, Hey, look, you know, this is look how many people we have on the PlayStation
1390200	1391400	platform.
1391400	1394840	You know, not the PlayStation three because the PlayStation three is in third place as
1394840	1396280	far as the new consoles go.
1396280	1404040	But the PlayStation platform is number one because the PlayStation two is so popular.
1404040	1405040	I don't know.
1405040	1407240	I think it's about time that they dropped the price of it.
1407240	1408480	I mean, it's old.
1408480	1410020	It's over 10 years old now.
1410020	1414600	So not a big surprise.
1414600	1419440	And then also, you know, other than the US getting the price job, of course, we're going
1419440	1423400	to see a price drop in Europe as well to 99 euros.
1423400	1426560	And unfortunately, no price drop for the UK.
1426560	1428200	Sorry.
1428200	1431360	But you know, 99 99.
1431360	1432960	We'll see if this spike sales.
1432960	1435480	Let me just say as far as I'm concerned.
1435480	1438320	I haven't had any other people buy PlayStation two systems.
1438320	1442360	In fact, I haven't had anyone buy a PlayStation two system in a very long time and the price
1442360	1443360	drop.
1443360	1445280	No one cared, at least on my end.
1445280	1450520	But Hey, you know, if your console died, maybe you can save a few bucks and the use prices
1450520	1455280	drop so you can buy use console even cheaper.
1455280	1457320	But I don't think this is going to make any difference night and day.
1457320	1459960	It doesn't make the poor college kids happy.
1459960	1461280	There's a market for this.
1461280	1463040	This is huge news for a lot of people.
1463040	1467240	That's not the core gamers like you and I, you know what I mean?
1467240	1471800	This is the let's get a really cheap video game system to put in the kid's bedroom type
1471800	1472800	of thing.
1472800	1475760	This is not going to be exciting news for the core gamer like you and I, because this
1475760	1477160	we've moved on.
1477160	1480440	We've graduated to 360 PS three, et cetera.
1480440	1482800	Well then they're like, Oh, it can impact sales of the weed.
1482800	1487160	No, I don't think it will because well, because that's the market they're going for.
1487160	1490540	Instead of trying to either trying to make the price of the PlayStation two so lucrative
1490540	1495120	that people will want to buy it instead of the we, because I think, I do think the PS
1495120	1499520	two is competing with the we for that sort of a kid's bedroom toy, you know, and the
1499520	1502080	we is not having the mass shortages that he used to have.
1502080	1506120	That was kind of what was keeping the PlayStation two in some ways of flow was that there was
1506120	1507640	sometimes the we was gone.
1507640	1514080	So people would opt for a PlayStation two, but I, you know, it's, you can't say PlayStation
1514080	1515140	two is a bad system.
1515140	1519160	You can't say there's no games available for the PlayStation two and then it's going to
1519160	1521400	drop the new price and the use price.
1521400	1524000	So, you know, you know, it's interesting that you had to come eventually.
1524000	1526800	I'm kind of curious to see what the sales are going to be on the week in the next few
1526800	1529360	months because no, they have met the demand.
1529360	1533740	And because of that, I've had a lot less people buying them.
1533740	1542800	And you know, this is when it meets as a man is usually a time when the colors come and
1542800	1547860	I wouldn't be surprised if the colors come during E3 because that's when they're going
1547860	1551640	to announce stupid, you know, superfluous shit like this, uh, comments from chat, comments
1551640	1555200	from chat, uh, tiger class says it's amazing that Sony still supports the PS two given
1555200	1556740	its enormous library.
1556740	1557740	You got to give it to them.
1557740	1561040	Unlike Microsoft and Nintendo that screw their fans by discontinuing their consoles.
1561040	1565560	Uh, the fact that Sony still supports the PS two shows that there are a large or still
1565560	1570320	a large contingent of people that still own their PS two is all that from tiger claw because
1570320	1573760	there's no backwards compatibility for the PlayStation two anymore on the PlayStation
1573760	1574760	three.
1574760	1576160	That's exactly what Brad from pod culture says.
1576160	1579680	Yeah, folks will pick one up, especially if your PS three is not backwards compatible
1579680	1582880	and your old chunky PS two is acting odd.
1582880	1587480	Um, also I want to say for Misty, kind of a dissenting voice here, it annoys me because
1587480	1593400	I just replaced my PS two since the beginning of the year and now it dropped to $99 slanted
1593400	1597320	and then face and Nintendo still will repair the old systems.
1597320	1601620	So really all of them, um, the last time I checked on their website, there was still
1601620	1605000	a repair for the NES, but there was no price listed.
1605000	1608040	It was, uh, I bet you basically had to call them and then they would probably drop the
1608040	1609040	bomb.
1609040	1611440	Yeah, that's not going to be pretty.
1611440	1612440	All right.
1612440	1616800	Well, Hey, I'm going over to the PSP because obviously the DSI has been much in the limelight
1616800	1618600	this week with his launch and everything.
1618600	1622720	But one of the highly anticipated games for the PSP, Elise for me, and probably most of
1622720	1626700	us here at music game loving orange launch radio, rock band unplugged.
1626700	1629920	And the reason why of course that we're all salivating over this game is that it's supposed
1629920	1633840	to be a lot like amplitude and frequency, uh, rock band unplugged.
1633840	1638080	The box art has leaked out to the internet and apparently it reveals a partial track
1638080	1639080	list.
1639080	1640560	However, do take this with a tiny grain of salt.
1640560	1644160	This news came out not March 31st, which, you know, in a certain time zone might've
1644160	1648640	been April 1st, but I could see this happening because this, this is legit.
1648640	1649640	It's very legit.
1649640	1652320	Cause a lot of these songs crossover into the actual rock band games.
1652320	1653320	I could see this.
1653320	1657680	Um, for example, the way for me to check, well, for example, uh, let's see, we have
1657680	1658680	blink one 82.
1658680	1659680	What's my age again?
1659680	1664320	Really idle white wedding Boston, more than a feeling through fighters ever long.
1664320	1665320	That game is definitely wrong.
1665320	1669760	That's not as in rock band, modest mouse float on also Jackson five ABC.
1669760	1671400	Now that I don't recall being in rock band.
1671400	1676400	So there are some new tracks, uh, the police message in a bottle, the who pinball wizard,
1676400	1678840	et cetera, et cetera.
1678840	1683280	Now also the box apparently also confirms that there will be download content.
1683280	1685000	There's going to be a music store.
1685000	1689840	Uh, unfortunately there will be no multiplayer at all in the game.
1689840	1694080	They had, um, also some screenshots from it in, on the back of the box as well.
1694080	1697880	Uh, yeah, I remember seeing the screenshots elsewhere on the internet and it, uh, definitely
1697880	1702840	looks like it's going to be an amplitude, you know, frequency type of game, which, Hey,
1702840	1705800	fine by me, you know, and I was just saying on Bobby show earlier, you know, Bobby black
1705800	1709920	Wolf, the guy who does the show, um, before us here on all games radio on Sunday nights,
1709920	1714960	um, was talking about the whole, he was, he was talking about the DS and DSI.
1714960	1720040	And the, how guitar hero on tour, one of the biggest selling third party DS games is kind
1720040	1723440	of screwed by the DSI because the game boy advanced slots now really.
1723440	1726600	And I was kinda, you know, we joked when we called on the show like, well, who, who the
1726600	1728760	fuck should be playing guitar here on the DS anyway?
1728760	1732440	You know, if they're trying to like emulate the whole, it doesn't matter the actual guitar
1732440	1734280	hero, it doesn't matter anyways.
1734280	1738760	It's a new system on top of the DS are still selling four colors of the DS and there's
1738760	1742240	still that many, you know, millions of, you know, DS is out there.
1742240	1744000	They're not going to suffer one bit.
1744000	1745480	But see, I give that a hard time yet.
1745480	1748960	I allow rock band because this whole rock band on tour, because they're making a different
1748960	1753160	game out of it that, you know, is really a throwback to something a lot of people have
1753160	1754160	been selling.
1754160	1755160	It doesn't have any peripherals.
1755160	1756360	That too.
1756360	1757360	They could easily too.
1757360	1762680	I wouldn't be surprised if they port this to the PlayStation two without, without the
1762680	1764760	salt, you know, song store and stuff like that.
1764760	1765760	Who knows?
1765760	1766760	We'll see.
1766760	1767760	All right.
1767760	1772520	Well, anyhow, um, we will, uh, continue to watch rock band unplugged and let you know
1772520	1773520	more on it.
1773520	1776840	And as soon as we know, which I'm sure will be E3, I'm sure that game is going to be playable
1776840	1777840	on the show floor.
1777840	1780160	And I know that will be one of the first things I check out.
1780160	1781160	What about you?
1781160	1782160	Dark soccer.
1782160	1783160	You interested in rock band unplugged?
1783160	1788000	Um, well, not particularly, I thought you were being amplitude frequency type fan.
1788000	1793320	I, I like it, but I'm, there's other things you're more interested in motion sick.
1793320	1794320	Oh yeah.
1794320	1795320	I can see that.
1795320	1802280	Well, um, there is going to be a new Jack and Dexter game for the PSP and the PS two.
1802280	1803280	Why?
1803280	1809160	I don't know, but there is, and it's going to basically pick up from where the, the last
1809160	1811440	uh, game left off.
1811440	1817760	And so you are in the last frontier and you're going to help someone become a sage Kira,
1817760	1819560	I think is the name.
1819560	1828400	And uh, so it's a adventure up in the mountains or in the air or with pirates of the sky.
1828400	1832240	Well, you know, this series obviously still has its fans.
1832240	1836000	And I think this goes right in line with the whole PlayStation two price drop.
1836000	1840560	It's interesting to see, wow, they are still making freaking games for the PlayStation
1840560	1845040	two, but you know, and this isn't like a D list title.
1845040	1847000	This is at least the B list.
1847000	1854760	Well, um, it actually is, uh, done by, uh, being developed by a high impact games.
1854760	1858040	So they're the ones that did size matters.
1858040	1865720	And uh, it's looks like it's going to be fairly less depressing than, you know, the second
1865720	1866720	one was.
1866720	1867720	All right.
1867720	1870960	I had any interest in Jack and Dexter for you.
1870960	1872920	No, I haven't been interested in that ever.
1872920	1875360	It's more of a kid's franchise, right?
1875360	1876360	Yeah.
1876360	1880120	But I know we have listeners that are fans and they're probably screaming at us right
1880120	1881120	now.
1881120	1882120	It's not necessarily a kid's franchise.
1882120	1884520	And I'm not really saying that it's just like ratchet and clank.
1884520	1888440	I tried to get in the ratchet and clank cause I had never really been a fan of it on the
1888440	1892040	PlayStation two with the PlayStation three version tools of destruction.
1892040	1897160	I played it for a little bit and then I ended up selling it to my friend cause I just couldn't
1897160	1898160	do it.
1898160	1900600	It just, it not my thing, just not very entertaining.
1900600	1904880	I was like into like Spyro and stuff for a little bit and my sister really went gung
1904880	1905880	ho with that.
1905880	1912080	But, um, yeah, grand theft auto that steals away all my time, unfortunately.
1912080	1919040	Anyways, some other games though that are going to be coming out that are kind of neat.
1919040	1924280	Tales of Vesperia, coming in the PS3.
1924280	1928640	And this is not really a big surprise since, you know, Tales of Vesperia came out on the
1928640	1929640	360.
1929640	1932040	This is kind of a similar thing with Eternal Sonata.
1932040	1938800	Now of course after the wait, not only do you get a game that is on par with the 360
1938800	1942440	version but they've also added in new stuff.
1942440	1947280	Including some new characters you'll get to play as that were kind of hinted in the Xbox
1947280	1952680	360 version but now they are playable, which is kind of cool.
1952680	1958420	And another game they also announced Tales of Versus, which is going to be a PSP title
1958420	1963000	and it's kind of like the Tales version of Dissidia.
1963000	1964000	Which is neat.
1964000	1968080	So you got all the Tales characters fighting each other.
1968080	1970160	It's still part of the Tales series, yeah.
1970160	1973040	But um, you know, a little bit different.
1973040	1976200	But uh, they're putting out a lot of Tales games, that's for sure.
1976200	1978640	Which is definitely crazy in Japan, right?
1978640	1981480	Didn't the Xbox 360 get a huge boost from Vesperia?
1981480	1982480	Yeah, yeah.
1982480	1985360	That and Internal Sonata I think did pretty good.
1985360	1991280	But I don't know, I never really noticed the Tales franchise that much.
1991280	1994140	I haven't really played any of them, so I kind of feel bad in that sense.
1994140	1996960	But I don't want to play any of them right now.
1996960	2001680	Well, Tales for Fantasia on Game Boy Advance is actually pretty good.
2001680	2004200	Like if you're into old school, like 16-bit.
2004200	2007840	Oh yeah, Tales definitely has a very cult following to it.
2007840	2009920	You know, there's lots of fans of this series.
2009920	2014200	But you know, I'm not surprised this game is showing up on Playstation 3.
2014200	2019480	It is a little bit late to the party, but I think over in Japan it's going to mean more
2019480	2020640	than it will here.
2020640	2024580	Because in Japan, the Playstation 3 has penetrated a bigger slice of the market.
2024580	2027120	So I think, you know, it's going to be a bigger deal over there.
2027120	2033100	I would say put it out this year if you can, because come the end of this year and possibly
2033100	2036680	next spring Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out and no one's going to care about
2036680	2040280	anything else as far as RPGs go.
2040280	2043040	And whether it's good or bad, I mean, just no one's going to care.
2043040	2048840	Speaking of which, remember, we're only like a couple weeks away, and I'll be getting my
2048840	2049840	copy of the demo.
2049840	2050840	Ooh, that's right.
2050840	2053040	And we'll definitely be doing that on the JT.
2053040	2054040	Definitely we'll be doing that.
2054040	2055040	We won't be the first, though.
2055040	2056040	There's going to be tons of people.
2056040	2057040	Oh, yeah.
2057040	2058040	Absolutely.
2058040	2060840	But we will definitely check it out on Sunday in case you forget to check earlier in the
2060840	2061840	week.
2061840	2062840	Okay.
2062840	2065960	So I want to talk about Playstation as well, which got a firmware update this week.
2065960	2066960	You know, they're on Playstation.
2066960	2068880	They do pretty regular firmware updates over there.
2068880	2074040	One of the big features now, in-game text chat, 16 people at a time, is one of the big
2074040	2076680	features of the new firmware, which was released this week.
2076680	2082040	Also, you can send, apparently, files to your friends as big as 3 megabytes now.
2082040	2086760	And you can sort friends in your friends list now alphabetically or by online status and
2086760	2090440	last login time, so you can kind of have some, which is good, because it seemed like there
2090440	2093120	was no rhyme or reason to the friends list sorting before, so that was a feature that
2093120	2094120	was needed.
2094120	2099680	Also, there's some other features, a dynamic normalizer that will prevent sudden increases
2099680	2101480	in volume between music tracks.
2101480	2105360	For those games that don't know how to normalize their volume, that's pretty good.
2105360	2107560	If you don't have a sound system, it'll do that as well.
2107560	2113400	Also, the ability to cut and paste text, which I guess if you're a huge chatterer in home
2113400	2115520	might be useful or something.
2115520	2119760	I can't think of a lot of chatty things I do on the Playstation 3, but I guess cut and
2119760	2120760	paste is needed.
2120760	2125080	And now the dawn of the age of text spamming in home.
2125080	2126080	That's true.
2126080	2130440	I hope they figured out a way to curb that in home, but, you know, cut and paste is also
2130440	2131440	a big, big...
2131440	2134680	You know, you might be laughing going, well, cut and paste shouldn't be a big fucking deal.
2134680	2139040	Look at all the iPhone users that are, like, rejoicing that cut and paste is finally coming
2139040	2140040	to iPhone.
2140040	2141720	Oh, hell yes.
2141720	2144840	That's a big deal over there, so I can see that.
2144840	2147920	So there you go, Playstation 3 firmware out now.
2147920	2151920	I actually upgraded earlier today before I went into home, but unfortunately those really
2151920	2154260	aren't a lot of features I use very often, except the friends list.
2154260	2156360	That will probably be the biggest thing for me.
2156360	2161800	Well, there's a particular series that I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
2161800	2163040	I won't see any of it.
2163040	2166440	I hate this whole series of movies.
2166440	2171600	The concept of it is disgusting and just repugnant to me.
2171600	2174560	What movie series is that, Rob?
2174560	2177320	Um, I would have to say...
2177320	2178320	Too slow, Saw.
2178320	2179320	Pokemon.
2179320	2180320	Oh.
2180320	2181800	I really, really hate Saw.
2181800	2182800	Pokemon in Saw?
2182800	2183800	No.
2183800	2188560	Would you watch that if the Pokemon starred in the next Saw movie?
2188560	2189560	Fuck no.
2189560	2190560	Pikachu!
2190560	2191560	Pikachu!
2191560	2192560	Pikachu!
2192560	2193560	Pikachu!
2193560	2194560	Pikachu!
2194560	2195560	Pikachu!
2195560	2199160	What do we do with Pikachu's armor?
2199160	2203620	As I was saying, Konami has the Saw license.
2203620	2209000	They pried it out of the dead fingers of Brasher Entertainment.
2209000	2210480	Thank God.
2210480	2213120	Because then it might actually be a decent game.
2213120	2220720	But now they were actually drawing comparisons between that and Silent Hill, which I thought
2220720	2229240	was more funny um more funny funnier there's my grammar today um the marketer David Daniels
2229240	2235200	was telling what sorry I'm laughing at the chat room hold on we got we got DJ Tyrant
2235200	2241840	hello Ash I'd like to play a battle with you and gold anthro says gotta saw them all
2241840	2254280	dear chat room they make Ritalin for a reason sorry dark soccer okay um but the marketer
2254280	2264040	David Daniels is quoted saying that Silent Hill is more about psychological terror but
2264040	2268120	soft for us is more about graphic intense horror that overwhelms you we want players
2268120	2273160	to turn away from the screen for just a moment because of the visual intensity or because
2273160	2277640	the graphics really really suck in other words it's going to be blood pornography these games
2277640	2281200	are going to be just that they're already preparing us for the fact that these games
2281200	2288000	are going to be blood pornography wait well it's supposed to be out in the fall it actually
2288000	2293240	has Tobin Bell doing the voice of jigsaw he does have a sexy voice I'll put it that way
2293240	2298600	it's a very sexy scary voice and considering you know Vincent Price is like long dead and
2298600	2304480	gone and there will never be anyone as wonderful as Vincent Price um you know Tobin Bell's
2304480	2310680	got a pretty scary voice for this generation well it's going to be out on PC, Xbox 360
2310680	2317400	and PS3 and guess who's not going to buy it me I'm not even going to let it come into
2317400	2322160	my house aren't you worried this might have an impact on the Silent Hill series I hope
2322160	2326460	not, better fucking not I do like that he has the distinction it's going to get worse
2326460	2331760	Silent well I like that they've made the clear distinction Silent Hill psychological thriller
2331760	2336200	because when I think psychological thriller I think of great scary movies like The Silence
2336200	2341640	of the Lambs these types of like classic psychological thrillers that's more in the suspense sense
2341640	2345380	right and but that's kind of what Silent Hill is right more of like a suspense mind fuck
2345380	2351640	kind of movie but it has the gross it has the gore attached to it it has but it's not
2351640	2357640	The gore is not the focus. The gore is part of driving in the psychological part.
2357640	2361640	You are walking through a personal nightmare for your character.
2361640	2366640	In essence, that is Silent Hill. You are walking through their nightmare.
2366640	2371640	You know, everything in the game has some aspect of their personality or their guilt
2371640	2374640	or something having to do with them that's going back to that person.
2374640	2378640	It requires more thought than just splattering blood everywhere.
2378640	2381640	But you know there are going to be people that are all about the blood orgy of Saw.
2381640	2383640	It will sell. It will sell.
2383640	2384640	It'll sell, but...
2384640	2389640	Which, Loki, you're a big blood fan. Are you going to be purchasing the blood orgy that is Saw?
2389640	2391640	No, because it's not going to be any good.
2391640	2393640	I'm sorry, even if...
2393640	2397640	Now, what they should have called it is blood orgy of the game, but you know...
2397640	2400640	I'd buy a game called blood orgy.
2400640	2406640	No, but seriously though, I'm sorry, but not to knock Konami or anything.
2406640	2409640	It's not going to be any good because it's made by Konami.
2409640	2411640	I don't want to knock them or anything, but it's...
2411640	2413640	God damn, your game is going to suck.
2413640	2414640	I'm sorry.
2414640	2417640	Hold on, Loki. To be fair, none of you have touched the game.
2417640	2421640	And you're basing your review of the game off the movie, which isn't completely fair.
2421640	2425640	No, I'm basing my review off of the screenshot that I saw, okay?
2425640	2430640	And also the fact that Saw cannot be made into a game very well.
2430640	2433640	Because how are you going to do that?
2433640	2436640	No, I'm sorry. Konami's not clever enough to figure that out.
2436640	2437640	Point and click.
2437640	2445640	How about I have read enough about Saw to know that I have zero interest in playing the game or seeing the movies or anything remotely related to it.
2445640	2447640	And I don't even watch the damn trailers.
2447640	2449640	Then again, I don't watch TV.
2449640	2454640	But still, I have zero interest in nothing but loathing for the franchise.
2454640	2459640	Now, I noticed the consensus amongst chat, and I'm not going to read a lot of the individual quotes from chat here.
2459640	2463640	Because it seems like there's a consensus that Saw 1, decent.
2463640	2465640	The rest, blood orgy.
2465640	2467640	Stupid porn movies.
2467640	2469640	Blood porn.
2469640	2471640	The Leo Shannon chat, I will read this comment.
2471640	2475640	Blood orgy and titties would be the best selling game ever.
2475640	2478640	It just might. It just might.
2478640	2482640	You know, it could be decent, but it's not going to be good.
2482640	2484640	And they've got a lot of things going against them.
2484640	2487640	Just because, one, it's a movie tie-in.
2487640	2497640	And two, really, when is the last standout awesome game other than Metal Gear Solid 4 that's come out from Konami in the recent years?
2497640	2503640	Oh, I can't think of one! That's why!
2503640	2508640	And I'm sorry, I don't all of a sudden see them turning themselves around any time soon.
2508640	2511640	And, I don't know.
2511640	2514640	Low expectations, let's put it that way.
2514640	2520640	If it comes out and it's awesome, good, then I'll eat my words, but I don't think I'll have to do that.
2520640	2522640	And no, I'm not making a bet on this game.
2522640	2528640	Agdef is telling me to give the first movie a try, but I'm going to go ahead and explain this right now.
2528640	2535640	The concept of that kind of thing, about putting people in that position, disgusts me.
2535640	2538640	Like you have no idea how much it disgusts me.
2538640	2545640	It's so reprehensible of an idea that thinking about it makes me want to vomit.
2545640	2547640	So no, I won't see it.
2547640	2551640	I did see the first Saw movie and it's one of those things where it's like, it's not that great.
2551640	2553640	You can live your life and not see it.
2553640	2558640	Like, there's a hundred other movies I would say a person has to see before they see Saw.
2558640	2560640	See Saw.
2560640	2562640	Saw!
2562640	2563640	Oh god, you're all done.
2563640	2565640	And that's the thing, I'm a pretty big fan of the Saw movies.
2565640	2569640	Granted, they've kind of gone downhill because once you kill off the main bad guy...
2569640	2572640	Oops, spoiler.
2572640	2574640	It's been like movies since then.
2574640	2581640	But once you kill off the main bad guy, it's kind of hard to, I don't know, continue the series without a new bad person.
2581640	2583640	And they've kind of done...
2583640	2586640	They've made it as confusing as possible unless you've watched the other movies.
2586640	2589640	And you're just like, oh, that's that dude from that other movie.
2589640	2591640	And, wait, what?
2591640	2594640	But next Silent Hill game, I am so there.
2594640	2596640	I bought Homecoming. It was fun. Good game.
2596640	2598640	I need to actually go back and beat it.
2598640	2600640	There's a lot of games that came out around the same time.
2600640	2603640	We were watching Annie and Jim play Homecoming this week.
2603640	2605640	It's okay. Also watched Siren.
2605640	2607640	And that was... I don't know.
2607640	2611640	But I just saw the movie...
2611640	2614640	I just don't see how you can make this into a game.
2614640	2616640	I'm sorry.
2616640	2618640	What's it gonna be?
2618640	2621640	I mean, it's just like an adventure game that doesn't make any sense.
2621640	2622640	It's gonna sell.
2622640	2625640	I would bet money this Saw game's gonna sell even though we all hate it.
2625640	2627640	Because there's an audience out there for it. There really is.
2627640	2629640	Well, I don't think there will.
2629640	2631640	There will be a Saw 2 video game.
2631640	2633640	It'll probably come out in October.
2633640	2636640	And it's gonna be coming out at the same time as a bunch of other bigger games.
2636640	2638640	And I'm sorry.
2638640	2641640	When this comes out, there will be people that pick it up because it's Saw.
2641640	2647640	But think of the last really good movie title that's come out on consoles.
2647640	2650640	That's right. Because most of them aren't that good.
2650640	2654640	And even Wanted, which I thought was gonna be awesome, wasn't that good.
2654640	2657640	And it's just not gonna happen.
2657640	2659640	It's not gonna be all of a sudden amazing.
2659640	2660640	They're not gonna break the mold.
2660640	2662640	It's just not gonna work.
2662640	2664640	Okay, I want to get over this Saw topic.
2664640	2666640	But I do want to say one other comment here.
2666640	2668640	It's in support, basically, of what DarkSakura is saying.
2668640	2670640	TigerKlon's chat says,
2670640	2672640	I feel the same way about movies that glamorize the gore.
2672640	2674640	I don't get why people are so turned on by it.
2674640	2676640	That I find deeply disturbing.
2676640	2678640	One final thought I want to put out there is
2678640	2686640	this is just gonna give ammunition to those people that say that video games are, you know, poisoning the minds of people everywhere.
2686640	2689640	And those people that say, you know, Manhunt 2 is corrupting America,
2689640	2692640	and Grand Theft Auto is poisoning our children, et cetera, et cetera.
2692640	2699640	These Saw games, especially if people's predictions that you are going to be the puppet in these games is correct.
2699640	2702640	If you're the little puppet creature, that'd be awesome.
2702640	2703640	I don't know.
2703640	2711640	I have a bad feeling that this game is going to be one of those things that certain lawyers who I wish would stay out of the goddamn news
2711640	2714640	are going to use to propel their case into the next decade.
2714640	2717640	They should be more offended by the movies because the movies are actually graphic and stuff.
2717640	2722640	Whereas this game, I don't think enough people are going to buy it to even, you know, care that it's violent.
2722640	2727640	I will go ahead and say, by the way, it is not the gore that bothers me.
2727640	2730640	It is the concept of what the people in the movie...
2730640	2732640	Torture porn. Torture porn bothers you.
2732640	2738640	That's it. I do not, I can't stand torture of people who really haven't done anything wrong.
2738640	2740640	Alright. Let's move on.
2740640	2742640	I'm so done with Saw.
2742640	2744640	But the people have done stuff that's wrong.
2744640	2746640	That's the whole point of why they're being tortured.
2746640	2747640	Well, you know what I mean.
2747640	2748640	Whatever.
2748640	2753640	Anyways, something that's not wrong in any way whatsoever would be Saints Row 2.
2753640	2759640	And there's brand new download content coming out for it on April 16th, which makes me pretty excited.
2759640	2762640	Because now I have a new reason to play that game again.
2762640	2769640	The new download content will be called Ultor Exposed, which makes sense because there's areas of the map that you can't conquer yet.
2769640	2772640	And they're all owned by Ultor.
2772640	2776640	And it will give you a few new things, including a co-op meta game.
2776640	2781640	You'll be able to use porn star Tara Patrick as one of your homies.
2781640	2790640	Okay. And new vehicles, new weapons, and some new multiplayer maps are also coming out along with that.
2790640	2797640	It's going to be available for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.
2797640	2801640	And I look forward to checking that out.
2801640	2804640	Alrighty. Let's move on to some release dates.
2804640	2807640	And let's travel the world and check out what's coming out in some other countries this week.
2807640	2812640	And I'm looking over at Japan and in the next gen systems, there's really not a whole lot.
2812640	2818640	You get a price reduction on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 on Playstation 3.
2818640	2820640	But not a lot of new stuff.
2820640	2824640	And I'm wondering if that's because you got the whole Advent Children coming out next week over in Japan.
2824640	2825640	I don't know.
2825640	2830640	On the Nintendo Wii, you do have Oboro Muramasa comes out this week.
2830640	2834640	And I'm not sure what this game really is, but it does look kind of stylized.
2834640	2835640	It is awesome.
2835640	2838640	This game is by the developers of Odin Sphere.
2838640	2840640	It's all hand drawn.
2840640	2842640	It's very stylized.
2842640	2843640	This looks kind of neat actually.
2843640	2845640	Like a side scroll action game.
2845640	2847640	It's coming out in June here in the US.
2847640	2850640	It's going to be called Muramasa Demon Blade.
2850640	2853640	Yeah, this game looks cool.
2853640	2856640	So if you're in Japan, you get an extra sneak peek at this this week.
2856640	2858640	Maybe we'll have a sneak peek of it next week. Who knows?
2858640	2859640	That would be awesome actually.
2859640	2862640	This game, I love the art in this. This looks really cool.
2862640	2864640	And this is a Wii game.
2864640	2866640	What's that, doctor?
2866640	2869640	I was going to say, there's videos of it on YouTube and whatnot.
2869640	2870640	And the animation is pretty high quality.
2870640	2872640	It looks really good.
2872640	2873640	Well, there you go.
2873640	2875640	At least there's that big title coming out.
2875640	2877640	Maybe people are afraid of that.
2877640	2878640	I don't know.
2878640	2881640	On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart 2.
2881640	2885640	Full title is Sugoi Arcana Heart 2.
2885640	2888640	Arcana Heart, that is the female chick fighter game, is it not?
2888640	2890640	Where it's all women, I guess.
2890640	2891640	They got a sequel.
2891640	2894640	So I'm assuming it's a matter of time before that comes out over here.
2894640	2897640	It actually looks pretty good on, is that just on PlayStation 2?
2897640	2898640	That is a PlayStation 2 game.
2898640	2900640	They have some really good captures.
2900640	2903640	Those are not bad graphics for PlayStation 2.
2903640	2906640	Again, showing that they're still cranking it out on the PlayStation 2.
2906640	2909640	Looking on the Nintendo DS, not a whole lot of stuff.
2909640	2912640	Rhythm to Run Run Run is a game coming out,
2912640	2915640	as well as another cooking game called Happy Cooking.
2915640	2919640	A party stylized concept game on the DS? What?
2919640	2924640	And then lastly in Japan, looking at the Sony PlayStation Portable.
2924640	2929640	I don't believe I see a whole lot on the PSP.
2929640	2931640	Where is my list here?
2931640	2933640	We do have another Evangelion game.
2933640	2936640	It's a Neon Genesis Evangelion,
2936640	2940640	Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Tokubetsu Hen Portable.
2940640	2941640	So you know what that means.
2941640	2944640	Dating Evangelion Sim on the PSP again.
2944640	2946640	Enjoy that.
2946640	2950640	Oh, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes is a big title coming out on the PSP.
2950640	2955640	I think that one is something you get a little more excited about.
2955640	2958640	Again, looks like this game's got some pretty sweet graphics too.
2958640	2960640	That's another Dynasty Warriors game?
2960640	2962640	It looks kind of, a little bit.
2962640	2964640	I mean, there's like zero English in this game whatsoever,
2964640	2966640	so looking at the screenshots I can't tell.
2966640	2970640	It's probably Sengoku Basara, that's, oh, I can't...
2970640	2972640	Battle Heroes is the subtitle.
2972640	2975640	I'm thinking what it's called over here.
2975640	2976640	They've only released one game.
2976640	2980640	I actually have that for the Wii and I haven't actually played it yet.
2980640	2982640	It's only in Japan.
2982640	2984640	I have this special edition, it's like a two disc game,
2984640	2986640	but it has the first and second one.
2986640	2990640	It was localized over here by Capcom and I can't remember,
2990640	2993640	it's like, it's going to bug me now.
2993640	2994640	It's comments from Chatroom.
2994640	2995640	Goldanthro says,
2995640	2999640	Sky wants a guy version game that's Arcana Heart style.
2999640	3002640	To be fair, that's most other fighting games.
3002640	3003640	To be fair.
3003640	3005640	Leo Shen says, Arcana Heart 2.
3005640	3006640	Get it.
3006640	3011640	They have a freaking loli fighter modeled after Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.
3011640	3012640	There's no place like home.
3012640	3013640	There's no place like home.
3013640	3014640	Punch.
3014640	3017640	Does she like, does she roundhouse kick people with her ruby slippers?
3017640	3018640	I guess so.
3018640	3019640	Let's see.
3019640	3020640	It's called Devil Kings over here.
3020640	3021640	That's what it was.
3021640	3022640	There you go.
3022640	3023640	Devil something.
3023640	3025640	Alright, let's move on to Europe.
3025640	3026640	Dark Sakura.
3026640	3027640	Europe release dates.
3027640	3029640	There's stuff.
3029640	3035640	Well, as far as our European release dates, just give me just a second.
3035640	3036640	It was thinking about it.
3036640	3037640	My apologies.
3037640	3038640	Modern technology.
3038640	3042640	On the seventh, we have Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.
3042640	3044640	Logs Lost Challenges.
3044640	3046640	We have Flock on PC.
3046640	3051640	The ninth, we have Elven Legacy and Helldorado.
3051640	3052640	Helldorado?
3052640	3053640	Okay.
3053640	3055640	I'm not even going to ask.
3055640	3058640	On the tenth, we have The Godfather 2.
3058640	3060640	And that's it.
3060640	3062640	Cool.
3062640	3065640	Over here, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.
3065640	3067640	Of course, this is all coming out today.
3067640	3068640	Of course, the DSi systems.
3068640	3072640	I mean, a lot of people knew that was coming out, both in blue and black.
3072640	3077640	Rhythm Heaven to kind of coincide with the DSi, but not necessarily a DSi game.
3077640	3079640	Coming out on the DS.
3079640	3083640	We've got Gravity coming out on the DS and on the Wii.
3083640	3087640	Kind of a fun little incredible machine type of game.
3087640	3091640	We've got Air Conflicts Aces of World War II coming to the PSP.
3091640	3095640	Because I don't think the PSP's had a World War II flight sim game yet.
3095640	3096640	So that's kind of cool.
3096640	3098640	The Chronicles of Riddick Dark Athena.
3098640	3100640	And it was about time they got one.
3100640	3101640	It was about time.
3101640	3104640	Every system needs their World War II flight sim fighting game.
3104640	3105640	Yes.
3105640	3106640	Yes.
3106640	3107640	Definitely.
3107640	3113640	And The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 this week.
3113640	3123640	Hannah Montana the movie, the game everyone's been waiting for coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.
3123640	3124640	Yay!
3124640	3125640	Yes, awesome.
3125640	3132640	And then if you're not interested in Hannah Montana, you might be interested in Godfather 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
3132640	3135640	Those two, you'd be surprised how the fans...
3135640	3141640	If you're interested in both of those games, I think something might be wrong.
3141640	3144640	I think most people would be interested in one or the other.
3144640	3151640	I don't really see somebody saying, yeah GameStop employee, I'm here to pick up my copy of Godfather 2 and Miley Cyrus.
3151640	3153640	It's for my daughter.
3153640	3159640	Miley Cyrus is going to get an offer that she can't refuse.
3159640	3162640	Because Miley Cyrus stars in The Godfather 4.
3162640	3164640	Nobody knows this.
3164640	3165640	Her and Sophia Copeland.
3165640	3170640	Where the Godfather becomes hip and sassy.
3170640	3174640	Alright.
3174640	3176640	Some actual serious...
3176640	3179640	Where RuPaul is the Godfather.
3179640	3182640	I'm going to make you offer You Camera Feels, okay?
3182640	3184640	Girl, you better work.
3184640	3193640	And then on Playstation 2 and PSP this week, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus coming out if you're looking for a good 2D fighting game.
3193640	3196640	On PC, DCS Black Shark.
3196640	3199640	Looks like some flight sim game.
3199640	3204640	Deer Drive is getting a re-release from Zoo Games.
3204640	3207640	It's a game where you drive your jeep and kill deer.
3207640	3211640	Just like, you know, that brings me back to, was it Cruisin' USA?
3211640	3214640	Hit the deer and they explode.
3214640	3220640	The game that we're featuring tonight actually on Justin TV, Ninja Blade will be making its way out this week if you want to own your own copy.
3220640	3223640	I actually recommend it, it's pretty fun.
3223640	3227640	And then, let's see here, Guilty Gear, I mentioned that.
3227640	3232640	Oh, and this is awesome on PC, apparently if you like crappy games or you're a girl.
3232640	3242640	OMG High School Triple Play Pack featuring, I believe it's like the Cheetah Girls, Mean Girls, and...
3242640	3246640	Oh, I'm sorry, Mean Girls Clueless and Pretty in Pink.
3246640	3248640	I didn't know they had games for those.
3248640	3250640	I like all of those movies.
3250640	3252640	I think something's wrong with me.
3252640	3255640	There is something wrong with you.
3255640	3261640	And then, let's see, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor coming out on PC.
3261640	3264640	Elven Legacy on PC as well.
3264640	3270640	And this is kind of cool, an Atlus PSP game, Hammerin' Hero coming out.
3270640	3275640	And another crappy Wii game, Escape the Museum.
3275640	3278640	And finally, you get a twofer here.
3278640	3285640	Not only do you get a crappy movie this week, but a crappy game based on said crappy movie that's based off of an anime series.
3285640	3288640	It's not so crappy, but Dragon Ball Evolution.
3288640	3292640	The game, the movie, the myth, the failure.
3292640	3294640	That's it.
3294640	3297640	Other Gay Guy on the show tonight, I have a question.
3297640	3302640	What is that show on VH1 with RuPaul, is it Drag Races?
3302640	3303640	Yeah, RuPaul's Drag Race.
3303640	3305640	How do you know that, Loki?
3305640	3306640	I watch The Soup.
3306640	3308640	Oh, Loki watches The Soup.
3308640	3313640	Don't you think they need to make a video game out of that?
3313640	3315640	Again, point and click.
3315640	3319640	Yeah, you dress the guys, you get them into their tucking panties.
3319640	3322640	It would be a Wii game, because it would be a party game.
3322640	3326640	Like, you know, it could be heel clubbing.
3326640	3330640	And you gotta do the dance, but it would be like Spice Girls the Game 2.
3330640	3331640	I am all over this game.
3331640	3334640	Let's put another girl through her paces.
3334640	3336640	RuPaul's Drag Races.
3336640	3339640	I like SSJ-100 Matt RuPaul GPS.
3339640	3343640	Work, turn to the left, work, turn to the right.
3343640	3347640	Any game where you replace the main character with RuPaul would be hilarious.
3347640	3348640	I love RuPaul.
3348640	3349640	God damn, RuPaul.
3349640	3352640	I love RuPaul, but I think that'd be great.
3352640	3355640	I think RuPaul would think that'd be funny.
3355640	3357640	Oh my god, is there a game developer out there listening?
3357640	3360640	Please, call them and make this happen.
3360640	3362640	There is an audience for that game.
3362640	3368640	Like Super Mario Bros. 3 RuPaul Edition, but instead of like the raccoon suit, it's like the sparkly suit.
3368640	3375640	Look, if you want to put in a little bit of money into this game, you will sell like, you're not going to sell a million.
3375640	3378640	You're probably not even going to sell 100,000, but you'll sell like 25,000.
3378640	3382640	No, I still think there should have been a gay X-Men where RuPaul was stormed.
3382640	3384640	I'm sorry.
3384640	3391640	That would be a great game.
3391640	3393640	Oh, here's something RuPaul should be in.
3393640	3395640	Oni Chambara.
3395640	3397640	No, seriously, I'm trying to tie this into the next story.
3397640	3400640	Did you know there was actually a movie based off of Oni Chambara?
3400640	3402640	Yes, I did, and I have...
3402640	3403640	It's out here as well.
3403640	3406640	It's localized here in the U.S. called Chambara Beauty, apparently.
3406640	3407640	I know, I got it.
3407640	3409640	I haven't got a chance to watch it yet, but...
3409640	3410640	Well, you better hurry because...
3410640	3411640	I will.
3411640	3412640	Guess what?
3412640	3417640	Apparently, even though this movie got negative reviews across the board, who would have thought?
3417640	3424640	For some reason, bikini-clad women slaying zombies with swords apparently had an audience for it.
3424640	3428640	Believe it or not, I played this game, and it was very fun.
3428640	3430640	And yet they won't make the RuPaul game.
3430640	3431640	Right.
3431640	3432640	They think there's no audience for that.
3432640	3434640	They'll make this shit, but they won't make it.
3434640	3436640	What's also awesome about...
3436640	3439640	You know, all the zombies are apparently farmers because they all wear flannel.
3439640	3440640	Here's the thing.
3440640	3443640	Chambara Beauty is now getting a sequel.
3443640	3444640	The movie is getting a sequel.
3444640	3447640	Oni Chambara the Game getting a sequel, that's probably a given as well.
3447640	3452640	But there will be another movie, Chambara Beauty Vortex.
3452640	3456640	And I guess there is a game called Vortex as well that's going to be coming out as well.
3456640	3458640	Amazingly enough, though, the Oni Chambara...
3458640	3461640	Like, for a Wii game, like, blood splattering on the screen.
3461640	3464640	Like, you get too much blood on your sword, and it sticks into the zombies.
3464640	3468640	I mean, it's not like a terrible blood fest, but it was a blood fest.
3468640	3469640	Now, something you should know.
3469640	3476640	The star of the first film, Starlit Eri Otogoro, is not coming back for the second movie.
3476640	3479640	So you know it's going to be a winner.
3479640	3482640	So this is a live action Japanese movie.
3482640	3485640	Is that what you're saying?
3485640	3488640	Yeah, this is a live action Japanese movie that's now getting a sequel to It.
3488640	3489640	Wow.
3489640	3493640	So we are seeing the beginnings of, like, Oni Chambara Mania.
3493640	3494640	That's amazing.
3494640	3497640	I love live action Japanese movies because they're so terrible.
3497640	3501640	But yet, no RuPaul game.
3501640	3502640	I'm just saying.
3502640	3504640	Such injustice in this world.
3504640	3505640	Such injustice.
3505640	3507640	You would like Skye...
3507640	3509640	I think I need to start one of those petition online things.
3509640	3511640	You know those things that don't mean anything?
3511640	3514640	But we need to start collecting signatures for a RuPaul video game.
3514640	3515640	No, Rob, but...
3515640	3518640	And I'll email fucking RuPaul somehow.
3518640	3520640	Back to live action really quick.
3520640	3523640	Akouge is a live action Japanese film about fag hags.
3523640	3525640	Check it out.
3525640	3526640	Akouge.
3526640	3527640	Really?
3527640	3531640	Yes, because I dated a Japanese guy for a little bit and he showed it to me.
3531640	3532640	Really?
3532640	3533640	It was awesome.
3533640	3536640	Because basically this chick likes to watch guys make out in the park.
3536640	3538640	Gee, you know...
3538640	3540640	I have a problem with that.
3540640	3543640	A lot of straight guys like to watch girls make out in the park.
3543640	3546640	Like, hello, cruel intentions.
3546640	3547640	Why not?
3547640	3551640	Some girls like to watch girls make out in the park.
3551640	3553640	La la la la.
3553640	3555640	Innocent, innocent.
3555640	3557640	Anyway.
3557640	3559640	How about different stuff?
3559640	3561640	Yes, how about different stuff?
3561640	3565640	Well, there is a game that's called Beyond Good and Evil.
3565640	3566640	Ooh.
3566640	3568640	And it's getting a sequel.
3568640	3569640	Ooh.
3569640	3576640	And it's inspired by the Trade Center airplane bombing thing.
3576640	3583640	And I refuse to refer to the event by the date because I think that's fucking retarded.
3583640	3586640	You can just refer to it as Loki's 21st birthday.
3586640	3588640	Okay, it happened on Loki's 21st birthday.
3588640	3591640	So when Loki was getting, what, liquor or something?
3591640	3593640	Eating steak at a steakhouse.
3593640	3594640	That was empty.
3594640	3595640	Okay.
3595640	3602640	But at any rate, the game is supposed to be based off of that.
3602640	3613640	They're saying that that day's event actually gave across the same type of element of fear
3613640	3616640	that he was looking for in the game.
3616640	3626640	And so he's going to incorporate that same sense, that same emotional sense into the sequel.
3626640	3632640	But he also, though, tried to compare it to Zelda.
3632640	3634640	Saying that...
3634640	3636640	Oh, come on.
3636640	3642640	Saying that they're good games but out of time.
3642640	3643640	And I'm like...
3643640	3645640	Is that like Majora's Mask?
3645640	3655640	No, it just means that there's people who like happy and some people who like to play fucking depressing stuff.
3655640	3657640	I had...
3657640	3660640	Braid, in a way, was depressing to me.
3660640	3663640	Like, I don't know. There's definitely depressing games out there.
3663640	3665640	All the Silent Hill games are pretty depressing, too.
3665640	3667640	God, they're fantastic.
3667640	3671640	I actually think that the UFO endings on Silent Hill are more depressing.
3671640	3675640	I have really yet to play that game that makes me want to eat an entire canister of ice cream, though.
3675640	3677640	Like, you know, getting that depressed.
3677640	3683640	Like watching a Lifetime movie or one of Steel Magnolias or something.
3683640	3686640	I have yet to really see the video game equivalent of that.
3686640	3692640	Well, the only problem I have with games like that that'll be about an actual horrifying event like that.
3692640	3696640	Or even the World War II games is the people who, when they play those games, are like,
3696640	3700640	"'Cause I'm showing respect to the event and I'm remembering it. Nah."
3700640	3704640	And I'm like, "'Cause you're sitting on your ass in your living room on a couch pressing buttons."
3704640	3706640	So I'm like, that's the only...
3706640	3708640	But, you know, it could be a good game. I don't know.
3708640	3715640	I... You know what? I have to say, and I'm just gonna leave it here, and yes, it was incredibly awful,
3715640	3721640	but making a big to-do about that is actually just perpetuating fear.
3721640	3723640	We just need to go back to business as usual.
3723640	3727640	It kinda seems like this person's reaching for buzzwords that are gonna catch people's attention.
3727640	3728640	I'm thinking...
3728640	3729640	That's the impression I get.
3729640	3740640	I can understand trying to evoke an emotion, and I understand that was a very particularly...
3740640	3746640	Well, for lack of a better description, that was definitely a unique sort of feeling, you know?
3746640	3752640	The combination of gutted and really numb, I would think.
3752640	3757640	And I can understand someone trying to evoke an emotion that is that unique,
3757640	3763640	but at the same time, don't drag that into it. Just fucking drop it.
3763640	3768640	I gotta say, going to the depressing games topic, which is kinda open to thing in chat here,
3768640	3771640	I gotta say this. Kitsune says, Lost Odyssey made me sad.
3771640	3773640	It's very depressing, but it's a good game. That's a good point.
3773640	3778640	Lost Odyssey was really, really sad. That was a really good story, too.
3778640	3781640	That was a horrifically-underlooked game by a lot of people.
3781640	3782640	You know what? Another game had a really depressing ending?
3782640	3783640	Hmm.
3783640	3784640	Klonoa.
3784640	3786640	Really? I never played that to completion.
3786640	3790640	The game is, you start it off, it's all cutesy happy, cutesy happy.
3790640	3793640	Get towards the end of the game. Oh my god!
3793640	3796640	Wind Waker also said.
3796640	3798640	Really? I didn't really play enough of it.
3798640	3801640	No, I thought it was. I was like, I've been playing this game for 15 years,
3801640	3802640	and then this is what happens to the kingdom?
3802640	3807640	Okay. I don't want to get a depressing show, so let's go back to LoL RuPaul for a minute here, okay?
3807640	3809640	Apparently we have a friend at Sony that listens to the show,
3809640	3814640	and they're gonna email some people about the RuPaul game and making it happen.
3814640	3818640	So, god bless you. You are a public servant of the people.
3818640	3820640	You are a brave man, so best of luck with that.
3820640	3822640	It better have the word fierce in the title.
3822640	3824640	That's right.
3824640	3827640	And it better not be soccer practice.
3827640	3829640	God bless you, sir. God bless you. I hope it happens.
3829640	3834640	If they need input of any sort, please give them my email.
3834640	3836640	Also, I want to point this out.
3836640	3838640	SSJ100Matt made a good point.
3838640	3843640	Rob, seriously, keep wishing, because last time you did that, they made SingStar Abba.
3843640	3844640	This is true.
3844640	3846640	What if they did SingStar RuPaul?
3846640	3848640	I don't think that would work as much.
3848640	3851640	You could sing Back to My Roots, which is actually...
3851640	3854640	Okay, that song is a guilty pleasure for me.
3854640	3857640	No, I don't think I'd want an entire SingStar game out of RuPaul,
3857640	3860640	but I think they could make a party game out of drag races.
3860640	3862640	That would be totally great.
3862640	3864640	I think they could. RuPaul's Fierce Drag Race.
3864640	3866640	ZakuPilot256, there's the name right there.
3866640	3869640	It's got to have fierce in the title.
3869640	3870640	That's right.
3870640	3873640	Most Fiercest.
3873640	3875640	It just has to be...
3875640	3877640	This game is fierce, just buy it.
3877640	3878640	The end.
3878640	3880640	The title should just be This Game is Fierce.
3880640	3883640	Alright, Lord Almighty, let's get past the RuPaul thing.
3883640	3885640	I'm so sorry to our listeners.
3885640	3888640	I know it's my fault, but I neglected the chat.
3888640	3889640	Candy!
3889640	3891640	I was laughing so hard, I couldn't see the chat,
3891640	3894640	so I just went back and caught up on it and wanted to mention that.
3894640	3895640	Sorry.
3895640	3900640	Anyways, so there's a rumor going around that Mortal Kombat,
3900640	3902640	the team that's working at least on Mortal Kombat,
3902640	3904640	is trying to leave Midway.
3904640	3907640	I guess that's kind of like rats escaping a sinking ship.
3907640	3911640	So they're looking for new developers.
3911640	3913640	Yay.
3913640	3915640	Probably going to buy them up.
3915640	3917640	I can totally see that happening.
3917640	3921640	It'd be hilarious if Capcom bought them up.
3921640	3923640	That would be cool.
3923640	3927640	Actually, that would be all kinds of strange,
3927640	3929640	because you know there would be that inevitable
3929640	3931640	Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat game,
3931640	3933640	and that's just going to really weird a lot of people out.
3933640	3935640	That's going to be creepy.
3935640	3938640	That's going to be like when Sonic and Mario started showing up in the same place.
3938640	3940640	I have a feeling if they were ever going to leave Midway,
3940640	3942640	which I doubt that they will,
3942640	3944640	but if they were, EA would probably buy them up,
3944640	3947640	because EA likes to snatch up properties like that,
3947640	3951640	and they've got enough money to throw around.
3951640	3953640	So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that.
3953640	3957640	Because, you know, EA needs a good fighting game franchise,
3957640	3963640	because that Marvel game that they put out sucked.
3963640	3966640	Did they do DC and Marvel?
3966640	3968640	Midway did.
3968640	3971640	No, it was Marvel vs. DC. Never mind, I'm stupid.
3971640	3973640	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, yeah.
3973640	3977640	EA did Marvel Ultimate Alliance, right?
3977640	3979640	No, that was Activision.
3979640	3983640	EA did Rise of the Imperfects or something like that.
3983640	3986640	Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer? No, it wasn't Silver Surfer.
3986640	3989640	No, Silver Surfer was also Activision.
3989640	3991640	Yeah, they did the Rise of the Imperfects game,
3991640	3994640	which is so ironic that they had Imperfect in the title,
3994640	4000640	but yes, it was not very good.
4000640	4003640	But, yeah, so we'll see if this actually happens.
4003640	4004640	I don't know.
4004640	4008640	I just have a feeling that Midway wouldn't part with the Mortal Kombat team that quick.
4008640	4010640	I mean, because if they do that, what does Midway have left?
4010640	4013640	I mean, nothing.
4013640	4014640	Not a lot of good stuff, at least.
4014640	4017640	Unreal Tournament, I guess? I don't know.
4017640	4018640	Eh, I don't know.
4018640	4024640	They're just in financial struggle right now, but I just, I don't know.
4024640	4025640	We'll see.
4025640	4027640	Well, I'm going to pull up a video here in studio,
4027640	4029640	and I apologize you guys can't see this on the radio,
4029640	4033640	but what's interesting about this, this is an Unreal...
4033640	4034640	Whoa, hello.
4034640	4038640	This is Unreal Tournament, but it's a Sonic the Hedgehog level
4038640	4042640	using the Unreal engine.
4042640	4044640	This is gorgeous.
4044640	4046640	I apologize for the volume. Good lord.
4046640	4047640	Let's see if we can turn that down.
4047640	4048640	There we go.
4048640	4049640	Oh, my God.
4049640	4051640	This is kind of interesting.
4051640	4053640	It looks a little bit like Smash Brothers.
4053640	4055640	It does kind of look like Smash Brothers.
4055640	4057640	There's giant lasers and lots of blood.
4057640	4059640	Very interesting level.
4059640	4062640	Somebody spent a lot of time on that, that's for sure.
4062640	4068640	They did something similar with, like, Legos and stuff before.
4068640	4072640	They had Lego maps and stuff, mods.
4072640	4074640	What's cool about stuff like this is, you know,
4074640	4077640	a member of the PC mods do work on the PlayStation 3 version,
4077640	4080640	so you can actually get this for the PlayStation 3 as well.
4080640	4081640	All right.
4081640	4083640	Enough of that background noise there from the game.
4083640	4084640	Question for you, though.
4084640	4089640	Which types of mods have you really been into for that?
4089640	4091640	I'm not an Unreal Tournament player, so I can tell you.
4091640	4092640	No, I'm not.
4092640	4094640	Well, what about, like, you know how they did with Quake?
4094640	4096640	Because, you know, there's a lot of Quake.
4096640	4097640	Oh, I love the Quake mods.
4097640	4098640	I love Kujo and the grappling hook,
4098640	4100640	because I'd be used to the grapples with the ceiling.
4100640	4101640	Yeah, the grappling hook was awesome in Quake.
4101640	4103640	That was a completely, like, user-done mod.
4103640	4105640	That changed the game significantly.
4105640	4108640	Yeah, I'd grappling hook to the ceiling and drop Kujo down
4108640	4111640	and have Kujo attack people, because it was awesome.
4111640	4113640	Oh, there's one that I like.
4113640	4114640	Hmm.
4114640	4116640	The cube mod.
4116640	4117640	Like the movie?
4117640	4118640	Yeah, like the movie.
4118640	4120640	For Quake?
4120640	4121640	Yeah.
4121640	4122640	Wow.
4122640	4123640	Because Quake's kind of old.
4123640	4125640	Well, not for Quake, but for one of the later...
4125640	4126640	Oh, okay.
4126640	4127640	Yeah.
4127640	4130640	They did a cube mod, and someone tried to do a hypercube one,
4130640	4133640	where it would randomly regenerate the room.
4133640	4137640	By the way, I don't mean to bring the Saw topic back up,
4137640	4140640	but Cube is a very good example of what's more of, like,
4140640	4142640	Cube's a very gory movie.
4142640	4144640	The first one especially is extremely gory.
4144640	4146640	I haven't seen the later ones, so I can't really speak for them.
4146640	4147640	The second one's kind of.
4147640	4149640	But more psychological.
4149640	4150640	Yes.
4150640	4152640	Very psychological, very intellectual type of movie.
4152640	4156640	Kind of just a good thing to kind of compare.
4156640	4159640	We're talking about this whole psychological thrill versus blood orgy.
4159640	4164640	My whole point between that is that I don't really want to see people put into situations
4164640	4170640	where they are forced to kill slash maim themselves or each other
4170640	4174640	to get out of the situation because of something someone else perceives they did,
4174640	4175640	or they might have done.
4175640	4179640	The cube, I think, is that you're putting the people together,
4179640	4182640	and they can either work together or they can kill each other.
4182640	4186640	And hypercube, they can just go crazy because time is freaking out.
4186640	4188640	I totally, I just want to say, I support you.
4188640	4190640	I cannot stand the Saw movies.
4190640	4192640	I'm like, because I saw part of one of them,
4192640	4194640	and the guy basically thinks he's helping them out by doing this.
4194640	4195640	Yeah.
4195640	4196640	And I'm like, dude, no.
4196640	4199640	I actually just went on Wikipedia to read the premise again.
4199640	4204640	And for me, I'm always the type of person that tries to get my brain into the character.
4204640	4209640	And that's something that just gives me a headache thinking about.
4209640	4211640	All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to open a can of worms.
4211640	4212640	I just wanted to mention that real quick.
4212640	4214640	Well, I will also say another defense.
4214640	4215640	How about those dolphins?
4215640	4218640	I will say another defense about that versus cube,
4218640	4221640	is that cube, you don't technically have an antagonist.
4221640	4223640	Technically.
4223640	4226640	You have the situation as your antagonist.
4226640	4228640	All right, let's move on. More gaming news. I'm sorry.
4228640	4230640	Dude, gotta.
4230640	4231640	Yeah, yeah, of course.
4231640	4232640	We want to get to the break and then get to part B.
4232640	4234640	It looks like we might do a list list after all tonight.
4234640	4239640	And I know we had talked about a topic before the show about doing the, what was it,
4239640	4241640	trick we would most want to see in Excitebots.
4241640	4243640	But I think I might have a better idea.
4243640	4245640	Let's do two.
4245640	4246640	What about this?
4246640	4248640	How about this for an idea for tonight's list list?
4248640	4249640	And maybe chat can give their input.
4249640	4251640	And if they have topic ideas, they can do that too.
4251640	4257640	What the DSI most needed in it to get me to buy one.
4257640	4260640	Feature that the DSI needed the most to get me to buy one.
4260640	4261640	Hmm.
4261640	4262640	That might be a good one.
4262640	4263640	Very topical. Think about it.
4263640	4264640	Hmm.
4264640	4265640	All right, we'll see.
4265640	4266640	Is it topical like an ointment?
4266640	4268640	All right, we'll see. Maybe the chat room has some better ideas.
4268640	4270640	If you have an idea for tonight's list list, let's send it over.
4270640	4271640	Well, we have some.
4271640	4272640	I got your joke. I got it.
4272640	4274640	I just didn't laugh.
4274640	4276640	Love ya.
4276640	4279640	Well, guess who I think is awesome?
4279640	4281640	Me.
4281640	4283640	Er.
4283640	4284640	Um.
4284640	4285640	Steve Weeby.
4285640	4286640	Oh, he's pretty cool.
4286640	4289640	For anyone who hasn't seen King of Kong,
4289640	4291640	the movie is pretty much about him.
4291640	4292640	Steve Weeby.
4292640	4296640	He's the guy who's trying to beat the big bastard Billy Mitchell,
4296640	4301640	who was the guy who had the Twin Galaxies highest score at Donkey Kong.
4301640	4306640	And Steve Weeby, he was just a really nice guy who thought he could do a better job,
4306640	4307640	and he beat the score.
4307640	4309640	And it turns out Billy Mitchell's a cock,
4309640	4313640	and sent in a videotape instead of coming in and doing it himself,
4313640	4318640	of him topping a million, over a million points on Donkey Kong.
4318640	4320640	Um.
4320640	4323640	So, Steve Weeby's going to be at E3.
4323640	4325640	And that is reason enough for me to go.
4325640	4327640	I want to witness this.
4327640	4329640	Here's what's interesting, though.
4329640	4331640	They did the same thing at E for All.
4331640	4335640	And to be fair to our, I guess you could say, you know, I don't know what to call it.
4335640	4338640	It's not really parent company, because we own ourselves.
4338640	4343640	But, you know, the company that enables us to do this live for you all every Sunday night,
4343640	4345640	All Games had a ginormous booth at E for All.
4345640	4348640	They had Steve Weeby there trying to break the score for Donkey Kong,
4348640	4351640	so it's kind of been there, done that.
4351640	4356640	So it's just interesting that now people seem to care because it's E3 and not E for All.
4356640	4357640	Which, you know, I get.
4357640	4359640	This is going to have far more people.
4359640	4363640	Yeah, but I also, nothing would have gotten me to go to E for All, I think.
4363640	4365640	Nothing.
4365640	4369640	E for All, to me, was just a ginormous waste of time,
4369640	4372640	and I could have slept, or done my laundry,
4372640	4377640	or, you know, washed dirty dishes with my tongue.
4377640	4380640	It just looked better on paper, I think.
4380640	4383640	It was one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper.
4383640	4388640	At any rate, this is funny because even the guys at Twin Galaxies
4388640	4393640	were just saying that it was completely awful of Billy Mitchell,
4393640	4394640	and he's just such a dick.
4394640	4395640	Oh my God, he's such a dick.
4395640	4396640	I don't like him.
4396640	4400640	Anyway, the other cool thing, though, is that with the two of them,
4400640	4404640	I think, I don't exactly agree with how my source says it,
4404640	4408640	because there have been other people who have hit the Donkey Kong kill screen,
4408640	4411640	but I think that those two are the only ones who have done it in a live event.
4411640	4416640	But the kill screen is basically after you pay so many levels of Donkey Kong,
4416640	4418640	it'll just stop.
4418640	4419640	It won't work anymore.
4419640	4421640	It'll just be game over.
4421640	4425640	It doesn't care how many extra lives you have or what your score is or anything.
4425640	4428640	It's just like, ugh, I'm dead.
4428640	4429640	Seriously.
4429640	4432640	Mario will be running around, freeze, dead.
4432640	4433640	Don't they show it in the movie?
4433640	4434640	Don't they show it in the movie?
4434640	4435640	Yeah, they show it.
4435640	4439640	But I've seen someone do it.
4439640	4441640	When?
4441640	4442640	A long time ago.
4442640	4443640	Huh.
4443640	4445640	I had to have been like 11.
4445640	4446640	Interesting.
4446640	4448640	And apparently, it was at Godfather's Pizza.
4448640	4451640	It seems to be one of those people who just didn't care.
4451640	4454640	Because we also had, I don't think I was that young.
4454640	4458640	I think I was a little older than that because we had one of the Mario machines,
4458640	4461640	the Nintendo arcade.
4461640	4463640	I bet there are a lot of people out there that could do it and just don't,
4463640	4465640	they don't want to get in the scene.
4465640	4466640	You know what I mean?
4466640	4467640	They do it for themselves.
4467640	4469640	I ask him if it broke.
4469640	4471640	If he broke the machine, he's like, yeah, I broke the machine.
4471640	4474640	And that's all I remember until I saw the movie.
4474640	4483640	But anyway, I really, I really, really would like to see him do it.
4483640	4487640	And I would love to be there when it happens.
4487640	4489640	I think it would be fantastic.
4489640	4492640	And that, and I would like to see what Billy Mitchell does about it,
4492640	4494640	just because he's a dick and I'm enjoying,
4494640	4498640	I'm kind of enjoying the drama a little bit, even though it's kind of stupid.
4498640	4502640	If he does, I will self-fornicate into my trousers.
4502640	4504640	Can we put it on the internet?
4504640	4506640	Can we broadcast that live on G4?
4506640	4507640	Yes, yes.
4507640	4509640	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
4509640	4512640	Immediately following, immediately following,
4512640	4515640	Steve, we'll be breaking the record live on G4.
4515640	4520640	We'll be live on G4, the doctor self-fornicating into his pants.
4520640	4523640	Trousers, all right, into his trousers.
4523640	4525640	He might not be wearing pants.
4525640	4528640	He might just be wearing the trousers.
4528640	4532640	AcidicVampire in chat says, I'd go to see Billy's flowing hair.
4532640	4534640	I don't think he's going to be there at E3.
4534640	4536640	All right, look, let's move on.
4536640	4537640	Maybe he will.
4537640	4538640	I don't know.
4538640	4540640	I'm a little low for the drama.
4540640	4541640	It was just a movie, people.
4541640	4542640	It was just a movie.
4542640	4545640	GS68 makes the best point, and immediately thereafter,
4545640	4548640	Billy Mitchell posts his new record on YouTube.
4548640	4550640	All right, look, a couple more news stories,
4550640	4551640	and we've got to take a break.
4551640	4552640	Yes.
4552640	4554640	So this is kind of funny.
4554640	4559640	For April Fool's Day, Bethesda decided
4559640	4561640	that they're going to go ahead and kind of do
4561640	4565640	a half-price sale on all the download content for Oblivion,
4565640	4567640	which is pretty cool, except there's a catch.
4567640	4570640	Horse Armor, they decided, you know what?
4570640	4571640	Horse Armor's awesome.
4571640	4575640	We're going to double the price of that, just to be funny.
4575640	4578640	To which I say nay.
4578640	4581640	I say nay.
4581640	4584640	And after that, he goes, hey.
4584640	4588640	OK, I had to throw that in.
4588640	4590640	I think this is their form of an April Fool's joke.
4590640	4592640	Like, not that it's a joke.
4592640	4593640	Like, it actually happened.
4593640	4594640	Yeah, it actually happened.
4594640	4596640	But I think it's like an April Fool's joke still.
4596640	4597640	You know what I mean?
4597640	4599640	Like, it was what they did in celebration of April Fool's
4599640	4600640	Day.
4600640	4602640	Because everyone realizes that, you know,
4602640	4604640	and including them that Horse Armor is ridiculous.
4604640	4607640	Yeah, I think even Bethesda realized, OK, you got us.
4607640	4608640	Horse Armor was pretty dumb.
4608640	4611640	But people still buy it.
4611640	4612640	Yeah, people still buy it.
4612640	4614640	I bet there's people that bought it with the double price.
4614640	4616640	And it doesn't make Oblivion a bad game by any means,
4616640	4618640	because Oblivion is one of the best games they've
4618640	4620640	made in many, many years.
4620640	4622640	And I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.
4622640	4624640	Like, Elder Scrolls V will make me
4624640	4626640	self-fornicate in my trousers, I hope.
4626640	4629640	Because if it doesn't, I'm going to be very disappointed.
4629640	4638640	Feature net guaranteed.
4638640	4639640	All right.
4639640	4641640	Look, last week we brought you a story
4641640	4644640	about a man who was suing Microsoft and Lionhead
4644640	4648640	over reports that he was being harassed because he was gay.
4648640	4649640	You might remember about this.
4649640	4651640	Apparently, we're not going to get
4651640	4653640	to see the drama unfold in the courtroom,
4653640	4656640	because there has been a settlement.
4656640	4657640	Likely didn't think that would happen.
4657640	4660640	The case has been settled out of court.
4660640	4663640	Microsoft has released a very brief statement.
4663640	4664640	And guess what?
4664640	4665640	This is all you're going to hear on it,
4665640	4668640	because usually with these settlements come gag orders.
4668640	4670640	Microsoft says, we are pleased to have
4670640	4673640	reached a makeable resolution to this matter with Mr. Durant.
4673640	4675640	The terms of the settlement are confidential,
4675640	4677640	but we can confirm that Mr. Durant will not
4677640	4679640	continue his employment at Lionhead
4679640	4681640	as part of the agreement.
4681640	4684640	That's probably what he got for taking his case to the media.
4684640	4686640	But hey, it sounds like everybody got what they wanted.
4686640	4688640	Isn't Bill Gates gay?
4688640	4690640	No, he's a wife, dummy.
4690640	4691640	He's still gay.
4691640	4693640	Like, oh, get my stuff.
4693640	4694640	Oh, shut.
4694640	4695640	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4695640	4696640	All right.
4696640	4697640	So there you go.
4697640	4699640	Follow up to last week, to be fair.
4699640	4700640	We wanted to follow up on that.
4700640	4704640	It's kind of, we'll never know the real answer
4704640	4707640	because of the settlement, but that's life.
4707640	4708640	All right, let's get into a segment
4708640	4710640	we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
4710640	4712640	It's called the classic video game of the week.
4712640	4714640	And as part of this segment,
4714640	4717640	Dark Sakura will dig into her archive of classic gaming
4717640	4720640	and find a title that she believes you all should be checking out.
4720640	4722640	She's been doing this quite a while now.
4722640	4724640	We have, like, over a year's worth of games
4724640	4726640	that they're tracking on the OLR Wikipedia,
4726640	4728640	which you can get to at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
4728640	4730640	and go to that little thing that says,
4730640	4732640	the little box in the corner with all the pictures
4732640	4735640	that has the big W in it,
4735640	4737640	and that's how you get to the Wiki on Wikia.
4737640	4739640	I can't remember the name of the box.
4739640	4740640	Extended play.
4740640	4741640	That's it.
4741640	4742640	Had a brain fart.
4742640	4746640	All right, anyhow, what is the classic game of the week this week, Dark Sakura?
4746640	4749640	The classic game of the week is Incredible Crisis.
4749640	4752640	That game is crack.
4752640	4754640	And by crack, I mean crack.
4754640	4757640	Welcome to Incredible Crisis.
4757640	4761640	This is a game that came out on the PlayStation.
4761640	4763640	And...
4763640	4767640	Incredible Crisis with puppies.
4767640	4774640	The game is about playing in a day in the family member's lives,
4774640	4777640	the main character being Taneo.
4777640	4781640	And they're trying to get everyone home early today
4781640	4783640	for Grandmother Haruko's birthday.
4783640	4789640	And this game very much is a parody of daily Japanese life.
4789640	4792640	This game is incredibly what the fuck.
4792640	4794640	For real. For real.
4794640	4798640	I can't think of many more WTF games that have ever been made.
4798640	4800640	I'll let Jamie explain.
4800640	4801640	Then I'll give my comment.
4801640	4804640	I'll say the music in the game if you'll listen to a little bit of it.
4809640	4811640	They're dancing, by the way, in the office.
4814640	4815640	I think that's not a good point.
4815640	4818640	It's done by the Tokyo Scott Paradise Orchestra.
4818640	4820640	So it's good music.
4820640	4822640	I love them.
4822640	4826640	So basically the way that this goes is you have a bunch of minigames
4826640	4831640	where you're playing through people's lives and it's sort of sequential.
4831640	4835640	Taneo, for example, this scene is him at work.
4835640	4837640	And they are dancing to relieve stress.
4837640	4840640	However, you've got this head meter
4840640	4844640	and just the redder and more full that it gets.
4844640	4848640	Finally his brain just explodes and he stresses out completely and freaks out.
4848640	4857640	So the way that it goes is that the main character is getting out of work
4857640	4866640	and he's attacked and has to get away from a boulder that's chasing after him.
4866640	4872640	And then the emergency crew straps him to a stretcher and send him into traffic.
4872640	4876640	So it's one of the minigames that's having to dodge traffic on a stretcher like a luge.
4876640	4885640	And then he meets this pretty lady and makes out with her in a Ferris wheel.
4885640	4890640	And so it's totally like, Rob, if you'll skip up to just a little bit further.
4890640	4891640	Any bit.
4891640	4892640	There it is.
4892640	4893640	This is it.
4893640	4894640	There.
4894640	4909640	Wow.
4909640	4915640	She tells you how to position yourself for the major boink action.
4915640	4922640	Well, technically the translation says he's giving an erotic back massage.
4922640	4923640	No.
4923640	4929640	Dude, they're doing it on a Ferris wheel.
4929640	4930640	Exactly.
4930640	4931640	And there's fireworks.
4931640	4935640	I don't think that's a back massage because that's not how we roll.
4935640	4940640	DJ Tyrant says, I jizzed in my pantsu.
4940640	4947640	I'll see you play as Etsuko who is the mother and she's out trying to buy stuff for Haruko's birthday
4947640	4950640	and she has to go to the bank and it's being robbed.
4950640	4955640	And just all this crap is happening to this family.
4955640	4962640	So the last one is about the little boy Tsuyoshi and more weird stuff.
4962640	4966640	He's like turned into an ant or something or shrunk to ant size.
4966640	4969640	It's like the game's just freaking bizarre.
4969640	4975640	It's so much weird crap this family has to go through all for the sake of getting home early.
4975640	4981640	You know, have a birthday party.
4981640	4984640	There are 24 mini games.
4984640	4990640	Some of them do repeat and it only is a one player game, but it doesn't.
4990640	4993640	It can still count as a party because really it's better to pass it around.
4993640	4994640	It's a lot of fun.
4994640	4995640	This game looks amazing.
4995640	4996640	What the fuck was I thinking?
4996640	4999640	I remember renting this game years ago and not liking it.
4999640	5003640	But granted, it was during a period of my life where I didn't play a lot of video games.
5003640	5007640	Admittedly, it was when I was in college and pretty much all I played was Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter.
5007640	5009640	And I remember renting this game and going, what the fuck?
5009640	5013640	But now I would have an appreciation for the WTF factor.
5013640	5014640	And I'm a little disappointed.
5014640	5019640	I don't think it's available on the PlayStation 3 download library.
5019640	5022640	But seeing that Ferris wheel level, I'm kind of not surprised.
5022640	5024640	You can borrow mine if you want to.
5024640	5025640	Cool.
5025640	5030640	Because I have a goal this month to pick all games that I own.
5030640	5032640	Which isn't hard.
5032640	5036640	But also there were two mini games that actually were left out of the game.
5036640	5040640	Because they were very kanji intensive so they couldn't translate them.
5040640	5042640	It would have been for him...
5042640	5045640	It was very difficult to translate.
5045640	5050640	To actually translate the play of the game into it because of the way it involved the kanji.
5050640	5053640	But one of them was...
5053640	5057640	Involved the daughter and the family singing karaoke.
5057640	5060640	Which I think would have been fun.
5060640	5065640	But it's a pretty cool little game.
5065640	5070640	Deathwishing in chat says, seriously man, I wanted to break a brick over my head after I played this.
5070640	5071640	It freaked me the fuck out.
5071640	5075640	It was like taking acid smoking crackpot and then spinning around in a wash cycle.
5075640	5077640	And actually if you want to know...
5077640	5079640	I'll link this in the chat room.
5079640	5084640	But if you want to know a little bit about part of the problem that went into translating the game.
5084640	5089640	Or just stuff that goes into translating and localizing games.
5089640	5094640	There's an article and it's from last April actually.
5094640	5097640	It's called The Art of Translating Video Games.
5097640	5103640	And I will link that in the chat room for people to see if they're interested in it.
5103640	5106640	It's a pretty cool little article.
5106640	5109640	Alright, well that's going to do it.
5109640	5112640	Your classic video game of the week, Incredible Crisis.
5112640	5114640	Good pick DarkSakura.
5114640	5118640	This is one I kind of forgot about but what a WTF kind of game.
5118640	5120640	Oh, it really is, isn't it?
5120640	5123640	I love the game.
5123640	5126640	I mean, I think it's crazy, crazy crack.
5126640	5128640	This is exactly what the classic game of the week should be.
5128640	5133640	One of those games that you kind of forget about but you need to go back and say, wow, that game was like fucking nuts.
5133640	5137640	Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Launch Radio.
5137640	5140640	But stay tuned guys, we have plenty more to come here on Orange Launch Radio.
5140640	5142640	Tonight's part B. We're going to do a listless game.
5142640	5144640	I didn't see a lot of topics submitted in chat.
5144640	5149640	Although, to be honest, I kind of missed a bunch of stuff when they were doing Incredible Crisis.
5149640	5152640	So what do you want to do? Do you want to do the Excitebots thing or do you want to do the DSi thing? What do you think?
5152640	5154640	I have zero preference.
5154640	5156640	Zero preference? I don't know.
5156640	5159640	I'd like to do what kind of flavor does Jamie want for pie.
5159640	5161640	I don't think that's going to work.
5161640	5166640	Let's see how creative we can get making up a trick.
5166640	5168640	Alright, you want to do the Excitebots one?
5168640	5170640	No, I want to do the DSi one.
5170640	5174640	Okay, I think the DSi one is a little more open and topical. So we'll do the DSi.
5174640	5176640	We'll do the Excitebots one when the Excitebot comes out.
5176640	5180640	Okay, so DSi, feature we most want or wish...
5180640	5182640	No, how do we phrase this?
5182640	5186640	Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it yesterday or today.
5186640	5187640	Okay.
5187640	5189640	Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it today.
5189640	5191640	Because none of us bought it, right?
5191640	5193640	Okay, but if it had this feature, I would have.
5193640	5194640	So there you go.
5194640	5202640	Alright, we're going to answer that question and do plenty more here on Orange Lounge Radio, such as talking about Blizzard Entertainment and a possible interesting franchise they could be doing.
5202640	5205640	As well as a Silent Hill game on the Wii.
5205640	5206640	Wii!
5206640	5210640	We're going to talk all about that when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5210640	5221640	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, April the 5th of 2009.
5221640	5226640	We're taping live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
5226640	5231640	It's about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night.
5231640	5234640	Join us for live taping, why don't you?
5234640	5236640	I'm sure you don't have anything better to do on a Sunday night.
5236640	5238640	There's nothing on TV, right?
5238640	5243640	Anyhow, Loki's here in studio, of course. He's playing through Ninja Blade.
5243640	5247640	So if you are joining us on this Sunday evening, check it out on Justin TV.
5247640	5249640	Dark Sakura's with us as well.
5249640	5254640	You guys are with us in our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, and on the Skype line a little later in the show.
5254640	5257640	We'll be taking your calls and also playing listless a little later as well.
5257640	5261640	But we still have some news to get to, and Loki's going to start us off in this Part B with some news.
5261640	5265640	Yes, there's some interesting rumors coming out.
5265640	5268640	Well, actually, I'm getting ahead of myself here.
5268640	5274640	The rumor is that apparently the Lips mic is going to be good for things other than Lips.
5274640	5279640	And starting things off, Guitar Hero Metallica actually has support for the Lips mics.
5279640	5286640	And apparently, Rock Band 2 will be getting a patch sometime this summer that will also add support for the shiny mics.
5286640	5293640	Because, you know, nothing screams Metallica likes sparkles on the mics.
5293640	5298640	I don't know. I don't understand why you need it to be supported.
5298640	5304640	I mean, I would think if people, you know, have Guitar Hero Metallica, most people probably already have World Tour.
5304640	5307640	So, you know, I don't know.
5307640	5310640	But hey, support for stuff is always good.
5310640	5313640	Well, plus the Lips mark is sparkly, you know, and all that.
5313640	5316640	So, you know, who doesn't like sparkles?
5316640	5318640	Me.
5318640	5322640	Oh, good point. The Lips mics are also wireless, says ZachDeft in chat.
5322640	5323640	That's true. That's pretty good.
5323640	5326640	Isn't there a third-party wireless mic too, though?
5326640	5328640	Um, I don't know.
5328640	5330640	You know, I've never played the Lips games.
5330640	5332640	I'm just kind of burned out on the karaoke games.
5332640	5337640	Between the Rock Band, between SingStar, ABBA, and the other SingStar stuff that's available on PS3,
5337640	5340640	I kind of didn't want to get Lips because I don't need another one.
5340640	5344640	You know, SingStars, as far as karaoke games go, SingStar is rock solid enough, you know?
5344640	5347640	Lips kind of was late to the party, if that makes sense.
5347640	5354640	Also, possibly late to the party, a revival of Redneck Rampage?
5354640	5356640	Now, here's one of those things I look at and I go,
5356640	5359640	surely this is an April Fool's joke, but I...
5359640	5362640	I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at the...
5362640	5363640	Redneck Rampage is pretty freaking funny.
5363640	5365640	So it's a game about my hometown?
5365640	5368640	I think it's stupid. I think it's one of the stupidest video games I've ever seen.
5368640	5370640	Like, I realize it's supposed to be a parody, but WTF.
5370640	5372640	But, okay, wait, I'm not done yet.
5372640	5376640	But apparently this story broke on, like, the 4th of April or whatever, but here we go.
5376640	5379640	Blizzard, apparently there's a rumor that Blizzard Entertainment
5379640	5382640	actually has the Redneck Rampage brand right now.
5382640	5385640	And apparently this is some research done by a website called INC Gamers.
5385640	5388640	They were doing some trademark following or what have you.
5388640	5392640	And apparently Redneck Rampage was originally trademarked in 97,
5392640	5394640	then Redneck Rampage rides again.
5394640	5398640	Redneck Rampage sucking grits on Route 66.
5398640	5401640	Yes, that was really the name of apparently the 3rd game that was made.
5401640	5405640	They are apparently all now under Blizzard's control.
5405640	5410640	So Blizzard apparently owns the rights to, you know, these games.
5410640	5413640	And I don't know, is that through, like, acquisitions and things like that? Who knows.
5413640	5418640	But, yeah, and apparently, you know, Activision actually acquired the Redneck Rampage thing.
5418640	5421640	But why would it then be given to Blizzard and not Activision?
5421640	5423640	Don't know.
5423640	5427640	But apparently there are some Blizzard folks on staff who actually worked on the original Redneck Rampage.
5427640	5429640	I hope to hell this doesn't mean they're making a new one.
5429640	5432640	I mean, talk about unnecessary, unnecessarys.
5432640	5436640	X-Link in chat suggests Redneck for the iPhone.
5436640	5440640	You know what? I would rather it be something like that.
5440640	5442640	And DJ Tyrant said Blizzard isn't this stupid, are they?
5442640	5444640	And hopefully not.
5444640	5448640	DJ Tyrant, maybe it's something that's a nod to those employees who were there that worked on the game.
5448640	5450640	I don't know.
5450640	5454640	But let's just hope it's just an interesting observation and nothing more.
5454640	5457640	I don't know, DarkSakura, would you buy a new Redneck Rampage?
5457640	5460640	Would I buy it? No.
5460640	5463640	Would I buy it? Yes. Definitely.
5463640	5467640	I'll tell you what I'd buy. A new Hexic. Or Hexen.
5467640	5468640	Hexen!
5468640	5469640	Those games were pretty awesome.
5469640	5470640	Heck yeah, I love Hexen.
5470640	5472640	Anyhow.
5472640	5474640	That game was awesome, though.
5474640	5476640	What, Redneck Rampage?
5476640	5481640	It was using the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D, but it had more features for it.
5481640	5483640	How about they just bring us Duke Nukem Forever?
5483640	5486640	Yeah, Hexen uses the same engine as Quake, right?
5486640	5487640	Yeah.
5487640	5489640	And it was awesome.
5489640	5494640	I just like turning people into chickens.
5494640	5509640	Well, as we covered on our last show, we're actually supposed to be getting those arcade games coming out for the Wii service.
5509640	5520640	Well, Sega is also taking a step to put actual arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade a lot more than what we've been seeing lately.
5520640	5528640	We're getting, and this makes my heart soar, Virtualon or Tariotangrim.
5528640	5532640	I don't have to figure out my Dreamcast to play it, except I have twin sticks.
5532640	5536640	So it's better to play it on the Dreamcast, but I digress.
5536640	5543640	There's release ratings for Shinobi and Altered Beast.
5543640	5547640	So that means System 16 will be getting some of those.
5547640	5549640	That's cool.
5549640	5556640	Also, there is one that's rumored as a Sega Vintage Collection Volume 2.
5556640	5564640	And there's also other Genesis titles listed as Comic Zone, Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.
5564640	5569640	Gunstar Heroes, of course, being one of the best Sega games ever.
5569640	5572640	Now, Comic Zone was already on the Virtual Console, though.
5572640	5575640	This is a Virtual Console. This is Live Arcade.
5575640	5576640	I thought you said for the Wii.
5576640	5582640	I started off with the Wii because we had talked about Sega arcade games coming out on Wii.
5582640	5589640	To recap, last week on Orange Challenge Radio, Rob ate a live frog.
5589640	5596640	And Loki's head exploded, leaving Jamie as the victor in Battle Royale Orange Challenge Edition.
5596640	5604640	Anyway, of course, you know, really you can play a lot of those on the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.
5604640	5605640	Not Outrun, though.
5605640	5606640	Shinobi Arcade.
5606640	5608640	Not Outrun. Surprisingly absent from the collection.
5608640	5611640	Did you know that Yuji Naka officially retired?
5611640	5613640	I did hear that this week, actually.
5613640	5616640	I don't think it made our show roll for whatever reason, but I did hear that news.
5616640	5618640	Dan got to meet him.
5618640	5619640	Cool.
5619640	5621640	At E3! One year.
5621640	5626640	Isn't it random how you'll just run into people that you just totally adore for their video game creations at E3?
5626640	5632640	I got my hug on with not Koji Kondo, the other, Igarashi.
5632640	5634640	I got a picture with a Kiriyamaoka. That was the thing.
5634640	5636640	I would hump him.
5636640	5639640	Which E3 is not supposed to be about fanboy moments, but look.
5639640	5640640	Yes, it is.
5640640	5641640	Here's the thing.
5641640	5646640	In defense, look, I realize E3 is supposed to be a trade event only open to journalists and people in the media.
5646640	5650640	Here's the thing. A good game journalist is a little bit fanboy.
5650640	5651640	Little bit.
5651640	5656640	They need to be fair, but I think a good game, you have to have a passion for video games.
5656640	5658640	And you have to have your obvious favors and things like that.
5658640	5663640	So I completely justify my, you know, screaming like a little 12 year old girl when I saw a Kiriyamaoka, okay?
5663640	5665640	So there you go.
5665640	5669640	That, he's also, it doesn't hurt that he's really good looking.
5669640	5674640	Aww, Black Wolf and DJ Tyrant both in chat said, I met Rob Roberts at E3.
5674640	5676640	Aww.
5676640	5677640	Yeah.
5677640	5679640	No, we said celebrities.
5679640	5681640	We're internet celebrities.
5681640	5684640	Black Wolf said, I totally squeed with fanboy delight when I met Rob Roberts.
5684640	5686640	He did actually.
5686640	5689640	I have yet to meet Rob Roberts, just so you guys know.
5689640	5691640	We did the whole, oh my god, oh my god.
5691640	5696640	I totally blush with embarrassment after running into Hideo Kojima.
5696640	5699640	Like three E3s in a row.
5699640	5701640	I don't know how this happens.
5701640	5706640	If it happens again this year, I'm gonna just go off and cry, or tell him to give me a job.
5706640	5710640	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
5710640	5713640	Let's stop talking about E3 and who we may or may not see at E3 this year.
5713640	5718640	So, this is kind of weird, I guess.
5718640	5724640	Last week we talked about how File Front was going away, and, you know, oh darn.
5724640	5727640	But, apparently, it's back.
5727640	5735640	And, it says File Front has been acquired by the original founders of the site, and will not be suspended as previously announced.
5735640	5738640	This is not an April Fools joke.
5738640	5741640	And, that's funny.
5741640	5745640	So, what once was dead is now back.
5745640	5750640	Well, congratulations to the folks at File Front for inserting a coin to continue.
5750640	5752640	Congratulations.
5752640	5753640	That's all it took, right?
5753640	5756640	And, in other news, EGM is coming back.
5756640	5757640	Oh wait, no, that's not true.
5757640	5759640	April Fools.
5759640	5761640	Alright.
5761640	5764640	That would have been a great, like, EGM yearly joke, right?
5764640	5766640	Because they used to do these epic April Fools jokes every year.
5766640	5770640	Like, you know, remember Ermac in Mortal Kombat was born of an EGM April Fools joke?
5770640	5773640	That could have been their epic joke this year, that they're coming back.
5773640	5776640	And then, aw, April Fools, it's a joke.
5776640	5779640	That would have been insulting for their fan base, yes.
5779640	5781640	Alright.
5781640	5783640	Not an April Fools joke.
5783640	5789640	When this news broke on April Fools Day, a lot of us were like, is this an April Fools joke?
5789640	5791640	Apparently, it's not.
5791640	5795640	It was announced that there is a Silent Hill game coming out for the Wii.
5795640	5797640	It's called Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
5797640	5799640	Here's the thing.
5799640	5804640	It's a remake, sort of, of the first game, but they don't want you to call it a remake of the first game.
5804640	5806640	It's a reimagining of the first game.
5806640	5809640	Which, you know, means Boohoo, no Pyramid Head, but at the same time...
5809640	5810640	The first game didn't have Pyramid Head.
5810640	5812640	Right, Boohoo, no Pyramid Head.
5812640	5815640	But the first game was pretty fucking phenomenal.
5815640	5818640	And a lot of people still say it was probably the best game in the series.
5818640	5823640	So, you know, definitely going to be a must-have for Silent Hill fans.
5823640	5827640	And a quote from the magazine where this originally appeared, Nintendo Power.
5827640	5829640	The characters play different roles.
5829640	5832640	Things don't necessarily happen in the same order.
5832640	5834640	And the story is taken in lots of new directions.
5834640	5836640	You still play as Harry Mason.
5836640	5838640	You're still looking for your daughter.
5838640	5842640	You don't see familiar elements, but they're all twisted to betray your expectations.
5842640	5846640	So this is kind of cool because it sounds like maybe it's going to be fucking with what people are expecting in the game.
5846640	5848640	Because they think it's going to be a remake.
5848640	5850640	That's going to be kind of cool.
5850640	5856640	So, apparently though, yes, they are going to exploit the Wii thing a little bit.
5856640	5859640	They are going to use some of the Wii remote action.
5859640	5861640	Some of the in-game puzzles will use Waggle in it.
5861640	5863640	You know, I heard...
5863640	5865640	Maybe I'm not supposed to repeat this, but I heard a long time ago...
5865640	5874640	Rumors that there were some tests being done in Konami of a Silent Hill type game where you would use the Wii mode as the flashlight as you were moving around.
5874640	5876640	And doesn't that sound scary?
5876640	5878640	I hope that concept made it into this game somehow.
5878640	5880640	I think that could be super creepy.
5880640	5881640	Fantastic.
5881640	5882640	And pretty cool.
5882640	5884640	If executed correctly. I mean, it could also be kind of dumb.
5884640	5888640	And thank god, because they should have been doing this kind of stuff on the Wii since the beginning.
5888640	5890640	So if they start doing that, great.
5890640	5891640	Yeah.
5891640	5900640	By the way, also, fans, you should know, part of the thing that bugged about the first Silent Hill game, that locked doors were everywhere.
5900640	5903640	Now there will be a way through every locked door.
5903640	5907640	You will no longer have to find that most of the doors in the game are permanently shut.
5907640	5910640	Sounds like it's going to be pretty awesome.
5910640	5914640	So, I'm definitely looking forward to this.
5914640	5915640	More information, at least.
5915640	5917640	I bet this is going to be one of the big things we're going to see at E3.
5917640	5921640	Or, Konami's having an event, if I remember right, this next week.
5921640	5926640	I mean, we weren't invited, but they're doing the Saw thing, and I know they're showing that.
5926640	5930640	I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up as well, along with your mandatory DDR and Yu-Gi-Oh for the year.
5930640	5931640	So, we'll see.
5931640	5933640	And, oh yeah, don't forget Winning Eleven.
5933640	5936640	All those games, you've got to get your mandatory entries for the year in there.
5936640	5938640	So, we'll see.
5938640	5940640	Are you excited about the Silent Hill Wii make?
5940640	5943640	Yes.
5943640	5944640	You're a clever one.
5944640	5945640	Alright.
5945640	5952640	Rob made me go hee for a game on the Wii.
5952640	5956640	Well, good. Let's hope there's more Wii-going Wii games later on.
5956640	5960640	Do you think you might have one in this next story, Dark Sakura?
5960640	5961640	I might.
5961640	5962640	Mm-hmm.
5962640	5963640	We can see.
5963640	5964640	Mm-hmm.
5964640	5966640	Because it's about Puyo Puyo.
5966640	5967640	Oh, never mind then.
5967640	5970640	Oh, hush.
5970640	5977640	There was, I don't know if you remember hearing about Project Ringo.
5977640	5979640	There had been talk going around about it.
5979640	5989640	It turns out that Project Ringo is a new Puyo Puyo game that's going to be on DS, Wii, and PSP.
5989640	5993640	And, of course, we get it as Puyo Pop.
5993640	6001640	And it will be technically it's just Puyo Puyo 7, which is more Puyo Puyo.
6001640	6008640	But you also will have a transformation mode, which will let you actually deflect attacks,
6008640	6014640	instead of, I guess, just preventing them from happening, and have larger chain combos.
6014640	6016640	So, that would be pretty cool.
6016640	6026640	But there should be some, I would say, information on the Project Ringo site when it actually goes active.
6026640	6027640	Actually, I think it is active.
6027640	6028640	Yeah.
6028640	6030640	It is active as of the third.
6030640	6033640	So, I'll link that into the chat room.
6033640	6036640	But it's the same damn puzzle game you've played for the last, like, 20 years, right?
6036640	6037640	Yeah.
6037640	6038640	It's more Puyo Puyo.
6038640	6039640	All right.
6039640	6040640	But, hey, if it's got online and you say something-
6040640	6042640	It's not Puyo Puyo!
6042640	6045640	Game guru being a butt.
6045640	6046640	All right.
6046640	6049640	But you are a big fan of the Puyo Puyo series, so you'll probably buy this if no one-
6049640	6051640	I'm a big enough fan to pronounce it correctly.
6051640	6052640	All right.
6052640	6053640	Yes.
6053640	6062640	And, I don't know, we kind of talked a little bit in Part A about the new, well, not really a new game,
6062640	6066640	but, you know, Tales of Vesperia coming to the PS3.
6066640	6072640	Well, there is a new Tales game coming to the Wii as well, Tales of Graces.
6072640	6077640	And it's been announced for the Wii thanks to Fumito Magazine.
6077640	6081640	And it looks actually neat.
6081640	6088640	It's supposed to be, I don't know, similar to, I guess, the other Tales games as far as appearance goes.
6088640	6097640	They haven't really said, you know, what the game is about other than, you know, as an adventure protecting people.
6097640	6100640	Or is it just waggle, waggle, waggle?
6100640	6103640	So the last Tales game that they put out was okay on the Wii.
6103640	6107640	And then this is supposed to be coming out in Japan in the winter.
6107640	6111640	So I guess we'll see more about this later on.
6111640	6114640	Well, some rumors are going around about upcoming Wii titles.
6114640	6123640	There's apparently a list that was leaked to the internet this week showing an upcoming release date list of some various games coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
6123640	6130640	But here's the interesting thing. It dates Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort on July 10th.
6130640	6136640	It also dates, here's the other interesting thing, Wii Fit Plus on November 19th.
6136640	6141640	Nintendo repackaging something and slapping Plus in front of it? No. You don't say.
6141640	6144640	Well, now here's something you should take though from this.
6144640	6146640	And, you know, yes chatters, I am aware.
6146640	6148640	Apparently this list came out of the Netherlands.
6148640	6150640	It wasn't actually from the US.
6150640	6153640	And, you know, take it with a grain of salt.
6153640	6157640	But I think most of us are looking at this going, Wii Fit Plus? Yeah, I can see that.
6157640	6159640	And I can see that happening.
6159640	6161640	That's innovation for you.
6161640	6166640	Well, but why, you know, why Nintendo should be leaking their release dates?
6166640	6169640	I don't know what the secrecy is. It's like, my god, we're not going to tell you.
6169640	6171640	It's like, good god.
6171640	6175640	Somebody might steal the idea to repackage something and add Plus to it.
6175640	6178640	Oh, wait a second. Guilty Gear did it first.
6178640	6181640	Well, doesn't, I mean, Loki, you kind of have an insider perspective on this.
6181640	6186640	Don't sometimes the retailers and the folks on the inside have to know this a little sooner before the consumer?
6186640	6191640	Yes, because Nintendo's a bitch and they, other than providing horrible pricing on stuff,
6191640	6196640	they also require two months prior notice for as far as orders and stuff go.
6196640	6200640	And then they tell you, oh, by the way, you're only getting 10% of that.
6200640	6207640	So, yeah, something like this, I could see them, you know, positioning it as, you know, a big holiday title.
6207640	6213640	You know, they're trying to basically, because Wii Fit, you know, it's still doing very well, it's still very hard to find,
6213640	6216640	and now we're going to have Wii Fit Plus.
6216640	6219640	No, no, no, no. I saw a stack of Wiis at two different Best Buys this weekend.
6219640	6220640	Wii Fit.
6220640	6222640	Oh, sorry, Wii Fit. I've still seen that around, too.
6222640	6226640	It's still, you'd be surprised, it's still hard to get from Nintendo.
6226640	6230640	Same with Mario Kart. What the hell is up with Mario Kart? I don't get that either.
6230640	6239640	But, for whatever reason, I could totally see this happening, you know, and it's going to be something stupid.
6239640	6245640	I don't know if it's going to now support Wii Motion Plus for something, but I'm not buying it, that's for sure.
6245640	6248640	Probably more crappy minigames. I mean, well, I shouldn't say that.
6248640	6253640	You know, Wii Fit isn't bad, per se, it's just not for the hardcore gamer.
6253640	6259640	But there's definitely an audience for it. It's not a bad piece of software, let's put it that way.
6259640	6270640	But really, okay, let me put it this way. Is this what they're going to come, you know, is this what they're going to basically load their guns with for their E3 press conference?
6270640	6278640	Because if they're like, and you thought we forgot you, core gamer, Wii Fit Plus.
6278640	6281640	Yeah, because right now it's looking like more of the same, and that's scary.
6281640	6284640	Well, no, I actually think that the Motion Plus is going to be the big thing.
6284640	6290640	But my concern is, because Nintendo is such a bitch about revealing things to people or telling them stuff,
6290640	6294640	I'm just afraid that they're going to alienate the developers and nobody's going to develop anything.
6294640	6300640	You know, I think number one, they should have developed Wii, I mean the Wiimote should have had this extra sensor in it anyway.
6300640	6305640	But then I just think they're going to alienate the producers again and nobody's going to make good games for it.
6305640	6312640	Here's what's going to happen. They basically said, okay, how are we going to make money based on, you know, our previous history with stuff?
6312640	6314640	What's sold so far? Okay, let's look at it today.
6314640	6322640	Okay, what's our number one selling product? Peripheral with game for, you know, like ten bucks more, okay?
6322640	6328640	So we tried that again with the Wii Zapper. Not quite, you know, where we needed to be, you know, it's peripheral with, you know, a game.
6328640	6330640	But it still sold pretty well because of that.
6330640	6335640	Now, okay, what else sells really well? Well, everyone buys a Wii system for Wii Sports.
6335640	6340640	Okay, there we go. We're going to do Wii Sports Resort. We're going to throw in something that people need to buy.
6340640	6344640	So not only is it the Wii Sports angle, but it's also the Wii Play angle at the same time.
6344640	6347640	Oh, and now we're going to do the same thing, you know, with Wii Fit.
6347640	6352640	We're going to do Wii Fit Plus. We're going to add some other new thing that people probably don't need.
6352640	6357640	And then we're going to try to resell it again because people eat up Wii Fit and they want to buy a Wii system for Wii Fit.
6357640	6363640	What about the Core Gamer? Oh, well, you get some ported GameCube games. Sweet.
6363640	6370640	And then we get, you know, a version of Excite Truck, which has really been toned down kid-wise.
6370640	6374640	And I hear they removed the whole, you know, custom soundtrack thing, which sucks.
6374640	6377640	Why? Let's go step backwards, you know, as far as innovation goes.
6377640	6384640	And I will bet you anything there will be multiple colored Wiimotes and people will piss themselves over it because I don't know why.
6384640	6386640	Oh, I got to own a red remote now.
6386640	6394640	I just have to disagree on the MotionPlus because for a lot of us that bought the Wii, we thought it was going to have one-to-one control from the beginning.
6394640	6399640	And I still think it should have. I don't understand why they didn't just make the Wiimote with this extra.
6399640	6404640	And I've heard people, I've heard things online that say that it does add that one-to-one control and the possibilities are great.
6404640	6410640	I just, I'm going to be pissed if Nintendo alienates all the producers again and doesn't actually, you know,
6410640	6417640	like I heard that LucasArts was upset because they weren't aware of this before they came out with their lightsaber game.
6417640	6422640	Yeah, AlphaKananagram backing you up in chat says they already alienated the devs.
6422640	6425640	That lightsaber game and the game using the lightsaber, the devs were pissed.
6425640	6430640	And sure enough, what does Wii Sports Resort have? Like a fencing game that is, it's fucking lightsabers.
6430640	6433640	And so I think that the potential is huge for those of us who bought the Wii.
6433640	6438640	We were willing to sacrifice graphics because it was going to have this complete interactivity of one-to-one control.
6438640	6442640	I'm just afraid that they're not going to support people on this, so.
6442640	6449640	You know, maybe we'll get knocked completely on our ass that they're going to reveal that game for the core gamer.
6449640	6456640	They're going to, you know, Reggie's going to whip it out and say, you know, here it is, Kid Icarus, the game you've all been waiting for, something like that.
6456640	6458640	You know, and it's going to rock.
6458640	6459640	Right, I hope.
6459640	6460640	I hope.
6460640	6461640	I'm just going to put out a good music game again.
6461640	6468640	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There are patterns for a reason. And, you know, what they're going to announce, what?
6468640	6472640	A new Pikmin game. Big whoopin' shit, okay?
6472640	6478640	You know, big deal, okay? New Pikmin game. Oh, the fans have been crying for it, yada yada yada.
6478640	6479640	Maybe a new Zelda game.
6479640	6485640	Okay, we're really going to get down to the point where we're just re-releasing the same franchise games over and over.
6485640	6487640	Let's do something new, okay?
6487640	6491640	I mean, the Wii Sports stuff is okay, but let's create a new character. Let's do something different.
6491640	6494640	Let's make, you know, something really epic.
6494640	6502640	But no, we're going to, you know, now you see the majority of the people that own Wiis aren't the core gamer anymore, so you're not the target audience.
6502640	6510640	And so, unfortunately, you're not going to get these games, or if you are going to get these games, there's going to be sacrifices made, and you're going to have to wait a long time for them.
6510640	6517640	You know, so if you want your new Zelda game, well, you better be prepared to wait until, like, 2010 fall, you know, if that.
6517640	6536640	And I totally agree with you. I totally agree, and I think that my thing is with the Wii Motion Plus is that this would open up the possibility for that true new style of gaming that we were all expecting with the Wii, where it's like your virtual reality, but I'm just afraid that the third-party producers are not going to feel like they're supported by Nintendo.
6536640	6542640	I don't think that is. What's going to happen is you're going to see a bunch of these games now. It supports the Wii Motion Plus. It's a sequel, Red Steel 2.
6542640	6549640	Oh, but the controls still suck. You know, it's not going to help anything. It's good as a new tool and stuff, but it's not anything innovative.
6549640	6554640	It's not, it's not, it's just fixing a problem. That's all it is.
6554640	6562640	And it's another peripheral that they can sell for ten bucks, bundle it with a game, and then they're going to include, you know, the remotes. They're going to have it built into it now.
6562640	6567640	And then it's going to be something else. It's going to be always something to fix the flaws of what the system was.
6567640	6573640	Not new. And I won't be damn surprised if there's anything from this press conference that surprises me.
6573640	6579640	But, you know, last year it was just like, yep, stupid peripheral. Really funny.
6579640	6584640	You know, with the whole Wii Zapper. It used to be awesome. The original Wii Zapper was really kick-ass.
6584640	6588640	When they first showed off, you know, the prototype and all that stuff, they should have stuck with that.
6588640	6594640	No, now it's a plastic shell that I don't even use anymore. The third-party peripherals are better than the goddamn Wii Zapper.
6594640	6600640	All right. Well, we'll see. We are two months away from E3, and a lot of these questions will be answered.
6600640	6606640	But in the meantime, we're going to answer some of your questions by going to a segment we like to do every week known as the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
6606640	6611640	By the way, I do want to remind everybody in studio and in our chat live that we are doing List List tonight.
6611640	6617640	And the topic tonight for List List, which we'll get to a little later in the show, but everybody should be thinking about their lists, right, for List List. It's been a little while.
6617640	6624640	It would be the feature that the DSi should have had to get me to buy one today. So be thinking about that.
6624640	6631640	In the meantime, let's open up the mailbag, mailbagorangehoundsradio.com, and read some of your emails right now.
6631640	6632640	DarkSakura.
6632640	6638640	We have one from Deathwishing. Hey, guys, remember how I called and ranted about how Microsoft stole my $20?
6638640	6639640	I do remember that.
6639640	6646640	Well, patience paid off. Not only did I get my original points of $1600 back, but I threw in an extra $1600.
6646640	6651640	I guess this shows you that being polite and waiting gets you a reward better than bitching 24-7.
6651640	6655640	Anyways, I'm gonna sleep now. K, thanks, bye.
6655640	6658640	I'm glad to hear all was resolved.
6658640	6662640	This is the next one is from Isabelle.
6662640	6669640	Well, first off, I want to start off by saying hi. How's it going? I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long while now, and I hope all of it is great for you guys.
6669640	6676640	Now to get to the point of my email, I finally got to play Tatsunoko vs Capcom after what seems like a million years, and all I have to say about that game is wow.
6676640	6681640	I've heard how you guys said it was well done and really awesome, but I didn't expect it to be this awesome.
6681640	6686640	I played its arcade version, and for an arcade game, it's really good.
6686640	6688640	DarkSakura, have you gotten to play the arcade version?
6688640	6691640	Another arcade game I got to play was Tekken 6.
6691640	6698640	Just from the arcade version, I can tell that once it hits homes, no one will leave their couches. Yes, it really was that good.
6698640	6702640	So I wish you all the best, and thanks for taking time for reading this email.
6702640	6709640	I actually haven't played the arcade version yet. I never got a chance to go check it out at any of the state local places that have it.
6709640	6712640	Yeah, I had no idea there was an arcade version of Tatsunoko vs Capcom. That's pretty rad.
6712640	6714640	Well, it originally was the arcade version.
6714640	6717640	You know, and I should have known that, but yet I didn't. I don't know why.
6717640	6724640	But I have played the Wii version, and I played with Jun and Ken as my team, and I was very happy with it.
6724640	6728640	I still need to get out and play Tekken 6, because I love Tekken and everything.
6728640	6734640	So, no, but I can't really say anything else I got, you know, more about any arcade versions of them.
6734640	6738640	Just that Tatsunoko vs Capcom is super cool.
6738640	6742640	And the last email. This comes from Spirit of Radio.
6742640	6744640	Okay.
6744640	6748640	I've been playing video games since I was little and never been scared in any game.
6748640	6752640	I'm sorry, but Silent Hill 2 to 3 are boring and controls like garbage.
6752640	6755640	I will agree with some of the control issues.
6755640	6759640	The only game that honestly gave me a hard time going to sleep was the original Manhunt.
6759640	6764640	The concept of someone forcing you to do snuff films is the stuff of nightmares.
6764640	6770640	Cool first time sending guys an email. Anyways, keep up the great podcast, you guys.
6770640	6776640	Also, Manhunt is something that I find repugnant. I don't really care for the game at all.
6776640	6784640	I like the psychological type of edge. The stuff that requires intelligence and not, you know, blood.
6784640	6789640	Well, yay for first time emailers, if nothing else.
6789640	6792640	Yeah. Thanks for emailing. Keep it up.
6792640	6796640	Alright. That's it for the emails. Alright.
6796640	6802640	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for reading in a future show.
6802640	6808640	In the meantime, let's get back to some gaming news. We just have a few more stories and then we're going to get into tonight's list list.
6808640	6811640	And we're going to respond to some of the tweets we got on Twitter this week.
6811640	6813640	We're going to respond to those in just a little bit.
6813640	6815640	We got one more round of stories, though, starting off with Loki.
6815640	6821640	Yes. It's interesting how, you know, April Fool's jokes can now become reality.
6821640	6834640	Basically, THQ and the developers of Red Faction, Guerrilla, had a funny little video that they put out of a fictional weapon that they were going to, you know, originally they were teasing.
6834640	6840640	They were going to include in the game the Ostrich Hammer, which is basically a giant ostrich that you use as a hammer.
6840640	6844640	And funny enough, it actually made it into the game.
6844640	6850640	Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that the company behind it, Volition, also puts out Saints Row.
6850640	6855640	So they are, of course, very used to quirky, weird shit.
6855640	6860640	So, Ostrich Hammer, that almost sounds like something that should be in, like, Team Fortress 2, but...
6860640	6863640	Sounds like the name of a real good metal band.
6863640	6866640	Ostrich Hammer!
6866640	6869640	But, yeah, so you'll be able to hit people with an ostrich.
6869640	6874640	Well, maybe you can use the Ostrich Hammer to mash buttons as fast as you can.
6874640	6878640	It's a new app that's coming to the iPhone. It's called the Hudson Button Masher.
6878640	6882640	And, yes, all you do in this game is you mash buttons.
6882640	6884640	Look, here's the thing.
6884640	6889640	I guess what the deal is is that there's this guy at Hudson, you go all the way back,
6889640	6892640	and that's actually where the name Master Higgins comes from, was his name.
6892640	6894640	That's where the guy in Adventure Island comes from.
6894640	6902640	Apparently, he was really, really famous in the 1980s because he could actually press a button 16 times in one second.
6902640	6905640	16 times in one second, if you can believe that.
6905640	6914640	Now, they made this little device back in, like, the 80s to kind of cash in on this whole button mashing thing called the Shooting Watch.
6914640	6919640	And you could use this to try and match, beat, or try and tie this guy's score.
6919640	6926640	Well, Shooting Watch has now been ported to the iPhone, so you can try and mash buttons as fast as you want.
6926640	6927640	But here's the thing.
6927640	6930640	I don't think this thing's going to be that...
6930640	6938640	It's going to cost you 99 cents. It's not going to be as real as the real deal because I don't think the iPhone screen is good enough.
6938640	6942640	It's not going to match the electronics of an actual button.
6942640	6948640	But look, if you just want a stupid app, pointless thing, have fun.
6948640	6950640	I guess you could say a little piece of history.
6950640	6952640	There might be people that remember these things.
6952640	6953640	Whoa.
6953640	6956640	Not yet. It's not time for listless yet. Shut up.
6956640	6961640	There might be people that remember these things that want to, you know, relive it.
6961640	6963640	I guess it's 99 cents. I don't know.
6963640	6966640	Impress your friends with how fast you can hammer the screen on your iPhone.
6966640	6967640	Whatever.
6967640	6970640	Yeah, and break your iPhone screen, please.
6970640	6973640	16 times in one second.
6973640	6975640	Like, imagine, 16 times. Ready?
6975640	6977640	One 1,000.
6977640	6979640	Okay, 16 times. Right in that.
6979640	6980640	Crazy.
6980640	6982640	One more story, then listless.
6982640	6985640	That makes my brain hurt to think about.
6985640	6994640	That would have come in really freaking handy doing the drinking minigame in Chrono Trigger.
6994640	7000640	Anyway, speaking of, for iPhone, there is actually a good game coming out.
7000640	7003640	Cooking Mama's a good game. This is a good game.
7003640	7010640	There is a version of Galaga that is coming out, which was...
7010640	7016640	You could actually play this particular version in...
7016640	7021640	I do believe that it came out in 1981? No.
7021640	7024640	There was the 1995 one.
7024640	7027640	That was the Galaga Remix.
7027640	7030640	But, Galaga Remix is coming out on iPhone.
7030640	7033640	I remember that. Wasn't that packaged with Pac-Man and Dig Dug Remixes?
7033640	7034640	I do believe so.
7034640	7038640	I think so. I remember. They had that at a local arcade around here. It's closed down.
7038640	7048640	And actually, as far as I was always aware, the Galaga Remix was based off of the Galaga 90 and Galaga 88.
7048640	7051640	But that was just in my observation.
7051640	7054640	But it's supposed to be coming out on the iPhone.
7054640	7057640	And it will be $5.99.
7057640	7065640	And you can use directional buttons, but there's also a sliding method and there is a tilt method.
7065640	7068640	Which I'm going to use the buttons, I swear.
7068640	7074640	Because trying to play pole position in tilt mode is not fun.
7074640	7077640	So, it's going to be pretty good. I think it's going to be good.
7077640	7079640	I was watching a video about it. It looks pretty good.
7079640	7082640	Let's have an interesting round table on this point here before we get into the list tonight.
7082640	7084640	Because an interesting comment was said in chat.
7084640	7087640	And I think everybody might want to have to say something to this.
7087640	7089640	GameGuru in chat says,
7089640	7093640	I don't see how you love the iPhone and hate on the DSi.
7093640	7095640	Apple's worse with updating hardware.
7095640	7097640	I didn't say I hate it.
7097640	7099640	No, you as in all of us.
7099640	7101640	Well, I don't hate the DSi.
7101640	7105640	I just haven't, I have other things to spend my money on right now, like Disneyland.
7105640	7107640	As far as, for me, here it is.
7107640	7109640	I already have a Nintendo DS.
7109640	7113640	What does the DSi add to it that the DS didn't already have?
7113640	7117640	Like, you know, I'm not saying the DS is a bad gaming system. It's not.
7117640	7122640	And if you don't have a DS yet, the DSi is probably a pretty good purchase for you.
7122640	7124640	I would actually recommend it over the DS at this point.
7124640	7129640	Because you know there's going to be those games later on that are going to have the DSi only functionality.
7129640	7131640	So you might want to think about that.
7131640	7135640	But with the iPhone, at least before I got one, there was really nothing like it out there before.
7135640	7145640	And yeah, Apple's really bad about releasing these updates with the 3G and the GPS and all this stuff a year later.
7145640	7150640	But at the same time, they're also really good about updating the software.
7150640	7156640	Like, think about it. The iPhones, when they first launched, didn't have the App Store and the user-made apps and those things built into it.
7156640	7160640	So, you know, that was something that Apple added for everybody.
7160640	7166640	You know, whereas I feel like with the DSi, there was nothing being given to current DS users.
7166640	7168640	You can't update the firmware on the DS.
7168640	7170640	So, I don't know.
7170640	7174640	I think for me, there's kind of the difference in those two things.
7174640	7176640	And the iPhone's not perfect.
7176640	7184640	You know, yeah, Apple is a huge abuser of this whole, let's upgrade the whole thing in a year and watch everybody buy it all over again.
7184640	7187640	But, you know, we give them crap for that, too, and it's deserved.
7187640	7192640	So, anyway, speaking of that, let's get to tonight's List List.
7198640	7202640	Now, I know it's been a while since we've done one of these on the show, so let me remind everybody how it works.
7202640	7206640	We are going to make the ultimate list, the definitive top three list.
7206640	7209640	And we're going to use our live chatters to help, along with the folks here in studio.
7209640	7212640	Those of us here in studio have paired our top three answers.
7212640	7216640	We're going to compile those into a list of 12, since there's four of us tonight.
7216640	7222640	Then we're going to go around the room and each one of us is going to take something off of the list, leaving a list of eight.
7222640	7228640	Then you guys in chat will vote on that list of eight and make our top three using your votes.
7228640	7232640	And then we will have the definitive top three list, no arguments, no debates.
7232640	7234640	It is the official list.
7234640	7236640	All right.
7236640	7239640	I say that, but of course there's always room for debate.
7239640	7244640	Okay, so that being said, tonight's topic, feature that should have been on the DSI that would have got me to buy one today.
7244640	7246640	Who wants to start us off tonight?
7246640	7249640	How about Loki? Loki's always got some evil answers for us.
7249640	7252640	Loki, what is your number three answer of the feature the DSI should have had?
7252640	7255640	You know, I was thinking a bunch of different things.
7255640	7257640	Let me say this, I'm sorry, real quick.
7257640	7262640	If it matters, if you have ideas, put them in our chat room, because if one of us gets an answer stolen,
7262640	7266640	like somebody else says the same answer we were going to use, usually we take backup answers from chat.
7266640	7268640	So just want to get that out there.
7268640	7269640	Which would be kind of neat.
7269640	7274640	I mean, I don't really use this on the Wii, but like the DSI message board.
7274640	7279640	You know, basically allowing you to send emails and attachments and stuff like that to each other.
7279640	7285640	Really, you know, DSI should have a lot of stuff that the Wii has, but you know, that's what I'm going to start with.
7285640	7288640	Alright, not a smart-ass answer from Loki, I'm impressed.
7288640	7290640	That's a very reasonable good answer.
7290640	7294640	Should be a way to email each other and have, you know, all that stuff.
7294640	7295640	A DSI message board, I like that.
7295640	7296640	The Doctor!
7296640	7297640	We'll just go on a line here.
7297640	7301640	Doctor, what is the number three feature the DSI should have had to get you to buy one today?
7301640	7302640	Voice recognition.
7302640	7305640	Software.
7305640	7307640	I think that would be an awesome feature in games.
7307640	7309640	You speak and then it responds.
7309640	7313640	Well now, I think about brain training and you have the blue and some of those things, but what would be-
7313640	7321640	It's so rudimentary, like actual practical where you could say, you know, you cast a spell in a fantasy game and they do it, you know.
7321640	7323640	I want to cast Magic Missile!
7323640	7325640	Yeah, really fully developed voice recognition software.
7325640	7327640	Improved voice, okay, I can go with that.
7327640	7328640	Alright, alright, cool.
7328640	7335640	Alright, I'll go next and my number three answer I'm going to use tonight is open app development like the iPhone.
7335640	7339640	That they should open up, because they're going to have this DSI downloadable stuff, I think they should open it up.
7339640	7343640	I think open app development is going to be my number three answer.
7343640	7346640	That anybody should be able to make a DS game.
7346640	7350640	Because the community, I think, could come up with some good stuff and maybe like a message board.
7350640	7354640	And I think it's been very good for the iPhone, so if we're going to make that comparison, then there you go.
7354640	7356640	DarkSoccer, you're number three.
7356640	7359640	Me.
7359640	7360640	Interesting.
7360640	7370640	I honestly think having your me being able to travel, you know, from your Wii to your DSi to go visit other people's, you know.
7370640	7373640	Technically they can already do that.
7373640	7376640	Well, they're going to have support for it, but yeah, they should.
7376640	7380640	You haven't integrated it into the actual OS of the system.
7380640	7387640	And I think it's kind of forgotten that you can put those things on the Wiimote, too, because there's not a lot of practical use for it.
7387640	7388640	You know what I mean?
7388640	7389640	I've brought mine over to your house before that way.
7389640	7390640	I remember that.
7390640	7391640	I remember that.
7391640	7392640	Okay, so Mii integration, I guess we could say.
7392640	7393640	Better use of the Miis on DS.
7393640	7394640	I like that idea.
7394640	7395640	Okay, Loki.
7395640	7401640	You know what would be kind of cool?
7401640	7402640	Bluetooth.
7402640	7403640	Okay.
7403640	7406640	Because just think of it as you will.
7406640	7410640	You could use your Wii Remote for motion sensitive games.
7410640	7414640	You know, not necessarily obviously waggling your Wii Remote around, but like racing games or something like that.
7414640	7417640	You could use it for wireless headsets.
7417640	7420640	Okay, okay.
7420640	7423640	Communication with other devices.
7423640	7424640	Okay.
7424640	7427640	The doctor, what's your number two?
7427640	7431640	The tilt feature, the motion feature like the iPhone is.
7431640	7436640	Are you guys wanting to turn the DSI into an iPhone?
7436640	7437640	What's going on here?
7437640	7438640	Oh, I guess I did one, too.
7438640	7441640	All right, what do you think the tilt feature would add to the DSI?
7441640	7449640	Well, gimmicks, but it seems like that would not have been a useless feature like the camera.
7449640	7450640	I'm sorry.
7450640	7458640	All right, my number two answer I'm going to say is, okay, I'm going to give the first smart ass answer of the night.
7458640	7464640	A virtual boy slot would have been something, too, since they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot.
7464640	7471640	Give me a virtual boy slot to give me a use for those games that are just collecting dust from the great red headache machine of death.
7471640	7476640	So a virtual boy slot.
7476640	7482640	Dark Sakura, your number two pick for a feature that you most would want to see in the DSI that would have gotten you to buy one.
7482640	7483640	TV tuner.
7483640	7486640	Oh, I like, I like that.
7486640	7487640	Okay, TV tuner.
7487640	7495640	I mean, if the freaking Turbo Express, the handheld Turbo Graphics could have a TV tuner.
7495640	7497640	And NEC didn't really, well, they kind of did.
7497640	7501640	But anyway, why can't the other links have one, too?
7501640	7502640	Why not?
7502640	7503640	Why the heck not?
7503640	7505640	Okay, I'll tell you why not.
7505640	7506640	The nomad.
7506640	7507640	No, I'm kidding.
7507640	7509640	Because they're getting rid of analog TV signals soon.
7509640	7510640	Doesn't matter.
7510640	7511640	Have a digital TV tuner.
7511640	7512640	No.
7512640	7513640	That's impossible.
7513640	7514640	Yes.
7514640	7516640	Impossible.
7516640	7517640	All right.
7517640	7519640	Now we're getting to the number one answers.
7519640	7524640	The number one feature you want to see in the DSI that would get you to buy the system right now.
7524640	7526640	Loki, what is your number one answer?
7526640	7531640	My number one answer is there's nothing they can do.
7531640	7538640	Honestly, they would have to, it's made out of bacon.
7538640	7539640	I don't know.
7539640	7551640	I have no number one answer.
7551640	7553640	Made out of bacon.
7553640	7556640	Or at least scratch and sniff bacon smell.
7556640	7557640	I don't know how with that.
7557640	7558640	Made out of bacon.
7558640	7559640	Bacon integration.
7559640	7560640	All right.
7560640	7561640	I like made out of bacon.
7561640	7562640	All right.
7562640	7569640	The DSI would sell, you would have bought one today and it was made out of bacon.
7569640	7574640	The doctor, your number one answer for what would have got you to buy the DSI today.
7574640	7576640	Since I guess the theme is crazy stuff now.
7576640	7580640	Like, you know, you can interact with it, it can interact with you back.
7580640	7585640	So like an energy hand will come out and like slap you in the face.
7585640	7588640	Is that your real answer?
7588640	7589640	That is.
7589640	7590640	And my final answer.
7590640	7594640	Energy hands.
7594640	7596640	You know, there's so many apps for that.
7596640	7597640	Slap in the face.
7597640	7601640	Helps with self-trouser fornication.
7601640	7609640	Hands made out of pure energy.
7609640	7610640	All right.
7610640	7614640	My number one answer, it's a little bit long, but this is a true answer by the way.
7614640	7616640	This is not a smart ass answer.
7616640	7620640	My number one answer for the thing that would have most got me to buy a DSI today.
7620640	7625640	Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.
7625640	7633640	My runner up answer would have been a multi-touch touch screen, but you know.
7633640	7635640	Like anything with a multi-touch touch screen.
7635640	7639640	We're not just limiting it to the iPhone.
7639640	7640640	All right.
7640640	7641640	Enough about you.
7641640	7642640	Let's talk about me and my answer some more.
7642640	7645640	Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.
7645640	7647640	I think that speaks for itself.
7647640	7650640	I bought these games for five damn dollars.
7650640	7652640	I ought to have the right to download it.
7652640	7653640	PS3 does it.
7653640	7655640	Why can't Nintendo do it?
7655640	7657640	Why can't you do it?
7657640	7660640	You got rid of the advanced slot, so don't give me that argument you released on the Game Boy Advance.
7660640	7662640	But now I can't play them anymore.
7662640	7666640	So he does what Nintendon't.
7666640	7668640	All right.
7668640	7671640	DarkSakura, your number one answer.
7671640	7680640	Mine would be to take PictoChat and make it truly networking, as in you can hop on the Wi-Fi,
7680640	7684640	and you don't have to be just in the general vicinity of somebody else with one.
7684640	7691640	You can draw penises on full-blown penor on people's DSIs in Malaysia.
7691640	7692640	Or an enhancement of that.
7692640	7696640	It could be like there's a camera on it, like video chat.
7696640	7699640	Can I just say PictoChat across the internets?
7699640	7700640	That would be cool.
7700640	7701640	All right.
7701640	7702640	There you go.
7702640	7709640	Although my bullshit answer could either be a Jelly Belly dispenser or gay porn.
7709640	7710640	Gay porn.
7710640	7711640	All right.
7711640	7712640	Gay porn always sells.
7712640	7715640	Let's see what the chat room had to say with some answers there.
7715640	7716640	Let's see.
7716640	7720640	We had a DDR pad was one answer.
7720640	7722640	Airport tuner, shortwave tuner.
7722640	7724640	We tried a DDR pad, remember?
7724640	7726640	Legend of Zelda ghost camera.
7726640	7727640	A vibrator.
7727640	7733640	I think I saw different forms of vibrator, a trance vibrator was one that came up as
7733640	7734640	well.
7734640	7735640	Let's see.
7735640	7736640	What do we have as well?
7736640	7738640	Laser Cats DSI game at launch would have made it better.
7738640	7740640	That's from S2100mat.
7740640	7741640	Virtual handheld for Mac Dev.
7741640	7742640	Kind of like my answer.
7742640	7745640	How about a fart sound maker or a swear button from the Dark Knight?
7745640	7746640	All right.
7746640	7747640	There you go.
7747640	7748640	Some of the answers we have from chat.
7748640	7749640	But sadly...
7749640	7750640	You know, they did make a DDR pad, though, for the Game Boy back in the day.
7750640	7751640	Way back in the day.
7751640	7752640	I have one.
7752640	7755640	Because they brought out the super midi version of DDR.
7755640	7756640	They were kind of shit.
7756640	7757640	They were funny.
7757640	7759640	Was it for your fingers, though?
7759640	7760640	Yeah.
7760640	7763640	ActDeft wins a RuPaul game for the DSiWare.
7763640	7764640	All right.
7764640	7766640	Here's the list so far, but now we're going to get to the elimination round.
7766640	7767640	Here we go.
7767640	7768640	DSI message board.
7768640	7770640	Voice recognition software.
7770640	7771640	Open app development.
7771640	7772640	Miis.
7772640	7773640	Bluetooth integration.
7773640	7775640	Tilt feature like the iPhone.
7775640	7776640	Virtual voice slot.
7776640	7777640	TV tuner.
7777640	7778640	Made out of bacon.
7778640	7779640	Energy hands.
7779640	7784640	Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.
7784640	7786640	And PictoChat across the internets.
7786640	7794640	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7794640	7797640	Energy hands, I'm sorry.
7797640	7798640	Energy hands.
7798640	7801640	Maybe just a little too soon for energy hands.
7801640	7802640	All right.
7802640	7805640	The Doctor, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7805640	7807640	The virtual voice slot.
7807640	7808640	Oh, you bastard.
7808640	7809640	All right.
7809640	7812640	Virtual voice slot comes off the list.
7812640	7817640	I am going to say, I have to be honest, the one I've got to take out is voice recognition
7817640	7818640	software.
7818640	7823640	Sorry, Doctor, that's not a retaliation thing, but I just think that would be hoarded to
7823640	7827640	the extreme and would just make the thing crap.
7827640	7829640	Dark soccer is going to be the last one to eliminate dark soccer.
7829640	7832640	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7832640	7836640	It was a toss-up between one and made out of bacon.
7836640	7839640	And I'm going to take out the tilt function because I'd rather be made out of bacon than
7839640	7840640	have tilt function.
7840640	7841640	All right.
7841640	7842640	So there you go.
7842640	7843640	Trust me.
7843640	7847640	I don't want them to even remotely consider it because some of these iPhone games are
7847640	7849640	unplayable because they have tilt function.
7849640	7850640	All right.
7850640	7851640	Fair enough.
7851640	7852640	Fair enough.
7852640	7855640	But then you have some good ones, too, like Rolando is kind of cool.
7855640	7856640	Let's check it out.
7856640	7858640	But I like bacon, too.
7858640	7859640	No, seriously.
7859640	7860640	Fair enough.
7860640	7863640	Every Friday after typography class now I have to go have bacon because bacon is meat
7863640	7864640	candy.
7864640	7865640	Fair enough.
7865640	7866640	All right.
7866640	7867640	So here we go.
7867640	7869640	Now here's the list you guys will vote on.
7869640	7875640	Spotify message board, open app development, Miis, Bluetooth integration, TV tuner, made
7875640	7881640	out of bacon, virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit,
7881640	7883640	and Picto chats across the internets.
7883640	7884640	Place vote now.
7884640	7888640	Send a private message with your number one and number two answer.
7888640	7892640	Make sure both are labeled or I will assume the first is your number one.
7892640	7896640	Send those over private message to Rob Roberts in chat room.
7896640	7899640	And if you don't know how to do that, ask somebody or maybe somebody will mention it
7899640	7901640	in chat how to do that right now.
7901640	7905640	Place those votes within the next 120 seconds you have to vote.
7905640	7911640	And we will tally it up and reveal for you who won a little later on in the show.
7911640	7917640	For now, while those votes are coming in, let's take a trip over to our Twitter.
7917640	7920640	And we're actually going to look at, you know, we put a call out on Twitter today saying,
7920640	7922640	you know, we're a little short on stories this week.
7922640	7924640	What do you guys want to see us talk about?
7924640	7926640	And we put the call out on Twitter.
7926640	7931640	And we did get some replies, some various tweets in our response here.
7931640	7933640	And I wanted to read some of those for you guys right now,
7933640	7937640	although right now I'm seeing a lot of gaming weeks.
7937640	7938640	Let's see.
7938640	7940640	We talked about the, let's see.
7940640	7943640	Act Def says talk about the March Madness winner some more.
7943640	7944640	We kind of talked about that already.
7944640	7948640	DJ Ratchet wants to know about the new PSP and PS2 Jackson Dexter game,
7948640	7950640	which we talked about earlier.
7950640	7955640	ZakuPilot256 asks, DSI, is it worth the upgrade?
7955640	7960640	Can I get a side of handheld console wars as well, please, lol.
7960640	7962640	There hasn't been a lot of PSP bashing tonight.
7962640	7963640	I don't know.
7963640	7967640	Is there, is the DSI, I mean, okay, let me back up.
7967640	7970640	The PSP's kind of a little bit behind in the console wars right now,
7970640	7974640	but the DSI is kind of out there to increase the lead, so to speak.
7974640	7976640	I know what we could talk about.
7976640	7979640	Did you hear about that news story where Sony apparently put out a press release
7979640	7983640	saying that, basically saying the DSI was a kiddie system,
7983640	7987640	and then touted that it had a Miley Cyrus game in the exact same press release.
7987640	7989640	Did you hear about that?
7989640	7993640	Well, I mean, they have their own kiddie stuff on the PSP,
7993640	7998640	but yes, it's mainly the DS that has kiddie stuff,
7998640	8002640	but that's, you have to understand, though, there's a double edge to everything.
8002640	8005640	I mean, because, yeah, you know why there's more kiddie games in there?
8005640	8009640	Because more kids own a DS than a PSP.
8009640	8010640	D'oh.
8010640	8012640	Well, you know, I got to disagree with that a little.
8012640	8015640	I just, I don't like all these uber-violent, uber-serious games.
8015640	8018640	I'm like, I fall asleep watching COD, I'm sorry.
8018640	8024640	So I like the more down-to-earth or the more silly games myself, so.
8024640	8026640	Well, but here's the thing, and I still feel this way,
8026640	8031640	and you know, maybe, okay, the PSP is still like games and more.
8031640	8034640	It might not be the best system at games, even though it still has,
8034640	8038640	you know, it does have Disada, it does have some games that are pretty awesome,
8038640	8041640	but the PSP is still, you know, for that college kid.
8041640	8046640	This is like the great college system, because you've got your MP3 player,
8046640	8048640	you've got your little internet browser you can use at Starbucks,
8048640	8051640	you've got your gaming system, you know, it's all right there.
8051640	8055640	And I think the DSi was trying to compete with that a little bit,
8055640	8058640	but it didn't work, because, you know, where's the internet?
8058640	8060640	Where is the MP3 player built in?
8060640	8061640	None of that is here.
8061640	8065640	So I still think the PSP excels at being more than a gaming,
8065640	8068640	but if all you want is handheld games, I think the DS still wins.
8068640	8071640	And then also the DSi, though, I mean, their music player is kind of crap,
8071640	8074640	because it's only the AAC format or whatever,
8074640	8077640	which I understand, you know, iTunes and stuff, that's fine,
8077640	8079640	but really I think it should have been MP3.
8079640	8081640	I mean, come on, man, give it the times.
8081640	8084640	And then also, you know, there's the internet browser,
8084640	8090640	which apparently is not very good anyways, so it's like, ugh, okay, whatever.
8090640	8094640	And then, you know, what, the photo manipulation stuff?
8094640	8096640	Really? Is that what you're going to do?
8096640	8098640	A photo manipulation? Is that really that important?
8098640	8100640	Are we going to, like, throw those around the internet now
8100640	8103640	and take pictures and manipulate them with silly faces,
8103640	8106640	like you couldn't do that in Microsoft Paint or something?
8106640	8108640	I mean, come on.
8108640	8112640	It's just, it's got potential, but they're never going to utilize it,
8112640	8113640	and that's sad.
8113640	8116640	I like AcidicVampire's response in chat.
8116640	8120640	In the PSP's defense, the games look saucier.
8120640	8121640	I like that word, saucier.
8121640	8124640	They could have had MP3 support if Nintendo had paid a license,
8124640	8127640	just like the Wii could have played DVDs if they had paid the license
8127640	8130640	for, you know, the use of DVD codecs.
8130640	8133640	But you know what? You know what's more important than Nintendo?
8133640	8134640	Money in their pocket.
8134640	8138640	So, you know, so much for that, you know,
8138640	8141640	and so I guess the consumer loses because Nintendo needs to make a buck.
8141640	8145640	Yeah, but nobody uses their consoles to play movies, though, anymore,
8145640	8147640	I don't think, anyway.
8147640	8149640	I use my consoles to play movies all the time.
8149640	8151640	It's my primary DVD player.
8151640	8154640	Whatever happens with it, PlayStation 3 is my primary movie player.
8154640	8160640	We do use it for Blu-ray, and our HD DVD player is our Xbox 360.
8160640	8163640	You know, and whatever I happen to have hooked up at the time,
8163640	8165640	you know, it would be kind of cool to have, you know,
8165640	8168640	a DVD player for the Wii.
8168640	8170640	Don't be surprised if that's, like, not something
8170640	8171640	that they're going to start selling to.
8171640	8174640	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
8174640	8176640	And yeah, I know most people already have DVD players,
8176640	8178640	but you know what?
8178640	8182640	People also have TVs, too, but yet still buy tons of TVs out there.
8182640	8184640	And who cares? It's another DVD player.
8184640	8185640	That's the point.
8185640	8187640	You know, we may be in the kids' room or something like that,
8187640	8189640	now, boom, it's a DVD player in the kids' room.
8189640	8193640	So, you know, I don't know.
8193640	8198640	Minor cost for, you know, another bullet point.
8198640	8200640	So, whatever.
8200640	8201640	All right, I'm still trying to tally the votes,
8201640	8203640	so let's move on to another topic here.
8203640	8205640	Crows asks on Twitter,
8205640	8208640	maybe talk about some April Fools' jokes that spread on the internet
8208640	8209640	that were actually entertaining.
8209640	8210640	I don't like April Fools' Day at all,
8210640	8213640	although I think, you know, for hating April Fools' Day,
8213640	8215640	I think Dark Tetsuya did a pretty funny one on our site,
8215640	8217640	where he did for I Heart that song,
8217640	8219640	he did Let Them Move from DD,
8219640	8222640	which is, like, a total throwback to the old school days
8222640	8223640	of Orange Lounge Radio.
8223640	8226640	So, like, I like dumb shit like that.
8226640	8228640	I don't know.
8228640	8230640	Loki, Dark Soccer, did you guys see anything funny on the internet?
8230640	8232640	I kind of turn off the internet on April Fools' Day.
8232640	8233640	This year, they actually kind of,
8233640	8236640	a lot of the sites that would normally do April Fools' jokes didn't.
8236640	8239640	They're just like, you know, I'm too busy with stuff, so forget it.
8239640	8244640	You know, basically, I saw a few in, like, the hacking communities,
8244640	8245640	like, some, you know, people,
8245640	8247640	oh, yeah, look, we're releasing, you know,
8247640	8249640	a tool to hack the PSP 3000,
8249640	8252640	or, you know, a new one to hack the Wii or something,
8252640	8254640	and it's just, whatever, you know,
8254640	8256640	those we kind of figured were fake.
8256640	8258640	And then, um,
8258640	8262640	I'm trying to think here, what are some of the other, you know,
8262640	8265640	April Fools' jokes that were just very obvious?
8265640	8267640	The new Metal Gear Solid game,
8267640	8269640	you know, they announced, you know,
8269640	8271640	what the new character was going to be,
8271640	8272640	which is kind of retarded,
8272640	8273640	and then, um,
8273640	8275640	I'm trying to think here.
8275640	8276640	They were kind of lame.
8276640	8278640	I mean, it was, you know,
8278640	8281640	the World of Warcraft thing that they did was kind of cool,
8281640	8284640	and then there was another one with IGN,
8284640	8286640	you know, tried to do this,
8286640	8289640	Wii Extend or Wii Expand or something like that,
8289640	8292640	which was supposed to be download content for, like, Wii games,
8292640	8297640	and the first one was Super Smash Brothers Brawl Extreme,
8297640	8300640	where they were going to have, like, blood and stuff like that,
8300640	8302640	and it just looked so fake, and, you know,
8302640	8305640	they had Mario getting decapitated and stuff like that.
8305640	8308640	You know, despite all the shit we give the mainstream press sometimes on this show
8308640	8309640	and all that stuff,
8309640	8313640	I think their Zelda trailer will never be topped.
8313640	8315640	That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' joke.
8315640	8316640	That was great.
8316640	8317640	That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' prank.
8317640	8321640	Not for the fact that I don't think anyone really fell for it,
8321640	8324640	but just, like, goddamn, they went all out with that shit that year,
8324640	8325640	and I think, like,
8325640	8328640	and, Doctor, you're a big Zelda fanboy.
8328640	8331640	Did you not get a huge boner April Fools' or not at that trailer?
8331640	8333640	No, and obviously it was fake,
8333640	8334640	but yeah, I mean,
8334640	8337640	if you've ever seen the fan-made Zelda movies,
8337640	8339640	I mean, this was, like, a bazillion,
8339640	8342640	the production value was pretty good.
8342640	8344640	And sadly enough, it will never come to fruition,
8344640	8345640	which is, you know,
8345640	8347640	I don't think it would cost that much,
8347640	8348640	you know, for something like that.
8348640	8350640	Now, this wasn't even an April Fools' thing,
8350640	8351640	but have you seen,
8351640	8353640	there's a trailer for a movie that someone made,
8353640	8355640	or short movie, called Turbo,
8355640	8357640	which is a little bit of a cross between, like,
8357640	8359640	Street Fighter and Tron and, you know,
8359640	8360640	the Karate Kid.
8360640	8362640	And it actually looks pretty cool,
8362640	8364640	and that's also made, you know, with a really low budget and stuff,
8364640	8366640	so, you know, nowadays,
8366640	8368640	you know, you can do pretty amazing stuff.
8368640	8369640	Hell, I mean, look at that,
8369640	8372640	was it the Half-Life short,
8372640	8374640	or it was, like, a series that's going on,
8374640	8377640	and I gotta wonder if they've got more episodes for that,
8377640	8379640	but, you know, the guys did it, like, on a shoestring budget,
8379640	8381640	and it's just, like, it's amazing.
8381640	8384640	It's absolutely amazing as far as visuals and stuff go,
8384640	8386640	which is sad, because sci-fi movies look like crap,
8386640	8388640	you know, like the sci-fi channel stuff,
8388640	8390640	so if a guy can do it in his basement,
8390640	8392640	then why can't they?
8392640	8396640	All right, and then one other thing on Twitter
8396640	8397640	I thought was pretty interesting,
8397640	8400640	and, you know, our good friend Marin,
8400640	8402640	or Tiara, whatever you want to say,
8402640	8404640	kind of likes to pimp her own stuff,
8404640	8406640	but I liked it.
8406640	8408640	It was actually a piece that she wrote on her own blog,
8408640	8411640	which I've jokingly referred to as the Giggling Girls blog,
8411640	8414640	but, no, it's what, AvengersTower.com?
8414640	8415640	Yes, it is.
8415640	8417640	I can't remember if it's Avenger Tower or Avengers Tower.
8417640	8418640	It's Avengers Tower.
8418640	8419640	Avengers Tower.
8419640	8422640	Like the old comic?
8422640	8424640	Like the Avengers Tower and the comic books.
8424640	8426640	Gotcha.
8426640	8429640	It was an article about the Beatles rock band,
8429640	8431640	which we talked about a couple weeks on the show,
8431640	8434640	but what I liked was there was this article she read on March 29th
8434640	8439640	about how the Beatles rock band game is going to carry a price tag
8439640	8443640	that's like $60 more than the current Rock Band 2 bundle,
8443640	8447640	and she's kind of speculating where could this extra $60 be coming from,
8447640	8448640	and I like some of the ideas.
8448640	8450640	One rumor was a keyboard,
8450640	8453640	which I think is more of a wishful thinking,
8453640	8454640	at least on my part.
8454640	8456640	I would love to see a keyboard, but I don't know.
8456640	8457640	I mean, definitely there are some Beatles songs
8457640	8459640	that would benefit from keyboard integration.
8459640	8462640	Another idea was extra microphones,
8462640	8465640	so maybe you could have more than one person singing.
8465640	8467640	You could have two people singing at once.
8467640	8469640	To kind of go with the keyboard thing,
8469640	8472640	their site, I don't know if it's viral or what,
8472640	8474640	but their actual, the Beatles site,
8474640	8479640	they've been having instruments slowly being added to their studio recording room,
8479640	8481640	and one of the instruments was a keyboard.
8481640	8483640	Hmm. Interesting.
8483640	8487640	Rumor number three, drums with cymbals
8487640	8490640	that maybe they're actually going to put actual cymbals or whatever
8490640	8492640	on the drum kit for the Rock Band.
8492640	8494640	Well, they did say that, you know, later on,
8494640	8496640	it's potential that they can have like, say,
8496640	8497640	Rock Band 3 or something like that,
8497640	8499640	where cymbals would be their own notes,
8499640	8500640	which is kind of cool.
8500640	8503640	Another rumor, two guitars instead of one.
8503640	8505640	Instead of, why not have the whole band?
8505640	8508640	I think it's more that is what's going to be why it's more expensive,
8508640	8511640	is the second guitar, I think, is going to be in there,
8511640	8512640	because they're going to model the bass.
8512640	8514640	They're probably going to have an actual bass and then a guitar.
8514640	8518640	And the last rumor, just milking the damn cash cow.
8518640	8519640	Milking the damn cash cow.
8519640	8521640	I really hope it's the keyboard one,
8521640	8525640	but I think, Loki, I think it's going to be one of their bass guitars
8525640	8527640	with the regular guitar, I think.
8527640	8529640	Especially because you have the,
8529640	8533640	and she goes into talking about the whole Hoffner violin bass,
8533640	8536640	which, you know, it seems likely that, you know,
8536640	8537640	with the Beatles and everything,
8537640	8540640	they would have like a special, you know, Beatles bass.
8540640	8543640	That seems likely.
8543640	8545640	Some folks in chat are saying, you know,
8545640	8547640	what about like a strobe light?
8547640	8548640	They can already buy that.
8548640	8550640	Oh, no, they're talking, oh, no, no, no, no.
8550640	8551640	They're talking about Nine Inch Nails.
8551640	8553640	I guess their April Fool's joke or something like that
8553640	8559640	had something to do with, oh, it was the album.
8559640	8561640	Oh, that Nine Inch Nails was putting out a new album
8561640	8564640	that was produced by Timbaland called Strobe Light.
8564640	8567640	That was a good April Fool's joke that was out on the internet.
8567640	8573640	All right, let's get into the listless results.
8573640	8576640	So we can get to your calls,
8576640	8579640	last minute stories, and the end of the show pretty soon.
8579640	8581640	Believe it or not, for being a slower Newsweek,
8581640	8583640	we sure seem to fill a couple of hours
8583640	8585640	and then some here on the show.
8585640	8587640	All right, here are your top three tonight,
8587640	8589640	the definitive list, as you guys in chat have voted
8589640	8592640	for the feature that they should have put on the DSI
8592640	8594640	that would have made me buy one today.
8594640	8599640	Number three, open app development, just like the iPhone.
8599640	8600640	Let anybody make an app.
8600640	8602640	There you go, open app development.
8602640	8606640	Number two feature that would have got me to buy a DSI today,
8606640	8608640	made out of bacon.
8608640	8610640	Made out of bacon was the number two feature.
8610640	8611640	There you go.
8611640	8613640	Where there's bacon, there's profit.
8613640	8617640	And the number one feature that would have gotten people
8617640	8622640	to buy the DSI today, virtual console games on my goddamn DS,
8622640	8624640	you money-sucking pieces of shit.
8624640	8629640	There it is, your number one answer on the list.
8629640	8632640	List segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8632640	8635640	All right, all right.
8635640	8638640	Lots of votes spread around amongst all the choices, though.
8638640	8639640	Everybody got a little love,
8639640	8642640	but I think those three struck a particular nerve,
8642640	8645640	because people just love their bacon and virtual console
8645640	8647640	and open app development.
8647640	8650640	All right, actdeft makes a good point.
8650640	8654640	If anybody can make an app, you know who will make his game a reality.
8654640	8657640	That individual who has a game named after himself.
8657640	8659640	Well, you know whose game sucks balls,
8659640	8661640	because I've actually played the demo,
8661640	8664640	and it's as crappy as it looks.
8664640	8669640	And I'm sorry, I don't care if it's one person developing it.
8669640	8672640	It's not good, and I would never...
8672640	8677640	If I paid retail for that, I'd have to kick myself in the junk.
8677640	8681640	BlackWolf asks in chat, what if Bobby BlackWolf made a game?
8681640	8684640	Would you talk about it if I called it Bobby's Game?
8684640	8686640	Yes, I would talk about it every week.
8686640	8688640	Every week, Bobby. Every week.
8688640	8689640	As long as it didn't suck.
8689640	8691640	In fact, I think you should beat him to the market,
8691640	8693640	because I would laugh my ass off at that.
8693640	8694640	Do it now.
8694640	8695640	But only if the theme song to the game is
8695640	8699640	La la la la, la la la la, Bobby's World.
8699640	8700640	No?
8700640	8703640	Oh, my God.
8703640	8705640	All right.
8705640	8708640	Also, before we get to the Skype line and so forth,
8708640	8710640	we have one segment we always do here on the show
8710640	8711640	that we don't want to miss,
8711640	8713640	but we just haven't had any really angsty stories.
8713640	8717640	But perhaps the invoking of said name,
8717640	8720640	of said band individual from said show,
8720640	8721640	and just even thinking about his game
8721640	8723640	should invoke anger and rage
8723640	8726640	in a certain segment we do here every week on Orange Launch Radio.
8726640	8741640	.
8741640	8743640	FUs of the Week.
8743640	8748640	Um, man, making me be angry, and I was starting to feel good.
8748640	8752640	Um, FU to having to go to work tomorrow.
8752640	8758640	Just, I really, I, you know, that's all.
8758640	8761640	I just really want to stay home and sleep.
8761640	8763640	What's wrong with that?
8763640	8765640	So, FU being tired.
8765640	8768640	FU to this glass of wine I'm drinking for being so yummy
8768640	8770640	and making me a little tipsy during the show.
8770640	8771640	I love it.
8771640	8772640	It's freaking delicious.
8772640	8774640	It's a muscata?
8774640	8775640	It's a muscato.
8775640	8776640	Muscato.
8776640	8777640	It's delicious.
8777640	8778640	It's a sweet wine.
8778640	8779640	It tastes like candy.
8779640	8780640	Mm-hmm.
8780640	8782640	It tastes like champagne without the bubbles,
8782640	8783640	as my friend put it.
8783640	8785640	It's delish.
8785640	8787640	Hey there, doctor.
8787640	8788640	Do you have any FUs of the Week,
8788640	8789640	even though Loki's holding the mic?
8789640	8791640	Yeah, even though this is a little old news,
8791640	8793640	I had a lady confront me about this the other day.
8793640	8795640	Fuck you to anyone who doesn't support gay marriage,
8795640	8797640	because you are fucking assholes.
8797640	8799640	Props to Iowa, though.
8799640	8801640	Props to Iowa, of all places.
8801640	8804640	Props to them, although I have heard those comparisons about,
8804640	8806640	well, isn't Iowa just doing what California did,
8806640	8808640	like, five years ago, which, or however long ago it was,
8808640	8809640	like, three years ago,
8809640	8811640	which ended up getting turned around by Prop 8 anyway.
8811640	8813640	Maybe, but I hear it's harder
8813640	8815640	to pass a constitutional amendment in that state,
8815640	8819640	so if you live in Iowa, please don't screw this up.
8819640	8822640	Please don't screw this up.
8822640	8824640	But right now, hey, you know,
8824640	8827640	I think some person in Iowa is probably really concerned.
8827640	8829640	I actually read about this somewhere,
8829640	8831640	that they are concerned,
8831640	8834640	the conservative moral majority, let's say, in Iowa,
8834640	8840640	that there's just going to be this outbreak of gay-ness
8840640	8842640	throughout the state.
8842640	8844640	It's going to become a gay mecca.
8844640	8846640	Like, there's just going to be a sodomy outbreak
8846640	8849640	within the state of Iowa because of this law passing.
8849640	8851640	You know what?
8851640	8853640	Why is that a bad thing?
8853640	8858640	Like, maybe people can come clean the place up,
8858640	8862640	throw a party in Des Moines that people want to come to.
8862640	8863640	And make it fierce.
8863640	8866640	Quick, when I say Des Moines, what do you think of?
8866640	8868640	My crappy customer.
8868640	8871640	Silent S. That's corn.
8871640	8873640	There's not a lot else I can think of.
8873640	8875640	All right, anyway.
8875640	8877640	ZakuPilot256 in chat says,
8877640	8880640	if gay people want to ruin their life with marriage, let them.
8880640	8882640	Amen to that. All right, anyhow.
8882640	8885640	Didn't I say it in my little rant that I put in my blog?
8885640	8889640	That everyone should have as much right to mess it up
8889640	8891640	like, you know, anyone else?
8891640	8894640	Just like Britney Spears. We have every right to fuck it up like Britney Spears did.
8894640	8896640	All right, look, I don't want to turn this into a political show,
8896640	8899640	but obviously it's an issue important to myself and the doctor.
8899640	8901640	So yay, Iowa.
8901640	8903640	F you. Everybody else.
8903640	8906640	All right. Yeah, Loki, please, your F you is the week.
8906640	8910640	My F you is the week goes to some of my airsoft guns not working correctly.
8910640	8913640	Did your airsoft thing, did you get to have that?
8913640	8915640	Because I saw multiple pleas on live channel,
8915640	8917640	and we were like, pretty please come play airsoft with me.
8917640	8919640	And I felt bad, I wanted to go, but I had plans.
8919640	8922640	No, we had like three people, including myself, and that's it.
8922640	8924640	But it was all right, we had fun with the small group.
8924640	8927640	I promise I will go airsoft with you in a future week.
8927640	8932640	That's fine, I just, I have, I've been bad and I've been buying too many guns.
8932640	8938640	So unfortunately, unfortunately I'm probably going to sell some,
8938640	8942640	but it's fine because I, you know, my primary gun that I normally use,
8942640	8946640	I don't really like anymore, but the new one I got is pretty cool.
8946640	8951640	But I'm going to stop buying guns and stick with the one that works really well.
8951640	8953640	All right.
8953640	8955640	ActDef says, bad Loki, what will the wife say?
8955640	8957640	She doesn't know.
8957640	8962640	And thankfully she doesn't listen to this show, all right.
8962640	8964640	Damn, all right, there you go.
8964640	8967640	Let's open up the Skype line if we can here.
8967640	8969640	1-8, do not disturb, let me open it up there.
8969640	8973640	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8973640	8975640	If you want to give us a call and interact with us,
8975640	8977640	talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight,
8977640	8980640	or as long as it's gaming related, we'll talk about anything pretty much.
8980640	8983640	So go ahead and call us right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8983640	8986640	username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8986640	8990640	Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for these calls to come in?
8990640	8992640	Yeah, sorry, I'm fighting a giant slug thing.
8992640	8994640	That's right, you still, well, actually you're getting saved.
8994640	8995640	We've got a call right now.
8995640	8997640	Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8997640	9000640	This is DS Master 26.
9000640	9002640	Hey, DS Master 26, what is on your mind?
9002640	9004640	Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm going to ask you.
9004640	9007640	How about the DSi?
9007640	9012640	Uh, seriously, I've seen, actually one of my friends has one.
9012640	9015640	She gets imports from Japan a whole bunch of times,
9015640	9019640	so she got one before the rest of us Americans did.
9019640	9024640	And I've seen the picture printouts from that camera on that DSi.
9024640	9026640	They're a bunch of crap.
9026640	9028640	Plus the internet browser,
9028640	9031640	we did a speed test you could get to Google first
9031640	9037640	on a PSP versus DSi and the internet on there is slow as hell.
9037640	9043640	Like dial up Windows 95 slow.
9043640	9047640	That's like on the Nintendo Wii, it's very, very slow.
9047640	9052640	Yeah, same thing with the DSi, but slower.
9052640	9055640	And seriously, the music player is crap.
9055640	9060640	I mean, besides, I already got that feature with my R4 card.
9060640	9062640	Wait, did they actually put a music player in the DSi?
9062640	9064640	I didn't even realize that was there.
9064640	9066640	It's built in now?
9066640	9071640	Yeah, but you use your SD card and it takes AAC.
9071640	9074640	But yeah, I already have a PSP or more importantly,
9074640	9076640	you know, an iPod and iPhone that will do it as well.
9076640	9078640	You know, I do use my PSP.
9078640	9080640	Yeah, same here.
9080640	9087640	I use my PSP, like the R4 does two videos, as I found out.
9087640	9090640	Actually, that's the reason why I called in.
9090640	9094640	I'm giving a review on Silent Hill, which I just saw last night.
9094640	9095640	The movie?
9095640	9096640	Freaking awesome.
9096640	9097640	Yeah.
9097640	9101640	Wow, you're only about three years late, but go ahead.
9101640	9103640	I'm just messing.
9103640	9105640	Wow, it came out three years ago?
9105640	9106640	It was a while ago.
9106640	9107640	I'm just messing with you.
9107640	9109640	I don't remember when, but it was a while ago.
9109640	9110640	What did you think?
9110640	9116640	Well, anyways, out of all the movie, out of the game movies I've seen,
9116640	9119640	this is like probably the best ever.
9119640	9122640	And plus on the factory scene, witch burnings,
9122640	9126640	and then the massive blood splatter in the awesome epic Pyramid Head,
9126640	9129640	which I'm thinking of being for Halloween.
9129640	9131640	Awesome flick.
9131640	9134640	Now you know why we fan-gasm over Pyramid Head all the time on this show.
9134640	9135640	He is sex.
9135640	9137640	He just, he really is.
9137640	9141640	He has a lot of it with the nurses.
9141640	9143640	And plus, not to mention, if you guys ever,
9143640	9149640	okay, have any of you played the DDR Extreme for the US version on the PS2?
9149640	9151640	On the PS2, yes.
9151640	9154640	Extreme 1, yes.
9154640	9160640	Okay, the ending song, the Silent Hill for the ending credits,
9160640	9162640	very reminiscent to the soundtrack.
9162640	9166640	I think it's like the last song you'll lock in Extreme,
9166640	9167640	but it was very similar to me.
9167640	9170640	I couldn't remember the first few times until the chorus came in.
9170640	9173640	I'm like, deja vu.
9173640	9176640	Yeah, I mean, it was pretty cool that they inserted that in the game.
9176640	9179640	Of course, that song originally comes from Silent Hill 3.
9179640	9181640	It was like the theme song of that game.
9181640	9185640	But yeah, I remember they put it in DDR with a funny little video too.
9185640	9188640	And wasn't it Extreme 2 that had that?
9188640	9191640	Because Extreme 1 had your reign from 4, if I remember right.
9191640	9193640	And the reason why I remember that...
9193640	9196640	No, it was Extreme 1.
9196640	9198640	It was. You know what, you're right, it was.
9198640	9200640	I remember that, though, that it also had your reign,
9200640	9202640	because that was a big thing for us here at OLR.
9202640	9204640	We got to play that song before anyone else,
9204640	9206640	and we had a ton of DDR people listening.
9206640	9207640	That was like the night we broke through,
9207640	9210640	and we actually got a lot of new listeners when we got that.
9210640	9212640	So, anyhow.
9212640	9213640	Yeah, I remember that.
9213640	9215640	That was a very controversial game in the community, though,
9215640	9217640	because they really changed the engine and all that stuff.
9217640	9219640	Anyway, sorry.
9219640	9225640	Well, have you ever noticed there's a Pump It Up game for the PSP?
9225640	9229640	I had heard there was a Pump It Up game on the PSP.
9229640	9235640	I found out on Playasia, and I'm like, what the heck?
9235640	9238640	Okay, I can understand DDR on this thing, but not Pump It Up,
9238640	9241640	because that takes five icons.
9241640	9244640	And we got the four external sort of square.
9244640	9246640	I don't know what I'm supposed to use, like R.
9246640	9247640	Well, what about the shoulder buttons?
9247640	9249640	I assumed it was the shoulder button.
9249640	9251640	I mean, if you're going to play DDR on a handheld,
9251640	9254640	Pump It Up makes sense to me.
9254640	9257640	Especially because there's a ton of fans of that other...
9257640	9259640	God damn, what's the Korean game?
9259640	9260640	The name escapes me.
9260640	9261640	DJ Maxx, thank you.
9261640	9264640	There's huge fans of that game.
9264640	9267640	Yeah, even though I got to say that's a little bit harder,
9267640	9271640	but okay, here's one thing I'd really love to see remade on the Wii
9271640	9273640	that Konami should really do,
9273640	9276640	especially with download content now available for Wii and everything,
9276640	9277640	the Guitar Hero.
9277640	9280640	I mean, why doesn't, in 360 and PS3,
9280640	9285640	why doesn't Konami try to re-release Beat Mania with the download content?
9285640	9288640	I mean, that would make a whole lot of sense.
9288640	9290640	I would love that, but unfortunately,
9290640	9293640	I think because of how Beat Mania 2 did,
9293640	9296640	or I'm sorry, not Beat Mania 2, Beat Mania on the PS2 did,
9296640	9299640	I don't think they're in any hurry to put out a new Beat Mania game.
9299640	9301640	I don't think it sold well enough for them.
9301640	9303640	I had heard it exceeded expectations,
9303640	9305640	but I could have always heard wrong,
9305640	9306640	because they never did do a second one.
9306640	9308640	If it sold that well, they would have done a second one.
9308640	9313640	I mean, as far as I know, DDR Universe 2 did not sell that great
9313640	9315640	compared to older DDR titles,
9315640	9316640	but they still made a 3,
9316640	9320640	and it wasn't just a reskinned version of the other ones,
9320640	9323640	because 2 was kind of just a reskinned Universe 1.
9323640	9325640	Just thinking of DDR,
9325640	9329640	haven't you noticed there hasn't been a single one out for the PS3?
9329640	9332640	They're still rehashing on the PS2.
9332640	9334640	It is interesting there hasn't been one on the PS3,
9334640	9336640	and I'm wondering if that's not going to be one of the things
9336640	9339640	Konami pulls out of their hat at E3 this year,
9339640	9340640	because you're right.
9340640	9345640	The PS3 is one of those platforms that hasn't seen a DDR game on it yet.
9345640	9348640	Maybe that will be where we start to see the download content and all that stuff.
9348640	9349640	Who knows?
9349640	9350640	But I don't know.
9350640	9353640	At the same time, I'm not going to hold my breath.
9353640	9355640	Plus, here's one thing.
9355640	9357640	I've been seeing tons of YouTube videos
9357640	9360640	where people have been controlling Beat Mania
9360640	9364640	using a guitar hero controller with the five keys mode.
9364640	9365640	Pretty darn interesting.
9365640	9368640	And then the scratch is the strum bar.
9368640	9370640	Pretty bored.
9370640	9372640	Let me ask you this.
9372640	9375640	I would probably have to try it out, but I don't know.
9375640	9378640	I'm not bored enough to set that all up.
9378640	9380640	If I'm going to play Beat Mania, I'm going to play it the way it was intended.
9380640	9382640	Let me ask you this, because the call's going a little long.
9382640	9383640	I've got to get some other calls.
9383640	9386640	I want to ask you this, because obviously you're a big music game fan.
9386640	9389640	I want to ask you about this question that came up kind of earlier in the show
9389640	9393640	about the whole guitar hero on the DS versus rock band on the PSP thing.
9393640	9395640	Are you interested in rock band on the PSP,
9395640	9397640	or are you interested in guitar hero on the DS?
9397640	9399640	What do you think?
9399640	9402640	I've actually bought the guitar hero DS,
9402640	9406640	and it's pretty darn interesting and pretty good for what it is.
9406640	9411640	I was surprised at the graphics for it for a DS game for guitar hero-wise,
9411640	9414640	and the sound quality was pretty darn good.
9414640	9416640	I think the style that they're going with,
9416640	9419640	the PSP version of rock band, that was pretty darn interesting.
9419640	9425640	You'd think they would try to mod, like, redo the guitar grip,
9425640	9430640	and then try to do some little quirky little drum set that you plug on top,
9430640	9432640	and then you just hit it with your fingers,
9432640	9434640	because I think that would be kind of fun.
9434640	9438640	Yeah, but at the same time I like the idea that they're just doing an amplitude-type game
9438640	9440640	that you're not going to need any of these stupid peripherals for.
9440640	9442640	I kind of like that idea.
9442640	9446640	Yeah, but that's also the same control scheme for DJ Max on the PSP,
9446640	9448640	which I kind of suck at.
9448640	9453640	I try it with the two-hand configuration like you would for Beatmania,
9453640	9455640	and I still suck.
9455640	9458640	I guess it's extremely hard even on the slow play mode.
9458640	9460640	I cannot do it.
9460640	9463640	All right, well, DS Master, we've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls,
9463640	9465640	but thank you so much for your opinions tonight,
9465640	9467640	and have fun with the music games, okay?
9467640	9469640	Oh, by the way, one more thing before I go.
9469640	9472640	Hopefully EA and the whole gaming industry of America
9472640	9476640	does not call for a bailout from Barack Obama.
9476640	9478640	That would suck.
9478640	9481640	Do they need one? Maybe.
9481640	9482640	Would they be eligible?
9482640	9485640	Probably midway.
9485640	9487640	They need more than a bailout.
9487640	9489640	They need a freaking water pump.
9489640	9491640	All right, DS Master, I've got to let you go,
9491640	9493640	but thank you so much for the call.
9493640	9494640	Take care, buddy.
9494640	9495640	Keep going and keep rocking the good shows.
9495640	9497640	Thank you very much.
9497640	9502640	All right, Dark Soccer, you seem like you're dying to comment on the bailout message.
9502640	9503640	No.
9503640	9505640	All right.
9505640	9508640	Are you guys talking about the...
9508640	9509640	I would think I was just saying them all.
9509640	9511640	Am I seeing a glitch in Ninja Blade here?
9511640	9513640	Because the monster has no health left,
9513640	9516640	and I keep hitting it, and it's not dying.
9516640	9517640	No, you just suck.
9517640	9518640	All right, let's go to the call.
9518640	9521640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9521640	9523640	It did the Mega Man 3 trick.
9523640	9525640	Uh-oh, did it cut off?
9525640	9527640	Okay, whoever...
9527640	9528640	I have to explain this trick.
9528640	9529640	What?
9529640	9530640	Hurry, because we've got to call on the line.
9530640	9532640	Okay, we'll call her going.
9532640	9534640	Okay, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9534640	9535640	Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.
9535640	9538640	Hey, DJ Tyrant. I haven't heard you on the show in a long time. What's up?
9538640	9543640	Hey, not much. I'm trying out the Skype for iPhone app. It seems to work pretty well.
9543640	9545640	Whoa, you're calling us from iPhone right now?
9545640	9546640	Yeah.
9546640	9549640	Wow, not too shabby. All right, I forgot that that's available now.
9549640	9552640	So those of you with iPhones, you can Skype us during the show on your iPhones.
9552640	9554640	Thank you for reminding us of that. I have to check that out.
9554640	9557640	It only works on Wi-Fi, though. Remember that.
9557640	9562640	That's true. Still, that's, you know, your regular Skype will only work with an internet connection, too.
9562640	9563640	What's on your mind?
9563640	9570640	That's true. Just, I know it's all the talk of today, but DSI, I really enjoy mine personally.
9570640	9577640	I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade. I got to play it last week at an event I got invited to,
9577640	9585640	and I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade, but I can see it's not for everyone, definitely.
9585640	9588640	What about it makes it such a great upgrade?
9588640	9598640	I like, I really like the screens. The controls are much better. Like, the D-pad and the buttons just in general feel a lot better and more sturdy.
9598640	9603640	Because the D-pad was really floaty on the light, I thought.
9603640	9609640	Sometimes I keep forgetting this is actually the third DS now we've gotten between DS Fat and DS Lite. I sometimes forget that.
9609640	9612640	Anyhow, do you still work in games retail?
9612640	9613640	No, I don't.
9613640	9616640	Okay, I thought for some reason you did, but then I also heard you'd moved on.
9616640	9622640	I don't know if you still know people there or what have you, but have you heard what the reception to this has been at all?
9622640	9628640	I haven't heard too much. Yeah, I haven't really heard anything.
9628640	9631640	Alright, sorry. My bad for asking.
9631640	9633640	No worries.
9633640	9639640	So, okay, so you're more of a fan of the DSI then. Is there anything that you're looking forward to?
9639640	9645640	Like, we've seen some announcements recently of the Zelda Spirit Tracks and so on. What are you looking forward to from Nintendo on DS?
9645640	9654640	Definitely the Zelda game. I honestly am looking forward to these new play control games because I missed out on them on the GameCube.
9654640	9660640	I'm kind of looking forward to them and they're not too badly priced either, which is a good thing.
9660640	9663640	Cheap is good. You're right, cheap is always a good thing. I don't mind that.
9663640	9669640	And of course the DSI where I really hope that that takes off like the App Store has on the iPhone.
9669640	9674640	I know it's not open though. That's really going to, I think, hurt it in the long run though.
9674640	9681640	I tend to agree, but at the same time, you know, it is a double-edged sword and I could see the other side of the argument where,
9681640	9687640	well, look at all the shit that's on the iPhone store because there's some real crap apps on the iPhone.
9687640	9691640	It's so hard to comb through there and find some decent games sometimes.
9691640	9697640	And you think there's supposed to be some quality control out there, but it's not much. It is not much.
9697640	9704640	So I guess maybe, you know, by closing it off, Nintendo will release quote-unquote quality apps on the DSI,
9704640	9707640	but at the same time, some of these games don't sound that quality.
9707640	9709640	Well, look at the WiiWare stuff.
9709640	9712640	Yeah, I guess that's true. Is there anything on WiiWare you enjoy?
9712640	9719640	I don't know if you really enjoy the fun. I see Crystal Chronicles, or not Crystal Chronicles, whatever.
9719640	9721640	My Life is King?
9721640	9728640	Yeah, and The Lost Winds has been really good. I haven't really bought anything since then because of the whole storage issue,
9728640	9732640	but now that they fixed that, I might start buying again.
9732640	9737640	Yeah, I actually finally updated the firmware this week and put some games on my SD card,
9737640	9741640	and I have like 500 blocks free on my Wii now. I'm just like, wow, this isn't real.
9741640	9746640	I don't know if I'm going to go on a buying binge because I already bought a new sound system that sent me back a lot of money.
9746640	9751640	But it's nice to know I have the space available when something comes out on the Wii that I must have.
9751640	9758640	Yeah, but I agree with you that I really hope they have some sort of support like the PS3 and the PSP.
9758640	9764640	I have a bad feeling I'm just dreaming with that, but you know it can be done.
9764640	9768640	Look at the Nintendo channel that streams DS demos to your DS. It can be done.
9768640	9773640	They just don't want to do it, or they're leaving it in their hat to unveil at a later conference.
9773640	9780640	Yeah, I mean that got me to buy Rhythm Heaven because they released a demo the day they gave it out at GDC,
9780640	9783640	and I tried it and I was like, well, this is a game I have to pick up.
9783640	9786640	Yeah, you know what, I played it at PAX and I remember really enjoying it.
9786640	9790640	I did not realize the demo was on Nintendo channel and I might have to go check that out.
9790640	9795640	Yeah, sometimes really good games sneak on there. They don't really announce what goes out there.
9795640	9798640	They really don't. People got to keep a better eye on that.
9798640	9803640	Alright, well, Jimmy, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in tonight, but any quick closing thoughts?
9803640	9804640	Thanks for having me on.
9804640	9806640	No problem. Any quick closing thoughts?
9806640	9809640	Um, I can't think of anything right now.
9809640	9811640	Alright, that's alright. Live radio is a lot of pressure.
9811640	9812640	Take care, buddy.
9812640	9813640	Alright, take care, buddy.
9813640	9818640	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9818640	9821640	We'll probably take one or two more calls and then we're going to call it a night.
9821640	9823640	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9823640	9824640	Hi.
9824640	9825640	Hi.
9825640	9826640	It's Deathwishing.
9826640	9827640	Hi, Deathwishing.
9827640	9828640	What's up?
9828640	9841640	Um, well, first of all, I'm burnout on my 360 and second of all, I'm rejecting that for one month because Operation Flashpoint, the new one's coming out I think next month.
9841640	9845640	Okay, hold on. Back up. Aren't you the same guy that was having the points problems earlier?
9845640	9846640	Yeah.
9846640	9854640	Okay, so obviously that's all fixed and Nintendo. Xbox was very kind to you and all that. What did you end up running out and buying with those points?
9854640	9875640	Um, I bought some rock band songs, my Call of Duty maps, and then with the extra points, oh, and I bought, my extra points, I bought one rock band song and a pack of burnout cars that came with a legendary cars pack which has like a DeLorean, like Back to the Future.
9875640	9877640	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah.
9877640	9879640	It has the Manhattan, you know.
9879640	9880640	The Dukes of Hazzard.
9880640	9887640	The Dukes of Hazzard one, but it has a Mexican flag on it.
9887640	9891640	My other question, was one of the rock band songs you bought Don't Stop Believin'?
9891640	9892640	No, I didn't buy that.
9892640	9893640	Fail.
9893640	9909640	I bought, like, Trash Unreal from Against Me, Come On, Come On from the Von Bondies, The Joker from Steve Miller, Sick Sick Sick from Queens of the Stone Age, and My Curse from Kill, Switch, and Gauge.
9909640	9913640	Now, look, those songs are all fine and dandy, but it needs more epic classic rock.
9913640	9920640	Um, thing is, I would buy classic rock, but there's no Led Zeppelin.
9920640	9926640	Maybe, that's one of those bands that could put out their own game, like Aerosmith and Metallica.
9926640	9929640	I don't like Aerosmith. In fact, I hate Aerosmith.
9929640	9935640	Well, I'm just saying, though, they were able to put out their own game. You know, we can argue about the success of that game.
9935640	9937640	Lead singer looks like a beat chick.
9937640	9943640	Alright, look, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight? I asked you the question about the points. You were talking about...
9943640	9949640	Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rise, I think it's Dragon Rise or something. Remember the old Operation Flashpoint? Did you ever play it?
9949640	9951640	What system was it on?
9951640	9952640	It was a PC game.
9952640	9953640	And it was Xbox, I think.
9953640	9955640	And Xbox, same thing.
9955640	9961640	I don't recall this game, but I'm going to look up and see if I get screenshots, because I'm a very visual person, sometimes that jogs my memory.
9961640	9963640	I doubt it. It's a Call of Duty type of game.
9963640	9972640	It's a military simulator, actually. It's like one of the more... I think, from what I remember, it was like one shot, pretty much, and we were dead.
9972640	9982640	Hmm. You know, surprisingly enough, I think I saw this game, like, once. So, what about... are they making a new one, or what's up?
9982640	9985640	Uh, yeah. Sequel's coming out. I think it's next month.
9985640	9987640	End of next month.
9987640	9990640	I'm not sure, though, but it's end of next month.
9990640	9992640	Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rising.
9992640	9996640	Yeah, and it's just like... it's like what I like.
9996640	10005640	I want these shoot... like, I'm this guy who wants these shooters that aren't... like, I'm tired of kind of seeing these really Call of Duty-esque super arcadey.
10005640	10009640	I get shot. Oh, look. I sit in the corner, suck my thumb. I'm okay.
10009640	10015640	I love this, because it's like you get shot, you bleed out while moving around, or you're downed.
10015640	10019640	And I love games, because it has a medic system. That's simply it.
10019640	10027640	Um, you're a fan of shooters, and something that caught my eye this week was some of the screens from the new Wolfenstein game.
10027640	10029640	What do you think of that?
10029640	10031640	Is that a good... aw, was that like...
10031640	10033640	It is in my pants.
10033640	10035640	Okay.
10035640	10037640	I wasn't gonna say that, but there you go.
10037640	10039640	I think it looks like crap, but, you know, that's...
10039640	10043640	Shut up. Okay, can you play a gag in his mouth?
10043640	10045640	Alright, well, he's playing a game.
10045640	10049640	Wolfenstein Enemy Territory was so great, and it was free, too.
10049640	10051640	What do you think of this new one? Is it gonna...
10051640	10053640	Yeah, but that's Enemy Territory, that's not...
10053640	10056640	Shut up! Is it gonna make everybody talk Wolfenstein again, or what?
10056640	10061640	It looks like an updated version of Wolfenstein. It looks like Wolfenstein to today's standards.
10061640	10065640	Ironsight, sprinting, you know, and then, all I notice is they better keep it class-based.
10065640	10071640	They better keep it class-based, and they better keep it in that objective, like, online campaign stuff that I saw in Enemy Territory.
10071640	10077640	Where I will go to a school, go up to the principal, hit him in the balls, and then laugh.
10077640	10080640	And then go home and make myself a sandwich.
10080640	10086640	Alright, what about the whole Hitler robot? That's what I would like to see make a comeback in Wolfenstein.
10086640	10088640	Hitler robot is the boss.
10088640	10091640	Sounds like an idea. Sounds like a plan.
10091640	10098640	Don't you remember the old-school Wolfenstein? Like, I don't know, you might be a little young, but the old, old-school Wolfenstein game.
10098640	10102640	Like, which one? Wolfenstein 3D or Wolfenstein, like, 2D?
10102640	10105640	Okay, not that old-school. Yeah, Wolfenstein 3D.
10105640	10114640	Uh, yes and no. I do remember there being a robot, but maybe I just couldn't tell if it was Hitler because I was, like, too stupid to know it was Hitler yet.
10114640	10121640	And plus, you know what, he wasn't the boss in the shareware one that most people played. He had to have the full one to see that.
10121640	10123640	Hitler robot.
10123640	10129640	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail the point from what you'd called in to talk about, but I just remembered I saw those Wolfenstein.
10129640	10133640	Because, you know, I was a fan. I may not be the biggest shooter fan, but I loved Wolfenstein 3D.
10133640	10135640	I love Wolfenstein 2.
10135640	10136640	So, there you go.
10136640	10137640	Alright, well, uh...
10137640	10142640	That's the list of the games I love. Wolfenstein and, uh, Delta Force Black Hawk Down.
10142640	10146640	Alright, well, we're gonna need you to call back when that game comes out, because I need to hear it from a shooter fan.
10146640	10149640	Because I don't follow a lot of the shooters, so I need to know if the game's worth...
10149640	10150640	I follow everything.
10150640	10151640	Worth crossing over for.
10151640	10154640	Alright, Deathwishing, any final thoughts before we let you go?
10154640	10155640	Um...
10155640	10158640	I still play Street Fighter IV. It's still awesome.
10158640	10159640	It is still awesome.
10159640	10162640	Think they'll unveil any secret characters. Downloadable.
10162640	10163640	Or think it's just a dream.
10163640	10166640	I think they need to get that tournament mode out quicker.
10166640	10167640	Alright.
10167640	10169640	If my principal's gonna get hurt faster.
10169640	10171640	Deathwishing, we gotta let you go.
10171640	10174640	Be careful when you threaten violence on the radio. Don't do it.
10174640	10175640	Alright.
10175640	10176640	See you, Deathwishing. Take care, buddy.
10176640	10177640	Allegedly. Bye.
10177640	10178640	Bye. Allegedly.
10178640	10179640	Yeah, good, good.
10179640	10180640	Throw that in there.
10180640	10181640	Throw that in there. Allegedly.
10181640	10182640	Alright, uh...
10182640	10184640	We have time for one more call?
10184640	10185640	One more quick call.
10185640	10187640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10187640	10189640	Uh, this is Spazinator.
10189640	10191640	Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10191640	10193640	Uh, yeah, um...
10193640	10202640	I just wanted to get your input on the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate.
10202640	10212640	I was wondering, compared to Rock Band, do you think they're kind of whoring out Guitar Hero a little bit?
10212640	10213640	Yeah, just a bit.
10213640	10218640	Uh, yeah, they're whoring it out a lot, but at the same time, they can kind of get away with it right now.
10218640	10225640	Because, you know, Best Buys and all these stores have sections upon sections dedicated to these games because they sell.
10225640	10228640	I'm not a big fan of the artist-based games.
10228640	10232640	I am not a big fan of them. I don't think they need the big fanfare they're getting.
10232640	10238640	I think if they were released as, like, a CD and put in the CD rack or what have you, they would be a little more...
10238640	10241640	I don't know. I kind of see that could be the way it's going at some point.
10241640	10247640	But, I don't know. I think at some point, the market is going to crack at some point and it's...
10247640	10249640	People are going to start rejecting it.
10249640	10258640	And it's all going to come crashing down. Like a little leak in the dam, suddenly it's all going to come crashing down.
10258640	10265640	Yeah, I was thinking more or less the same thing. I mean, although it's kind of a different genre altogether,
10265640	10269640	you kind of saw the same thing with the Tony Hawk games.
10269640	10275640	I mean, they were releasing iteration after iteration with that series.
10275640	10282640	And basically, like what happened to that series, people kind of gave up on that series in favor of skates.
10282640	10291640	I mean, you can't always draw a few parallels between the Tony Hawk series and Guitar Hero, almost.
10291640	10297640	You know, I will say this, though. I think Rock Band 2 has really succeeded with the store.
10297640	10300640	And, you know, I think it's succeeded in a place where Guitar Hero hasn't.
10300640	10305640	Granted, Guitar Hero has released a lot of downloadable content and songs,
10305640	10309640	but the place where Rock Band 2 has got them is that they've done it consistently.
10309640	10312640	They've consistently put out a lot of songs on their store.
10312640	10319640	And, you know what? Very few games can I say that six months after release, I'm still playing it at least once a week.
10319640	10322640	You know, very few games can I say that.
10322640	10332640	Yeah, yeah. In fact, I'm checking the Rock Band store constantly, and to some degree I even do the same with Guitar Hero.
10332640	10339640	And occasionally, you know, I do see some songs on the Guitar Hero store that I do like,
10339640	10347640	like Blyton Allen's No Rain and whatnot, but compared to Rock Band, you know,
10347640	10355640	Guitar Hero really doesn't have a whole lot that I would consider going out and getting compared to Rock Band, you know.
10355640	10358640	But, again, that's just me.
10358640	10367640	You know, at least in my opinion, it seems like Rock Band has a better structure of music, though.
10367640	10375640	I think Rock Band's got the better music, too, but I do understand that Guitar Hero has to lean towards more guitar-driven songs.
10375640	10381640	Sometimes, you know, that might not necessarily be the same stuff I listen to, but I like Rock Band because you do more band-based songs, you know.
10381640	10385640	And some have guitar solos, but some have drum solos, some have vocal.
10385640	10388640	Like, Don't Stop Believin'. Not a song really notable for its...
10388640	10393640	Well, it does have a pretty bitchin' guitar solo, and it's really fuckin' hard on Rock Band Expert, by the way.
10393640	10399640	I can't do that part, but, like, most people know Don't Stop Believin' for the vocals.
10399640	10406640	You know, you don't really get songs like that in Rock Band. I mean, in Guitar Hero.
10406640	10416640	Yeah. Now, with me, one thing I noticed is, well, kind of like you, I can't really do the Expert level stuff yet.
10416640	10423640	I'm still getting started on the Medium level because I'm kind of new to the whole music-y thing.
10423640	10443640	But, you know, at least with Guitar Hero, since they're more or less emulating the Rock Band sets, you would think that, even though the name is Guitar Hero, they would encompass some other varieties of music.
10443640	10448640	You know, it's probably some of the guitar-heavy stuff, you know?
10448640	10461640	Yeah. I don't know, though. Guitar Hero just... Guitar Hero feels like a bit of a scattered mess right now, and I hope if they're going to do another big Guitar Hero, what, five this year as their big game, I hope they find some focus.
10461640	10466640	But, Spaznier, we gotta let you go because we're running out of time. We want to end tonight so we can get to our afterbirth and so on.
10466640	10469640	Do you have any quick final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
10469640	10475640	Uh, yeah. Final fantasy, you know, whoever rules, well, sucks. No, just kidding.
10475640	10479640	Yeah, yeah. All right. Get off the show. All right. See you, Spaznier. Thanks for the call.
10479640	10481640	All right. Take care. Have a good one.
10481640	10482640	All right. Bye.
10482640	10491640	By the way, I didn't mention during my gaming week this week, I actually went back to World of Warcraft this week because I'm a big fat addict, but I haven't been playing that much.
10491640	10496640	Look, we got one more call coming in. I want to take it because I noticed it was a name I haven't heard from in a while. I want to let him on the show.
10496640	10478640	Hi, you're on Orange
10498640	10500640	It's Brad from Pod Culture.
10500640	10508640	Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How's Dollhouse going? I've heard Dollhouse, and I know you do your Dollhouse show, too. I've heard Dollhouse has really picked up in the last three weeks.
10508640	10510640	Oh, yes, it has.
10510640	10517640	I need to go back and catch up because I want to watch the first couple episodes and then I just kind of got distracted and was watching other stuff, but I heard it got really good.
10517640	10523640	Yeah, if you kind of gave it up, it's definitely picked up some steam.
10523640	10526640	All right. Well, I think you still watch it all on Hulu, right?
10526640	10527640	I believe so, yeah.
10527640	10534640	All right, I'm going to have to go check that out. Well, look, I know you didn't call to talk about Dollhouse so that you probably would anyway. What did you call in to talk about tonight, Brad?
10534640	10545640	Actually, I don't know if you'd mentioned it on the show before, but I've got an iPhone game that is just great.
10545640	10546640	Hmm, what's that?
10546640	10548640	It's Zombieville, USA.
10548640	10552640	I'm interested already. What's in Zombieville, USA?
10552640	10561640	It's just this little side scroller cartoony shooting zombies game. Three simple controls, right, left, and you tap in the middle and you shoot.
10561640	10565640	Is it a bloody game? Do you get decapitated zombies and all that fun stuff?
10565640	10567640	You do, but it's kind of cartoony.
10567640	10575640	I can deal with cartoon violence. I don't like blood orgy. We already had the blood orgy discussion earlier in the show. Cartoony violence, especially with zombies, is okay.
10575640	10584640	Oh, it's great. It's pretty much the same level over and over, but at the end of each level you can find cash, you upgrade your weapons.
10584640	10586640	Is there a cost with said game?
10586640	10588640	It's like two or three bucks.
10588640	10592640	It's not that bad. Is there a demo or a movie or anything I can see online to get a taste for it?
10592640	10595640	I'm not 100% certain.
10595640	10599640	You're not the developer. I shouldn't grill you on this stuff, but I'm just curious how you found it or what have you.
10599640	10605640	Well, there you go. Check that out if you're interested in some zombie killing.
10605640	10611640	It's good to hear about some good iPhone games, especially when we're talking about all the crap that's out there on the marketplace as well.
10611640	10615640	It's a good way to waste a lot of time.
10615640	10621640	Yes, I've wasted a lot of time with some of those games, like WordFu and some of those iPhone games they have.
10621640	10625640	Great time wasters, especially when I'm lying in bed, but I don't want to go to sleep just yet.
10625640	10628640	I'll reach over and grab my phone and play a couple games and it'll make me tired.
10628640	10633640	Alright, Brad, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up. Any quick thoughts for our listeners?
10633640	10634640	Later on.
10634640	10636640	Any final thoughts?
10636640	10638640	Nope.
10638640	10640640	Well, take care and have a good one, buddy.
10640640	10641640	Later on.
10641640	10645640	Alright, that was our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad, here on Orange Lawns Radio.
10645640	10652640	That was definitely, definitely the last call, but he hadn't been on the show in a while and he's a good friend of the show and does his own indie podcast.
10652640	10659640	We'd like to support our fellow indie podcasters, but as for tonight's show, it's got to be coming to a close.
10659640	10663640	So, is there any other last minute stories that we didn't get to earlier?
10663640	10664640	Yes, Loki.
10664640	10667640	It kind of ties into what we were talking about a little bit earlier.
10667640	10668640	Sure.
10668640	10677640	Apparently, there has been a, what is it, a kind of like a slide that had been leaked out.
10677640	10685640	It was during one of the GDC, I guess one of their conferences that they had with Dan Teasdale.
10685640	10692640	And he did a panel called Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Design Lessons Learned from Rock Band.
10692640	10704640	And it's interesting, though, because he then released a PDF version, or they released a PDF version of the session and all the slides are on there.
10704640	10711640	It had an earlier version of the slide that had been omitted from the actual show.
10711640	10716640	And it reveals Lego Rock Band.
10716640	10718640	I heard about this.
10718640	10723640	I think Tiger Claw sent me a link to this and I neglected to get to it in the Twitter part, but okay.
10723640	10728640	But it's interesting, though, they're also mentioning the PSP Rock Band is on there as well.
10728640	10730640	The Beatles Rock Band.
10730640	10735640	And then there's a ton of Guitar Hero stuff, which I'm really whoring that stuff out.
10735640	10743640	But they have Guitar Hero Modern Hits, Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits, Guitar Hero, well now Smash Hits.
10743640	10750640	Guitar Hero Arcade, which I guess maybe they're porting the arcade version over, which I don't know why because it was three.
10750640	10753640	Guitar Hero Fiving, Guitar Hero Band Hero.
10753640	10759640	And then there's Guitar Hero Mobile 2, and Mystery Game that's also on mobile.
10759640	10765640	And I know everyone says, oh my god, both companies are whoring the franchise out.
10765640	10773640	And yeah, Lego Rock Band I can understand is maybe not, I don't know, it's not exactly the way they go.
10773640	10779640	But the way I look at it, it's a way to introduce Rock Band to younger kids and you don't have to buy it.
10779640	10783640	It's not like it's going to have songs in there that you're really probably going to need to buy.
10783640	10786640	They're only going to be available in Lego Rock Band.
10786640	10791640	Whereas the Guitar Hero games, you can't port that shit over.
10791640	10796640	If you buy Metallica, well those Metallica songs are stuck on the Metallica game.
10796640	10803640	So you can't really bring that over, which I think is where the developers differ the most.
10803640	10810640	That's why I kind of respect Rock Band a little bit more because at least if you're going to put out a song, or anything they do to their track packs obviously,
10810640	10813640	those are also optional since they're all available online.
10813640	10821640	It's an option, you don't have to buy it, but if you do buy it you can import it into your game and it all seamlessly works.
10821640	10824640	Whereas Guitar Hero, I gotta have a stack of discs.
10824640	10828640	That's it. Oh, that's it for that story at least.
10828640	10836640	We also talked a little bit about Unreal Tournament 3 and how they had a mod for that to play in another video game, like Sonic the Hedgehog.
10836640	10842640	Well, Team Fortress 2, someone's made a map that's sort of like a Mario Kart track, which is kind of neat.
10842640	10847640	But, I mean, it's definitely not based on a real Mario Kart track, it just kind of has the graphics of it.
10847640	10850640	So that's kind of neat.
10850640	10854640	And then, let's see here.
10854640	10859640	There was another website, I guess, WeOperaSDK.com.
10859640	10867640	They've released a Twitter, which is a WeRapid blogging, I don't know if it's, I'm assuming it's like Twitter,
10867640	10873640	but it's their own website that's formatted for the Wii.
10873640	10875640	Neat.
10875640	10878640	Could have been that DSI message board, right?
10878640	10879640	Could have been.
10879640	10884640	And yeah, I guess they're going to have different things that they've incorporated to this.
10884640	10893640	IRC style commands, smileys, possible integration with the Wii message board, I guess email updates or something like that.
10893640	10898640	Web skinning, that sort of stuff. That's neat.
10898640	10901640	That's it.
10901640	10905640	Alright, well we need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up the show tonight.
10905640	10911640	DarkSakura, you've been awfully quiet over there in the corner, poking away, talking to some of our AIM listeners and so on.
10911640	10913640	Any final thoughts tonight?
10913640	10917640	Yawn, you look like you're going to, I don't think you're going to nap.
10917640	10920640	If you go and lie down, you're going to go to sleep.
10920640	10923640	I'm pretty tired. We spent three and a half hours in IKEA.
10923640	10924640	Oh my god.
10924640	10931640	We went to eat, and the intention was to spend two, and then we ran into some people that Becky knew, because I went with Becky.
10931640	10934640	And I sort of know one of them.
10934640	10937640	But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but Swedish meatballs.
10937640	10938640	And shiny.
10938640	10939640	And Swedish meatballs.
10939640	10943640	Well, that's what I had. And there was shiny, there was so much shiny, I kept going, ooh, shiny.
10943640	10944640	Ooh, shiny.
10944640	10948640	And then staring at stuff, so, hi, Kia, evil.
10948640	10952640	Alright. Um, the doctor, thank you so much for being here tonight.
10952640	10957640	And, you know, you definitely joined in on the conversation, and we always appreciate having you here on the show.
10957640	10958640	Please come back again.
10958640	10959640	Woo!
10959640	10961640	And thanks for participating in tonight's Listless and all that fun stuff.
10961640	10963640	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10963640	10967640	Um, in honor of Rice Princess. Poop.
10967640	10969640	Why isn't she here tonight? Shame on her.
10969640	10970640	I don't know, she didn't get my text.
10970640	10974640	You didn't, I didn't get your text either. I think you need to check your cell phone company.
10974640	10976640	You need to call them and yell at them.
10976640	10983640	Um, my final thought is, I need food. I'm very hungry. I'm, like, dying of hunger pains.
10983640	10985640	Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought.
10985640	10987640	I don't know, I don't have anything.
10987640	10989640	Alright, boy, aren't you boring.
10989640	10990640	Yes, I am.
10990640	10993640	How is Ninja Blade? You've been playing that for, like, three hours now during the show.
10993640	10998640	It's frustrating, because you die pretty easy in it, so it's hard.
10998640	11000640	And I'm playing on normal difficulty in it.
11000640	11014640	Um, the thing is, I, as you probably saw, there was a glitch, a level-ending glitch where I couldn't defeat the boss because he ran out of life and I just sat there slashing at the dead corpse and it wouldn't trigger the event that I needed it to trigger.
11014640	11020640	So I had to restart there, but, um, it's okay. It's alright. It's neat.
11020640	11025640	They've got a lot of really over-the-top stuff going on, but, um, it's a neat game.
11025640	11027640	I'll probably finish it.
11027640	11032640	Okay. Alright, well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
