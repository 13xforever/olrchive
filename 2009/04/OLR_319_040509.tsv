14285	25312	I, April 5th, 2009, Konami prepares to juggle two scary franchises, most Oblivion DLC gets a price cut, and have the release dates been leaked for highly anticipated Wii games?
31260	35422	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35482	41406	We are that video game show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41466	46669	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week, as well as the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47129	48129	Yo, what up?
48410	49150	Good, how are you?
50711	51511	I survive.
52252	52812	You survive?
53012	53512	I survive.
53853	56094	On the souls of innocent children.
57688	58708	FlashMediaEncoder3
84139	84419	Ninja Blade
104430	106031	and we do that video and then we do audio of the show.
106331	113393	Now soon, we're going to upgrade and have a little switch box and then we can switch back and forth between the camera and the game and that would be super.
113613	114353	It would be even cooler.
114513	115134	What would that be?
115274	115914	Picture in picture?
116114	116914	Picture in picture?
117214	117874	I don't know about that.
118535	119175	Now you're talking money.
120075	121556	Switch box like 1999.
122797	123638	You'd be surprised.
123918	125739	It's not as hard as you think.
125779	126380	We'll see.
126440	127720	Maybe for the future.
128201	129762	Joining us tonight, we do have a special guest.
129842	135166	I'm actually very excited because I didn't think we were going to have a special guest, but he just kind of showed up last minute.
135246	136266	Boy, I'm happy he's here.
136667	138088	Say hello to Casper the Gay.
138608	139609	Who is now the Doctor.
139789	140369	Oh, the Doctor.
140409	140689	That's right.
141110	142090	How long ago did you change your name?
142371	143331	About six months ago.
143371	144252	A long time ago.
144432	144692	All right.
144793	146734	Well, Casper the gay doctor is here.
146875	147375	Basically, yeah.
147395	147675	All right.
147756	148376	Yeah, it still works.
148396	149417	How are you doing, Casper?
149437	150198	Awesome.
150258	151019	I'm really good.
151059	152781	I'm helping everyone with their medical problems.
152861	155083	Okay.
155143	156725	Ghost.
156785	156985	Excellent.
157005	158687	You're wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt today.
158787	159608	Yes, and a hat.
159668	160969	See, I got the Hyrule symbol on my hat.
160989	161630	Oh, look at you go.
161990	163472	I'm nerded out today for the show.
163552	164693	I got to ask you real quick.
164773	166875	Legend of Zelda spirit tracks, yay or nay?
167376	167476	Ah.
169414	169714	ZELDA FANBOY
197077	205521	What they should have done is every time that he, you know, in the original game, every time that he got on the boat, they would play the Lonely Island I'm On A Boat song.
205541	207061	Because that would be awesome.
208602	211243	Because, believe me when I say, Link F'd a mermaid.
211563	213604	I'm on a boat, you guys.
213624	215205	In Hyrule, you guys.
218075	218375	I don't know.
218395	219956	Do you think they're going to sell a lot of copies of that?
220716	221157	Probably.
221217	223858	I mean, it's a Zealot title, so I'm sure, but it'll probably be boring.
224158	229121	And if it sells a lot, then they're going to do a sequel, Spirit Tracks 2, Link on a Boat.
229361	230541	That one I would actually buy.
230662	232643	Busting Octoroks with my boomerang.
233043	235644	If it had T-Pain as a character only, though.
235684	236064	Oh, hell.
247526	251787	Alright, let's get to how we always like to start the show off with a little bit of, how was your gaming week?
251827	253048	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
253688	256629	Um, I played, um, stuff.
257269	260650	Actually, I played Pet Society on Facebook, which I've become oddly addicted to.
262291	263411	At least it's not Neopets.
263991	264471	Fuck no.
265992	272934	Um, I played some more Cookie Mama on iPhone, and then I didn't actually finish what I was cooking, so whatever.
272954	273534	Okay.
274713	275434	Mama fixed it.
276614	282719	And we got something from Alva eBay that arrived in perfect condition for seven bucks.
282939	283960	The item was fine.
283980	285201	The box was nasty.
285561	287503	It had mildew and shit, but it was brand new.
288103	290685	We have a Capcom fighting stick for the Genesis.
291446	291826	Wow.
292326	293387	Why did you order that?
293887	296249	Because we have several Genesees.
296389	297510	Because I wanted one.
298471	299211	It was seven bucks.
299451	301213	Dude, why not?
301735	302375	Just impulse buy.
302415	304477	You didn't break it out to try anything with?
304497	306818	You didn't get old school championship edition or anything?
307138	308119	Well, we already have all that.
308179	309119	Alright, just checking.
309900	312801	And we got the FC Mobile.
313562	314662	Yeah, what is this all about?
314682	315183	The FC Mobile.
315203	316183	It's a handheld NES.
317484	318264	That's really all it is.
318925	320205	I don't know how long the battery life is.
320466	323127	Dan played it more than me, but we played Guardian Legend.
323167	326229	The thing's got to be somewhat big if you actually put an entire cartridge into it.
326289	328150	Is it about the size of an NES cartridge, the system?
329031	333072	About the width plus another two inches.
334093	337614	So it's not the Atari where it has all the games inside it in the memory.
337634	338834	You plug in your cartridge.
338974	341055	It's like a Game Boy, but it plays NES games.
341155	342395	It's called the FC Mobile.
342415	342716	They're like $40.
344116	344717	Wow, that's not bad.
344897	345698	And they're really light.
345798	346779	Is that because of the whole thing?
346839	356168	Like the same reason they were selling the third-party NESs at E3 a few years ago where it's something like the patent on the Nintendo property expired because it's been like 20 years?
357049	358010	Something like that I want to say.
358651	364076	So would that mean that in a couple of years we're going to start seeing like Super Nintendos and Genesis start coming out and all these things?
364096	365918	You don't need to do a Genesis one, Rob.
367554	368074	I'm just saying.
368375	370397	Because of the Nomad.
370857	372398	Oh my god, Dan was hilarious.
373139	376102	Well, also the fact Sega repackages their games like 50 times over.
376882	381086	Dan was very hilarious about this, and if he hears it, he's going to be a little bit embarrassed, but I don't care.
382728	390475	He was like, I wonder if, you know, they're going to do a super... Because it was like you were saying, it talks about doing a handheld Genesis.
390495	392677	He's like, wait, wait, we have that.
392717	393718	It's called the Nomad.
394418	408289	So I was like, yes, sweetie, pat, pat, pat Question from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice So be heard, join our chat live on Sunday night Hitstun asks, how is the hardware?
408349	409210	Is the screen good?
410230	413053	Pretty good, pretty good, I like it You don't have dead pixels?
414033	414794	No Well, that's good
416107	417408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
434838	438801	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
462996	466239	And then I played some WiiWare stuff.
466259	473164	I actually played Bit.Trip Beat, which it's okay until they thought, hey, it's a great idea.
473184	478688	Let's have little blocks that are dark blue against a black background where you can't see them.
479669	481130	That's when I stopped playing the game.
481791	484293	And that was it.
484933	488416	JustinFYIChat is giving us feedback that they can't hear us on JustinTV right now.
488456	489577	They're not getting audio on there.
489857	490878	They're getting video but no audio.
492574	495618	Thanks for watching!
510586	515007	Another homebrew game, that's a demo for another game that I'd like not to mention on this show.
515548	529072	Let me just say it sucks as much as you would think it sucks, and the guy who made it is a douchebag, and I think we know who we're talking about here, but we are not mentioning his name, because that would be wrong.
530452	538515	And then, my wife started playing Excite Truck again, in preparation for ExciteBots Trick Racing, so...
540149	541229	Very excited by that.
542350	542730	She is.
543530	545971	And then, what else did I play?
546311	547291	I think that's pretty much it.
547691	550272	I got a lot of stuff that I was going to play, but I didn't get to play a lot of it.
550972	554913	Oh, I checked out that stupid, I think we talked about it last week, the Kama Sutra DS thing.
555333	555833	It's funny.
556314	556934	That's about it.
557574	560875	And then, yeah, that's it.
561035	564256	I have Rhythm Tengoku, or Rhythm Heaven, I guess, to try out.
564356	568297	And then more Peggle DS, because that's fun.
569699	570320	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
587483	588284	NinjaBlade NinjaBlade
606196	607457	and played that for a little bit.
607718	611761	I know I've been gaining weight since I was sick last year and I wanted to see how much.
611981	613162	So now you weigh 20 pounds.
613282	613743	Oh, shut up.
614343	621489	So I went back and played that for a little bit and was playing some of the old school classics on there like Legend of the Mystical Ninja and all that stuff.
622009	622390	Cool, cool.
624901	626202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
641230	641931	Thanks for watching!
660560	661000	Thanks for watching!
677405	679546	It still feels a little clunky to me.
679726	684268	And when I say clunky, I mean the download speeds of the areas as you load them.
684348	690431	Yes, I realize you can download in the background and all this, but I kind of wish the thing was a little more intuitive.
690471	695593	If I was going to start walking towards a particular map, it would be cool if that map would start loading.
695613	696313	It's kind of a little...
698534	700377	That's profiling.
700677	706524	There's a lot of polish that still needs to be done in home, but it is getting slightly better and better at the same time.
707305	712811	Just slightly, but I do see improvement in home, and I think that has to be acknowledged because it is a pretty ambitious thing.
713472	716275	Is there a download yet that gives home a point?
717156	719197	There are still more minigames popping up.
719237	722339	The Guitar Hero area has a Simon Says-style minigame.
722419	724581	It's nothing that awesome.
724681	727183	It's free, but it's free.
727783	730385	Again, might I remind everybody, you don't pay for home.
731405	737970	Considering it's a free thing, granted, they microtransaction a lot of these clubs and things, but I have yet to pay a dollar.
738010	739631	If you're not in home, you're homeless.
741526	742506	And nobody wants to be homeless.
743727	746587	Actdeft in chat says, Home is second life without the crazy antics.
746807	749088	GameGuru says, The big picture of home is make money.
749108	752089	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see where the more nickel and diming comes in a little later.
752169	753249	So, I don't know.
753929	754169	All right.
755649	756090	Let's see.
756170	757190	What else?
758290	759090	In my gaming week.
760431	763391	Really not a whole lot else that I can think of.
764351	765272	Xbox 360.
766052	767892	Just playing some of the old arcade titles.
767932	769533	Pagle and so forth.
769833	770733	But not a lot of new stuff.
771155	772296	I did forget one game I played.
772356	772636	What's that?
772776	774497	Which is the game that we're playing right now.
774897	779379	But Ninja Blade, I played during the week, actually, because I haven't really gotten a chance to play it since I got it.
781420	782440	It's fun.
782680	788423	It's actually not too... Sorry, if you heard an echo there, it's because I was checking JustinTV where we do have audio, thank God.
789043	791644	Yes, because you unplugged something from your splitter coming out of your computer.
791965	798087	The way you had it hooked up there would have been fine, but they wouldn't have been able to hear the music that we played during the little break.
798928	799168	Whatever.
799828	801149	Anyways, give us a quick walkthrough.
801189	807511	I know this is radio, and we'll try to keep the references to the video minimum, but kind of walk us through this game a little bit.
807551	811432	You were talking about, I know, earlier before we started, this big epic cutscene at the beginning of Ninja Boy.
811572	813473	It's so over the top that it's hilarious.
813853	819415	The main character looks like he's the spirit, you know, Sans crappy movie.
821436	824517	But it's actually very God of War-esque.
824757	825498	You basically...
827452	828632	Thanks for watching!
853301	854344	What's the flippin' point?
854424	855868	You say it's kind of God of War-esque?
856329	859517	Yeah, the point is you're this team of ninjas that...
861169	861669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
889545	890986	So that's pretty much the game.
892247	893508	But you like these over the top.
893608	896169	Oh yeah, it's awesome.
896450	903975	I do, but it's actually, you know, a lot of the games that are put out from software and stuff like that, they're not that great.
904395	905896	But this is actually pretty good.
906096	907717	And it's been pretty entertaining so far.
907757	913161	And it actually looks like it's going to start me from the beginning because apparently I didn't get far enough to save.
914081	919005	But all the more exciting because I'm going to show you that whole skydiving part.
919745	924350	Okay, this is a little cutscene that shows what happens when some old man sees some chick that's been infected.
924510	925331	We don't need to see that.
925971	926632	Skip that.
928874	929735	Alright.
930556	934500	Let me go to Casper, sorry, the doctor, and we'll ask the doctor about his gaming week and we'll come back to you.
934520	936462	Hopefully you're a little bit into Ninja Blade at that point.
936482	937743	You can tell us a little bit about the gameplay.
938944	939425	Alright, uh,
940353	941554	The Doctor, how was your gaming week?
956989	959450	I don't know if you guys ever played that, but there's lots of crazy minigames.
959490	962612	Yes, we have played that, or at least I watched Loki play it at PAX.
962692	964613	The best minigame has to be the dancing.
964653	967094	It's kind of like DDR, but where you have to move your whole body.
968855	972577	Watching my friend get into this was hilarious.
972737	974018	We were cracking up.
975079	975859	But I'm with you.
975879	978781	There's not a lot of new stuff on any system that I'm like, woo!
979847	980548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1008968	1010970	I mean, what does that even do?
1012111	1012912	That's no point to me.
1014333	1016075	Well, it takes pictures, Doctor.
1016375	1019097	Ah, I have a camera, and I don't need another one.
1020639	1020999	Fair enough.
1023361	1023822	All right, well.
1024402	1027926	So, yeah, but we're also watching Loki here.
1028326	1031569	There are monsters and blood and swords and ridiculousness.
1032210	1033130	Rawr!
1033991	1034992	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1057059	1061241	Well, I'm just, you know, basically right now they're just, you know, kind of teaching you the basics of the game.
1061341	1062301	Oh, you can do jump attacks.
1062382	1065023	Oh, you can do, like, heavy attacks and yada, yada, yada.
1065103	1065763	Kill these guys.
1066463	1073747	So, um, but it gets ridiculous because, like, your, like, sensei or whatever is kind of helping you out through the game and he gives you, like, these different weapons to use.
1074247	1077168	Meanwhile, like, he's, like, flipping around and, you know, throwing people.
1077269	1082351	Like, there's a quick time event where I gotta jump and I dodge that thing.
1083977	1085979	So now it's all Dragon's Lair where you just press a button.
1086019	1086920	And I hit a button.
1087080	1087440	Interesting.
1087660	1095307	Yeah, there's a lot of interactive cut scenes and quick time events and a lot of stuff that I miss because it's hard to read them on this TV.
1095747	1096307	But that's okay.
1096608	1096948	Interesting.
1097830	1100172	Alright, well, and I'm looking at a comment in chat.
1100412	1102695	For some reason, the JustinTV chat is borked tonight.
1102735	1104476	Like, I'm not seeing anything in the JustinTV chat.
1104496	1106258	So if you guys are trying to yell at us there, don't even bother.
1106298	1107319	You've got to go to our main room.
1108060	1110001	But I do see Misty saying, whoop blood.
1110642	1112163	So, very bloody game.
1112784	1113905	Can I get a whoop blood?
1114105	1114686	Whoop blood.
1115366	1119708	That game you were playing the other week on the GameCube, Mad World, that was way worse on the blood.
1120748	1121849	I almost brought that again.
1123990	1135815	I like this setup for the show where we have the game that we'll be running during the show and then someday we'll have the switcher so we'll go back to having the camera in studio when something exciting actually happens here in studio which is not that often.
1137037	1138138	And the Interactive Cutscenes
1154909	1161074	TigerClaw in chat says basically OLR wants to copy FNG which is Friday Night Gaming Bobby's show here on All Games Radio.
1161775	1161975	No.
1162615	1164457	We don't want to copy Friday Night Gaming.
1164677	1165277	They did their own thing.
1165298	1168680	They fix stuff on air and we don't really get into that kind of stuff.
1169201	1179389	Plus they have that whole gaming center thing where people like that All Games Interactive used to have back in the day where people could like walk in and out as they want to and seeing as we tape this show at my house that's not exactly going to be happening.
1179689	1181871	Although we have had Perfect Strangers show up here before.
1181951	1182512	Remember Moe?
1183092	1183473	Remember?
1183753	1189241	We didn't even know her before we sent her an email on YouTube and she came here and sung the show, or sung the song on the show, so.
1190102	1191584	No, we didn't do it.
1192318	1195199	You know, we've done the same shit for, what, seven years now?
1195239	1197980	We're just slightly evolving a little bit as time goes on.
1198020	1198260	All right.
1198961	1199501	Let's get in.
1199521	1203002	The entire class says, OLR could turn into a gaming center if more guests show up.
1203322	1203983	I hope not.
1204023	1205063	Again, this is my house.
1205223	1208324	It's like, you know, at 10, 10, 1030, I want everyone to get that out.
1208344	1210385	Well, I just walked in, so I'm another guest.
1210405	1211286	What about me?
1211626	1212986	Yeah, but you're different because I know you.
1213747	1215727	No, I mean the doctor and me.
1215827	1216168	Oh, shut up.
1216188	1216948	I'm different.
1217506	1221289	Alright, housekeeping tonight before we get into the gaming news.
1221309	1223310	We're like 20 minutes into the show, we need to get into the gaming news.
1223591	1225692	Just a quick warning, kind of a disclaimer tonight.
1225772	1234939	It was April Fool's Week this week, and while we think we've done a pretty good job of weeding the actual news stories from the bullshit, there might have been some bullshit that snuck through, but I don't think tonight.
1234979	1236460	I think we got pretty much everything cleared.
1238201	1248266	Also, don't forget to follow us on Twitter at UsernameOLR or follow us on Facebook, OLArmy, or follow us on LiveJournal at UsernameOrangeLounge.
1250281	1253403	Also, I want to make a mention of Orange Lounge Radio March Madness.
1253443	1260587	That's the thing that Bress Lowell really heads up, kind of spears it up for the Saturday night program here under Station Live.
1260647	1263029	And, you know, we kind of give our commentary running on it.
1263109	1264950	It finally ended this last week.
1264990	1269513	Seems like it went on for a while, but considering you had like 64 games that had to get narrowed down to one.
1270253	1277856	there were no ties this year there was one clear winner in the final no ties that we have to break Super Mario Bros.
1278136	1290501	3 is your ultimate video game of all time per OLR March Madness this year which once again beat Chrono Trigger Chrono Trigger was the runner up for the second year in a row
1292008	1292548	Super Mario Bros.
1292568	1293109	3 Super Mario Bros. 3
1314927	1316808	I'm not knocking on Chrono Trigger.
1316828	1319770	It's a fabulous game, definitely worthy of the runner-up prize.
1320111	1323913	However, you can't get mad that a game like Super Mario Bros.
1324254	1324634	3 beat it.
1325534	1327136	If Rock Band had ultimately won...
1328197	1345776	I could see you, because that was in the final four I could see you getting mad if Rock Band won I would have stopped playing video games forever I would have joined you And I love me Rock Band But like a fine wine, it needs to age a little bit It needs to age a little bit before it can truly be the ultimate video game of all time Alright
1346537	1348819	Yeah, Necessity Vampire in chat says, it's just a poll.
1349580	1350481	It's just a damn poll.
1350541	1350981	Don't cry.
1351662	1352002	Don't cry.
1352022	1353604	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1353684	1358448	Loki, you're going to have to pause your game so you can start us off with some gaming news tonight about Sony.
1358909	1360070	Big press conference, right?
1360523	1361203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1377093	1391040	and that is supposed to spike sales and allow the PlayStation brand to grow even more or it's just another way for them to say, hey look, look how many people we have on the PlayStation platform.
1391820	1402285	Not the PlayStation 3 because the PlayStation 3 is in third place as far as the new consoles go but the PlayStation platform is number one because the PlayStation 2 is so popular.
1404187	1404547	I don't know.
1404647	1407188	I think it's about time that they drop the price of it.
1407328	1408169	I mean, it's old.
1408389	1409409	It's over 10 years old now.
1409910	1411710	So, not a big surprise.
1414472	1417473	And then, also, other than the U.S.
1417533	1422435	getting the price drop, of course, we're going to see a price drop in Europe as well to 99 euros.
1423276	1425277	And, unfortunately, no price drop for the U.K.
1425617	1425837	Sorry.
1428018	1428198	But...
1429312	1430233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1455293	1457154	I don't think this is going to make any difference night and day
1480307	1482807	Well, that, and they're like, oh, it can impact sales of the Wii.
1482887	1486528	No, I don't think it will, because... Well, because that's the market they're going for.
1486868	1498310	Instead of trying to... They're trying to make the price of the PlayStation 2 so lucrative that people will want to buy it instead of the Wii, because I think... I do think the PS2 is competing with the Wii for that sort of kids' bedroom toy.
1498830	1499090	You know?
1499230	1501951	And the Wii is not having the mass shortages that it used to have.
1501991	1508772	That was kind of what was keeping the PlayStation 2 in some ways afloat, was that there was... Sometimes the Wii was gone, so people would opt for...
1509512	1510012	PlayStation 2.
1513053	1514974	You can't say PlayStation 2 is a bad system.
1515074	1517395	You can't say there's no games available for the PlayStation 2.
1518855	1521096	It's going to drop the new price and the used price.
1521436	1523977	I think it had to come eventually.
1524017	1534701	I'm kind of curious to see what the sales are going to be on the Wii in the next few months because they have met the demand and because of that I've had a lot less people buying them.
1534961	1538682	When it meets the demand it's usually a time when the colors come.
1540783	1541803	It might be a matter of time.
1542504	1550206	And I wouldn't be surprised if the colors come during E3 because that's when they're going to announce stupid, superfluous shit like this.
1550787	1551987	Comments from chat, comments from chat.
1552347	1556368	TigerClaw says, It's amazing that Sony still supports the PS2 given its enormous library.
1556669	1557369	You gotta give it to them.
1557409	1568393	Unlike Microsoft or Nintendo that screw their fans by discontinuing their consoles, the fact that Sony still supports the PS2 shows that there are still a large contingent of people that still own their PS2s.
1568473	1569433	All that from TigerClaw.
1569873	1573756	Or because there's no backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 2 anymore on the PlayStation 3.
1573856	1575998	And that's exactly what Brad from PodCulture says.
1576178	1582123	Yeah, folks will pick one up, especially if your PS3 is not backwards compatible and your old, chunky PS2 is acting odd.
1584065	1591411	Also, I want to say for Misty, kind of a dissenting voice here, it annoys me because I just replaced my PS2 since the beginning of the year and now it dropped to $99.
1592752	1594093	Slanted angry face.
1594153	1596395	And Nintendo still will repair the old systems.
1597349	1598050	DarkSakura,
1612329	1613330	PSP, Rock Band Unplugged
1640530	1644854	This news came out March 31st, which in a certain time zone might have been April 1st.
1645154	1648297	No, I can see this happening because... This is legit.
1648617	1651660	It's very legit because a lot of these songs cross over into the actual Rock Band games.
1652421	1652861	I can see this.
1652881	1655063	There is a way for me to check.
1656204	1667332	For example, Blink-182, What's My Age Again, Billy Idol, White Wedding, Boston, More Than a Feelin', Foo Fighters, Everlong, Modest Mouse, Float On, Jackson 5, ABC, The Police, Message in a Bottle, The Who, Pinball Wizard, etc.
1678815	1683138	Now also, the box apparently also confirms that there will be download content.
1683158	1684539	There's going to be a music store.
1685659	1688361	Unfortunately, there will be no multiplayer at all in the game.
1689802	1693825	They had also some screenshots from it on the back of the box as well.
1695098	1701043	I remember seeing the screenshots elsewhere on the internet, and it definitely looks like it's going to be an amplitude frequency type of game.
1701143	1703184	Which, hey, fine by me.
1703845	1722719	And I was just saying on Bobby's show earlier, Bobby Blackwolf, the guy who does the show before us here on All Games Radio on Sunday nights, was talking about the DS and DSi, and how Guitar Hero on Tour, one of the biggest selling third-party DS games, is kind of screwed by the DSi because the Game Boy Advance slot's now gone.
1722739	1723079	Not really.
1723419	1728721	And I was kind of, you know, we joked when we called on the show, like, well, who the fuck should be playing Guitar Hero on the DS anyway?
1728761	1731442	You know, if they're trying to, like, emulate the whole... It doesn't matter.
1731462	1732802	Play the actual Guitar Hero.
1733282	1734143	It doesn't matter anyways.
1734263	1736563	It's a new system on top of the DS.
1736583	1738284	They're still selling four colors of the DS.
1738604	1741885	And there's still that many millions of DSs out there.
1742186	1743706	They're not going to suffer one bit.
1743986	1753390	But see, I give that a hard time, yet I allow Rock Band, this whole Rock Band on tour, because they're making a different game out of it that is really a throwback to something a lot of people have been salivating from.
1753410	1754591	It doesn't have any peripherals.
1754971	1755331	That too.
1756372	1761654	They could easily... I wouldn't be surprised if they port this to the PlayStation 2.
1762034	1764575	Without the song store and stuff like that.
1764755	1765135	Who knows?
1765456	1765776	We'll see.
1767356	1775598	Well, anyhow, we will continue to watch Rock Band Unplugged and let you know more on it as soon as we know, which I'm sure will be E3.
1775638	1780159	I'm sure that game's going to be playable on the show floor, and I know that will be one of the first things I check out.
1780419	1781199	What about you, DarkSakura?
1781219	1782319	Are you interested in Rock Band Unplugged?
1783700	1785700	Well, not particularly.
1785720	1785960	Really?
1786000	1787681	I thought you were a big amplitude frequency type fan.
1788161	1792382	I like it, but I'm... There's other things you're more interested in.
1792402	1793222	They make me motion sick.
1793442	1794442	Yeah, I can see that.
1795856	1801479	Well, there is going to be a new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP and the PS2.
1802499	1802919	Why?
1803159	1803720	I don't know.
1804180	1805120	But there is.
1805641	1810443	And it's going to basically pick up from where the last game left off.
1811323	1813584	And so you are in the last frontier.
1814345	1814625	And you're...
1815365	1816966	Going to help someone become a sage.
1817226	1818507	Kira, I think is the name.
1819407	1823070	And so it's an adventure up in the mountains.
1824050	1824710	Or in the air.
1825591	1828152	Or with pirates of the sky.
1829853	1832295	Well, you know, this series obviously still has its fans.
1832335	1835957	And I think this goes right in line with the whole PlayStation 2 price drop.
1835997	1840640	It's interesting to see, wow, they are still making freaking games for the PlayStation 2.
1841020	1842601	And this isn't like a...
1844107	1844987	D-List title.
1845007	1846208	This is at least the B-List.
1847328	1854390	Well, it actually is being developed by High Impact Games.
1854710	1856211	So they're the ones that did Size Matters.
1857911	1866094	And it looks like it's going to be fairly less depressing than the second one was.
1867521	1867881	Alright.
1868902	1870863	Any interest in Jak and Dexter for you?
1870963	1873144	No, I haven't been interested in that ever.
1873504	1874885	It's more of a kids franchise, right?
1875905	1876926	I don't know.
1877446	1878827	I know we have listeners that are fans.
1878847	1881248	It's not necessarily a kids franchise.
1881348	1882389	I'm not really saying that.
1883109	1884530	It's just like Ratchet and Clank.
1884690	1890473	I tried to get into Ratchet and Clank because I had never really been a fan of it on the PlayStation 2 with the PlayStation 3 version.
1890853	1891634	Tools of Destruction.
1892174	1895336	I played it for a little bit and then I ended up selling it to my friend because I just...
1896397	1898278	Tales of Vesperia
1924212	1928595	And this is not really a big surprise since Tales of Vesperia came out on the 360.
1928635	1931476	They did a similar thing with Eternal Sonata.
1932037	1940902	Now, of course, after the wait, not only do you get a game that is on par with the 360 version, but they've also added in new stuff.
1942163	1948166	Including some new characters you'll get to play as that were kind of hinted in the Xbox 360 version.
1948606	1951128	But now they are playable, which is kind of cool.
1952565	1963582	and on another game they also announced Tales of Versus which is going to be a PSP title and it's kind of like the Tales version of Dissidia which is neat.
1963602	1966487	So you got all the Tales characters fighting each other.
1968058	1970260	It's still part of the Tales series, yeah.
1970460	1976165	A little bit different, but they're putting out a lot of Tales games, that's for sure.
1976565	1978487	It's selling like crazy in Japan, right?
1978527	1981990	Didn't the Xbox 360 get a huge boost from this period?
1982130	1984712	Yeah, that and Eternal Sonata, I think, did pretty good.
1985233	1986494	But, I don't know.
1988535	1991258	I never really noticed the Tales franchise that much.
1991358	1996182	I haven't really played any of them, so I kind of feel bad in that sense, but I don't want to play any of them.
1996940	2001623	Well, Tales for Fantasia on Game Boy Advance is actually pretty good.
2002023	2003504	Like for an old school, like 16-bit.
2005000	2008063	Oh yeah, Tales definitely has a very cult following to it.
2008103	2009724	There's lots of fans of this series.
2011085	2012827	I'm not surprised this game is showing up on PlayStation 3.
2014228	2020453	It is a little bit late to the party, but I think over in Japan it's going to mean more than it will here.
2020533	2024116	Because in Japan, the PlayStation 3 has penetrated a bigger slice of the market.
2024577	2026979	So I think it's going to be a bigger deal over there.
2027219	2039444	I would say put it out this year if you can because come the end of this year and possibly next spring, Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out and no one's going to care about anything else as far as the RPGs go.
2040224	2042565	And whether it's good or bad, I mean, just no one's going to care.
2043045	2049827	Speaking of which, remember, we're only like a couple weeks away and I'll be getting my copy of the demo.
2049847	2050728	Ooh, that's right.
2051744	2053065	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2077027	2081388	Also, you can send, apparently, files to your friends as big as three megabytes now.
2081968	2087870	And you can sort friends in your friends list now alphabetically or by online status and last login time.
2089350	2093551	Which is good, because it seemed like there was no rhyme or reason to the friends list sorting before, so that was a feature that was needed.
2094472	2095732	Also, there's some other features.
2096412	2101376	a dynamic normalizer that will prevent sudden increases in volume between music tracks.
2101696	2104598	For those games that don't know how to normalize their volume, that's pretty good.
2105359	2107000	If you don't have a sound system, it'll do that as well.
2107621	2114866	Also, the ability to cut and paste text, which I guess if you're a huge chatter in home might be useful or something.
2115647	2120310	I can't think of a lot of chatty things I do on the PlayStation 3, but I guess cut and paste is needed.
2120330	2122852	And now the dawn of the age of text spamming in...
2123738	2124218	Out now!
2124238	2126059	I actually upgraded earlier today before I went into home.
2151013	2173020	but unfortunately those really aren't a lot of features I use very often except the friends list that will probably be the biggest thing for me well there's a particular series that I hate hate hate hate hate hate I won't see any of it I hate this whole series of movies the concept of it is disgusting and just repugnant to me what movie series is that Rob?
2175099	2178042	Um, I would have to say Pokemon.
2178603	2178743	Oh.
2180584	2181665	I really, really hate Saw.
2181826	2182847	Pokemon and Saw?
2183467	2184728	No.
2184808	2188211	Would you watch that if the Pokemon started in the next Saw movie?
2189232	2189853	Fuck no.
2190333	2191134	Pikachu!
2191174	2193636	Pikachu!
2194737	2195158	Well, anyway.
2196199	2196259	Um...
2199131	2203013	As I was saying, Konami has the Saw license.
2203553	2208555	They pried it out of the dead fingers of Brash Entertainment.
2209716	2210116	Thank God.
2210876	2212537	Because then it might actually be a decent game.
2214778	2219140	But now, they were actually drawing comparisons between that and Silent Hill.
2220340	2221601	Which I thought was more funny.
2222681	2223322	Funnier!
2223562	2225203	There's my grammar today.
2225883	2225943	Um...
2227213	2230796	The marketer David Daniels was telling what?
2231656	2233057	Sorry, I'm laughing at the chat room.
2233357	2234798	Hold on, we got DJ Tyrant.
2235319	2235959	Hello, Ash.
2236580	2237841	I'd like to play a battle with you.
2239282	2241923	And Gold Anthro says, gotta saw them all.
2246567	2248668	Dear chat room, they make Ritalin for a reason.
2250289	2250990	Sorry, DarkSakura.
2251010	2251330	It's okay.
2252571	2256374	But the marketer David Daniels is quoted saying...
2258513	2267219	that Silent Hill is more about psychological terror but Saw for Us is more about graphic intense horror that overwhelms you.
2267619	2271642	We want players to turn away from the screen for just a moment because of the visual intensity.
2272832	2290806	or because the graphics really really suck in other words it's going to be blood pornography these games are going to be just they're already preparing us for the fact that these games are going to be blood pornography well it's supposed to be out in the fall it actually has Tobin Bell doing the voice of Jigsaw
2291468	2292189	Thanks for watching!
2307591	2313097	Well, it's going to be out on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, and guess who's not going to buy it?
2314058	2314438	Me!
2315099	2318102	I'm not even going to let it come into my house.
2318582	2321665	Aren't you worried this might have an impact on the Silent Hill series?
2321925	2322266	I hope not.
2322346	2323367	It better fucking not.
2323968	2325529	I do like that he has the distinction.
2325549	2326490	You mean it's going to get worse?
2326891	2329333	I like that they've made the clear distinction.
2329934	2331816	Silent Hill, psychological thriller.
2331856	2336762	Because when I think psychological thriller, I think of great scary movies like The Silence of the Lambs.
2337142	2339485	These types of classic psychological thrillers.
2339785	2341487	More in a suspense sense.
2341667	2343708	Right, but that's what Silent Hill is, right?
2343868	2345889	More of like a suspense, mindfuck kind of movie, right?
2345909	2349770	But it has the gross... It has the gore attached to it.
2350250	2353612	It has... But it's not... The gore is not the focus.
2353792	2353992	Yes.
2354192	2357413	The gore is part of driving in the psychological part.
2357453	2361555	This is... You are walking through a personal nightmare for your character.
2361695	2361935	That's...
2362815	2364416	In essence, that is Silent Hill.
2364496	2367196	You are walking through their nightmare.
2367376	2374879	Everything in the game has some aspect of their personality or their guilt or something having to do with them that's going back to that person.
2374939	2378240	It requires more thought than just splattering blood everywhere.
2378640	2381300	But you know there are going to be people that are all about the blood orgy of Saw.
2381520	2382081	It will sell.
2382341	2382861	It will sell.
2383501	2386802	It'll sell, but... Loki, you're a big blood fan.
2386962	2389103	Are you going to be purchasing the blood orgy that is Saw?
2389243	2390243	No, because it's not going to be any good.
2392063	2398546	I'm sorry, even if they could promise... Now, what they should have called it is Blood Orgy of the Game, but, you know... I'd buy a game called Blood Orgy.
2400526	2402007	No, but seriously, though... I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2402247	2407309	I'm sorry, but, you know, not to knock Konami or anything, it's not going to be any good.
2408289	2409410	Because it's made by Konami.
2409890	2412811	I don't want to knock them or anything, but it's... God damn, your game's going to suck.
2413775	2414376	I'm sorry.
2414596	2415256	Hold on, though.
2415577	2417838	To be fair, none of you have touched the game.
2418058	2421721	And you're basing your review of the game off the movie, which isn't completely fair.
2421781	2425464	No, I'm basing my review off of the screenshot that I saw, okay?
2425925	2430608	And also the fact that Saw cannot be made into a game very well.
2430989	2432470	Because how are you going to do that?
2433594	2436815	And no, I'm sorry, Konami's not clever enough to figure that out.
2437376	2438096	Point and click.
2438296	2448360	How about I have read enough about Saw to know that I have zero interest in playing the game or seeing the movies or anything remotely related to it, and I don't even watch the damn trailers.
2448480	2454902	Then again, I don't watch TV, but still, I have zero interest in nothing but loathing for the franchise.
2455290	2469117	Now, I noticed the consensus amongst chat, and I'm not going to read a lot of the individual quotes from chat here, because it seems like there's a consensus that Saw 1, decent, the rest, blood orgy, stupid porn movies, blood porn.
2470358	2474620	The Leo Shannon chat, I will read this comment, blood orgy and titties would be the best selling game ever.
2476120	2477321	It just might, it just might.
2479279	2482600	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
2501503	2502844	I don't think I'll have to do that.
2521268	2528492	Actdeft is telling me to give the first movie a try, but I'm going to go ahead and explain this right now.
2528952	2538617	The concept of that kind of thing, about putting people in that position, disgusts me like you have no idea how much it disgusts me.
2539158	2539298	It's...
2541019	2545881	It's so reprehensible of an idea that thinking about it makes me want to vomit.
2546261	2547422	So no, I won't see it.
2548382	2552144	I did see the first Saw movie, and it's one of those things where it's like, it's not that great.
2552284	2553944	You can live your life and not see it.
2554024	2557746	Like, there's a hundred other movies I would say a person has to see before they see Saw.
2559477	2559837	C-Saw
2579269	2591141	Continue the series without a new bad person and they've kind of done, they've made it as confusing as possible unless you've watched like the other movies and you're just like, oh, that's that dude from that other movie and wait, what?
2591881	2593783	But next Silent Hill game, I am so there.
2595184	2595945	I bought Homecoming.
2595985	2596446	It was fun.
2596706	2597106	Good game.
2597266	2598368	I need to actually go back and beat it.
2599176	2599637	Thanks for watching!
2617503	2618564	What's it going to be?
2618664	2620705	It's just like an adventure game?
2620765	2621686	It doesn't make any sense.
2622066	2627069	I would bet money this Saw game is going to sell even though we all hate it because there's an audience out there for it.
2627270	2627750	There really is.
2629151	2631192	There will be a Saw 2 video game.
2631753	2637917	It will probably come out in October and it's going to be coming out at the same time as a bunch of other bigger games and I'm sorry.
2638257	2647203	When this comes out there will be people that pick it up because it's Saw but think of the last really good movie title that's come out on consoles.
2648864	2651026	That's right, because most of them aren't that good.
2657025	2657626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2679585	2686453	This is just going to give ammunition to those people that say that video games are poisoning the minds of people everywhere.
2686573	2692661	And those people that say Manhunt 2 is corrupting America and Grand Theft Auto is poisoning our children, etc.
2693021	2699308	These saw games, especially if people's predictions that you are going to be the puppet in these games is correct...
2700089	2702991	If you're the little puppet creature, that'd be awesome.
2703271	2703612	I don't know.
2703672	2714359	I have a bad feeling that this game is going to be one of those things that certain lawyers, who I wish would stay out of the goddamn news, are going to use to propel their case into the next decade.
2714379	2722345	They should be more offended by the movies because the movies are actually graphic and stuff, whereas this game, I don't think enough people are going to buy it to even care that it's violent.
2722925	2727009	I will go ahead and say, by the way, it is not the gore that bothers me.
2727770	2731353	It is the concept of what the people in the movie... Torture porn.
2731393	2732334	Torture porn bothers you.
2732354	2732914	Basically, that's it.
2733174	2738219	I do not... I can't stand torture of people who really haven't done anything wrong.
2739130	2739370	All right.
2740030	2740571	Let's move on.
2741911	2742831	I'm so done with Saw.
2743131	2744632	But the people have done stuff that's wrong.
2745112	2746893	That's the whole point of why they're being tortured.
2747533	2748053	You know what I mean.
2748693	2748913	Whatever.
2749413	2753795	Anyways, something that's not wrong in any way whatsoever would be Saints Row 2.
2754495	2761758	And there's brand new download content coming out for it on April 16th, which makes me pretty excited because now I have a new reason to play that game again.
2763345	2772171	The new download content will be called Ultor Exposed, which makes sense because there's areas of the map that you can't conquer yet, and they're all owned by Ultor.
2773051	2776674	It will give you a few new things, including a co-op metagame.
2777394	2781097	You'll be able to use porn star Tara Patrick as one of your homies.
2784685	2790734	Okay, and new vehicles, new weapons, and some new multiplayer maps are also coming out along with that.
2791215	2797864	It's going to be available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.
2798605	2801129	And I look forward to checking that out.
2802856	2808338	All righty, let's move on to some release dates and let's travel the world and check out what's coming out in some other countries this week.
2808398	2813160	And I'm looking over at Japan and in the next-gen systems, there's really not a whole lot.
2813721	2820984	You get a price reduction on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 on PlayStation 3, but not a lot of new stuff.
2821004	2825445	And I'm wondering if that's because you got the whole Advent Children coming out next week over in Japan.
2825525	2825846	I don't know.
2827046	2831547	On the Nintendo Wii, you do have Oboro Muramasa comes out this week.
2831767	2835208	And I'm not sure what this game really is, but it does look kind of stylized.
2835228	2835689	It is awesome.
2835729	2838309	This game is by the developers of Odin Sphere.
2838569	2839710	It's all hand-drawn.
2839950	2842111	It's very stylized.
2842511	2843591	This looks kind of neat, actually.
2843611	2845171	It's like a side-scroll action game.
2845231	2847132	It's coming out in June here in the U.S.
2847192	2849613	It's going to be called here Muramasa the Demon Blade.
2851291	2851791	Thanks for watching!
2873220	2873720	Arcana Heart 2
2899151	2900932	A party-stylized concept game on the DS?
2900972	2901052	What?
2920738	2946094	and then lastly in Japan looking at the Sony Playstation Portable I don't believe I see a whole lot on the PSP where is my list here we do have another Evangelion game it's a Neon Genesis Evangelion called Setsu no Girlfriend Tokubetsu Hen Portable so you know what that means dating Evangelion Sim on the PSP again enjoy that
2947660	2954258	Oh, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes is a big title coming out on the PSP I think that one is something you get a little more excited about
2955898	2958919	Again, looks like this game's got some pretty sweet graphics too.
2959219	2960599	It's another Dynasty Warriors game?
2960780	2962360	It looks kind of, a little bit.
2962420	2965241	I mean, there's like zero English in this game whatsoever.
2965501	2967161	It's probably Shingoku Basara.
2967201	2970382	That's, oh, I can't.
2970522	2971102	Battle Heroes.
2972483	2975104	I'm thinking what it's called over here.
2975644	2976724	They've only released one game.
2976944	2979105	I actually have that for the Wii, and I haven't actually played it yet.
2979245	2979405	Hmm.
2980485	2982727	Sky wants a guy version game that's Arcana Hearts style.
2982747	2984629	To be fair, that's most other fighting games.
3003834	3010081	Leo Shen says, Arcana Heart 2, get it, they have a freaking loli fighter modeled after Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz.
3011482	3014245	There's no place like home, there's no place like home, punch!
3015306	3017849	Does she roundhouse kick people with her ruby slippers?
3017929	3019290	I guess so, let's see.
3019511	3021513	It's called Devil Kings over here, that's what it was.
3021713	3022193	There you go.
3022554	3023435	It was Devil something.
3024057	3026198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3054430	3055172	I'm not even going to ask.
3056335	3057800	On the 10th, we have The Godfather 2.
3059043	3059485	And that's it.
3061443	3063404	DSi Systems Rhythm Heaven Gravity
3087935	3095257	Air Conflicts, Aces of World War 2 coming to the PSP because I don't think the PSP's had a World War 2 flight sim game yet.
3095597	3096197	So that's kind of cool.
3096957	3098378	The Chronicles of Riddick, Dark Athena.
3098398	3099758	And it was about time they got one.
3100478	3101338	It was about time.
3101578	3104499	Every system needs their World War 2 flight sim fighting game.
3104539	3106139	Yes, yes, definitely.
3106419	3112381	And the Chronicles of Riddick, Assault on Dark Athena coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 this week.
3113683	3122905	Hannah Montana the movie, the game everyone's been waiting for, coming out on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3123646	3123826	Yay!
3124166	3124846	Yes, awesome.
3125426	3132148	And then if you're not interested in Hannah Montana, you might be interested in Godfather 2, coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
3132508	3139110	Those two, you'd be surprised how the fans... And if you're interested in both of those games, I think something might be wrong.
3141840	3144841	I think most people would be interested in one or the other.
3145001	3152683	I don't really see somebody saying, yeah, GameStop employee, I'm here to pick up my copy of Godfather 2 and Miley Cyrus.
3152744	3153444	It's for my daughter.
3153464	3156305	Miley Cyrus is going to get an offer that she can't refuse.
3160046	3161826	Because Miley Cyrus stars in the Godfather 4.
3162787	3163447	Nobody knows this.
3164927	3166588	Her and Sofia Coppola.
3166688	3169429	Where the Godfather becomes hip and sassy.
3173277	3174599	All right.
3174919	3178043	Some actual serious... Where RuPaul is the godfather.
3178163	3178444	Yeah.
3180186	3180987	I'm going to make you offer.
3181007	3182669	You can't refuse, okay?
3182949	3183990	Girl, you better work.
3185757	3193580	And then on PlayStation 2 and PSP this week, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus coming out if you're looking for a good 2D fighting game.
3194721	3196662	On PC, DCS, Black Shark.
3197442	3199022	Looks like some flight sim game.
3200283	3204325	Deer Drive is getting a re-release from Zoo Games.
3205085	3207486	It's a game where you drive your jeep and kill deer.
3208547	3209868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3228161	3229462	Oh, and this is awesome.
3229662	3243851	On PC, apparently if you like crappy games or you're a girl, OMG High School Triple Play Pack featuring, I believe it's like the Cheetah Girls, Mean Girls, and... Oh, I'm sorry.
3244131	3246052	Mean Girls, Clueless, and Pretty in Pink.
3246973	3248553	I didn't know they had games for those.
3249034	3250315	I like all of those movies.
3251475	3252916	I think something's wrong with me.
3253256	3254597	There is something wrong with you.
3257309	3260670	Let's see, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor coming out on PC.
3261710	3264111	Elven Legacy on PC as well.
3265531	3269692	And this is kind of cool, an Atlus PSP game, Hammer and Hero coming out.
3271153	3274693	And another crappy Wii game, Escape the Museum.
3276154	3278654	And finally, you get a twofer here.
3278815	3284296	Not only do you get a crappy movie this week, but a crappy game based on said crappy movie that's based off of
3287168	3296516	Dragon Ball Evolution The Game, The Movie, The Myth, The Failure Don't you think they need to make a video game out of that?
3313826	3314707	Again, point and click.
3316629	3320433	You dress the guys, you get them into their tucking panties.
3320533	3323376	It would be a Wii game, because it would be a party game.
3323737	3324798	It could be heel clubbing.
3326079	3329923	And you gotta do the dance, but it would be like Spice Girls the game, too.
3330924	3332045	I am all over this game.
3332146	3334008	Let's put another girl through our paces.
3335342	3336042	Thank you.
3336223	3337223	RuPaul's Drag Races.
3337703	3339084	I like SSJ100 Matt.
3339164	3340225	RuPaul GPS.
3340685	3341126	Work.
3341486	3342246	Turn to the left.
3342346	3342867	Work.
3343207	3344007	Turn to the right.
3344147	3347850	Any game where you replace the main character with RuPaul would be hilarious.
3348390	3349190	I love RuPaul.
3349210	3349731	God damn.
3349771	3349991	RuPaul.
3350011	3350912	RuPaul means her own game.
3350972	3353193	I love RuPaul, but I think that'd be great.
3353233	3354594	I think RuPaul would think that'd be funny.
3356348	3358369	Oh my god, is there a game developer out there listening?
3358449	3360931	Please, call them and make this happen.
3361011	3362812	There is an audience for that game.
3362892	3363873	Like Super Mario Bros.
3363893	3368416	3, RuPaul edition, but instead of the raccoon suit, it's the sparkly suit.
3368996	3377962	Look, if you want to put in a little bit of money into this game, you're not going to sell a million, you're probably not even going to sell 100,000, but you'll sell like 25,000.
3378102	3382765	No, I still think there should have been a gay X-Men where RuPaul was Storm.
3382986	3383346	I'm sorry.
3385267	3394588	that would be a great game here's something RuPaul should be in Oni Chambara
3396400	3398281	No, seriously, I'm trying to tie this into the next story.
3398542	3401404	Did you know there was actually a movie based off of Chambara?
3401484	3402524	Yes, I did.
3402625	3403885	It's out here as well.
3403925	3405306	It's localized here in the U.S.
3405347	3407068	called Chambara Beauty, apparently.
3407128	3408309	I know, I got it.
3408329	3409630	I haven't got a chance to watch it yet.
3410230	3410911	Well, you better hurry.
3411171	3411571	I will.
3411811	3412312	Guess what?
3412872	3425001	Apparently, even though this movie got negative reviews across the board, who would have thought, for some reason, bikini-clad women slaying zombies with swords apparently had an audience for it.
3425609	3426169	Chambara Beauty Vortex
3454025	3457408	and I guess there is a game called Vortex as well that's going to be coming out as well.
3457448	3465474	Amazingly enough though, for a Wii game, blood splattering on the screen, you get too much blood on your sword and it sticks into the zombies.
3465814	3469016	It's not like a terrible blood fest, but it was a blood fest.
3469237	3475922	Now something you should know, the star of the first film, Starlet Eri Otogoro, is not coming back for the second movie.
3476902	3478183	So you know it's going to be a winner.
3479645	3482487	So this is a live action Japanese movie.
3483430	3484291	Is that what you're saying?
3501016	3501696	No RuPaul game.
3501937	3502457	I'm just saying.
3503457	3504598	Such injustice in this world.
3504818	3505458	Such injustice.
3505999	3510081	You would like Sky... I think I need to start one of those petition online things.
3510101	3511521	You know those things that don't mean anything?
3511781	3515083	But we need to start collecting signatures for a RuPaul video game.
3515743	3518525	And I'll email fucking RuPaul somehow.
3518945	3520726	Back to live action really quick.
3520806	3524108	Akoge is a live action Japanese film about fag hags.
3524548	3524968	Check it out.
3525869	3526269	Akoge.
3527310	3527650	Really?
3528031	3531753	Yes, yeah, because I dated a Japanese guy for a little bit and he showed it to me.
3532073	3532253	Really?
3532273	3532814	It was awesome.
3533094	3533394	Awesome.
3533414	3536236	Because basically this chick likes to watch guys make out in the park.
3537297	3540178	Gee, you know... I have no problem with that.
3540278	3543721	A lot of straight guys like to watch girls make out in the park.
3543741	3543881	Right.
3543901	3545102	Like, hello, Cruel Intentions.
3545142	3545382	Right.
3547543	3547903	Why not?
3548464	3550305	Some girls like to watch girls make out in the park.
3550325	3553687	La, la, la, la.
3553807	3554888	Innocent, innocent.
3556209	3556469	Anyway...
3558904	3559485	Different stuff.
3559565	3560706	Yes, how about different stuff?
3562787	3565669	Well, there's a game that's called Beyond Good and Evil.
3567450	3568471	And it's getting a sequel.
3570292	3576156	And it's inspired by the Trade Center airplane bombing thing.
3577131	3594795	and I refuse to refer to the event by the date because I think that's fucking retarded so you can just refer to it as Loki's 21st birthday okay it happened on Loki's 21st birthday so when Loki was getting what liquor or something eating steak at a steakhouse that was empty okay
3596548	3602692	But at any rate, the game is supposed to be based off of that.
3603453	3617122	They're saying that that day's events actually gave across the same type of element of fear that he was looking for in the game.
3617322	3625788	And so he's going to incorporate that same emotional sense into the sequel.
3627228	3632369	But, um... He also, though, tried to compare it to Zelda.
3633409	3635530	Saying that... Oh, come on.
3636850	3640030	Saying that they're good games, but out of time.
3642831	3645051	And I'm like, um... Is that like Majora's Mask?
3646652	3654453	No, it just means that there's people who like happy, and some people who like to play fucking depressing stuff.
3656610	3660094	I had... Braid in a way was depressing to me.
3661535	3663096	There's definitely depressing games out there.
3663497	3665118	All the Silent Hill games are pretty depressing too.
3665138	3666198	God, they're fantastic.
3668340	3671202	I actually think that the UFO endings on Silent Hill are more depressing.
3671442	3676125	I have really yet to play that game that makes me want to eat an entire canister of ice cream though.
3676605	3677986	Getting that depressed.
3678026	3684210	Watching a Lifetime movie or Steel Magnolias or something.
3684290	3686472	I have yet to really see the video game equivalent of that.
3687312	3700236	The only problem I have with games like that that'll be about an actual horrifying event like that, or even the World War II games, is the people who, when they play those games, are like, because I'm showing respect to the event and I'm remembering it.
3700396	3700936	Nah.
3701277	3704898	And I'm like, because you're sitting on your ass in your living room on a couch pressing buttons.
3705518	3708359	So I'm like, that's the only – but it could be a good game.
3708379	3708659	I don't know.
3710230	3710730	You know what?
3711271	3721359	I have to say, and I'm just going to leave it here, and yes, it was incredibly awful, but making a big to-do about that is actually just perpetuating fear.
3721920	3723621	We just need to go back to business as usual.
3723822	3727745	It kind of seems like this person's reaching for buzzwords that are going to catch people's attention.
3728706	3729687	That's the impression I get.
3729827	3736853	I can understand trying to evoke an emotion, and I understand that was a very particularly...
3740676	3745858	Well, for lack of a better description, that was definitely a unique sort of feeling, you know?
3746539	3752361	The combination of gutted and really numb, I would think.
3752741	3762926	And I can understand someone trying to evoke an emotion that is that unique, but at the same time, don't drag that into it, just fucking drop it.
3763823	3764003	Klonoa
3785242	3785583	Really?
3785844	3786967	I never played that to completion.
3787007	3792542	It's all, the game as you start it off, it's all cutesy happy, cutesy happy, get towards the end of the game.
3792682	3793725	Oh my god!
3795669	3797070	Wind Waker also said.
3797450	3797690	Really?
3797850	3799011	I didn't really play enough of it.
3799371	3800072	No, I thought it was.
3800132	3803154	I was like, I've been playing this game for 15 years and then this is what happens to the kingdom?
3803714	3807657	Okay, I don't want to get a depressing show so let's go back to Lowell RuPaul for a minute here, okay?
3808017	3814722	Apparently we have a friend at Sony that listens to the show and they're going to email some people about the RuPaul game and making it happen.
3814802	3816443	So, God bless you.
3816503	3819104	You are a public servant of the people.
3819305	3820886	You are a brave man.
3821046	3822867	It better have the word fierce in the title.
3822887	3823187	That's right.
3825468	3828009	God bless you, sir.
3828330	3828970	God bless you.
3828990	3829690	I hope it happens.
3830090	3834352	If they need input of any sort, please give them my email.
3835092	3836113	Also, I want to point this out.
3837113	3838614	SSJ100Matt made a good point.
3838694	3842955	Rob, seriously, keep wishing because last time you did that, they made SingStar Abba.
3844136	3844816	This is true.
3844836	3846477	What if they did SingStar RuPaul?
3847437	3848478	I don't think that would work as much.
3848598	3854060	You could sing Back to My Root, which is actually... Okay, that song is a guilty pleasure for me.
3855262	3857723	No, I don't think I'd want an entire SingStar game out of RuPaul.
3859004	3860905	I think they could make a party game out of drag races.
3861005	3862066	That'd be totally great.
3862486	3863026	I think they could.
3863106	3864427	RuPaul's Fierce Drag Race.
3864747	3865468	ZakuPilot256.
3865608	3866728	There's the name right there.
3866749	3869450	It's got to have fierce in the title.
3869550	3870010	That's right.
3871091	3872112	Most fiercest.
3873672	3874633	It just has to be fierce.
3875632	3876793	This game is fierce!
3876933	3877453	Just buy it.
3878214	3878554	The end.
3878774	3881016	The title should just be This Game is Fierce.
3881256	3884438	Alright, Lord Almighty, let's get past the RuPaul thing.
3884458	3885499	I'm so sorry to our listeners.
3885519	3886900	You're the one who took us back to RuPaul.
3886940	3889261	I know, it's my fault, but I neglected the chat.
3889301	3890022	Candy!
3890222	3895145	I was laughing so hard I couldn't see the chat, so I just went back and caught up on it and wanted to mention that.
3895205	3895446	Sorry.
3895466	3896626	Anyways, so...
3899088	3904951	There's a rumor going around that Mortal Kombat, the team that's working at least on Mortal Kombat, is trying to leave Midway.
3905231	3907732	I guess that's kind of like rats escaping a sinking ship.
3909273	3912074	So they're looking for new developers.
3913314	3913374	Yay.
3914415	3916396	Probably going to buy them up.
3916756	3917876	I could totally see that happening.
3917896	3922238	It would be hilarious if Capcom bought them up.
3923119	3923819	That would be cool.
3925763	3934070	Actually, that would be all kinds of strange, because you know there would be that inevitable Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat game, and that's just gonna really weird a lot of people out.
3934770	3935611	That's gonna be creepy.
3935971	3938433	That's gonna be like when Sonic and Mario started showing up in the same place.
3938453	3948442	I have a feeling if they were ever gonna leave Midway, which I doubt that they will, but if they were, EA would probably buy them up, because EA likes to snatch up properties like that, and...
3949124	3951325	They've got enough money to throw around.
3951925	3954006	So, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that.
3954306	3957107	Because, you know, EA needs a good fighting game franchise.
3958088	3962929	Because that Marvel game that they put out sucked.
3963970	3966051	Didn't they do DC and Marvel?
3966471	3968191	Midway did.
3968211	3968592	What the hell?
3968932	3969992	No, it was Marvel vs. DC.
3970052	3970792	Never mind, I'm stupid.
3971553	3972033	No, it wasn't.
3972053	3975114	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, yeah.
3975174	3976975	EA did Marvel Ultimate Alliance, right?
3977648	3978808	No, that was Activision.
3978828	3979449	That was Activision.
3979469	3984010	No, EA did that, was it Rise of the Imperfects or something like that?
3984030	3985210	Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer?
3985530	3986251	No, it wasn't Silver Surfer.
3986291	3988191	No, Silver Surfer was also Activision.
3989532	3997374	Yeah, they did the Rise of the Imperfects game, which, so ironic that they had Imperfect in the title, but yes, it was not very good.
4001155	4002776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4023718	4024599	I just, I don't know.
4025360	4025700	We'll see.
4026421	4034730	Well, I'm going to pull up a video here in studio, and I apologize you guys can't see this on the radio, but what's interesting about this, this is an unreal... Whoa, hello.
4035490	4040776	This is Unreal Tournament, but it's a Sonic the Hedgehog level using the Unreal Engine.
4040816	4040916	What?
4045010	4046710	I apologize for the volume, good lord.
4046931	4049571	See if I can turn that down, there we go.
4049891	4051612	This is kind of interesting.
4051932	4053252	It looks a little bit like Smash Bros.
4053312	4053712	at most.
4054332	4056233	It does kind of look like Smash Bros.
4056313	4057073	doesn't it?
4057973	4059654	Very interesting level.
4060034	4061994	Somebody spent a lot of time on that, that's for sure.
4063874	4065195	They did something similar with...
4067874	4072355	with Legos and stuff before they had Lego maps and stuff, mods.
4072856	4079998	What's cool about stuff like this is, remember the PC mods do work on the PlayStation 3 versions, so you can actually get this for the PlayStation 3 as well.
4080938	4083659	Alright, enough of that background noise there from the game.
4083679	4088900	Question for you though, which types of mods have you really been into for that?
4089901	4091861	I'm not an Unreal Tournament player, so I can tell you.
4092621	4094462	Well, what about, you know how they did with Quake?
4095566	4095866	The Cube Mod
4117512	4118072	Like the movie?
4118192	4119753	Yeah, like the movie.
4120013	4120494	For Quake?
4120894	4121094	Yeah.
4121414	4121694	Wow.
4122275	4123215	Because Quake's kind of old.
4123235	4125616	Well, not for Quake, but for one of the later... Oh, okay.
4125796	4125977	Yeah.
4126577	4133881	They did a cube mod, and someone tried to do a hypercube one where it would randomly regenerate the room.
4134895	4135936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4160183	4175436	My whole point between that is that I don't really want to see people put into situations where they are forced to kill slash maim themselves or each other to get out of the situation because of something someone else perceives they did or they might have done.
4176116	4186925	The cube, I think, is that you're putting the people together and they can either work together or they can kill each other and hypercube, they can just go crazy because time is freaking out.
4187626	4190890	I totally, I just want to, I support you on the, I cannot stand the Saw movies.
4190910	4196195	I'm like, because I saw part of one of them, and the guy basically thinks he's helping them out by doing this, and I'm like, dude, no.
4196496	4210070	I actually just went on Wikipedia to read the premise again, and while I, and for me, I'm always the type of person that tries to get my brain into the character, and that's something that just gives me a headache thinking about it.
4210570	4211131	Alright, I'm sorry.
4211151	4212132	I didn't mean to open a can of worms.
4212172	4213313	I just wanted to mention that real quick.
4213353	4214614	I will also say another defense.
4214714	4215715	How about those dolphins?
4216316	4221160	I will say another defense about that versus Cube is that Cube, you don't technically have an antagonist.
4222782	4223262	Technically.
4224543	4226445	You have the situation as your antagonist.
4227166	4227746	Alright, let's move on.
4227766	4228267	More gaming news.
4228347	4228687	I'm sorry.
4229648	4230229	Dude, gotta...
4230677	4232478	What the DSI most needed in it to get me to buy one?
4232498	4233920	Feature that the DSI needed the most to get me to buy one.
4261225	4261465	Hmm.
4261725	4262485	That might be a good one.
4262786	4263406	Very topical.
4263766	4264166	Think about it.
4265506	4266667	Is it topical like an ointment?
4267247	4267507	We'll see.
4267567	4268727	Maybe the chat room has some better ideas.
4268747	4270528	If you have an idea for tonight's list, let's send it over.
4271268	4272908	I got your joke.
4272968	4273289	I got it.
4273789	4274469	I just didn't laugh.
4275729	4276009	Love ya.
4277650	4279330	Well, guess who I think is awesome?
4280170	4280391	Me.
4282291	4282411	Er.
4284852	4285312	Steve Wiebe.
4285748	4287629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4308456	4327288	and it turns out Billy Mitchell's a cock and sent in a videotape instead of coming in and doing it himself of him topping over a million points on Donkey Kong so Steve Weeby's going to be at E3 and that is reason enough for me to go I want to witness this
4328658	4329698	Here's what's interesting, though.
4330379	4332119	They did the same thing at E4ALL.
4332159	4336361	And to be fair to our, I guess you could say, you know, I don't know what to call it.
4336401	4338902	It's not really parent company because we own ourselves.
4338962	4346084	But, you know, the company that enables us to do this live for you all every Sunday night, All Games had a ginormous booth at E4ALL.
4346244	4349285	They had Steve Wiebe there trying to break the score for Donkey Kong.
4349325	4351486	So it's kind of been there, done that.
4351826	4354507	So it's just interesting that now people seem to care about
4354807	4357809	because it's E3 and not E4ALL, which, you know, I get.
4358389	4359730	This is going to have far more people.
4359910	4363932	Yeah, but I also, nothing would have gotten me to go to E4ALL, I think.
4364772	4365172	Nothing.
4365913	4377438	E4ALL, to me, was just a ginormous waste of time and I could have slept or done my laundry or, you know, washed dirty dishes with my tongue.
4377518	4380600	It just looked better on paper, I think.
4380660	4382801	It was one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper.
4383812	4411049	at any rate um and this is funny because even the guys at Twin Galaxies were just saying that it was completely awful of uh Billy Mitchell and he's just such a dick oh my god he's such a dick I don't like him anyway um the other cool thing though is that with the two of them I think that I don't exactly agree with how my source says it because there have been other people who have hit the Donkey Kong kill screen but I think that those two are the only ones who have done it in a live event
4411969	4418131	But the kill screen is basically after you pay so many levels of Donkey Kong, it'll just stop.
4418791	4419931	It won't work anymore.
4420052	4421392	It'll just be game over.
4421612	4425353	It doesn't care how many extra lives you have or what your score is or anything.
4425373	4427354	It's just like, dead.
4428654	4429214	Seriously.
4430675	4432215	Mario will be running around, freeze.
4432255	4433436	Yeah, don't they show it in the movie?
4433576	4434636	Yeah, they show it.
4435856	4437997	But I've seen someone do it.
4440296	4440596	When?
4441636	4442437	A long time ago.
4443057	4445137	I had to have been like 11.
4446078	4446478	Interesting.
4446898	4448778	And apparently it was at a Godfather's Pizza.
4449138	4451079	And citizens must be one of those people who just didn't care.
4452419	4454600	Because we also had, I don't think I was that young.
4454620	4455660	I think I was a little older than that.
4455700	4462002	Because we had one of the Mario machines, the Nintendo arcade machines.
4462102	4465966	I bet there are a lot of people out there that could do it and just don't want to get in the scene.
4466166	4466606	You know what I mean?
4467047	4467847	They do it for themselves.
4468068	4469289	I ask him if it broke.
4470049	4472371	If he broke the machine, he's like, yeah, I broke the machine.
4472391	4475094	And that's all I remember until I saw the movie.
4477036	4484162	But anyway, I really, really would like to see him do it.
4484222	4485904	And I would love to be there when it happens.
4487685	4489066	I think it would be fantastic.
4489506	4498349	And I would like to see what Billy Mitchell does about it just because he's a dick and I'm kind of enjoying the drama a little bit even though it's kind of stupid.
4498509	4501170	If he does, I will self-fornicate into my trousers.
4503166	4504106	Can we put it on the internet?
4504626	4506427	Can we broadcast that live on G4?
4506467	4507007	Yes, yes.
4507027	4509208	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
4510728	4511749	Immediately following.
4511789	4512689	Immediately following.
4512749	4515430	Steve, we'll be breaking the record live on G4.
4515450	4516450	We'll be live on G4.
4516790	4518591	The doctor self-hornicating into his pants.
4520371	4520752	Trousers.
4521112	4521412	Alright.
4522032	4522812	Into his trousers.
4523152	4524333	He might not be wearing pants.
4525333	4527334	He might just be wearing the trousers.
4528883	4532025	Ascetic Vampire in chat says, I'd go to see Billy's flowing hair.
4532465	4534386	I don't think he's going to be there at E3.
4535167	4536187	All right, look, let's move on.
4536567	4537108	Maybe he will.
4537288	4537648	I don't know.
4538969	4539949	I'm a little over the drive.
4539969	4540950	It was just a movie, people.
4541290	4541930	It was just a movie.
4542771	4544352	GS68 makes the best point.
4545152	4547833	And immediately thereafter, Billy Mitchell posts his new record on YouTube.
4549474	4551796	All right, a couple more news stories and we're going to take a break.
4552196	4552376	Yes.
4553537	4554997	So this is kind of funny.
4555057	4555197	For...
4557324	4566747	April Fool's Day, Bethesda decided that they're going to go ahead and kind of do a half price sale on all the download content for Oblivion, which is pretty cool.
4567347	4568107	Except there's a catch.
4568528	4570788	Horse Armor, they decided, you know what?
4571068	4572069	Horse Armor's awesome.
4572109	4573609	We're going to double the price of that.
4574709	4575590	Just to be funny.
4575850	4577630	To which I say, nay.
4578811	4579811	I say nay.
4581992	4583752	And after that, he goes, hey.
4585093	4586253	Okay, I had to throw that in.
4588775	4591256	I think this is their form of an April Fool's joke.
4591336	4592576	Like, not that it's a joke.
4592856	4593896	Like, it actually happened.
4593916	4594617	Yeah, it actually happened.
4594637	4596877	But I think it's like an April Fool's joke still.
4596937	4597377	You know what I mean?
4597817	4600438	Like, it was what they did in celebration of April Fool's Day.
4600778	4604819	Because everyone realizes that, you know, including them, that horse armor is ridiculous.
4604839	4608239	Yeah, I think even Bethesda realized, okay, you got us.
4608279	4609420	Horse armor was pretty dumb.
4609460	4610420	But people still buy it.
4611820	4612421	Feature Net Guaranteed
4639441	4640101	Alright, look.
4640521	4648684	Last week we brought you a story about a man who was suing Microsoft and Lionhead over reports that he was being harassed because he was gay.
4648704	4649624	You might remember about this.
4650244	4655766	Apparently, we're not going to get to see the drama unfold in the courtroom because there has been a settlement.
4658228	4660350	The case has been settled out of court.
4660971	4664734	Microsoft has released a very brief statement, and guess what?
4664754	4668317	This is all you're going to hear on it, because usually with these settlements come gag orders.
4668898	4673903	Microsoft says, We are pleased to have reached a makeable resolution to this matter with Mr. Durant.
4674403	4681029	The terms of the settlement are confidential, but we can confirm that Mr. Durant will not continue his employment at Lionhead as part of the agreement.
4682318	4687402	That's probably what he got for taking his case to the media, but hey, it sounds like everybody got what they wanted.
4687802	4688903	Isn't Bill Gates gay?
4689964	4691225	No, he has a wife, dummy!
4691425	4692085	He can still be gay.
4692305	4694267	Like, get my stuff!
4694407	4694967	Oh, shut.
4696001	4697923	Alright, so there you go.
4697943	4699524	Follow up to last week, to be fair.
4700025	4701726	We wanted to follow up on that.
4702567	4707271	We'll never know the real answer because of the settlement, but that's life.
4708132	4711275	Alright, let's get into a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
4711295	4712877	It's called the Classic Video Game of the Week.
4714983	4722146	And as part of this segment, DarkSakura will dig into her archive of classic gaming and find a title that she believes you all should be checking out.
4722586	4723727	She's been doing this quite a while now.
4723767	4736832	We have like over a year's worth of games that they're tracking on the OLR Wikipedia, which you can get to at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and go to that little thing that says, the little box in the corner with all the pictures that has the big W in it.
4736912	4738853	And that's how you get to the Wiki on Wikia.
4740033	4741114	I can't remember the name of the box.
4741194	4741914	Extended Play.
4742094	4742454	That's it.
4742474	4743595	I had a brain fart.
4744415	4747257	Anyhow, what is the classic game of the week this week, DarkSakura?
4747797	4750399	The classic game of the week is Incredible Crisis.
4751660	4753081	That game is crack.
4753901	4755342	And by crack, I mean crack.
4755962	4758124	Welcome to Incredible Crisis.
4760505	4762546	This is a game that came out on the PlayStation.
4766569	4767970	Incredible Crisis with puppies.
4769095	4783848	Now, the game is about playing in a day in these family members' lives, the main character being Taneo, and they're trying to get everyone home early today for Grandmother Haruko's birthday.
4784489	4789453	And this game very much is a parody of daily Japanese life.
4790214	4792975	This game is incredibly what the fuck.
4793475	4794035	For real.
4794135	4794716	For real.
4794816	4798137	Like, I can't think of many more WTF games that have ever been made.
4798157	4801118	Because, like, when you... Well, I'll let Jamie explain.
4801218	4802038	Then I'll give my comment.
4802398	4804579	Also, the music in the game, if you'll listen to a little bit of it.
4810301	4812402	They're dancing, by the way, in the office in this song.
4815688	4820932	It's done by the Tokyo Sky Paradise Orchestra, so it's good music.
4821632	4823093	I love them.
4823594	4830299	So basically the way that this goes is you have a bunch of mini-games where you're playing through people's lives, and it's sort of sequential.
4832020	4837504	Taneo, like, for example, this scene is him at work, and they are dancing to relieve stress.
4838205	4841847	However, you've got this head-meter, and just the...
4843008	4844849	The Redder and More Full That It Gets
4863789	4864269	There it is.
4864289	4864589	This is it.
4864609	4864709	There.
4894710	4894990	Wow.
4895010	4897631	She tells you how to position yourself for the major boink action.
4897651	4900313	Well, technically, the translation says he's giving an erotic back massage.
4900373	4900413	No.
4925778	4929345	Dude, they're doing it on a Ferris wheel.
4929966	4930407	Exactly.
4930607	4931589	And there's fireworks.
4931669	4934995	I don't think that's a back massage because that's not how we roll.
4935438	4937460	DJ Terrence says, I jizzed in my pantsu.
4940602	4954975	But I'll see you play as Etsuko, who is the mother, and she's out trying to buy stuff for Haruko's birthday, and she has to go to the bank, and it's being robbed, and just all this crap is happening to this family.
4956076	4956776	So, um...
4958097	4963142	No, and the last one is about the little boy, Tsuyoshi, and more weird stuff.
4963162	4966324	He's like turned into an ant or something, or shrunk to ant size.
4966865	4969827	It's like, the game's just freaking bizarre.
4970448	4979015	It's so much weird crap this family has to go through, all for the sake of getting home early to, you know, have a birthday party.
4982516	4984277	There are 24 minigames.
4985678	4986739	Some of them do repeat.
4987700	4994104	And it only is a one-player game, but it can still count as a party because really it's better to pass it around.
4994144	4994765	It's a lot of fun.
4995065	4996286	This game looks amazing.
4996326	4997387	What the fuck was I thinking?
4997467	5000349	I remember renting this game years ago and not liking it.
5000629	5001169	FF7 and Puzzle Fighter
5023328	5024769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5045880	5050366	to actually translate the play of the game into it because of the way it involved the kanji.
5050686	5058938	But one of them involved the daughter in the family singing karaoke, which I think would have been fun.
5066392	5070697	Deathwishing in chat says, Seriously man, I wanted to break a brick over my head after I played this.
5070737	5071839	It freaked me the fuck out.
5071899	5075604	It was like taking acid, smoking crackpot, and then spinning around in a wash cycle.
5076084	5103424	and actually if you want to know I'll link this in the chat room but if you want to know a little bit about part of the problem that went into translating the game or just stuff that goes into translating and localizing games there's an article and it's from last April actually that's called The Art of Translating Video Games and I will link that in the chat room for people to see if they're interested in it
5105330	5105950	I love the game.
5105970	5109071	I mean, I think it's crazy, crazy crack.
5126598	5128519	This is exactly what the classic game of the week should be.
5128579	5133083	One of those games that you kind of forget about, but you need to go back and say, wow, that game was like fucking nuts.
5133583	5133843	All right.
5134564	5137506	That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5137526	5138346	But stay tuned, guys.
5138366	5140448	We have plenty more to come here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5140508	5142509	Tonight's part B. We're going to do a listless game.
5142950	5149494	I didn't see a lot of topics submitted in chat, although to be honest, I kind of missed a bunch of stuff when they were doing Incredible Crisis.
5149514	5150075	So what do you want to do?
5150095	5152497	You want to do the Excitebots thing or you want to do the DSi thing?
5152517	5152897	What do you think?
5153718	5154758	I have zero preference.
5154958	5155619	Zero preference?
5155739	5156059	I don't know.
5157079	5159520	I'd like to do What Kind of Flavor Does Jamie Want for Pie?
5160060	5161881	I don't think that's going to work.
5162381	5166402	Let's see how creative we can get making up a trick.
5167283	5168383	Alright, you want to do the Excitebots one?
5169190	5169971	No, I want to do the DSi one.
5169991	5170731	You want to do the DSi one.
5170751	5170951	Okay.
5170991	5174073	I think the DSi one is a little more open and topical.
5174093	5174834	So we'll do the DSi.
5174854	5176895	We'll do the Sightbot when Sightbot comes out.
5177316	5177496	Okay.
5177796	5181419	So DSi, feature we most want to – or wish – no.
5181619	5182439	How do we phrase this?
5182880	5186722	Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it yesterday or today.
5187082	5187263	Okay.
5187583	5191245	Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it today because none of us bought it, right?
5191786	5191966	Okay.
5192006	5193747	But if it had this feature, I would have.
5194327	5194768	So there you go.
5195248	5205872	Alright, we're going to answer that question and do plenty more here on Orange Lounge Radio such as talking about Blizzard Entertainment and a possible interesting franchise they could be doing as well as a Silent Hill game on the Wii.
5206672	5210454	We're going to talk all about that when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5216727	5220388	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, April the 5th of 2009.
5221829	5226790	We're taping live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
5226830	5231872	It's about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night.
5232652	5234093	Join us for live taping, why don't you?
5235077	5235798	DarkSakura is with us as well
5250131	5250551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5266229	5267929	Thanks for watching!
5294602	5294862	I don't know.
5294882	5299223	I don't understand why you need it to be supported.
5299283	5304744	I mean, I would think if people, you know, have Guitar and Metallica, most people probably already have World Tour.
5304924	5307465	So, you know, I don't know.
5308325	5310126	But hey, support for stuff is always good.
5311146	5313967	Well, plus the lips mark is sparkly, you know, and all that.
5314127	5315787	So, you know, who doesn't like sparkles?
5317057	5317537	Me.
5319419	5319979	Oh, good point.
5320019	5322621	The lips mics are also wireless, says Actdeft in chat.
5322641	5322881	True.
5323021	5323781	That's pretty good.
5324502	5326163	Isn't there a third-party wireless mic, too, though?
5327507	5328969	Um, I don't know.
5329429	5330891	You know, I've never played the Lips games.
5330931	5332552	I'm just kind of burned out on the karaoke games.
5332612	5340560	Between the Rock Band, between SingStar, ABBA, and the other SingStar stuff that's available on PS3, I kind of didn't want to get Lips because I don't need another one.
5340780	5345084	You know, SingStar's, as far as karaoke games go, SingStar's rock solid enough, you know?
5345204	5347126	Lips kind of was late to the party, if that makes sense.
5348387	5348808	Oh, hmm.
5350637	5354540	Also, possibly late to the party, a revival of Redneck Rampage?
5355280	5363826	Now, here's one of those things I look at and I go, surely this is an April Fool's joke, but I... I don't know, I mean, I'm looking at the... Redneck Rampage is pretty freaking funny.
5363866	5365027	So it's a game about my hometown?
5365047	5365967	I think it's stupid.
5366067	5368309	I think it's like one of the stupidest video games I've ever seen.
5368329	5372191	Like, I realize it's supposed to be a parody, but WTF, but okay, wait, I'm not done yet.
5372692	5375794	But apparently this story broke on like the 4th of April or whatever, but here we go.
5377155	5382218	Blizzard, apparently there's a rumor that Blizzard Entertainment actually has the Redneck Rampage brand right now.
5382538	5385820	And apparently this is some research done by a website called INC Gamers.
5386241	5388983	They were doing some trademark following or what have you.
5389423	5394386	And apparently Redneck Rampage was originally trademarked in 97, then Redneck Rampage rides again.
5395567	5397849	Redneck Rampage sucking grits on Route 66.
5399069	5401571	Yes, that was really the name of apparently the third game that was made.
5401971	5404713	They're apparently all now under Blizzard's control.
5405954	5410715	So Blizzard apparently owns the rights to these games.
5410876	5412956	Is that through acquisitions and things like that?
5413016	5413376	Who knows?
5415377	5418258	Apparently Activision actually acquired the Redneck Rampage thing.
5418538	5421439	But why would it then be given to Blizzard and not Activision?
5422579	5422899	Don't know.
5424119	5427581	But apparently there are some Blizzard folks on staff who actually worked on the original Redneck Rampage.
5427921	5429781	I hope to hell this doesn't mean they're making a new one.
5429901	5431322	I mean, talk about unnecessary.
5431682	5432282	Unnecessaries.
5434384	5436865	X-Link in chat suggests redneck for the iPhone.
5438366	5438887	You know what?
5439027	5440608	I would rather it be something like that.
5441068	5443329	And DJ Tyrant said, Blizzard isn't this stupid, are they?
5443769	5445030	And hopefully not.
5445070	5449192	DJ Tyrant, maybe it's something that's a nod to those employees who were there that worked on the game.
5449312	5449913	I don't know.
5450633	5455035	But let's just hope it's just an interesting observation and nothing more.
5455055	5458017	I don't know, DarkSakura, would you buy a new redneck rampage?
5459576	5460157	Would I buy it?
5460257	5460437	No.
5461057	5461778	Would I buy it?
5461818	5462078	Yes.
5462718	5463379	Definitely.
5464279	5465240	I'll tell you what I'd buy.
5465260	5466200	A new Hexic.
5466741	5467281	Or Hexen.
5467381	5467941	Hexen!
5468121	5469062	Those games were pretty awesome.
5469102	5470343	Heck yeah, I love Hexen.
5471103	5471343	Anyhow.
5473024	5474265	That game was awesome, though.
5474866	5475706	What, Redneck Rampage?
5475786	5476246	Yeah.
5477047	5481329	It was using the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D, but it had more features for it.
5481570	5483171	How about they just bring us Duke Nukem forever?
5484091	5486773	Didn't Hexen use the same engine as Quake, right?
5486873	5487093	Yeah.
5487373	5488574	Yeah, and it was awesome.
5490444	5493007	I just like turning people into chickens.
5495830	5500756	Well, as we covered on our last show, we're supposed to be getting...
5504281	5509743	We're actually supposed to be getting those arcade games coming out for the Wii service.
5510403	5520347	Well, Sega is also taking a step to put actual arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade a lot more than what we've been seeing lately.
5521407	5528290	We're getting, and this makes my heart soar, Virtualon or Tario Tangram.
5528890	5530851	I don't have to bake out my Dreamcast to play it, except...
5531448	5538015	I have twin sticks, so it's better to play it on the Dreamcast, but I digress.
5538855	5547764	There's release ratings for Shinobi and Altered Beast, so that means System 16 will be getting some of those.
5548245	5548685	That's cool.
5549887	5564181	Also, there is one that's rumored as a Sega Vintage Collection Volume 2, and there's also other Genesis titles listed as Comic Zone, Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.
5564962	5569086	Gunstar Heroes, of course, being one of the best Sega games ever.
5569895	5571935	Now, Comic Zone was already on the virtual console, though.
5572536	5573096	But this is the arcade.
5573116	5573876	This is the virtual console.
5573896	5574676	This is live arcade.
5574896	5576696	Oh, but I thought you said for the Wii.
5576897	5581537	I started off with the Wii because we had talked about Sega arcade games coming out on Wii.
5581858	5581978	Ah.
5582898	5583078	Yes.
5583498	5587659	To recap, last week on Orange Downs Radio, Rob ate a live frog.
5590199	5591360	And Loki's head exploded.
5592360	5595761	Leaving Jamie as the victor in Battle Royale Orange Downs Edition.
5596921	5597741	Anyway, um...
5599281	5600381	Dan got to meet him At E3 One year
5622000	5624002	I got my hug on with, um, uh, not Koji Kondo, the other, Igarashi.
5632950	5634752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5654412	5679447	but I think a good game you have to have a passion for video games and you have to have your obvious favors and things like that so I I completely justify my you know screaming like a little 12 year old girl when I saw Akira Yamaoka okay so there you go that he's also it doesn't hurt that he's really good looking oh Black Wolf and DJ Tyrant both in chat said I met Rob Roberts at E3 yeah no we said celebrities
5680501	5706632	Internet Celebrities Black Wolf said I totally squeed with fanboy delight when I met Rob Roberts He did actually I have yet to meet Rob Roberts Just so you guys know Oh my god, oh my god I totally blushed with embarrassment after running into Hideo Kojima Like three E3s in a row I don't know how this happens If it happens again this year I'm gonna just go off and cry Or tell him to give me a job
5708052	5710473	All right, let's move on with more gaming news.
5710493	5713454	Let's stop talking about E3 and who we may or may not see at E3 this year.
5716695	5719016	So this is kind of weird, I guess.
5719296	5724918	Last week we talked about how Filefront was going away and, you know, oh darn.
5725418	5727158	But apparently it's back.
5728499	5735681	And it says Filefront has been acquired by the original founders of the site and will not be suspended as previously announced.
5736101	5737502	This is not an April Fool's joke.
5739498	5741560	And that's funny.
5742060	5745382	So what once was dead is now back.
5746443	5750466	Well, congratulations to the folks at Filefront for inserting a coin to continue.
5750826	5751807	Congratulations.
5752948	5754109	That's all it took, right?
5754289	5756470	And in other news, EGM is coming back.
5756730	5757611	Oh, wait, no, that's not true.
5758312	5759132	April fools.
5760013	5760293	All right.
5762011	5764353	That would have been a great EGM yearly joke, right?
5764373	5766835	Because they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year.
5767876	5771078	Remember, Ermac in Mortal Kombat was born of an EGM April Fool's joke.
5771458	5773880	That could have been their epic joke this year, that they're coming back.
5773920	5775482	And then, oh, April Fool's.
5775602	5776202	It's a joke.
5776823	5777983	That would have been too soon.
5778084	5779985	Insulting for their fan base, yes.
5780385	5780626	All right.
5781659	5783741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5799617	5804441	It's a remake, sort of, of the first game, but they don't want you to call it a remake of the first game.
5804501	5806542	It's a reimagining of the first game.
5806863	5810906	Which, you know, means Boohoo, no Pyramid Head, but at the same time... The first game didn't have Pyramid Head.
5810966	5812607	Right, Boohoo, no Pyramid Head.
5812907	5815529	But the first game was pretty fucking phenomenal.
5815549	5818311	And a lot of people still say it was probably the best game in the series.
5818391	5823395	So, you know, definitely going to be a must-have for Silent Hill fans.
5823856	5827779	And a quote from the magazine where this originally appeared, Nintendo Power...
5828379	5851077	The characters play different roles Things don't necessarily happen in the same order And the story is taken in lots of new directions You still play as Harry Mason You're still looking for your daughter And you'll see familiar elements But they're all twisted to betray your expectations So this is kind of cool Because it sounds like maybe it's going to be fucking with what people are expecting in the game Because they think it's going to be a remake That's going to be kind of cool So um
5852873	5856595	Apparently though, yes, they are going to exploit the Wii thing a little bit.
5856635	5859136	They are going to use some of the Wii remote action.
5859637	5861838	Some of the in-game puzzles will use Waggle in it.
5862118	5874945	You know, I heard, maybe I'm not supposed to repeat this, but I heard a long time ago rumors that there were some tests being done in Konami of a Silent Hill type game where you would use the Wii mode as the flashlight as you were moving around.
5875245	5876325	And doesn't that sound scary?
5876405	5879127	I hope that concept made it into this game somehow.
5879167	5881028	I think that could be super creepy.
5881348	5881969	Fantastic.
5882009	5882589	And pretty cool.
5882849	5883830	If executed correctly.
5883870	5885011	I mean, it could also be kind of dumb.
5885191	5889374	And thank God, because they should have been doing this kind of stuff on the Wii since the beginning.
5889435	5890676	So if they start doing that, great.
5891596	5900183	By the way, also, fans, you should know, part of the thing that bugged about the first Silent Hill game, that locked doors were everywhere.
5900724	5903806	Now there will be a way through every locked door.
5904126	5907629	You will no longer have to find that most of the doors in the game are permanently shut.
5909050	5910652	Sounds like it's going to be pretty awesome.
5911383	5914765	So, I'm definitely looking forward to this.
5915185	5915985	More information, at least.
5916005	5918106	I bet this is going to be one of the big things we're going to see at E3.
5918667	5922109	Or, Konami's having an event, if I remember right, this next week.
5922169	5926931	I mean, we weren't invited, but they're doing the Saw thing, and I know they're showing that.
5927051	5931273	I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up as well, along with your mandatory DDR and Yu-Gi-Oh for the year.
5931333	5931894	So, we'll see.
5932934	5934275	And, oh yeah, don't forget Winning Eleven.
5934635	5936896	All those games, you've got to get your mandatory entries for the year in there.
5937276	5938717	So, we'll see.
5938797	5940358	Are you excited about the Silent Hill remake?
5943997	5944957	You're a clever one.
5946959	5948421	Robbie me go he.
5950182	5951844	For a game on the Wii.
5953305	5953666	Well, good.
5953726	5956969	Let's hope there's more Wii going Wii games later on.
5957009	5959191	Do you think you might have one in this next story, DarkSakura?
5961201	5962362	Project Ringo
5977757	5979238	There's been talk going around about it.
5979278	5989486	It turns out that Project Ringo is a new Puyo Puyo game that's going to be on DS, Wii, and PSP.
5990567	5992589	And, of course, we get it as Puyo Pop.
5993890	6000515	And it will be, technically, it's just Puyo Puyo 7, which is more Puyo Puyo.
6001756	6014266	But you also will have a transformation mode which will let you actually deflect attacks instead of, I guess, just preventing them from happening and have larger chain combos.
6015246	6016127	So that would be pretty cool.
6016587	6019650	But there should be some...
6021607	6024268	I'm a big enough fan to pronounce it correctly.
6051280	6051580	Alright.
6052361	6052581	Yes.
6053582	6065991	And, um... I don't know, we kind of talked a little bit in Part A about the new... Well, not really a new game, but Tales of Vesperia coming to the PS3.
6066071	6069433	Well, there is a new Tales game coming to the Wii as well.
6070314	6071655	Tales of Graces.
6073016	6076879	And it's been announced for the Wii, thanks to Fumitsu Magazine.
6077939	6078600	And, um...
6080034	6085356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6098429	6100150	Or is it just waggle, waggle, waggle?
6100310	6100710	I don't know.
6100770	6103231	The last Tales game that they put out was okay on the Wii.
6103491	6106632	And then this is supposed to be coming out in Japan in the winter.
6107913	6110434	So I guess we'll see more about this later on.
6112079	6115120	Well, some rumors are going around about upcoming Wii titles.
6115160	6124003	There's apparently a list that was leaked to the internet this week showing an upcoming release date list of some various games coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
6124063	6125004	But here's the interesting thing.
6125344	6130506	It dates Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort on July 10th.
6130906	6135768	It also dates, here's the other interesting thing, Wii Fit Plus on November 19th.
6136668	6140070	Nintendo, repackaging something and slapping Plus in front of it?
6140210	6141591	No, you don't say.
6142331	6144172	Well, now, here's something you should take, though, from this.
6144253	6145933	And, you know, yes, chatters, I am aware.
6146294	6148595	Apparently, this list came out of the Netherlands.
6149075	6150536	It wasn't actually from the U.S.
6151156	6153378	And, you know, take it with a grain of salt.
6153418	6156099	But I think most of us are looking at this going, Wii Fit Plus?
6156379	6157180	Yeah, I can see that.
6157600	6157800	Yeah.
6157960	6158741	I can see that happening.
6159181	6160782	That's innovation for you.
6160962	6161983	That's innovation for you.
6162623	6166347	Well, but why, you know, why the, uh, Nintendo should be leaking their release dates?
6166707	6169850	I don't know what this secrecism is, it's like, my god, like, we're not gonna tell you.
6169870	6171331	It's like, good god.
6172092	6175895	Somebody might steal the idea to repackage something and add plus to it.
6176236	6178378	Oh, wait a second, Guilty Gear did it first!
6178558	6186385	Well, doesn't, I mean, Loki, you kind of have an insider perspective on this, don't sometimes the retailers and the folks on the inside have to know this a little sooner before the consumer?
6186445	6187026	Thanks for watching!
6200934	6201335	WEEFIT
6223192	6226273	It's still, you'd be surprised, it's still hard to get from Nintendo.
6227614	6228434	Same with Mario Kart.
6228474	6229955	What the hell is up with Mario Kart?
6229975	6230775	I don't get that either.
6231315	6236337	But, for whatever reason, I could totally see this happening.
6236357	6239618	And it's going to be something stupid.
6239819	6243420	I don't know if it's going to now support Wii Motion Plus for something, but...
6244887	6246048	I'm not buying it, that's for sure.
6246068	6247728	Probably more crappy minigames.
6248008	6249169	I mean, well, I shouldn't say that.
6249269	6252190	You know, Wii Fit isn't bad, per se.
6252390	6253771	It's just not for the hardcore gamer.
6253871	6255352	But there's definitely an audience for it.
6255432	6258973	It's not a bad piece of software.
6259313	6259954	Let's put it that way.
6261514	6262615	Okay, let me put it this way.
6263982	6271089	Is this what they're going to basically load their guns with for their E3 press conference?
6271129	6278396	Because if they're like, and you thought we forgot you, Core Gamer, we fit plus.
6279236	6282039	Yeah, because right now it's looking like more of the same and that's scary.
6282139	6285001	Well, no, I actually think that the Motion Plus is going to be the big thing.
6285101	6294830	But my concern is because Nintendo is such a bitch about revealing things to people or telling them stuff, I'm just afraid that they're going to alienate the developers and nobody's going to develop anything.
6295551	6300355	You know, I think number one, they should have developed, I mean, the Wiimote should have had this extra sensor in it anyway.
6300755	6305119	But then I just think they're going to alienate the producers again and nobody's going to make good games for it.
6306360	6307081	Here's what's going to happen.
6319346	6321227	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6337213	6338634	We're going to do Wii Sports Resort.
6338654	6341136	We're going to throw in something that people need to buy.
6341436	6345339	So not only is it the Wii Sports angle, but it's also the Wii Play angle at the same time.
6345699	6348261	Oh, and now we're going to do the same thing with Wii Fit.
6348562	6349823	We're going to do Wii Fit Plus.
6349843	6352765	We're going to add some other new thing that people probably don't need.
6353225	6358309	And then we're going to try to resell it again because people eat up Wii Fit and they want to buy a Wii system for Wii Fit.
6359770	6360591	What about the Core Gamer?
6361693	6363413	Oh, well, you get some ported GameCube games.
6363774	6364254	Sweet.
6364494	6370755	And then we get a version of Excite Truck, which has really been toned down kid-wise.
6370955	6374836	And I hear they removed the whole custom soundtrack thing, which sucks.
6375156	6375396	Why?
6375456	6377837	Let's go step backwards as far as innovation goes.
6378357	6382498	And I will bet you anything there will be multiple colored Wiimotes and people will piss themselves over it.
6383758	6384999	Because I don't know why.
6385179	6386819	Oh, I gotta own a red remote now.
6388696	6395338	I just have to disagree on the Motion Plus because for a lot of us that bought the Wii, we thought it was going to have one-to-one control from the beginning.
6395658	6396979	And I still think it should have.
6397019	6405201	I don't understand why they didn't just make the Wiimote with this extra... And I've heard people, I've heard things online that say that it does add that one-to-one control and the possibilities are great.
6405361	6415624	I just, I'm going to be pissed if Nintendo alienates all the producers again and doesn't actually... You know, like I heard that LucasArts was upset because they weren't aware of this before they came out with their...
6417825	6420087	LightSaber Games, so I'm very upset.
6444123	6447245	You know, maybe we'll get knocked completely on our ass.
6447385	6449606	That they're going to reveal that game for the core gamer.
6450127	6457130	They're going to, you know, Reggie's going to whip it out and say, you know, here it is, Kid Icarus, the game you've all been waiting for, something like that.
6457490	6458411	You know, and it's going to rock.
6458511	6459151	I hope.
6459391	6461512	Right, and Konami's going to put out a good music game again.
6461993	6462533	I'm sorry.
6462793	6463253	I'm sorry.
6464414	6465734	There are patterns for a reason.
6466275	6468656	And, you know, what they're going to announce, what?
6468836	6469737	A new Pikmin game.
6469977	6470257	Big...
6470936	6472537	Whoopin' shit, okay?
6473037	6474238	You know, big deal, okay?
6474298	6475139	New Pikmin game.
6475499	6477520	Oh, you know, the fans have been crying for it.
6477880	6478661	Yada, yada, yada.
6478701	6479901	Maybe a new Zelda game.
6480342	6485605	Okay, are we really gonna get down to the point where we're just re-releasing the same franchise games over and over?
6485645	6487486	Let's do something new, okay?
6487646	6490908	I mean, the Wii Sports stuff is okay, but let's create a new character.
6490948	6492089	Let's do something different.
6492449	6494410	Let's make, you know, something really epic.
6495010	6497392	But no, we're gonna, you know, now, you see...
6498092	6498693	Thanks for watching!
6520258	6521499	I totally agree with you.
6522099	6536572	My thing with the Wii Motion Plus is that this would open up the possibility for that true new style of gaming that we were all expecting with the Wii, where it's like your virtual reality, but I'm just afraid that the third-party producers are not going to feel like they're supported by Nintendo.
6536812	6537553	I don't think that is.
6537733	6539575	What's going to happen is you're going to see a bunch of these games.
6539775	6541297	Now it supports Wii Motion Plus.
6541337	6541858	It's a sequel.
6541898	6542338	Red Steel 2.
6543279	6545122	Oh, but the controls still suck.
6545202	6546383	It's not going to help anything.
6546703	6549807	It's good as a new tool and stuff, but it's not anything innovative.
6549847	6550368	It's not...
6551910	6554932	It's just fixing a problem, that's all it is.
6554972	6564256	And it's another peripheral that they can sell for $10, bundle it with a game, and then they're going to include the remotes, they're going to have it built into it now, and then it's going to be something else.
6564336	6567678	It's going to be always something to fix the flaws of what the system was.
6568658	6569278	Not new.
6569939	6577082	And I won't be damn surprised if there's anything from this press conference that surprises me, but last year it was just like, yep, huh.
6577521	6578663	Stupid peripheral, huh?
6579043	6579704	Really funny.
6579744	6581006	You know, with the whole Wii Zapper.
6581326	6582368	It used to be awesome.
6582488	6584791	The original Wii Zapper was really kick-ass.
6585131	6588956	What they first showed off, you know, the prototype and all that stuff, they should have stuck with that.
6589096	6591440	No, now it's a plastic shell that I don't even use anymore.
6591480	6594484	The third-party peripherals are better than the goddamn Wii Zapper.
6595253	6595613	All right.
6595893	6596353	Well, we'll see.
6596414	6600475	We are two months away from E3, and a lot of these questions will be answered.
6600515	6606958	But in the meantime, we're going to answer some of your questions by going to a segment we like to do every week known as the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
6606998	6611480	By the way, I do want to remind everybody in studio and in our chat live that we are doing listless tonight.
6611520	6617262	And the topic tonight for listless, which we'll get to a little later in the show, but everybody should be thinking about their lists, right, for listless.
6617282	6617882	It's been a little while.
6618663	6623305	It would be the feature that the DSI should have had to get me to buy one today.
6624161	6625023	So be thinking about that.
6625444	6628690	In the meantime, let's open up the mailbag.
6628750	6631996	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and read some of your emails right now.
6632156	6632717	DarkSakura.
6633430	6634750	We have one from Deathwishing.
6635571	6638511	Hey guys, remember how I called and ranted about how Microsoft stole my $20?
6638671	6640232	I do remember that.
6640592	6641592	Well, patience paid off.
6641972	6646113	Not only did I get my original points of $1,600 back, but I threw in an extra $1,600.
6647033	6651294	I guess this shows you that being polite and waiting gets you a reward better than bitching 24-7.
6652055	6653335	Anyways, I'm gonna sleep now.
6653355	6653915	Okay, thanks, bye.
6656016	6657316	I'm glad to hear all was resolved.
6658596	6660957	This is... The next one is from Isabelle.
6662594	6665215	Well, first off, I want to start off by saying hi, how's it going?
6665275	6668797	I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long while now, and I hope all of it is great for you guys.
6669557	6676300	Now to get to the point of my email, I finally got to play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom after what seems like a million years, and all I have to say about that game is wow.
6677340	6682022	I've heard how you guys said it was well done and really awesome, but I didn't expect it to be this awesome.
6682402	6684183	I played its arcade version, and for the arcade...
6685063	6686644	and for an arcade game, it's really good.
6687044	6688784	DarkSakura, have you gotten to play the arcade version?
6689304	6692285	Another arcade game I got to play was Tekken 6.
6692846	6697527	Just from the arcade version, I can tell that once it hits homes, no one will leave their couches.
6697627	6698867	Yes, it really was that good.
6699368	6702469	So I wish you all the best and thanks for taking time for reading this email.
6703329	6705029	I actually haven't played the arcade version yet.
6705189	6710011	I never got a chance to go check it out at any of the local places, well, state local places that have it.
6710151	6712493	Yeah, I had no idea there was an arcade version of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6712513	6712953	That's pretty rad.
6712973	6714654	Well, it originally was the arcade version.
6714694	6715935	You know, and I should have known that.
6716896	6717557	But yet I didn't.
6717597	6718057	I don't know why.
6718945	6724530	I have played the Wii version, and I played with Jun and Ken as my team, and I was very happy with it.
6725470	6728693	I still need to get out and play Tekken 6, because I love Tekken everything.
6729993	6737879	But I can't really say anything else, more about any arcade versions of them, just that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is super cool.
6739160	6742683	And the last email, this comes from Spirit of Radio.
6744884	6749047	I've been playing video games since I was little and never been scared in any game.
6749527	6752549	I'm sorry but Silent Hill 2-3 are boring and controls like garbage.
6752649	6754910	I will agree with some of the control issues.
6755831	6759654	The only game that honestly gave me a hard time going to sleep was the original Manhunt.
6760014	6764097	The concept of someone forcing you to do snuff films is the stuff of nightmares.
6764577	6767799	Cool first time sending you guys an email.
6768239	6769920	Anyways, keep up the great podcast you guys.
6770941	6773483	Also, Manhunt is something that I find repugnant.
6773923	6775764	I don't really care for the game at all.
6776865	6779406	I like the psychological type of edge.
6779826	6783508	The stuff that requires intelligence and not, you know, ooh, blood!
6786910	6789312	Well, yay for first-time emailers, if nothing else.
6789572	6791033	Yeah, thanks for emailing.
6791073	6791413	Keep it up.
6793658	6793938	All right.
6794259	6794579	That's it.
6794719	6795560	That's it for the emails.
6795620	6795900	All right.
6795920	6796620	It's over.
6796861	6801905	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for reading in a future show.
6802385	6802545	Yes.
6803166	6804707	In the meantime, let's get back to some gaming news.
6804747	6811512	We just have a few more stories, and then we're going to get into tonight's list list, and we're going to respond to some of the tweets we got on Twitter this week.
6811532	6813794	We're going to respond to those in just a little bit.
6813834	6816056	We got one more round of stories, though, starting off with Loki.
6816456	6816656	Yes.
6816797	6822201	It's interesting how April Fool's jokes can now become reality again.
6823416	6825238	Thanks for watching!
6841971	6845173	And funny enough, it actually made it into the game.
6845533	6850556	Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that the company behind it, Volition, also puts out Saints Row.
6851637	6855539	So they are, of course, very used to quirky, weird shit.
6856119	6857460	So, Ostrich Hammer.
6857480	6860201	That almost sounds like something that should be in Team Fortress 2.
6860261	6863283	Sounds like the name of a real good metal band.
6864264	6865564	Ostrich Hammer!
6867385	6869667	But yeah, so you'll be able to hit people with an ostrich.
6870560	6871421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6894844	6901846	Apparently, he was really, really famous in the 1980s because he could actually press a button 16 times in one second.
6903940	6905501	16 times in one second, if you can believe that.
6906141	6914605	Now, they made this little device back in the 80s to kind of cash in on this whole button mashing thing called the Shooting Watch.
6915165	6919707	And you could use this to try and match, beat, or try and tie this guy's score.
6920127	6923689	Well, Shooting Watch has now been ported to the iPhone.
6923889	6927090	So you can try and mash buttons as fast as you want.
6927351	6928031	But here's the thing.
6928511	6930232	I don't think this thing's going to be that...
6931957	6934139	It's gonna cost you 99 cents.
6934219	6939023	It's not gonna be as real as the real deal because I don't think the iPhone screen is good enough.
6939123	6942546	It's not gonna match the electronics of an actual button.
6942946	6947669	But look, if you just want a stupid app, pointless thing...
6948490	6948911	Have fun.
6973039	6974199	16 times in one second.
6974499	6975580	Like, imagine 16 times.
6975600	6975800	Ready?
6976680	6977440	One one thousand.
6977781	6978001	Okay?
6978501	6978761	16 times.
6978901	6979281	Right in that.
6980362	6980782	Crazy.
6981522	6982603	One more story, then listless.
6982923	6985204	That makes my brain hurt to think about.
6986524	6991526	That would have come in really freaking handy doing the drinking minigame in Chrono Trigger.
6995168	6999990	Anyway, speaking of for iPhone, there is actually a good game coming out.
7001124	7002164	Cooking Mama is a good game.
7002264	7003065	This is a good game.
7004145	7018809	There is a version of Galaga that is coming out, which was... You could actually play this particular version in... I do believe that it came out in 1981?
7018869	7021290	No.
7022530	7027632	There was the 1995 one that was the Galaga remix.
7028512	7030693	But Galaga remix is coming out on iPhone.
7031348	7031769	I remember that.
7031789	7033734	Wasn't that packaged with Pac-Man and Dig Dug remixes?
7034255	7034837	I do believe so.
7034897	7035318	I think so.
7036300	7037643	They have that at a local arcade around here.
7037704	7038125	It's closed down.
7039728	7048312	And actually, as far as I was always aware, the Galaga remix was based off of the Galaga 90 and Galaga 88.
7049673	7051414	But that was just in my observation.
7051854	7054235	But it's supposed to be coming out on the iPhone.
7054976	7056537	And it will be $5.99.
7058598	7065801	And you can use directional buttons, but there's also a sliding method and there is a tilt method.
7066201	7069103	Which I'm going to use the buttons, I swear, because...
7070367	7072889	Trying to play Pole Position and Tilt Mode is not fun.
7074811	7076292	So, it's going to be pretty good.
7076512	7077713	I think it's going to be good.
7077733	7078614	I was watching a video about it.
7078634	7079135	It looks pretty good.
7079735	7083058	Let's have an interesting round table on this point here before we get into the list list tonight.
7083078	7085300	Because an interesting comment was said in chat.
7085480	7087682	And I think everybody might want to have to say something to this.
7088082	7093087	GameGuru in chat says, I don't see how you love the iPhone and hate on the DSi.
7093647	7095188	Apple's worse with updating hardware.
7095369	7098011	I didn't say I hate... No, you as in all of us.
7099204	7100744	Well, I don't hate the DSi.
7100904	7105045	I just haven't... I have other things to spend my money on right now, like Disneyland.
7106066	7107646	As far as... For me, here it is.
7107906	7109487	I already have a Nintendo DS.
7109787	7113448	What does the DSi add to it that the DS didn't already have?
7113788	7116388	Like, you know, I'm not saying the DS is a bad gaming system.
7116488	7116928	It's not.
7117269	7122010	And if you don't have a DS yet, the DSi is probably a pretty good purchase for you.
7122970	7126851	I would actually recommend it over the DS at this point because you know there's going to be those games later on.
7127552	7128032	and so on and so forth.
7149513	7150835	Updating the software.
7150855	7151275	Think about it.
7151295	7158541	The iPhones, when they first launched, didn't have the App Store and the user-made apps and those things built into it.
7158582	7161704	That was something that Apple added for everybody.
7161764	7166649	Whereas I feel like with the DSi, there was nothing being given to current DS users.
7166689	7169852	You can't update the firmware on the DS.
7170452	7170752	I don't know.
7170792	7172934	I think for me, there's kind of the difference in...
7174034	7174635	Those two things.
7175496	7177158	And the iPhone's not perfect.
7177759	7184787	You know, yeah, Apple is a huge abuser of this whole let's upgrade the whole thing in a year and watch everybody buy it all over again.
7185107	7187991	But, you know, we give them crap for that, too, and it's deserved.
7188892	7192997	So, anyway, speaking of that, let's get to tonight's list list.
7198976	7199796	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7217561	7223066	Then we're going to go around the room and each one of us is going to take something off of the list, leaving a list of eight.
7223527	7228611	Then you guys in chat will vote on that list of eight and make our top three using your votes.
7228971	7231033	And then we will have the definitive top three list.
7231494	7232695	No arguments, no debates.
7233395	7234536	It is the official list.
7235057	7235337	All right.
7236879	7239221	I say that, but of course there's always room for debate.
7239481	7241142	Okay, so that being said, tonight's topic...
7242079	7245000	Feature that should have been on the DSi that would have got me to buy one today.
7245020	7246261	Who wants to start us off tonight?
7246481	7247021	How about Loki?
7247622	7249362	Loki's always got some evil answers for us.
7249703	7252444	Loki, what is your number three answer of the feature the DSi should have had?
7252464	7255345	You know, I was thinking a bunch of different things.
7256125	7256546	Let me say this.
7256586	7256846	I'm sorry.
7256886	7257226	Real quick.
7257506	7266910	Chatters, if you have ideas, put them in our chat room because if one of us gets an answer stolen, like somebody else says the same answer we were going to use, usually we take backup answers from chat.
7266950	7267791	So I just wanted to get that out there.
7268591	7285163	which would be kind of neat I mean I don't really use this on the Wii but like the DSI message board you know basically allowing you to send emails and attachments and stuff like that to each other really you know DSI should have a lot of stuff that the Wii has but you know that's what I'm going to start with
7285970	7290232	Doctor, what is the number three feature the DSi should have had to get you to buy one today?
7290272	7290812	Voice recognition.
7290852	7291113	Software.
7306138	7307859	I think that would be an awesome feature in games.
7308320	7309420	You speak and then it responds.
7309460	7321189	Well, now, I think about brain training and you have the blue and, you know, some of those things, but what would be... It's so rudimentary, like actual practical where you could say, you know, you cast a spell in a fantasy game and they do it, you know.
7321669	7323731	Go in and cast magic missiles!
7323771	7326353	Yeah, really fully developed voice recognition software.
7326413	7328034	Improved voice... Okay, I can go with that.
7328254	7328514	All right.
7328714	7328935	All right.
7328975	7329075	Cool.
7329095	7329675	All right.
7329715	7330235	I'll go next.
7330316	7338462	And my number three answer I'm going to use tonight is open app development like the iPhone that they should open up because they're going to have this DSI downloadable stuff.
7338502	7339542	I think they should open it up.
7340063	7346348	I think open app development is going to be my number three answer that anybody should be able to make a DS game.
7347088	7350651	because the community, I think, could come up with some good stuff and maybe like a message board.
7350951	7352332	And I think it's been very good for the iPhone.
7352472	7354373	So if we're going to make that comparison, then there you go.
7355274	7356215	DarkSakura, you're number three.
7357656	7360197	Me.
7360458	7361098	Interesting.
7361118	7370205	I honestly think having your me being able to travel, you know, from your Wii to your DSi to go visit other people's memes, you know.
7371665	7373186	Technically, they can already do that.
7373807	7376168	Well, they're going to have support for it, but yeah, they should.
7376188	7380230	Have it integrated into the actual OS of the system.
7380570	7386974	And I think it's kind of forgotten that you can put those things on the Wiimote, too, because there's not a lot of practical use for it.
7387414	7387894	You know what I mean?
7388314	7390095	I've brought mine over to your house before that way.
7390115	7391076	I remember that.
7391096	7392937	Okay, so Mii integration, I guess we could say.
7392997	7394298	Better use of the Miis on DS.
7394318	7394918	I like that idea.
7395618	7396539	Okay, Loki.
7398260	7398400	Um...
7400751	7402011	You know what would be kind of cool?
7402212	7402792	Bluetooth.
7404312	7405413	Okay.
7405813	7407153	Just think of it as you will.
7407453	7410675	You could use your Wii Remote for motion sensitive games.
7411035	7415456	Not necessarily obviously waggling your Wii Remote around, but like racing games or something like that.
7415636	7417857	You could use it for wireless headsets.
7420198	7420878	Okay.
7421198	7423419	Communication with other devices.
7423439	7424480	Okay.
7426460	7427000	The Doctor.
7427441	7428101	What's your number two?
7429666	7431747	The tilt feature, the motion feature like the iPhone has.
7434929	7436690	Are you guys wanting to turn the DSi into an iPhone?
7436710	7437750	What's going on here?
7437850	7438671	I guess I did one too.
7439371	7441472	What do you think the tilt feature would add to the DSi?
7444013	7450196	Well, gimmicks, but it seems like that would not have been a useless feature like the camera.
7450336	7450716	I'm sorry.
7452998	7455099	Alright, my number two answer I'm going to say is...
7457112	7459212	Okay, I'm going to give the first smart-ass answer of the night.
7459432	7461933	A Virtual Boy slot would have been something too.
7462433	7472155	Since they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, give me a Virtual Boy slot to give me a use for those games that are just collecting dust from the great red headache machine of death.
7472195	7473215	So a Virtual Boy slot.
7476976	7482557	DarkSakura, your number two pick for feature that you most would want to see in the DSi that would have gotten you to buy one.
7482817	7483357	TV Tuner.
7485575	7487115	Ooh, I like, I like that.
7487175	7488276	Okay, TV tuner.
7488596	7495159	I mean, if the freaking Turbo Express, the handheld TurboGrafx could have a TV tuner.
7496059	7498220	And NEC didn't really, well, they kind of did.
7498260	7501782	But anyway, why can't, yeah, the Lynx had one too.
7501862	7502322	Why not?
7502902	7503663	Why the heck not?
7504683	7505964	Okay, I'll tell you why not.
7506004	7506644	The Nomad.
7506804	7507485	No, I'm kidding.
7507505	7510086	Because they're getting rid of analog TV signals soon.
7510646	7512027	Doesn't matter, have a digital TV tuner.
7512067	7512347	No.
7512367	7512407	No.
7513187	7513888	That's impossible.
7513928	7514228	Yes!
7515709	7516469	Unpossible.
7517369	7517670	Alright.
7518610	7520131	Now we're getting to the number one answers.
7520151	7525254	The number one feature you want to see in the DSi that would get you to buy the system right now.
7525874	7527035	Loki, what is your number one answer?
7528255	7532438	My number one answer is... There's nothing they can do.
7534079	7539382	Honestly, they would have to... It's made out of bacon.
7539482	7539942	I don't know.
7540202	7540282	Um...
7545859	7547480	I have no number one answer.
7552062	7553643	Made out of bacon.
7554383	7556904	Or at least scratch and sniff bacon smell.
7556944	7557344	I don't know.
7557404	7557905	How about that?
7558325	7558845	Made out of bacon.
7558865	7559826	Bacon integration.
7560706	7561987	Alright, I like made out of bacon.
7562067	7567209	Alright, the DSI would sell, you would have bought one today and it was made out of bacon.
7570083	7574727	The Doctor, your number one answer for what would have got you to buy the DSi today.
7574807	7576909	Since I guess the theme is crazy stuff now.
7576929	7579211	Like, you know, you can interact with it.
7579312	7580513	It can interact with you back.
7580533	7583115	So, like, an energy hand will come out and, like, slap you in the face.
7585717	7586838	Is that your real answer?
7588620	7589080	That is.
7589161	7589901	And my final answer.
7589961	7591303	Energy hands.
7594989	7596271	You know, there's so many apps for that.
7596311	7597212	Slap in the face.
7597733	7598394	Wow.
7598514	7600938	Helps with self-trouser fornication.
7601219	7602961	Hands made out of pure energy.
7609181	7614365	Alright, my number one answer... It's a little bit long, but this is a true answer, by the way.
7614405	7615906	This is not a smart-ass answer.
7617087	7625793	My number one answer for the thing that would have most got me to buy a DSi today... Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.
7626314	7635961	My runner-up answer would have been a multi-touch touchscreen, but, you know... Like anything with a multi-touch touchscreen.
7636121	7637542	We're not just limiting it to the iPhone.
7637562	7638323	Did you molest it some more?
7639301	7640181	All right, enough about you.
7640221	7641882	Let's talk about me and my answer some more.
7642562	7646063	Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.
7646524	7648204	I think that speaks for itself.
7648584	7650705	I bought these games for five damn dollars.
7651085	7652486	I ought to have the right to download it.
7653106	7654006	PS3 does it.
7654586	7655787	Why can't Nintendo do it?
7656687	7657467	Why can't you do it?
7657687	7662529	You got rid of the Advance slot, so don't give me that argument you released on the Game Boy Advance, because now I can't play them anymore.
7662589	7664010	So he does when Nintendo...
7667319	7667739	Roll.
7668000	7670982	Alright, DarkSakura, your number one answer.
7671983	7684153	Mine would be to take PictoChat and make it truly networking as in you can hop on the Wi-Fi and you don't have to be just in the general vicinity of somebody else with one.
7684513	7691439	You can draw penises on full-blown PNOR on people's DSIs in Malaysia.
7691559	7695042	Or an enhancement of that, it could be like there's a camera on it, like video chat.
7696746	7699167	Can I just say PictoChat across the internets?
7699627	7700467	That would be cool.
7700607	7701808	Alright, there you go.
7702608	7709632	Although my bullshit answer could either be a jelly belly dispenser or gay porn.
7710232	7711093	Gay porn, alright.
7711293	7713254	Gay porn always sells.
7713274	7715775	Let's see what the chatroom had to say, some answers there.
7716295	7719257	Let's see, we had a DDR pad.
7720157	7731644	was one answer, Airport Tuner, Shortwave Tuner, Legend of Zelda Ghost Camera, a Vibrator, I think I saw different forms of Vibrator, a Trans Vibrator was one that came up as well.
7734837	7736098	Let's see, what do we have as well?
7736158	7738581	LaserCat's DSi game at launch would have made it better.
7738621	7740462	That's from S2100, Matt.
7740522	7741944	Virtual Handheld from Actdeft.
7741984	7742744	Kind of like my answer.
7743385	7746528	How about a fart sound maker or a swear button from Dark Knight?
7746628	7747228	All right, there you go.
7747248	7748209	Some of the answers we have from chat.
7748229	7751052	You know, they did make a DDR pad for the Game Boy back in the day.
7751372	7752193	Way back in the day.
7752453	7752953	I have one.
7753594	7755956	Because they brought out the Super MIDI version of the DDR.
7755976	7757177	They were kind of shit.
7757597	7758298	They were funny.
7758718	7759839	Was it for your fingers, though?
7760100	7760280	Yeah.
7760300	7760380	Yeah.
7761892	7763853	Actdeft wins a RuPaul game for the DSiWare.
7763873	7767034	Alright, here's the list so far, but now we're going to get to the elimination round.
7767054	7767454	Here we go.
7767514	7786280	DSiMessageBoard, voice recognition software, open app development, Miis, Bluetooth integration, tilt feature like the iPhone, virtual voice slot, TV tuner, made out of bacon, energy hands, virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit, and PictoChat across the internets.
7787020	7789421	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7791828	7796132	Uh... Energy Hands, I'm sorry.
7797333	7798474	Energy Hands.
7798774	7801037	Maybe just a little too soon for Energy Hands.
7801577	7802638	Alright, The Doctor.
7803499	7805541	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7806182	7807103	The Virtual Boy Slot.
7807823	7808744	Oh, you bastard.
7808764	7810426	Alright, Virtual Boy Slot comes off the list.
7811969	7818676	Um, I am going to say, I have to be honest, the one I've got to take out is voice recognition software.
7818796	7827286	Sorry, doctor, that's not a retaliation thing, but I just think that would be whored to the extreme and would just make the thing crap.
7827967	7829688	DarkSakura is going to be the last one to eliminate.
7829769	7831711	DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7833374	7834255	DarkSakura.com
7856428	7856768	Check it out.
7856788	7857908	But I like bacon, too.
7857948	7858268	Bacon.
7859209	7859889	No, seriously.
7860109	7860489	Fair enough.
7860569	7864510	Every Friday after typography class, now I have to go have bacon because bacon is meat candy.
7864590	7865010	Fair enough.
7865110	7865410	All right.
7866270	7866851	So here we go.
7867411	7869111	Now here's the list you guys will vote on.
7869211	7880934	DSI Message Board, Open App Development, Mies, Bluetooth Integration, TV Tuner, Made Out of Bacon, Virtual Console Games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.
7881494	7883616	and Pictochats across the internet.
7884016	7885237	Place vote now.
7885297	7888620	Send a private message with your number one and number two answer.
7888680	7892263	Make sure both are labeled or I will assume the first is your number one.
7892904	7896407	Send those over private message to Rob Roberts in chat room.
7897168	7901511	And if you don't know how to do that, ask somebody or maybe somebody will mention it in chat how to do that right now.
7901972	7905695	Place those votes within the next 120 seconds you have to vote.
7906015	7909038	And we will tally it up and reveal for you who won
7909578	7911279	A little later on in the show.
7912159	7917180	For now, while those votes are coming in, let's take a trip over to our Twitter.
7918180	7922581	And we're actually going to look at... We put a call out on Twitter today saying, you know, we're a little short on stories this week.
7922941	7924722	What do you guys want to see us talk about?
7924962	7926262	And we put the call out on Twitter.
7926722	7931564	And we did get some replies, some various tweets in our response here.
7932004	7934244	And I wanted to read some of those for you guys right now.
7934264	7936005	Although right now I'm seeing a lot of gaming weeks.
7936645	7936685	Um...
7938072	7938712	DSI, is it worth the upgrade?
7938732	7941414	Can I get a side of handheld console wars as well, please?
7960653	7989038	there hasn't been a lot of PSP bashing tonight I don't know is there is is is the DSI I mean okay let me back up the PSP is kind of a little bit behind in the console wars right now but the DSI is kind of out there to increase the lead so to speak I know what we could talk about did you hear about that news story where Sony apparently put out a press release saying that basically saying the DSI was a kiddie system and then touted that it had a Miley Cyrus game in the exact same press release did you hear about that
7990865	7991165	DS, PSP
8011122	8012984	Well, you know, I gotta disagree with that a little.
8013044	8016186	I don't like all these uber-violent, uber-serious games.
8016266	8018128	I'm like, I fall asleep watching COD.
8018188	8018648	I'm sorry.
8019089	8023513	So I like the more down-to-earth or the more silly games myself.
8024943	8032165	Well, but here's the thing, and I still feel this way, and you know, maybe, okay, the PSP is still like games and more.
8032345	8042167	It might not be the best system at games, even though it still has, you know, it does have Dissida, it does have some games that are pretty awesome, but the PSP is still, you know, for that college kid.
8042187	8051989	This is like the great college system, because you've got your MP3 player, you've got your little internet browser you can use at Starbucks, you've got your gaming system, you know, it's all right there.
8052089	8054150	And I think the DSi was trying to
8054870	8058732	Compete with that a little bit, but it didn't work because, you know, where's the internet?
8058832	8060573	Where is the MP3 player built in?
8060953	8061673	None of that is here.
8062333	8068376	So I still think the PSP excels at being more than a gaming, but if all you want is handheld games, I think the DS still wins.
8068556	8079281	And then also the DSi, though, I mean, their music player's kind of crap because it's only the AAC format or whatever, which I understand, you know, iTunes and stuff, that's fine, but really I think it should have been MP3.
8079401	8081082	I mean, come on, man, give it the times.
8081802	8081882	Um...
8082162	8087205	And then also, you know, there's the internet browser, which apparently is not very good anyways.
8087726	8090047	So it's like, ugh, you know, okay, whatever.
8090688	8094110	And then, you know, what, the photo manipulation stuff?
8094490	8094810	Really?
8095491	8096432	Is that what you're going to do?
8096672	8097652	A photo manipulation?
8098033	8099093	Is that really that important?
8099213	8106618	Are we going to, like, throw those around the internet now and take pictures and manipulate them with silly faces like you couldn't do that in Microsoft Paint or something?
8106638	8107319	I mean, come on.
8110541	8113283	It's got potential, but they're never going to utilize it, and that's sad.
8114203	8116765	I like Acidic Vampire's response in chat.
8117085	8119386	In the PSP's defense, the games look saucier.
8120647	8121507	I like that word, saucier.
8121527	8129572	They could have had MP3 support if Nintendo had paid a license, just like the Wii could have played DVDs if they had paid the license for the use of DVD codecs.
8130852	8131673	But you know what?
8131853	8133354	You know what's more important than Nintendo?
8133654	8134675	Money in their pocket.
8134915	8135235	So...
8137027	8137747	So much for that.
8138788	8141429	So I guess the consumer loses because Nintendo needs to make a buck.
8142109	8146291	Yeah, but nobody uses their consoles to play movies anymore, I don't think, anyway.
8147611	8149492	I use my consoles to play movies all the time.
8149652	8150993	It's my primary DVD player.
8152914	8154474	PlayStation 3 is my primary movie player.
8154594	8158316	We do use it for Blu-ray and our HD DVD player is our Xbox 360.
8161296	8163797	and whatever I happen to have hooked up at the time.
8163857	8167479	It would be kind of cool to have a DVD player for the Wii.
8168539	8171980	Don't be surprised if that's not something that they're going to start selling too.
8172061	8174361	I mean, it's just... I don't know.
8175042	8178163	And yeah, I know most people already have DVD players, but you know what?
8178683	8182405	People also have TVs too, but yet still buy tons of TVs out there.
8182945	8183525	And who cares?
8183685	8185046	It's another DVD player.
8185066	8185546	That's the point.
8185946	8188027	The Wii may be in the kids' room or something like that.
8188127	8188627	Now, boom!
8188687	8190068	It's a DVD player in the kids' room.
8190228	8190468	So...
8193262	8193683	I don't know.
8194244	8197909	Minor cost for another bullet point.
8199071	8199552	So whatever.
8201222	8203803	I'm still trying to tally the votes, so let's move on to another topic here.
8204644	8209626	Crows asked on Twitter, maybe talk about some April Fool's jokes that spread on the internet that were actually entertaining.
8209806	8223933	I don't like April Fool's Day at all, although I think, you know, for hating April Fool's Day, I think Dark Tetsuya did a pretty funny one on our site where he did for I Heart that song, he did Let Them Move from DD, which is like a total throwback to the old school days of Orange Lounge Radio.
8223973	8226815	So, like, I like dumb shit like that.
8228229	8228549	I don't know.
8228649	8230951	Loki, DarkSakura, did you guys see anything funny on the internet?
8231011	8233613	I kind of turn off the internet on April Fool's Day.
8233633	8236435	This year, a lot of the sites that would normally do April Fool's jokes didn't.
8236995	8239677	They're just like, I'm too busy with stuff, so forget it.
8241178	8245601	Basically, I saw a few in the hacking communities.
8245641	8253066	People were like, oh yeah, look, we're releasing a tool to hack the PSP-3000 or a new one to hack the Wii or something.
8253206	8255147	It's just, whatever.
8255207	8256868	Those we kind of figured were fake.
8261311	8262071	I'm trying to think here.
8262091	8265533	What are some of the other April Fool's jokes that were just very obvious?
8266073	8267474	The new Metal Gear Solid game.
8268514	8272316	They announced what the new character was going to be, which is kind of retarded.
8272936	8275258	I'm trying to think here.
8276428	8277109	They were kind of lame.
8277149	8281432	I mean, it was, you know, the World of Warcraft thing that they did was kind of cool.
8282092	8292460	And then there was another one with IGN, you know, trying to do this Wii Extend or Wii Expand or something like that, which was supposed to be download content for, like, Wii games.
8292860	8295782	And the first one was Super Smash Bros.
8296263	8300266	Brawl Extreme, where they were going to have, like, blood and stuff like that.
8300306	8301787	And it just looked so fake and...
8302667	8305188	They had Mario getting decapitated and stuff like that.
8305288	8313210	You know, despite all the shit we give the mainstream press sometimes on this show and all that stuff, I think their Zelda trailer will never be topped.
8313330	8315691	That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fool's prank.
8315711	8316251	That was great.
8316391	8318232	That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fool's prank.
8318292	8324854	Not for the fact that I don't think anyone really fell for it, but just like, god damn, they went all out with that shit that year.
8324974	8328855	And Doctor, you're a big Zelda fanboy.
8329175	8332056	Did you not get a huge boner, April's Fools or not, at that trailer?
8332156	8341037	No, and obviously it was fake, but yeah, I mean, if you've ever seen the fan-made Zelda movies, I mean, this was like a bazillion, the production value was pretty good.
8342728	8348770	And sadly enough, it will never come to fruition, which is, you know, I don't think it would cost that much, you know, for something like that.
8349650	8360853	Now, this wasn't even an April Fool's thing, but have you seen, there's a trailer for a movie that someone made, a short movie, called Turbo, which is a little bit of a cross between, like, Street Fighter and Tron and, you know, the Karate Kid.
8361294	8368776	And actually, it looks pretty cool, and that's also made, you know, with a really low budget and stuff, so, you know, nowadays, you can do pretty amazing stuff.
8368836	8371937	Hell, I mean, look at that, what is it, the Half-Life, um...
8372777	8374038	Thanks for watching!
8395149	8395629	All right.
8395929	8398150	And then one other thing on Twitter I thought was pretty interesting.
8398230	8405334	And, you know, our good friend Marin, or Tiara, whatever you want to say, kind of likes to pimp her own stuff.
8406134	8406734	But I liked it.
8406794	8412177	It was actually a piece that she wrote on her own blog, which I've jokingly referred to as the Giggling Girls blog.
8412517	8415138	But, no, it's what, AvengersTower.com?
8415418	8415958	Yes, it is.
8416038	8418159	I can't remember if it's Avenger Tower or Avengers Tower.
8418219	8418960	It's Avengers Tower.
8418980	8419900	It's Avengers Tower.
8420220	8421161	Like the old...
8423330	8425332	The Avengers Tower and the comic books
8451786	8452327	Extra Microphones
8463419	8465800	So maybe you could have more than one person singing?
8466540	8468681	You'd have two people singing at once?
8469022	8481387	To kind of go with the keyboard thing, their site, I don't know if it's viral or what, but their actual The Beatles site, they've been having instruments slowly being added to their studio recording room, and one of the instruments was a keyboard.
8483488	8483888	Interesting.
8484969	8492132	Rumor number three, drums with cymbals, that maybe they're actually going to put actual cymbals or whatever on the drum kit for the rock band.
8492906	8503222	well they did say that later on it's potential that they can have like say Rock Band 3 or something like that where the cymbals would be their own notes which is kind of cool another rumor two guitars instead of one
8504818	8509280	I think it's more of that is what's going to be why it's more expensive.
8509780	8511421	The second guitar, I think, is going to be in there.
8511721	8512842	Because they're going to model the bass.
8512962	8515043	They're probably going to have an actual bass and then a guitar.
8515483	8517864	And the last rumor, just milking the damn cash cow.
8518805	8520005	Milking the damn cash cow.
8520445	8527409	I really hope it's the keyboard one, but I think it's going to be one of their bass guitars with the regular guitar.
8527809	8529450	Especially because you have the...
8530630	8540452	And she goes into talking about the whole Hoffner violin bass, which, you know, it seems likely that, you know, with the Beatles and everything, they would have like a special Beatles bass.
8541332	8542032	That seems likely.
8544313	8546613	Some folks in chat are saying, you know, what about like a strobe light?
8547953	8548973	You can already buy that.
8549473	8552274	Oh, no, they're talking about Nine Inch Nails.
8552334	8557815	I guess their April Fool's joke or something like that has something to do with... Oh, it was the album.
8560351	8564274	Oh, that Nine Inch Nails was putting out a new album that was produced by Timbaland called Strobelight.
8564834	8566836	That was a good April Fool's joke that was out on the internet.
8567876	8570618	Alright, let's get into the listless results.
8574161	8579585	So we can get to your calls, last minute stories, and the end of the show pretty soon.
8579665	8585209	Believe it or not, for being a slower news week, we sure seem to fill a couple of hours and then some here on the show.
8585919	8594785	Alright, here are your top three tonight, the definitive list as you guys in chat have voted for the feature that they should have put on the DSi that would have made me buy one today.
8595325	8602530	Number three, open app development, just like the iPhone, let anybody make an app, there you go, open app development.
8603030	8611275	Number two feature that would have got me to buy a DSi today, made out of bacon, made out of bacon was the number two feature, there you go.
8612216	8613818	Where there's bacon, there's profit.
8613858	8619283	And the number one feature that would have gotten people to buy the DSi today?
8620544	8625168	Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.
8625228	8625748	There it is.
8626729	8629272	Your number one answer on the list.
8629852	8630152	Lists.
8630453	8631794	Segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8633553	8633873	Alright.
8634853	8635173	Alright.
8635834	8638414	Lots of votes spread around amongst all the choices, though.
8638774	8643316	Everybody got a little love, but I think those three struck a particular nerve.
8643676	8645816	People just love their bacon and virtual console.
8646617	8647377	And open app development.
8647877	8648157	Alright.
8649437	8650618	Actdeft makes a good point.
8650738	8654779	If anybody can make an app, you know who will make his game a reality.
8654959	8657300	That individual who has a game named after himself.
8657560	8661981	Well, you know whose game sucks balls, because I've actually played the demo, and it
8662867	8664208	It's as crappy as it looks.
8666128	8666628	I'm sorry.
8666648	8669490	I don't care if it's one person developing it.
8669790	8672631	It's not good.
8672851	8675412	If I paid retail for that, I'd have to kick myself in the junk.
8677555	8683840	BlackWolf asks in chat, what if Bobby BlackWolf made a game, would you talk about it if I called it Bobby's Game?
8684601	8685741	Yes, I would talk about it every week.
8686262	8686882	Every week, Bobby.
8687603	8687943	Every week.
8688424	8689124	As long as it didn't suck.
8689144	8693407	In fact, I think you should beat him to the market because I would laugh my ass off at that.
8693427	8693768	Do it now.
8694108	8698912	But only if the theme song to the game is la la la la la la la la Bobby's World.
8699770	8703071	Oh my god.
8703952	8704252	Alright.
8706292	8714035	Also, before we get to the Skype line and so forth, we have one segment we always do here on the show that we don't want to miss, but we just haven't had any really angsty stories.
8714095	8726600	But perhaps the invoking of said name of said band individual from said show and just even thinking about his game should invoke anger and rage in a certain segment we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
8742302	8742762	FU's of the week
8766676	8771079	F you to this glass of wine I'm drinking for being so yummy and making me a little tipsy during the show.
8771159	8771799	I love it.
8772200	8773440	It's freaking delicious.
8773621	8775502	It's a Moscato.
8775662	8776162	Moscato.
8777363	8778023	It's delicious.
8778204	8779104	It's a sweet wine.
8779124	8779985	It tastes like candy.
8781065	8783847	It tastes like champagne without the bubbles, as my friend put it.
8784448	8784908	It's delish.
8786445	8787186	Hey there, Doctor!
8787206	8789929	Do you have any FUs of the week, even though Loki's holding the mic?
8790270	8793273	Yeah, even though this is a little old news, I had a lady confirm me about this the other day.
8793633	8795576	Fuck you to anyone who doesn't support gay marriage.
8795876	8797218	Because you are fucking assholes.
8798159	8799340	Props to Iowa, though.
8799500	8800221	Props to Iowa.
8801181	8821850	of all places props to them although I have heard those comparisons about well isn't Iowa just doing what California did like five years ago or however long ago it was like three years ago which ended up getting turned around by Prop 8 anyway maybe but I hear it's harder to pass a constitutional amendment in that state so if you live in Iowa please don't screw this up please don't screw this up
8823510	8827991	But right now, hey, I think some person in Iowa is probably really concerned.
8828631	8842734	I actually read about this somewhere, that they are concerned, the conservative moral majority, let's say, in Iowa, that there's just going to be this outbreak of gayness throughout the state.
8842774	8844114	It's going to become a gay mecca.
8844334	8849175	There's just going to be a sodomy outbreak within the state of Iowa because of this law passing.
8850922	8851442	You know what?
8852363	8853323	Why is that a bad thing?
8854424	8858486	Like, maybe people can come clean the place up.
8860207	8862829	Throw a party in Des Moines that people want to come to.
8863269	8863910	And make it fierce.
8864130	8866131	Quick, when I say Des Moines, what do you think of?
8867312	8868352	My crappy customer.
8869273	8871714	Silent S. Corn.
8871794	8873175	There's not a lot else I can think of.
8873995	8874536	Alright, anyway.
8875636	8879959	ZakuPilot256 in chat says, If gay people want to ruin their life with marriage, let them.
8880982	8881563	Amen to that.
8881643	8882383	Alright, anyhow.
8882644	8885466	Didn't I say it in my little rant that I put in my blog?
8886307	8891112	That everyone should have as much right to mess it up like anyone else?
8891592	8892533	Just like Britney Spears.
8892593	8894395	We have every right to fuck it up like Britney Spears did.
8894435	8899059	Alright, look, I don't want to turn this into a political show, but obviously it's an issue important to myself and the doctor.
8900100	8901001	So yay, Iowa.
8902402	8903463	F you, everybody else.
8904980	8906261	Yeah, Loki, please, your FU of the week.
8907062	8913967	My FU of the week goes to some of my airsoft guns not working correctly, so... Did your airsoft thing, did you get to have that?
8913987	8917770	Because I saw, like, multiple please on live, and we were like, pretty please, come play airsoft with me.
8917790	8919512	And I felt bad, I wanted to go, but I had plans.
8919692	8922914	No, we had, like, three people, including myself, and that's it.
8922934	8924676	But it was alright, we had fun with the small group.
8925116	8927158	I promise I will go airsoft with you in a future week.
8927518	8928779	That's fine, I just, I have...
8930578	8932199	Actdeft says, Bad Loki, what will the wife say?
8932260	8933120	She doesn't know.
8958464	8960385	And thankfully she doesn't listen to this show.
8960485	8960805	All right.
8963487	8963807	Damn.
8963927	8964267	All right.
8964467	8964968	There you go.
8965088	8967649	Let's open up the Skype line if we can here.
8967669	8969230	I'm going to do not disturb.
8969250	8971391	Let me open it up there.
8971411	8974273	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8974293	8980776	If you want to give us a call and interact with us, talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight, or as long as it's gaming related, we'll talk about anything pretty much.
8980876	8982717	So go ahead and call us right now.
8982737	8986960	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8987580	8990582	Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for these calls to come in?
8990742	8993083	Yeah, sorry, I'm fighting a giant slug thing.
8993563	8994664	Well, actually, you're getting saved.
8994684	8995565	We've got a call right now.
8995645	8996985	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8997005	8997346	Who's this?
8998546	9000587	This is DSMaster26.
9000647	9002869	Hey, DSMaster26, what is on your mind?
9002889	9004390	Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm going to ask you.
9005510	9006371	How about the DSI?
9009332	9013435	Seriously, I've seen, actually, one of my friends has one.
9013475	9015676	She gets imports from Japan a whole bunch of times.
9016291	9016731	PSP vs. DSi
9044278	9045559	That's like on the Nintendo Wii.
9045619	9046859	It's very, very slow.
9048540	9051761	Yeah, same thing with the DSi, but slower.
9053062	9056143	And seriously, the music player is crap.
9056183	9059224	I mean, besides, I already got that feature with my R4 card.
9060625	9062726	Wait, didn't they actually put a music player in the DSi?
9062806	9063926	I didn't even realize that was there.
9064247	9064887	It's built in now?
9066522	9070723	Yeah, but you use your SD card and it always takes AAC.
9072024	9076986	But yeah, I already have a PSP or more importantly, you know, an iPod and iPhone that will do it as well.
9077086	9079066	You know, I do use my PSP pretty much every day.
9079086	9080367	Yeah, same here.
9080407	9086709	I use my PSP, like, but R4 does do videos, as I found out.
9087809	9089670	Actually, that's the reason why I called in.
9090447	9094489	I'm giving a review on Silent Hill, which I just saw last night.
9094929	9095409	The movie?
9095449	9096429	Freaking awesome.
9097030	9097310	Yeah.
9097550	9097830	Wow.
9097910	9099050	Isn't it amazing?
9099130	9101071	You're only about three years late, but go ahead.
9102252	9102892	I'm just messing.
9103852	9105333	Wow, it came out three years ago?
9105953	9106633	It was a while ago.
9106693	9107333	I'm just messing with you.
9107353	9108914	I don't remember when, but it was a while ago.
9110415	9110915	What did you think?
9111015	9118978	Well, anyways, out of all the movie, out of the game movies I've seen, this is like probably the best ever.
9119747	9128996	And plus on the fact you're seeing witch burnings and then the massive blood splatter in the awesome epic Pyramid Head, which I'm thinking of being for Halloween.
9130057	9130857	Awesome flick.
9131958	9135421	Now you know why we fangasm over Pyramid Head all the time on this show.
9135481	9136122	He has sex.
9136402	9137383	He just, he really is.
9137824	9139145	And he has a lot of it.
9139645	9140466	With the nurses.
9142222	9149483	And plus not to mention, if you guys ever... Okay, have any of you played the DDR Extreme for the US version on the PS2?
9150023	9151564	On the PS2, yes.
9151664	9153404	Extreme 1, yes.
9154924	9162906	Okay, the ending song, the Silent Hill for the ending credits, very reminiscent to the soundtrack.
9162946	9168266	I think it's like the last song you'll lock in Extreme, but it was very similar to me.
9168306	9171187	Like, I couldn't remember the first few times until the chorus came in.
9171207	9171427	I'm like...
9172335	9173375	No, it was...
9195250	9196951	Well, have you ever noticed there's a pump-it-up game for the PSP?
9225609	9227791	I had heard there was a Pump It Up game on PSP.
9230213	9235217	I found out on PlayAsia, and I'm like, what the heck?
9235677	9241202	Okay, I can understand DDR on this thing, but not Pump It Up, because it takes five icons.
9242122	9245765	And we got the four external sort of square, I don't know what I'm supposed to use.
9245825	9248267	Well, what about the shoulder buttons?
9248287	9249588	I just assumed it was the shoulder button.
9249728	9252851	I mean, if you're going to play DDR on a handheld, Pump It Up makes sense to me.
9254346	9254686	DJ Max DJ Max
9289379	9300165	I would love that, but unfortunately, I think because of how Beatmania 2 did, or I'm sorry, not Beatmania 2, Beatmania on the PS2 did, I don't think they're in any hurry to put out a new Beatmania game.
9300185	9301406	I don't think it sold well enough for them.
9301586	9305048	I had heard it exceeded expectations, but I could have always heard wrong.
9305788	9322913	because they never did do a second one if it sold that well they would have done a second one I mean as far as I know DDR Universe 2 did not sell that great compared to older DDR titles but they still made a 3 and you know it wasn't just a reskinned version of the other ones because 2 was kind of just a reskinned Universe 1
9324662	9329765	Just thinking of DDR, haven't you noticed there hasn't been a single one out for the PS3?
9329785	9332086	They're still rehashing on the PS2.
9332887	9340151	It is interesting there hasn't been one on the PS3, and I'm wondering if that's not going to be one of the things Konami pulls out of their hat at E3 this year, because you're right.
9340691	9344253	The PS3 is one of those platforms that hasn't seen a DDR game on it yet.
9346054	9349075	Maybe that will be where we start to see the download content and all that stuff.
9349096	9349416	Who knows?
9349856	9350336	But I don't know.
9350456	9351697	At the same time, I'm not going to hold my breath.
9353476	9357080	Beatmania Guitar Hero Control 5 Keys Scratches the Strum Bar
9369414	9371274	What do you think of it?
9399625	9406628	I've actually bought the Guitar Hero DS, and, you know, it's pretty darn interesting, pretty good for what it is.
9406828	9413931	I was surprised at the graphics for it, for a DS game, for Guitar Hero-wise, and the sound quality was pretty darn good.
9415372	9419953	I think the style that they're going with the PSP version of Rock Band, though, is pretty darn interesting.
9420013	9428577	You'd think they would try to mod, like, redo the guitar grip, and then try to do some little quirky little drum sets.
9429622	9432244	You know, that you plug on top and then you just hit with your fingers.
9433025	9434506	I didn't think that'd be kind of fun.
9435007	9441132	Yeah, but at the same time, I like the idea that they're just doing like an amplitude type game that you're not going to need any of these stupid peripherals for.
9441313	9442113	I kind of like that idea.
9442474	9448479	Yeah, but that's also the same control scheme for DJ Max on the PSP, which I kind of suck at.
9450020	9455125	I try it with the two-hand configuration like you would for Beatmania, and I still suck.
9455871	9456151	I can't do it.
9456171	9457251	Oh, by the way, one more thing before I go.
9457271	9461373	Hopefully EA and the whole gaming industry of America does not call for a bailout from Barack Obama.
9461413	9461713	That would suck.
9461733	9462233	Do they need one?
9462573	9462713	Maybe.
9462733	9463293	Would they be eligible?
9463313	9464033	Probably midway.
9486223	9489185	DarkSakura, you seem like you're dying to comment on the bailout message.
9489225	9489465	No.
9489885	9490145	Alright.
9505672	9511974	Are you guys talking about the... I think I was just saying, Am I seeing a glitch in Ninja Blade here?
9512014	9515815	Because the monster has no health left and I keep hitting it and it's not dying.
9516595	9517236	No, you just suck.
9517316	9518596	Alright, let's go to the call.
9519156	9520237	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9520257	9520597	Who's this?
9522117	9523098	It did the Mega Man 3 trick.
9523238	9524438	Uh-oh, did it cut off?
9525658	9528499	Okay, whoever... I have to explain this trick.
9528679	9528879	What?
9529560	9530520	Hurry, because we've got a call on the line.
9530560	9532280	Okay, we'll call her going.
9532340	9533521	Okay, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9533541	9533821	Who's this?
9534895	9535936	Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.
9536056	9537016	Hey, DJ Tyrant.
9537036	9538197	I haven't heard you on the show in a long time.
9538217	9538517	What's up?
9539397	9540138	Hey, not much.
9540338	9542199	I'm trying out the Skype for iPhone app.
9542279	9543499	It seems to work pretty well.
9543680	9545340	Whoa, you're calling us from iPhone right now?
9546181	9546441	Yeah.
9546621	9548162	Wow, not too shabby.
9548202	9548462	All right.
9548742	9550223	I forgot that that's available now.
9550263	9553324	So those of you with iPhones, you can Skype us during the show on your iPhones.
9553385	9554465	Thank you for reminding us of that.
9554505	9555366	I have to check that out.
9555406	9556766	It only works on Wi-Fi, though.
9556806	9557387	Remember that.
9557767	9558147	That's true.
9558167	9562669	But still, your regular Skype will only work with an internet connection, too.
9563069	9563590	What's on your mind?
9563610	9563890	That's true.
9565104	9584985	Um, just, I know it's all the talk of today, but DSi, I really enjoy mine personally, um, I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade, I got to play it last week, um, at an event I got invited to, and I don't know, I think it's pretty, a pretty good upgrade, but I can see, it's not for everyone, definitely, so.
9585926	9587428	What about it makes it such a great upgrade?
9590006	9591948	I really like the screens.
9592008	9593450	The controls are much better.
9593470	9597874	The D-pad and the buttons just in general feel a lot better and more sturdy.
9598815	9601417	Because the D-pad was really floaty on the Lite, I thought.
9603520	9607924	Sometimes I keep forgetting this is actually the third DS now we've gotten between DS Fat and DS Lite.
9607964	9609085	I sometimes forget that.
9609566	9611668	Anyhow, do you still work in games retail?
9612979	9613520	No, I don't.
9613700	9614461	I haven't heard too much.
9627052	9628753	Yeah, I haven't really heard anything.
9629534	9629994	Alright, sorry.
9630414	9631195	My bad for asking.
9631976	9633437	No, no worries.
9634297	9638020	So, okay, well, so you're more of a fan of the DSi then.
9638380	9639981	Is there anything that you're looking forward to?
9640141	9643403	Like, we've seen some announcements recently of the Zelda Spirit Tracks and so on.
9643744	9645785	What are you looking forward to from Nintendo on DS?
9646485	9648107	Definitely the Zelda game.
9648287	9654631	I'm kind of, I honestly am looking forward to these new play control games because I missed out on them on the GameCube, so...
9656314	9660760	I'm kind of looking forward to them, and they're not too badly priced either, which is a good thing.
9661000	9661601	Cheap is good.
9661861	9662202	You're right.
9662222	9663083	Cheap is always a good thing.
9663183	9663744	I don't mind that.
9664264	9665926	And, of course, the DSiWare.
9665987	9669791	I really hope that that takes off like the App Store has on the iPhone.
9670312	9671394	I know it's not open, though.
9671574	9674658	That's really going to, I think, hurt it in the long run, though.
9676389	9688032	I tend to agree, but at the same time, it is a double-edged sword, and I could see the other side of the argument where, well, look at all the shit that's on the iPhone store, because there's some real crap apps on the iPhone.
9688052	9691372	It's so hard to comb through there and find some decent games sometimes.
9691673	9695893	And you think there's supposed to be some quality control out there, but it's not much.
9695914	9697134	It is not much.
9697174	9697354	Yeah.
9698354	9708560	So I guess maybe by closing it off, Nintendo will release quote-unquote quality apps on the DSi, but at the same time, some of these games don't sound that quality.
9708580	9711061	Yeah, I guess that's true.
9711181	9712462	Is there anything on WiiWare you enjoy?
9712482	9717525	I don't know if we really enjoy the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
9718203	9718983	My Life as a King
9733038	9736139	Yeah, but I agree with you that I really hope they have some sort of support like the PS3 and the PSP.
9760631	9761592	I have a bad feeling.
9761612	9762853	I'm just dreaming with that.
9762913	9764755	But you know it can be done.
9764835	9768118	Look at the Nintendo channel that streams DS demos to your DS.
9768298	9769018	It can be done.
9769058	9770440	They just don't want to do it.
9770780	9774403	Or they're leaving it in their hat to unveil at a later conference.
9774503	9780768	I mean, that got me to buy Rhythm Heaven because they released a demo the day they gave it out at GDC.
9780808	9781829	And I tried and I was like, well,
9782384	9783245	Thanks for having me on.
9807419	9809921	I can't think of anything right now.
9829694	9842223	Um, well, first of all, I'm... I'm burnt out on my 360, and second of all, I'm rejecting that, again, that, because, uh, for one month, because Operation Flashpoint, the new one's coming out, I think, next month.
9842243	9843364	Okay, hold on, back up.
9843404	9845705	Aren't you the same guy that was having the points problems earlier?
9846466	9846726	Yeah.
9846846	9852410	Okay, so, obviously that's all fixed, and Nintendo, Xbox was very kind to you and all that.
9852750	9854411	What did you end up running out and buying with those points?
9855952	9856813	Um, I bought...
9858075	9874489	Some rock band songs, my Call of Duty maps, and then with the extra points, I bought one rock band song and a pack of Burnout Cars that came with a Legendary Cars pack, which has like a DeLorean.
9874509	9874889	Mm-hmm.
9875367	9875807	Don't Stop Believin'
9892362	9893023	No, I didn't buy that.
9893203	9893503	Fail.
9894103	9909351	I bought Trash Unreal from Against Me, Come On, Come On from the Von Bondys, The Joker from Steve Miller, Sick, Sick, Sick from Queens of the Stone Age, and My Curse from Killswitch Engage.
9909531	9913133	Now look, those songs are all fine and dandy, but it needs more epic classic rock.
9915655	9919797	Thing is, I would buy classic rock, but there's no Led Zeppelin.
9921791	9926935	That's one of those bands that could put out their own game, like Aerosmith and Metallica.
9927115	9928116	I don't like Aerosmith.
9928716	9929837	In fact, I hate Aerosmith.
9930237	9933079	I'm just saying, though, they were able to put out their own game.
9933740	9935721	We can all argue about the success of that game.
9935861	9937182	Leitzinger looks like a beat chick.
9937642	9938303	All right, look.
9939943	9942185	What did you really want to call in and talk about tonight?
9942205	9944748	Operation Flashpoint.
9945168	9946590	I think it's Dragon Rise or something.
9947210	9948652	Remember the old Operation Flashpoint?
9948672	9950234	Did you ever play it?
9950254	9951435	What system was it on?
9951535	9952456	It was a PC game.
9952796	9954879	And it was Xbox, I think.
9954899	9955699	And Xbox, I mean.
9956400	9959021	I don't recall this game, but I'm going to look up and see if I get screenshots.
9959441	9961962	I'm a very visual person, so sometimes that jogs my memory.
9962082	9962522	I doubt it.
9962602	9964422	It's a Call of Duty type of game.
9964482	9966303	It's a military simulator, actually.
9966443	9971344	I think, from what I remember, it was one shot, pretty much.
9971364	9972005	You were dead.
9976086	9979107	You know, surprisingly enough, I think I saw this game once.
9980717	9982780	So what about... Are they making a new one or what's up?
9983761	9984902	Yeah, sequel's coming out.
9985002	9985943	I think it's next month.
9986344	9987025	End of next month?
9988547	9990509	I'm not sure though, but it's end of next month.
9990809	9992932	Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising.
9993313	9994314	Yeah, and it's just like...
9996075	9996835	It's like what I like.
9997956	10005919	I'm this guy who wants these shooters that aren't, like, I'm tired of kind of seeing these really Call of Duty-esque Super Arcadia.
10005979	10009780	I get shot, oh look, I sit in the corner, suck my thumb, I'm okay.
10011021	10016223	I love this because it's like you get shot, you bleed out while moving around, or you're downed.
10016783	10019564	And I love games because it has a medic system, that's simply it.
10022079	10027602	You're a fan of shooters, and something that caught my eye this week was some of the screens from the new Wolfenstein game.
10027882	10028743	What do you think of that?
10030003	10033085	Is that a good... Oh, was that like... Jizz in my pants.
10033385	10033725	Okay.
10033745	10036667	I wasn't going to say that, but there you go.
10036827	10038087	I think it looks like crap.
10038928	10039328	Shut up!
10039768	10043230	Okay, can you play a gag in his mouth?
10043370	10044831	Alright, well, he's playing a game.
10045751	10048953	Wolfenstein Enemy Territory was so great, and it was free, too.
10049973	10051154	What do you think of this new one?
10051194	10052815	Yeah, but that's Enemy Territory.
10053055	10053575	Shut up!
10053715	10056256	Is it going to make everybody talk Wolfenstein again or what?
10056977	10059058	It looks like an updated version of Wolfenstein.
10059118	10061599	It looks like Wolfenstein to today's standards.
10061739	10063180	Ironsight, sprinting, you know.
10063320	10066081	And then all I notice is they better keep it class-based.
10066101	10077487	They better keep it class-based and they better keep in that objective online campaign stuff that I saw in Enemy Territory where I will go to a school, go up to the principal, hit him in the balls, and then laugh.
10078741	10080862	And then go home and make yourself a sandwich.
10098928	10100489	Wolfstein 3D.
10100509	10102390	Wolfstein 3D or Wolfstein 2D?
10102890	10104290	Okay, not that old school.
10104310	10106751	Yeah, Wolfstein 3D.
10106972	10108072	Yes and no.
10108372	10115335	I do remember there being a robot, but maybe I just couldn't tell if it was Hitler because I was too stupid to know it was Hitler yet.
10115355	10116596	Plus, you know what?
10116636	10119037	He wasn't the boss in the shareware one that most people played.
10119077	10121318	You have to have the full one to see that.
10122846	10123367	Hitler, Robot
10142956	10151978	Alright, well we're going to need you to call back when that game comes out because I need to hear it from a shooter fan because I don't follow a lot of the shooters so I need to know if the game is worth crossing over for.
10152238	10154279	Alright, Deathwishing, any final thoughts before we let you go?
10156139	10157200	I still play Street Fighter 4.
10157540	10158340	It's still awesome.
10159320	10160080	It is still awesome.
10160100	10163461	Think they'll unveil any secret characters downloadable?
10163481	10166702	I think they need to get that tournament mode out quicker.
10168681	10180286	Deathwishing, we gotta let you go be careful when you threaten violence on the radio don't do it see you Deathwishing, take care buddy allegedly, bye hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10193255	10202681	Yeah, I just wanted to get your input on the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate.
10203782	10212307	I was wondering, compared to Rock Band, do you think they're kind of whoring out Guitar Hero a little bit?
10212607	10213328	Yeah, just a bit.
10214399	10225531	Yeah, they're whoring it out a lot, but at the same time, they can kind of get away with it right now because, you know, Best Buys and all these stores have sections upon sections dedicated to these games because they sell.
10226071	10228194	I'm not a big fan of the artist-based games.
10228694	10229875	I am not a big fan of them.
10229935	10232258	I don't think they need the big fanfare they're getting.
10232678	10234838	Yeah, I was thinking more or less the same thing.
10234858	10234978	I mean...
10262293	10269616	Although it's kind of a different genre altogether, you kind of saw the same thing with the Tony Hawk games.
10269896	10278739	I mean, they were releasing iteration after iteration with that series, and basically look what happened to that series.
10278759	10282860	You know, people kind of gave up on that series in favor of skates.
10283180	10291223	I mean, you know, you can almost draw a few parallels between the Tony Hawk series and your Dark Hero almost.
10292833	10293813	I will say this, though.
10294033	10298194	I think Rock Band 2 has really succeeded with the store.
10298634	10301095	I think it's succeeded in a place where Guitar Hero hasn't.
10301135	10310077	Granted, Guitar Hero has released a lot of downloadable content and songs, but the place where Rock Band 2 has got them is that they've done it consistently.
10310457	10313557	They've consistently put out a lot of songs on their store.
10314338	10320219	Very few games can I say that six months after release, I'm still playing it at least once a week.
10320339	10321419	Very few games can I say that.
10323211	10323892	Yeah, yeah.
10324152	10332938	In fact, I'm checking the rock band store constantly, and to some degree, I even do the same with Guitar Hero.
10333639	10350872	And occasionally, I do see some songs at the Guitar Hero store that I do like, like Black Melon's No Rain and whatnot, but compared to rock bands, Guitar Hero really doesn't have a whole lot of
10351348	10355029	that I would consider going out and getting compared to Rockbean, you know?
10356250	10361272	But then again, that's just me.
10361512	10367434	At least in my opinion, it seems like Rockbean has a better selection of music, though.
10368764	10390513	I think rock band's got the better music too, but I do understand that Guitar Hero has to lean towards more guitar-driven songs, and sometimes, you know, that might not necessarily be the same stuff I listen to, but I like rock band because you do more band-based songs, you know, and some have guitar solos, but some have drum solos, some have vocal, like Don't Stop Believin', not a song really notable for its good, well, it does have a pretty bitchin' guitar solo.
10391013	10393735	And it's really fucking hard on Rock Band Expert, by the way.
10393815	10395776	I can't do that do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do part.
10396176	10399298	But, like, most people don't stop believing for the vocals.
10399898	10402820	You know, you don't really get songs like that in Rock Band.
10403220	10405141	I mean, in Guitar Hero.
10408123	10416668	Yeah, now, with me, one thing I noticed is, well, kind of like you, I can't really do the expert level stuff yet.
10416928	10419169	I'm still just getting started on the
10419602	10423584	The medium level, because I'm kind of new to the whole music-y thing.
10424225	10447579	But, you know, at least with Guitar Hero, since they're more or less emulating rock band sets, you know, you would think that even though the name is Guitar Hero, they would encompass some other varieties of music, you know, guitar-heavy stuff, you know?
10449116	10450718	Yeah, I don't know, though.
10450758	10461951	Guitar Hero just... Guitar Hero feels like a bit of a scattered mess right now, and I hope if they're going to do another big Guitar Hero, what, five this year as their big game, I hope they find some focus.
10462332	10464694	But Spaznir, we've got to let you go because we're running out of time.
10464715	10466857	We want to end tonight so we can get to our afterbirth and so on.
10466877	10469080	Do you have any quick final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
10470504	10498523	uh, yeah, Final Fantasy, you know, Eleven Rules, Wild Sox, no, just kidding, just kidding, yeah, yeah, alright, get off the show, alright, see you Spazinator, thanks for the call, alright, have a good one, alright, bye, uh, by the way, I didn't mention during my gaming week this week, um, I actually went back to, um, World of Warcraft this week, because I'm a big fat addict, but I haven't been playing that much, look, we got one more call coming in, I want to take it, because I noticed it was a name I haven't heard from in a while, I want to let him on the show, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10499252	10500512	It's Brad from PodCulture.
10527572	10528213	I believe so, yeah.
10528233	10529494	Alright, then I'm going to have to go check that out.
10529514	10532378	Well, look, I know you didn't call to talk about Dollhouse, although you probably would anyway.
10532798	10534460	What did you call in to talk about tonight, Brad?
10535781	10545532	Actually, I don't know if you'd mentioned it on the show before, but I've got an iPhone game that is just great.
10545732	10546273	Hmm, what's that?
10547116	10548676	It's Zombieville, USA.
10549617	10550897	I'm interested already.
10550997	10552298	What's in Zombieville, USA?
10552858	10558019	It's just this little side-scroller cartoony shooting zombies game.
10558499	10561940	Three simple controls, right, left, and you tap in the middle and you shoot.
10562400	10563261	Is it a bloody game?
10563281	10565201	Do you get decapitated zombies and all that fun stuff?
10566222	10567402	You do, but it's kind of cartoony.
10568617	10570138	I can deal with cartoon violence.
10570598	10571538	I don't like blood orgy.
10571578	10573439	We already had the blood orgy discussion earlier in the show.
10573479	10575720	Cartoony violence, especially with zombies, is okay.
10576360	10576981	Oh, it's great.
10577741	10584364	It's pretty much the same level over and over, but at the NH level, you can find cash, you upgrade your weapons.
10585284	10586424	Is there a cost with said game?
10587505	10588585	It's like two or three bucks.
10588825	10589426	That's not that bad.
10589606	10592707	Is there a demo or a movie or anything I can see online to get a taste for it?
10594665	10596106	I'm not 100% certain.
10596126	10596967	You're not the developer.
10596987	10598088	I shouldn't grill you on this stuff.
10598188	10600450	I'm just curious how you found it.
10600470	10600870	There you go.
10602191	10605173	Check that out if you're interested in some zombie killing.
10605714	10610618	It's good to hear about some good iPhone games, especially when we're talking about all the crap that's out there on the marketplace as well.
10612199	10615382	It's a good way to waste a lot of time.
10615951	10621496	Yes, I've wasted a lot of time with some of those games like WordFu and some of those iPhone games they have.
10621956	10625579	Great time wasters, especially when I'm lying in bed but I don't want to go to sleep just yet.
10625800	10629623	I'll reach over and grab my phone and play a couple games and it'll make me tired.
10630824	10632265	Brad, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up.
10632285	10633486	Any quick final thoughts for our listeners?
10634327	10634747	Later on.
10635488	10636028	Any final thoughts?
10637990	10638691	Nope.
10639071	10640772	We'll take care and have a good one, buddy.
10642389	10642649	PodCulture
10673926	10677909	Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Design Lessons Learned From Rock Band
10694159	10714879	It's interesting though because he then released a PDF version or they released a PDF version of the session and all the slides are on there and it had an earlier version of the slide that had been omitted from the actual show and it reveals Lego Rock Band.
10716601	10717342	I heard about this.
10718618	10722801	I think Tigerclaw sent me a link to this, and I neglected to get to it in the Twitter part, but okay.
10723321	10724242	But it's interesting, though.
10724262	10729765	They're also mentioning that the PSP rock band is on there as well, the Beatles rock band.
10730526	10734549	Then there's a ton of Guitar Hero stuff, which really horned that stuff out.
10735709	10743174	But they have Guitar Hero Modern Hits, Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits, Guitar Hero Arcade,
10745996	10749638	Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero Band Hero Guitar Hero Mobile 2 and Mystery Game
10772287	10780089	I don't know, it's not exactly the way they go, but the way I look at it, it's a way to introduce Rock Band to younger kids, and you don't have to buy it.
10780469	10786811	It's not like it's going to have songs in there that you're really probably going to need to buy, just that are only going to be available in LEGO Rock Band.
10788732	10791913	Whereas the Guitar Hero games, you can't port that shit over.
10791973	10798375	If you buy Metallica, well, those Metallica songs are stuck on Metallica Games, so you can't really bring that over.
10799284	10823986	which I think is where the developers kind of differ the most you know that's why I kind of respect Rock Band a little bit more because at least if you're going to put out you know a song or and they do do their track packs obviously though those are also optional since they're all available online it's an option you don't have to buy it but if you do buy it you can import it into your game and it all seamlessly works whereas Guitar Hero I gotta have a stack of discs
10826155	10826455	That's it.
10827175	10828536	Oh, that's it for that story, at least.
10830097	10837360	We also talked a little bit about Unreal Tournament 3 and how they had a mod for that to play in another video game, like Sonic the Hedgehog.
10837460	10843103	Well, Team Fortress 2, someone's made a map that's sort of like a Mario Kart track, which is kind of neat.
10843363	10846304	But, I mean, it's definitely not based on a real Mario Kart track.
10846364	10847725	It just kind of has the graphics of it.
10848245	10850546	So that's kind of neat.
10851146	10852627	And then, let's see here.
10855225	10859869	There was another website, I guess, WeOperaSDK.com.
10860230	10873061	They've released a tweeter, which is a Wii rapid blogging... I don't know if it's... I'm assuming it's like Twitter, but it's their own website that's formatted for the Wii.
10874462	10874682	Neat.
10876184	10878266	Could have been that DSi message board, right?
10879086	10879507	Could have been.
10880189	10884834	And yeah, I guess they're going to have different things that they've incorporated to this.
10885575	10896165	IRC style commands, smileys, possible integration with the WeMessage board, I guess email updates or something like that, web skinning, that sort of stuff.
10896806	10897246	That's neat.
10899508	10899909	That's it.
10902305	10906227	Alright, well we need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up the show tonight.
10906268	10911911	DarkSakura, you've been awfully quiet over there in the corner, poking away, talking to some of our AIM listeners and so on.
10912271	10913272	Any final thoughts tonight?
10914533	10914913	Yawn?
10914953	10915493	Nap?
10916774	10917654	I don't think you're going to nap.
10917694	10919836	If you go and lie down, you're going to go to sleep.
10920623	10921423	I'm pretty tired.
10921984	10923645	We spent three and a half hours in Ikea.
10924185	10924785	Oh my god.
10924845	10926966	We went to eat and the intention was to spend two.
10927487	10931689	And then we ran into some people that Becky knew because I went with Becky.
10932549	10934410	And I sort of know one of them.
10934891	10937152	But Swedish meatballs.
10937912	10938372	And shiny.
10938532	10939233	And Swedish meatballs.
10939473	10940193	Well, that's what I had.
10940774	10941514	And there was shiny.
10941554	10942575	There was so much shiny.
10942635	10943775	I kept going, ooh, shiny.
10944115	10944676	Ooh, shiny.
10944856	10946176	And then staring at stuff.
10946196	10947877	So Ikea, evil.
10948838	10949078	All right.
10950730	10958336	TheDokta, thank you so much for being here tonight and you definitely joined in on the conversation and we always appreciate having you here on the show.
10958376	10959097	Please come back again.
10959858	10961979	And thanks for participating in tonight's listless and all that fun stuff.
10962180	10963661	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10964862	10965983	In honor of Rice Princess.
10966663	10967024	Poop.
10968339	10969160	Why is she here tonight?
10969640	10970020	Shame on her.
10970080	10970340	I don't know.
10970380	10971881	She didn't get my text.
10971981	10972882	I didn't get your text either.
10972922	10974563	I think you need to check your cell phone company.
10974883	10975944	You need to call them and yell at them.
10977164	10980426	My final thought is I need food.
10980526	10981407	I'm very hungry.
10981547	10983628	I'm dying of hunger pains.
10984569	10985309	Loki, your final thought.
10986610	10986990	I don't know.
10987010	10988731	I don't have anything.
10988871	10989632	Boy, aren't you boring.
10990194	10990875	Yes, I am.
10991175	10991936	How was Ninja Blade?
10991956	10993957	You've been playing that for like three hours now during the show.
10994117	10998581	It's frustrating because you die pretty easy in it, so it's hard.
10998942	11000643	And I'm playing on normal difficulty in it.
11001344	11014495	The thing is, as you probably saw, there was a glitch, a level ending glitch where I couldn't defeat the boss because he ran out of life and I just sat there slashing at the dead corpse and it wouldn't trigger the event that I needed it to trigger.
11015055	11016336	So I had to restart there, but...
11018362	11019705	Okay, it's alright.
11020106	11020527	It's neat.
11020627	11025378	They've got a lot of really over-the-top stuff going on, but it's a neat game.
11026120	11026942	I'll probably finish it.
11028662	11029002	Okay.
11030242	11030482	All right.
11030602	11033063	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

11058248	11060189	Well, I laughed a lot tonight too, so thank you.
