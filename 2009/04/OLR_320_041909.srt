00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Today, April 19th, 2009, a new PSP game is set to be released with no UMDs.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,320
Karaoke Revolution looks to be getting a reboot, but what is the hidden bonus feature in the

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,760
PC version of Braid?

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,280
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Radio.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,480
Yes, we are back, and here to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,680
gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,960
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining you every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
Not with us tonight, unfortunately, is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,120
It's her birthday today, and she's celebrating her birthday at Disneyland, because you know

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,440
they have that whole get in free for your birthday thing going on.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
Joining us, though, of course, as always, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Hello.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
How you doing, Loki?

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Good.

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
All right.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,120
Before anybody asks, yes, we have a new video card, okay?

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,360
We're taking care of it.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,800
Old video card, yes.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,580
We'll talk about it a little more during the housekeeping segment tonight, but we're excited

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,840
here because in studio right now, we're playing the Final Fantasy 13 demo, and actually streaming

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
it on Justin TV.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
And yes, I know we're not the first to do it.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
You know, I feel like there's some people out there, like, that were in the main all

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,520
games chat room earlier doing the whole, Samsons did it, thing.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
You know what I mean?

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Okay, we get it.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
But, like, you know what?

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,480
You know, and this may not be as big for you guys, but for me, like, it's one thing to

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,980
watch it on YouTube and watch somebody else play it on Justin TV, but to, like, actually

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,080
see it on my little TV here in the garage is, like, wow.

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Wow, that looks nice.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Wow.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,200
Because, like, you know, it's not pixelated at all or anything like that, so it's pretty

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
nice.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
So if you haven't seen it at all for whatever reason yet, you can check out our Justin TV

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,440
channel while we're live.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,020
If you are listening on podcast, hopefully there's some archived footage over there on

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,880
Justin TV that you can look at.

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,320
So, Loki, tell us about a little bit how you got this demo and how you ordered it and all

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
that, and why you did it.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,120
I just imported the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, the Final Fantasy XIII

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,720
trial version, and I did it because, one, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII, and honestly,

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
this is probably the only way I could play it for, you know, a year until it comes out.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,720
You know, I'm assuming spring 2010 for us.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,280
And also, because I like Advent Children a lot, and I wanted to see the movie, you know,

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,480
all high def with, you know, extra scenes, so it's a win-win.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,680
And because, you know, PlayStation 3 games are region-free, and because the Blu-ray movie

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,360
is the same region for both- You know, it just wouldn't be OLR without

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
tech problems.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Sorry.

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah.

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,920
So it's the same region, you know, for Japan and US, you know, why not?

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,120
And plus, the movie itself actually has the English dub track in it, so...

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,440
It works.

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
And it's pretty awesome.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,720
I actually watched more of the movie than I have played of the demo, so I've only played

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
about 10 minutes of the demo right now.

60
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
And so far?

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
So far.

62
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
You like it?

63
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Yeah, it's gonna be good.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,080
I mean, it's got a lot in common with Final Fantasy VII.

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,600
Starts off with the train, sort of futuristic, you know, there's, you know, a lot of battle

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
stuff going on.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160
I don't know, it just feels very VII-ish.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,960
But which, well, which Final Fantasy game have they been able to hoard unlike any other?

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
VII.

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Exactly.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Yeah, and they're gonna hoard this like crazy.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,960
But you know what though, it's without a doubt gonna be the best RPG that's ever gonna grace

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,320
the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,000
That's, without a doubt, it's gonna be the one that's gonna be on these systems.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,720
Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the PS3, I can guarantee it.

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Huh.

77
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
Well, it'll probably be on, I mean, because they're gonna hoard, you know, XIII out for

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
a while.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
They've got like three, two versions.

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
With Versus and everything?

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
There's still Versus, and then all the other ones they're gonna put out.

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,520
XIV probably won't be out for a long time, and by that time there'll be probably a new

83
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
system.

84
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
XIII won't be another MMO.

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Like XI was.

86
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,520
No, I don't think it'll be part of the series if that's the case.

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Who knows?

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Speculate, speculate, speculate.

89
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
But we gotta get XIII out first.

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,160
It's been years in the making, but I'll tell you what, just from the little bits and pieces

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm seeing.

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,960
And this is old, I mean, this footage, or the game itself, this is all back from December

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,260
2008, is, you know, how far along it was.

94
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,520
So now, it's not even gonna resemble this by the time, it was kinda like, you know,

95
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,600
the VIII demo, you know, because the VIII demo came out way early, and then, you know,

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
VIII came out, and it was, you know, quite a bit different, so.

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,760
Well, Loki's gonna do his best to kinda go back and forth from actually playing the demo

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
to doing what he needs to do on the show.

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,480
It's gonna be very difficult tonight, because Dark Sakura's not here, so it's just Loki

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,240
and I here to cover the news tonight, but he'll play the game as much as he can.

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,960
But if we have stragglers come into the Justin TV room that aren't really familiar with this

102
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,480
show, if our regular listeners would help them understand.

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,720
Yeah, haven't figured out what we wanna do with audio, if we wanna do half Final Fantasy

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,040
13, half us talking, you know, because we can only, you know, do one channel at a time,

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
or whatever.

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Probably half and half is good.

107
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Half and half?

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Half and half is good.

109
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Alright.

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Alright.

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
And then...

112
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Yeah, I mean, that's it.

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,680
I mean, the movie itself looks awesome, and the HD, oh, it's sweet.

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, what else has been going on in your gaming week, Loki?

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
What other stuff have you been playing?

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,560
I finished Grand Theft Auto Lost in the Damned.

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,680
I was playing that online a bit.

118
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,760
There's actually a lot of people cheating out there, you know, apparently I'm not the

119
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,100
only one that knows how to modify the 360 version, and a lot of people just don't seem

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,280
to care about being very obvious with it, so whatever, you know, that's fine.

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,240
And then, I've been playing, I'm trying to think of what else I was playing here.

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,920
I tried, what was it, I downloaded the demo for Outrun, but I haven't gotten a chance

123
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,720
to play that yet.

124
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,200
I was actually looking at some of the, like, XNA games that they had on there, the community

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,960
stuff, and there was not a lot that I'm interested in, but there's a few that I was gonna try.

126
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,480
I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet.

127
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:06,240
I did on the DS, I tried giving Bob's game another try, and no, it still sucks really

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
bad.

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,040
In fact, it sucks even more than the last time I played it, and it's just so poorly

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
put together.

131
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
That's it.

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,080
And I tried a little bit of, what was it, Trackmania DS, and that was fun.

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,000
And you know, last week we played Muramasa, the DM Blade.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,040
You know, that game actually, I'm thinking I'm not gonna pick it up, you know, when it

135
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,640
comes out in the US.

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,200
It's just not, I don't know, it, not quite how I pictured it.

137
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Wasn't that what we were looking at last week at the board show?

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
Yeah, but it was the Japanese one.

139
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,120
I mean, usually I'll pick it up when they come over here.

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,200
But you know, not really, it looks good, but it's just not something I can see myself putting

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,280
a lot of time into.

142
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,160
Then I'm trying to think of what else I played.

143
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
That's pretty much it right now.

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
I have just a lot of stuff.

145
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,440
I got into the Fat Princess Beta, which if we have time, I may show some of that.

146
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I don't even know if that plays offline or not.

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,120
I haven't got a chance to play it yet, just downloaded it.

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,600
And then, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it for right now for games.

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
It's just been busy.

150
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Alright, sounds good.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,960
Why don't you unpause the demo and let the folks see a little more of it while we're

152
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
gonna hook up the audio again.

153
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Okay, sounds good.

154
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,240
And I'm gonna talk a little bit about my gaming week and we're gonna do something a little

155
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,400
different tonight because it's just Loki and I, just the two of us, us two here holding

156
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
down the fort.

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,760
We're actually gonna do something different tonight.

158
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
We're gonna let our Skype line be open all night long.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,480
Usually we only will take Skype calls at the end of the show, but tonight you guys are

160
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,640
truly in the passenger seat.

161
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,640
You will be able to call in and if you wanna, you know, the nice thing about this is that,

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,760
you know, I guess one thing we can say we do differently is that if you wanna call in

163
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,280
and see Loki do something in the demo, you can actually call in and he'll do whatever

164
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I guess you wanna do.

165
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Like if there's a menu you wanna look at or what have you.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,960
I don't know, for what it's worth.

167
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
But also we want you guys to participate in the show tonight.

168
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,880
So we're gonna actually invite a listener to call in and tell us how your gaming week

169
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
was.

170
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,800
So I put the number there in chat, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

171
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,080
In the meantime, my gaming week, actually not totally eventful.

172
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
I'm still on my Wii Fit plan.

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,760
It's been two weeks since I started actually taking Wii Fit seriously and I'm trying to

174
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,680
get in as much of it as I can every day.

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,880
I did go through like a two or three day streak where I didn't play, you know, at all just

176
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
cause I had other stuff going on.

177
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,080
But I've been trying to get in a good 15, 30, one day I got like 45 minutes in on Wii

178
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Fit.

179
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,140
So I'm gonna keep trying to do that on Wii Fit and hopefully get to my goal weight of

180
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
losing I think like four pounds or so.

181
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,280
But in the meantime, I lost a whole pound in the past two weeks on Wii Fit.

182
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Woo hoo!

183
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
And a little DDR.

184
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,980
Also, I played a little bit of World of Warcraft and checked out the new patch.

185
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,480
I'll tell you more about that in just a minute.

186
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
But we got a call on the line.

187
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

188
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Who's this?

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
This is Leo Shen.

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Hey, Leo Shen.

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,600
How you doing, Leo Shen?

192
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm doing fine yourself.

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Good!

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Now this is, I believe this may be the first time in OLR history where we have invited

195
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
this open to the listeners to tell us about your gaming week.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
So Leo Shen, be the first listener and tell us what kind of games you've been playing

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
this week.

198
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Well, I played a little bit of Arcana Heart 2.

199
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,640
I tried to give it another shot on the PS2.

200
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,120
It's a piece of shit.

201
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,520
Now Arcana Heart, is that the all chick fighting game?

202
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,720
That's the all girl fighting game.

203
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
Now I remember, I think you were in chat last week during the Bork show and you were telling

204
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,400
people that this game was shit and you were not a big fan of it.

205
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
I seem to remember the first one had such a big cult following.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,320
Why is this one not as good as the first one?

207
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,920
It's got major slowdown and it was a pretty bad port.

208
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,260
Really?

209
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,560
It's a port of an arcade version?

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
Yes, it is.

211
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Interesting.

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Hmm.

213
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
So it's just a bad port.

214
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
What is it?

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Pixelated?

216
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Does it run crappy?

217
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Is it just not fun?

218
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,880
If you can put your finger on what it is, what is it?

219
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,040
Um, let's see, whenever, okay, all the old characters are fine, but when you try to use

220
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,840
the new characters, their frame rate slows down majorly and it pretty much makes the

221
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,720
game, like, you can play it, but it's just not fun waiting for it.

222
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Hmm.

223
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm looking in chat and the hitstun agrees with you.

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
The PlayStation 2 port of Arcana Heart 2 is awful.

225
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
No, I guess that means there's probably not going to be an Arcana Heart 3.

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,120
If it was in the arcade and on PS3, maybe.

227
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Maybe.

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
Anything else you've been playing this week?

229
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,160
Actually, I've been playing a lot of Street Fighter IV because I just received my tournament

230
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,280
edition Mad Cat stick.

231
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,920
How does it play with the new stick?

232
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
It plays amazing with the stick.

233
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Nice.

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,680
How much of an investment was that for you?

235
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:00,840
Well, I play a lot of fighters and I'm thinking that this could serve me well in BlazBlue,

236
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,000
King of Fighters XII, and Tekken 6, so I picked it up.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Very cool.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,520
Wow, so you're very busy with fighting games.

239
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,960
Is that like your primary genre of games you enjoy?

240
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, um, not a, I play all sorts.

241
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,760
Personally I've been playing a lot of Eroge, which is Japanese pornography games, so they're

242
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
fun.

243
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Nice.

244
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Sounds like fun.

245
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Are you a role-playing game fan?

246
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
Are you excited about Final Fantasy XIII?

247
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
No.

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
No.

249
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,360
Alright, well then, I guess I'm not going to ask you about the, wait, but you did like

250
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Lost Odyssey?

251
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm liking Lost Odyssey a lot.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, it's Final Fantasy-ish, but, you know, Final Fantasy is not for everyone.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't like Final Fantasy at all.

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Alright.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's fair.

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's fair.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Alright, well we're going to let you go so we can finish up our gaming weeks and get

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
into the news.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But have a good one, buddy.

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thanks for calling.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No problem.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You too.

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Alright.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Enjoy those fighting games.

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,880
And now, I'm actually, I'm a little bit distracted by this Final Fantasy XIII demo, so what is

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
this?

267
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
This is that one new character that was announced.

268
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,680
Yeah, and he has a chocobo that lives in his afro.

269
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,640
The little chocobo that lives in the dude's afro and he just kind of like let it go.

270
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,120
But I'm looking, I'm watching this, it's like, this is all like the in-game engine, isn't

271
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
it?

272
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah.

273
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Oh my gosh.

274
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Wow.

275
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
That looks nice.

276
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Alright, well we're going to let you go then, so why not?

277
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
We'll take this call.

278
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

279
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Who's this?

280
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
It's GS68.

281
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Hey, GS68.

282
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
How you doing?

283
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm okay.

284
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Uh, what's on your mind?

285
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
How was your gaming week?

286
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
My gaming was alright.

287
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:46,580
I played Star Soldier R and um, the

288
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:53,580
game was pretty good, so I played a little bit of Para Para Paradise, which is kind of

289
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,580
like a mix.

290
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Wow, so you've had a pretty busy week.

291
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
So even after all these years, you're still playing Para Para Paradise.

292
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Um, yeah, whenever I get a Milpitas golf plan.

293
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,620
Like on Friday, I had a male friend and a female friend with me and they encouraged me

294
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,900
to play, so I played around.

295
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,660
Why do you think that series ended up dying?

296
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,460
For those who don't know, Para Para Paradise, I guess you could say it's like DDR with your

297
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,860
hands for those who don't know.

298
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Yeah, basically.

299
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,780
But there's this whole like, it's that mixed with country line dancing, except it's not

300
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,580
country, it's techno music.

301
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,740
Like that's the best way I can explain Para Para to those who have no idea what it is.

302
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Yeah, one thing is, especially, two things I really like about why like it's easier to

303
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,500
maintain the machines because instead of stepping on pads, you just move your hand center sensors

304
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,980
so you're not wearing out the sensors.

305
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,980
And then also it, not only is it easier to freestyle, but the game actually encourages

306
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,240
you to freestyle.

307
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,740
We had a guy locally used to play Para Para Paradise, so it was very good at the freestyle

308
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,580
but he didn't do like the Para girl type moves.

309
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,820
He did this weird rave dancing thing.

310
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,640
Do you remember that guy with the little hat and everything?

311
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
He was really good at that stuff.

312
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
He would do breakdancing stuff.

313
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,380
Yeah, he'd do like breakdancing to Para Para Paradise.

314
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,540
I'm like, that's Para freestyle to me, you know, like, it was pretty cool.

315
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,220
Because you know, I think Para kind of got teased a little bit over here because it's

316
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,780
such a girl game or what have you, but you know, it's fun.

317
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Fuck it.

318
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,300
I remember myself as more manly for playing that game.

319
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,420
I mean, because, you know, most men would not bother with that game.

320
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,860
That's just interesting, the cultural differences from there to here, so.

321
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Alright.

322
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
I know, well.

323
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,420
Well, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

324
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,740
Yeah, I gave, yeah, I got Bear, I played the Bear Knuckle 3, the Japanese version of Street

325
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Jump Rage 3 with the English patch, so it was much more comprehensive, and I actually

326
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,060
get to play on the real normal difficulty instead of the American normal that's really

327
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,540
Japanese hard BS.

328
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Hmm.

329
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,100
So, so, wait, then Japanese normal is like easy mode.

330
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,340
Yeah, there are a lot of changes to the American version, like, all the difficulties got bumped

331
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,380
up by one, for example, on the US version, easy is the equivalent of normal on Japanese

332
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,900
version, and what really sucks about it is that if you play on easy on the US version,

333
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,660
the game ends on stage 5 with a bad ending, which I think is retarded.

334
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,220
Alright, well, excuse me, I just coughed, sorry to hear about the bad, ahh, sorry to

335
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,060
hear about the bad ending, my god, if not, if it's not the computer breaking, it's me

336
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,100
breaking here at OLR, alright, sorry, anyway, sorry to hear about the bad ending of the

337
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,900
game, we're going to get back to our gaming weeks, but thanks for the call, buddy, have

338
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
a good one.

339
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Alright.

340
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,860
And keep dancing the Para Para no matter what anyone else says.

341
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Alright.

342
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Alright.

343
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
Bye.

344
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,700
Alright, we're going to close off the Skyblind for just a little bit so I can finish my gaming

345
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
week.

346
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,780
World of Warcraft got a new patch this week, the 3.1 patch, which I checked out and played

347
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,940
with a little bit, there's a couple new upgrades in this, one of the new upgrades is Uldular,

348
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,820
which is a new endgame raid that they have in the game, which, you know, is really for

349
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,620
the high end players that have finished Karazhan, finished Eye of Eternity, which actually is

350
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,860
me, I would fit into that category, but since I was gone for so long, I haven't really been

351
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,500
in the group of players to go in there yet, also, they like to raid on like Friday and

352
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,940
Saturday nights, so I'm like, dude, those are the two nights I don't want to raid, those

353
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,900
are the nights I want to go out and have fun, because it's Friday and Saturday nights, it's

354
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
the weekend.

355
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,220
So, yeah, I just really haven't gotten around to raiding the new content yet, but I did

356
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,300
check out some of the other new features they have, such as the Argent Tournament is one

357
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,500
of the new things they have, which is basically like a joust-like game, a jousting-like game,

358
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,640
I shouldn't say joust-like game because I didn't think of the old Atari 2600, but a

359
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,820
jousting-like minigame that they've put into WoW, which is decent, but it's very buggy

360
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,140
right now, and it's having a lot of lag and bug issues, and some of the WoW and Blizzard

361
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,020
folks have been taking a lot of heat from the fans for not testing this patch thoroughly

362
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,260
enough because they're having a lot of problems on the main server.

363
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,060
People have been getting stranded in the Ulduar dungeons where they've been locked out of

364
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,820
their characters, you know, people have been having problems, I was having problems today

365
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,780
with the jousting in Argon Tournament, you're supposed to do like, you want to collect five

366
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,060
emblems every day, and that's the most you can collect, and then you can advance quicker

367
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,820
through the levels, so I'm trying to collect my five every day, and while I was trying

368
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,660
to do my fights to get one of the emblems, the game was just, like, I was losing when

369
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,100
it was halfway through the fight, so it was kind of buggy, so that was disappointing a

370
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,440
little bit, you know, but you kind of cut your losses in that way, Blizzard's pretty

371
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,160
good about compensating people for time, they already comped everybody a free day because

372
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,380
patch day was so borked in, you know, everything that was going on, so, you know, this is just

373
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,700
kind of par for the course with MMOs, but damn, you have your rabid fans who just get

374
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,020
pissed every time they roll out some new patch and something's broken, they're like, I can't

375
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,340
believe these people, blah blah blah blah, it's just kind of like, jeez, you know, go

376
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,020
outside then, it's gonna bother you that much, so, so you've been playing the Final Fantasy

377
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,580
XIII demo, I've been talking to some people, and I'm just still impressed how the, this

378
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,900
is all kind of the in-game engine, looking at this, but I haven't gotten to see a lot

379
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,220
of battles, but how is the battle system? It's pretty cool, basically, so like, there's

380
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,620
a battle system, it's transitioned into this, you have a little bar that's like your AP

381
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,660
bar or whatever, and you can pick attacks and they have different, like, you know, lengths,

382
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,740
so this one attack will do, you know, one, I can do three normal attacks, and it'll do

383
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:13,900
just kind of like a little hack and slash thing, or, for example, I can do, uh, Viagra,

384
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,420
which will do all three, and then that attacks everything.

385
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,620
Huh, now how do you, how do you know, how are you understanding the Japanese in this?

386
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,700
You don't know Japanese, do you? No, it's just trial and error.

387
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,020
Trial and error, I guess that works. Yeah, especially if you're trying to find

388
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,780
a cure spell, it's like, uh, where is that? I'm like, uh, maybe it's this menu. One of

389
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,260
these other menus, I think it's, if I remember correctly, I think that's attack, skill, and

390
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,580
I think that's, uh, white magic, maybe. You can probably guess it's very similar to

391
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,540
the layout of most other Final Fantasy games, too, like your top command's always gonna

392
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,600
be attack. Yeah, I mean, you can just do, like, three

393
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,780
different things. See, I don't even know what I just did there, but.

394
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,340
So it's interesting, because having played a lot of Final Fantasy XII, I'm, I'm kind

395
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,260
of, it looks like, in a way, they've taken a step back to not even XI, because XI was

396
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,580
so different, but X, this is more like Final Fantasy X's battles, but with a little bit

397
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
of that. Um, no, I think it's supposed to be, like,

398
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,180
XII, because you can actually avoid battles, you just have to, you know, not walk into

399
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,820
the creature. So it's kind of a hybrid of X and XII.

400
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,660
Something like that, I guess. Strange. Very strange.

401
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,860
Hmm. All right, well, if you want to join us and

402
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,980
chat with us, chat.orangelaungerated.com is the place to be, we'll be reading comments

403
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,580
from chat all night, we'll also have the phone lines open.

404
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,800
I am trying to keep a little eye on the JustinTV chat, but I'm not always the best at balancing

405
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,880
two chat rooms, especially when we're down a host tonight, we're all very, very busy

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,980
in multitasking right now here in studio. But we will do our best to try and get through

407
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,900
the show tonight, let's start to get into some gaming news, but first I want to talk

408
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,900
about some housekeeping tonight. Obviously last week's show was very borked,

409
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,040
if you were here for it, we had a video card die in the middle of the show. We did get

410
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,340
back up and running, we had to make some small changes, we're not on a widescreen monitor,

411
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,760
which I'm hating because I got so used to the real estate screen space on a widescreen

412
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,140
monitor, but that's all right, I'm dealing, it's better than nothing, it's better than

413
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,980
last week. And we have a recycled video card plugged

414
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,140
in the computer, which apparently Loki was using as a doorstop.

415
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Well, the computer was a doorstop, yes. The video card is just sitting there.

416
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,620
That's hilarious. But hey, now we're getting some use out of it. But this is what I wanted

417
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,580
to say, it has come to my attention that the listeners, a lot of the people that were listening

418
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,500
last night, or not last night, last week, actually ended up taking up a collection because

419
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,860
of, and I don't know if it was inspired by my frustrations and venting that was going

420
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,220
on that night with all the problems and what have you, or what it was, but regardless,

421
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,100
the listeners took up a collection, they collected something like, I'm not even kidding, $250,

422
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,020
$280 I think they got, almost $300, they've bought us a new studio computer, some type

423
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,820
of refurbished thing I think they got on Newegg, they've got us a new studio computer that's

424
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340
on its way. Well, that's awfully nice.

425
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,820
I know, I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.

426
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,660
It's not a Mac. No, it's not a Mac, it's not a Mac. I'm like,

427
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,580
guys, you didn't have to do that, we just needed the video card, we're fine. But at

428
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,060
the same time, now that we know there's a third one coming, we're kind of like, okay,

429
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,740
well, come to think of it, there is a lot we could do with a third computer. We could

430
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,980
probably, we could have one in the house, so we could stream more from the TV in there,

431
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,860
we could have a satellite computer at Dark Sacras for nights that we want to broadcast

432
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,340
from her house, there's things we can do with it.

433
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,120
Or Loki can tear it apart, I don't know. No, I'm not going to tear it apart, I'm just,

434
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,380
it might come in handy with Skype later on. Oh, okay, okay, sure, sure, yeah. We can do

435
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,740
some fancy things with Skype. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, yeah.

436
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,540
Sounds good, sounds good. I'm liking this idea. Alright. So, great. And actually, Brad

437
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,300
from Pod Culture in the chat room is clarifying, it's a lot of new parts as well, it's all

438
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,700
new parts. And all the chatters are being very nice. ActDef says we didn't have to,

439
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,700
but we wanted to. You guys are very, very nice. I mean, I'm almost at a loss for words,

440
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,420
like when I read about it. You know, my reaction is just like, guys, you really don't, I mean,

441
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,100
we kind of pride ourselves on the fact that we've done this for seven years and really

442
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,220
not made a lot of money off of it. I mean, you know, thanks to-

443
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
I wouldn't think we've made any money off of it.

444
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,980
Thanks to, well, thanks to another very generous donation we had a couple of years ago on Christmas,

445
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,740
you might remember, we got to do some travel the next year and do some shows that we wouldn't

446
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,380
normally do. And I'll, actually, I want to say something about shows in a minute. But

447
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,420
yeah, so it's just been, just very thankful and very floored and just really shows you

448
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,380
the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio and it's just amazing and just, I'm

449
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
very thankful. So thank you.

450
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,900
They say that I'm going to fill it full of porn. That's wrong. I have a PC at home and

451
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,460
a PSP to fill full of porn. I don't need any more porn on this computer.

452
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,620
They're saying Loki will have to put it together, which is fine.

453
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
That's fine.

454
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,540
Yeah. And we, and I think there was, we're going to put the old drives in it so we don't

455
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,740
lose any of the shows and all that. So we'll figure it out.

456
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
That's fine.

457
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,500
I have to call Rama. He's been trying to get ahold of me and I just have been so busy trying

458
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,340
to get everything together. So we will have more to come.

459
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
We'll put it to good use.

460
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,700
Yes, we will. We'll find one way or another, we will definitely get good use out of that

461
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,660
machine. So very excited. All right. Let's see. What else I want to mention? Speaking

462
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,500
of travel, I am going to be attending after being requested to do so for about the past

463
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,100
three years by various listeners. It is true, which you may have heard. I am going to ASAN

464
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,420
anime central in Chicago. Not only am I going, I'm going to be doing a panel there. It's

465
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,460
called, so you think you can podcast and I'm going to take my, yes, I'm going to take my

466
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,460
seven years of podcasting experience at well radio slash podcasting experience and talk

467
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,420
about how, you know, if you are a independent gamer, independent anime fan, it's not going

468
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,900
to be just about video games, just about fandom. If you have a fandom, you want to make a podcast

469
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,940
about how do you get started? How do you find an audience? How do you do that? So I'm very

470
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,520
excited to go there. I have friends and so I might be making a cameo at the Bamani panel

471
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,100
as well, which I'm very excited about because Eddie, my buddy who runs a big, big website

472
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,620
called Bamani style.com, you may have heard of it. He is runs that panel and is hoping

473
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,520
to have me do a cameo so that I'm excited. I really want to do that. Unfortunately, dark

474
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,180
soccer and Loki not able to go now because the wife won't let Loki go and I still have

475
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,780
travel budget. You know, yeah, we're doing the E3 thing just because I'm using my tax

476
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,320
return to do it. So that's something that was paid for by anybody. I got paid for by

477
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,700
my work because our work gave us each $1500 trips, basically. So I'm using this to go

478
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:34,980
to LA and we're staying at a nice hotel, E3, and then the slum hotel in Disneyland. But

479
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,980
we're going to go do that. I have to find something for the wife to do while I'm at

480
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,700
E3 though. I was going to get her in but, you know, I thought about it and, you know,

481
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,300
even if I could get her in, which wouldn't have been, you know, exactly the most up and

482
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:55,140
up ways, she would have been bored out of her mind. Yeah, yeah. But yeah. Bobby is in

483
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,420
chat right now. Our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf does a show before us on All Games Radio.

484
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,840
I have considered going to ASEN just to crash Rob's panel. That's very sweet. That's alright

485
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,800
because I was going to go to a DragonCon and crash yours. But then I guess they have now

486
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,860
PAX and DragonCon are the same weekend or whatever. PAX is looking very likely this

487
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,620
year as well. I think we're all in the mindset of let's get past E3 first, then we'll talk

488
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:20,980
PAX. Yeah, I'm not going to PAX. I know I definitely want to go. This will be the last

489
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,180
trip I take for a long time, unfortunately. Fair enough, fair enough. You got to do what

490
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,660
you got to do. Personal life first. Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news because

491
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,180
the Justin TVers are like, are you going to unpause the damn game or not? Sorry, I can't

492
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,500
multitask like that. I probably could. It's Orange Lounge Radio. Does it say Final Fantasy

493
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,860
13 television? No, we're just trying to do both tonight. Sorry. Alright, no that's alright.

494
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,500
So there was a rumor. Don't apologize, Logi. There was a rumor from Ars Technica that said

495
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,580
they had a source that was claiming that Patapon 2 would be a download only, that it would

496
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,700
not have a physical UMD, that it would actually be just a code basically that would come in

497
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:08,220
a case and it would be available the same day as it's available on the PSN. Now this

498
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:16,300
actually brings up a lot of bad things. One, okay we didn't know that, at least at my work,

499
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,520
until I asked about it and they're all, oh yeah, I forgot to mention that to you. Which

500
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,020
sucked. And two, because we have stores that rent PSP games, now they can't rent that.

501
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,420
So they cancel all their orders off, which honestly is not that many. But still, it's

502
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:36,220
annoying. So basically here's what you're going to get. You're going to get this case,

503
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,420
it's going to have a voucher in it. It's going to have a printed manual. And it will be $20.

504
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,500
Now if you don't give a crap about your printed manual, you can download it for $15. Honestly

505
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,300
I think $5 for a case that you're basically going to throw away in a manual is a rip off

506
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:59,260
to me. But this is something that they're trying, that they're testing out apparently.

507
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,140
I have a feeling though that this is not going to be a test. Especially if that PSP 2 rumors

508
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,900
or whatever, 4000 or whatever you're going to call it, happen to be true and there is

509
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:16,060
a no UMD port in the new upcoming system, then all of the PSP games will be like this.

510
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,680
Or at least they're going to have this option so that you can, those who may not have this

511
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,580
new system will be able to download it or be able to play it on the original system

512
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
as well.

513
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah, that sounds like a little more than a test to me. This is letting the middle man

514
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,300
down gently is I think what this is about. Don't you think? I mean this is very successful

515
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,620
which I actually don't think it's going to be. I don't think it's going to be that successful.

516
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
I don't think so either.

517
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,300
I don't think this is going to sell any more than the regular arcade title.

518
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,060
Honestly I think if they were smart they would not put it in stores and just leave it as

519
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,800
a download and that's it. Because I think they're wasting money putting it in stores

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,060
because really if you're an informed buyer, an informed consumer, you're going to realize

521
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,500
that, huh, it's $5 cheaper online. Why the hell would I pay for it in the store?

522
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,380
They've done this before with PS3 games where it's the same price online as it is in the

523
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,940
store or you get a little bit more with it. For example, Warhawk, you got a Bluetooth

524
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:19,220
headset and you got the game and some other crap. That's a little bit different. But if

525
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,420
it's just going to be the same price online versus buying in the stores, why do I even

526
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,020
bother buying it in the store?

527
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:32,140
What about, is this for grandma, mom, relative who just wanders into the game store and thinks

528
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,500
this looks like a good family-friendly title to buy the children?

529
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,360
Maybe, but at the same time it also might be for the people that had pre-orders on it.

530
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:50,300
I don't know. At the same time, this worries me in two ways. One, if it's not successful,

531
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,260
if it turns out more people decide to download it online than buy it in the store, they're

532
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,260
like, hey, look, the online download thing works just fine. Let's just do it that way

533
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
and not put it out in the store.

534
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,980
If it does really well in the store, then they're going to realize, hey, you know what?

535
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,720
We don't need a UMD in there. We can just go ahead and have it as a download title.

536
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,260
And guess what? If they buy it as a code, they can't sell it used. There are no used

537
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,860
copies. It's all new all the time.

538
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,940
If you want to comment on this, we are open all night tonight. Decipher in chat says they're

539
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,980
not really wasting money putting it into stores as it will let people who didn't know about

540
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,740
the online store find out about it and how to use it. And Cheeseburger says this could

541
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,700
be for a gift. Those are coming from our chat room, chat.orangewonsradio.com.

542
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,900
But they could easily do a gift online or something with a voucher and that kind of

543
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,340
stuff. I mean, that can be done. I don't know.

544
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,260
Grandma can't exactly go on the PlayStation store. You know what I mean? They know, oh,

545
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,300
my grandson loves video games. I'm going to go to GameStop and buy a game. Oh, this pat-a-pawn

546
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,660
looks very nice and cutesy. I'll buy this, right?

547
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
I guess, yeah.

548
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,020
But I mean, I don't know how, you know, is it going to be enough? Is there really going

549
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,600
to be enough of that to justify this whole strange way of releasing titles? I don't know.

550
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,640
It's going to be a test and I have a feeling, though, it's not going to be just a one-time

551
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,460
test despite what they said. You know, I have a feeling it's going to be something that

552
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,520
we're going to see a lot more of.

553
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,500
Because, I mean, everyone's kind of going to the online digital stuff, especially now

554
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,100
with, you know, the iPhone app store, you know, doing well by itself. I mean, they're

555
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,860
realizing they don't need to sell stuff in, you know, a traditional marketplace.

556
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,900
Wait a minute. Are you trying to blame Apple for this whole thing?

557
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:35,420
Um, part of it, I guess. But it's not even so much Apple. I mean, look at, like, you

558
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,500
know, Xbox Live Arcade or even just an old PlayStation network. You know, they've figured

559
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,820
out that you can, you know, put stuff out just digital only and it still sells pretty

560
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
well.

561
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,660
Let's go to the lines. We have a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

562
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Hi, this is Hack Def.

563
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,300
Hey, Hack Def. How you doing? What do you think about this? Patapon 2, digital release

564
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,980
only, but kind of $5 more if you want the case and manual in stores. What do you think?

565
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:05,060
Well, I think it's a good idea. Not necessarily in the United States, but in the whole world,

566
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,180
especially down in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

567
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,220
And for those listeners that don't listen to the show regularly, you actually are from

568
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,860
Mexico, so I'm kind of curious your perspective on this. Why?

569
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:27,020
Why? Because the PSN store in Mexico, it's barely updated on time. If we don't get all

570
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:36,140
the stuff, the U.S. gets, like, some games, demos, videos, and other stuff. So if the

571
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:48,620
Patapon 2 goes only download on the PSN, I don't know if it would get released on time,

572
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,100
but having to go to the store and having something you can use to download, it would be very

573
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
useful.

574
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,300
Loki, have you heard anything about what's going to happen outside the U.S.? Because

575
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,220
I would think, wouldn't these codes be region-locked on top of everything else?

576
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,860
They released it as a UMD in Europe. So this is only in Japan, I think they also released

577
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,100
it as a UMD. So it's only in the U.S. that they're trying this right now.

578
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:23,020
Most of the things they release in the U.S., it's brought over here, so that's why I'm

579
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,780
concerned about this.

580
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,340
Interesting. Huh. Well, I guess, I'll be kind of curious to see when this game's released.

581
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,820
Is this a game you're thinking of picking up, Acteft?

582
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:41,500
I don't have a PSP, but I tried the Patapon 1 demo on a friend's PSP, and I liked it.

583
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:49,100
And if I'm getting a PSP soon, probably will. I do want to get Patapon 2.

584
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,700
Well, if you do end up getting the PSP, or if your friend does it, I'd be kind of curious

585
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,020
how easy or difficult it is for you to do so. So you'll have to follow up with this

586
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
later.

587
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,020
Yeah.

588
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,820
And let us know how it goes. Alright, well thanks for the call, Acteft, and have a good

589
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
one.

590
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Thank you.

591
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,380
Bye bye. Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're doing a little bit different and keeping it open

592
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,220
all night tonight for your calls if you want to call in at any time and comment on what

593
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
have you.

594
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,740
Let's go ahead and move on to another story and talk a little bit about Gears of War 3.

595
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,300
God of War 3. Every time I see G-O-W, I think Gears of War. It's actually God of War 3.

596
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,980
God of War 3, I guess there was a survey going on out there, and there's going to be a God

597
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,500
of War 3 Collector's Edition, and one thing that they've actually been exploring, putting

598
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,000
into this, per a survey that went out earlier this week, that there could be re-releases

599
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,380
of God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-Ray. Kind of interesting, right? Yeah. Also, a God of War

600
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,140
and God of War 2 cinematic movie compilation, which, you know, God of War obviously had

601
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,940
some pretty epic cutscenes and some great music in it, so that would be very interesting

602
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,980
to see a type of just cinematic compilation be released. Now, granted, these are just

603
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,980
things they're exploring. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen, but it's interesting

604
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,660
that they asked about it, because that would mean that they are talking that it's feasible,

605
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,500
right? And if it's feasible to actually be able to play PlayStation 2 games and emulate

606
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,320
them on Blu-Ray, then that means that they've built an emulator that runs in software, which

607
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,620
means that they can do an update that will be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2

608
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,420
games. But why would they do that if they can resell the game, just like Nintendo does?

609
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,740
Exactly, that's true, but I think that they would want to do it as a patch so that you

610
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,220
can, you know, have it on the system so that you can download PlayStation 2 games, just

611
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,900
like you can PlayStation 1 games. I have a feeling this is where it's going to go, and

612
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,100
I have a feeling they're playing this down right now, because that's going to be an announcement

613
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,060
that they're going to make. If this ever comes to fruition, I mean, it could be just all

614
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,660
talk right now, but... Well, and if a later comment from Sony is to be believed, this

615
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:52,940
is just all talk right now. There was actually a named Sony Computer Entertainment representative

616
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,340
that said, it is simply a marketing survey. The goal of it is to do focus testing. If

617
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,620
that was the number one requested thing, that would be something they would need to see

618
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:06,420
if it was technically feasible. But that is just a thought. That is retarded. I'm sorry.

619
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,280
They would not offer something if it was completely unfeasible. They would not do that. That is

620
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,700
just backwards thinking right there. I mean, you wouldn't say, hey, how would you like

621
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,540
it if we made a Blu-ray disc that made you popcorn, or something like that. I mean, they're

622
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,180
not going to offer something if it's not a possible option, or if it's not something

623
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,420
that they're currently working on. The problem is, they probably didn't realize that this

624
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,740
survey would get out to everybody, even though a lot of this stuff always happens, and so

625
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,340
now they're playing it down, because they don't want their surprises ruined. I'm sorry,

626
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:44,320
but I have a feeling if this is on this survey, that it's going to happen. They may not offer

627
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,500
that, but it's something that they're working on, obviously.

628
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,600
Well, don't these companies usually use an outside marketing vendor to do this type of

629
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,020
crap anyway? Just to say, the outside marketing vendor didn't just pull this out of their

630
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
butt.

631
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,420
I don't think that they would do that, because they're wanting to see, okay, we're going

632
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,100
to make this box set or whatever of God of War. Here's the components that we're thinking

633
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,940
about putting in it. Let's see what people want in there, and most people are looking

634
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,660
for, so we can cut our costs and not put everything in there. We just put the stuff that people

635
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,460
are mostly interested in. That's the whole purpose of that. You wouldn't put, say, a

636
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,940
God of War full-size statue or something like that, if that was not something that you were

637
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,980
really thinking about putting into this box set or something like that. You wouldn't have

638
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,860
an option for this stuff. I'm sure people would love to play God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-ray.

639
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,420
That would be pretty awesome. But if they're never going to be able to do that, then what's

640
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,740
the point of even wasting your time as that with an option, when it'll skew all the other

641
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,860
ones that are actual legitimate options? Which leads me to believe that they actually are

642
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,420
working on this, or they have it implemented already, and it's something that's coming

643
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,860
soon, that they're just keeping tight-lipped about, because it's going to be a big thing.

644
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,380
I will let you anything. There was a rumor from last E3 that they figured out a way to

645
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,700
have downloadable PlayStation 2 games, and if they've got an emulator built, of course

646
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,660
they're going to use it, because now you can reissue all those old PlayStation 2 games,

647
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,340
because a lot of them are out of print now, and let's start making a lot more money. You

648
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,860
can sell them for 20 bucks a pop. I would be so happy if a software emulator comes out

649
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,160
for PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility, because I do have a lot of PS2 games I would

650
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,740
like to play. Granted, I do still have a working PS2, but I'm running out of shelf space, for

651
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:25,060
Christ's sake. I have a 360, a Wii, and a PS3, and a cable box. I have a lot of crap

652
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,780
in my living room. And it also would be fine right now, too, because they dropped the price

653
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,360
of the PlayStation 2, and yeah, it might cut into their PlayStation 2 system sales, but

654
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,300
really at this point, who gives a crap about their system sales? There are 44 million units

655
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,380
out there. Who cares if it cuts down? You want to catch up with the PlayStation 3, so

656
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,700
hey, now we can say, hey, we're fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 stuff, and that

657
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
would be a big thing.

658
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,460
Here's something thought-provoking from chat. Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob, Sony can

659
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,740
make their buckage by selling the PlayStation 2 emulator as a purchase in the Sony online

660
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,700
store. Oh god, don't give them ideas. Don't give them ideas, because that sounds very

661
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,060
fusible. It really does. Hitstun says they could sell the PlayStation 2 emulator for

662
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,700
a hundred dollars and people would buy it. No, I draw the line.

663
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
They wouldn't do that.

664
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,140
I would pay, I would pay twenty. I would pay probably up to twenty. More than that, I'll

665
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,780
just say, fuck it, I'll bring the PlayStation 2 in the house if there's something I really

666
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,060
want to play. But for that convenience of being able to, like, get rid of my PS2 practically,

667
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,020
I might actually pay, like, twenty bucks. Just so you know. I don't know.

668
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Alright, also Game Guru says E3 will obviously have Sony announce the end of the PlayStation

669
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,020
2. I don't think, I don't think that's necessarily true. They're still selling it.

670
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,220
They're never going to announce that.

671
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,740
I don't think they would ever come out on stage and say, and just so you know, we killed

672
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
the PlayStation 2.

673
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
They're not going to do that.

674
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
We took it out to the barn last night and put a hole in it.

675
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
They're still making money.

676
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,780
They're not, they're not ever going to do that. If the PlayStation 2 ever dies, which

677
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,700
it won't, they're still making PS1 games.

678
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
No they're not.

679
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Some people aren't. Aren't they?

680
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
No.

681
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
They're still supporting. But, like, third-party developers are still supporting.

682
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
No.

683
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Really?

684
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,620
Yeah, they saw PlayStation 1 support years ago. No, they're still making PlayStation

685
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,140
2 games. And, you know, there's, it's still doing pretty well for them.

686
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,420
Uh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Let's take a call.

687
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,140
Uh, this is Spazinator.

688
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,540
Hey, Spazinator. So PlayStation 2 games possibly coming to the PlayStation 3, would you pay

689
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
for an emulator?

690
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:25,540
Oh, yeah, definitely. Uh, as long as they don't go overly expensive with it, uh, actually

691
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:32,660
is a pretty good idea. Um, in a, in a, in a sense, you know, I agree with you, because,

692
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:39,340
you know, uh, you know, if you have multiple systems and don't tend to sell you all the

693
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:46,180
games, you know, hitting a backwards compatible system would be great. You know, less clutter,

694
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:53,940
you know, less wires, that kind of thing. And not only that, but, uh, you know, at least

695
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:00,380
with the original launch, you know, PlayStation 3, uh, you know, they were fully backwards

696
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,180
compatible with the Emulsion Engine. You can't really find those new anymore, which kind

697
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
of sucks.

698
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,140
No, I mean, you can't, you can't really find them anywhere, to be fair. I mean, when I

699
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,060
bought my PlayStation 3, I, I tried to look for a little bit for one that was backwards

700
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,260
compatible, but I just gave up. I was just like, forget it. I still have a PlayStation

701
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,780
2 I can use if I get that desperate. But I just, I want to be able to play a little

702
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,740
big planet already. You know, that was really the game that finally convinced me I needed

703
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,500
to jump on board with Sony. So.

704
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:34,140
Yeah, at least with me, I used to have, uh, the 60 gigabyte model, but as I had mentioned

705
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:41,420
before, last year, that was stolen. And, and unfortunately before, before the system was

706
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,140
stolen, I had sold my PlayStation 2, kind of thinking, well, since my system was backwards

707
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:54,500
compatible, why keep the PS2 around? Uh, now, you know, after the theft, I kind of regret

708
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:01,700
that because my new system is backwards compatible, but no, uh, but I figured, you know, if they

709
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:07,620
could do like some kind of update where they put Emily on it, you know, that'd be great.

710
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,940
You know, cause now I can go back and play all my old PlayStation 2 games over again.

711
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,900
And while I'm, uh, I have, he haven't even finished yet. So, you know, you know, I would

712
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,700
love to go back and play some of my games I haven't finished or play some of the ones

713
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,020
all over again, you know, a lot of them were classics.

714
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,140
I would love to see them kind of unlock. That would be a really sweet treat for Sony to

715
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,620
kind of give people is the fact that you could suddenly play all your PlayStation 2 games

716
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,060
again, but I don't know, the realist in me just thinks it's not happening. They're still

717
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,940
selling so many PlayStation twos. They realize that people have both. And, uh, you know,

718
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,100
Sony wants to live in this bubble. I think they, they literally think, I think there

719
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,100
are people there in the boardrooms that think, you know, w people should only have a PlayStation

720
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,460
2 and a PlayStation 3, and they can have them both. What do you, what do you mean? Xbox

721
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,940
three sixties and wheeze. Our customers aren't buying those. Don't you think that they couldn't

722
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,300
you imagine their suits and boardrooms that really think this? Yeah. I could totally see

723
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,820
this. Yeah. And to kind of touch on what you were saying before you took my call, you know,

724
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,660
then he had the, just dropped the price on the PlayStation 2. And he always right now

725
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,540
in the place station to sell and buried in the places, they should three, uh, you have

726
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:30,020
to, you want to boost, you know, they're, you know, pre-season three sales, uh, dramatically

727
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,220
they would, you know, make, uh, you know, uh, some kind of, uh, emulator available on

728
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:45,460
PSN, uh, ditch, you know, uh, the physical places, you know, two altogether and say,

729
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:52,980
you know, we want you to buy the system. You can play all your old games on it. You know,

730
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,940
you may have to pay for kind of fee for downloading, but you'll still be able to use all games

731
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,420
plus they'll buy all these new games and hopefully, you know, they'll see the, uh, their, you

732
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:10,260
know, uh, sales on PlayStation three increase as a result, you know? All right. Well, spasnator,

733
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,780
I think we can all agree though that wherever Sony's going to think they're going to make

734
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,740
the most money, that's what they're going to end up doing. Right. All right. Well, half

735
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,540
a good one. All right. Spasnator, wait real quick before you go. Uh, Final Fantasy 13,

736
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:28,900
you excited or don't care? I'm excited. Um, I'm definitely looking forward to getting

737
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,660
a, I've been a real big fan of the series for, you know, some years now. Um, uh, tell

738
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,940
I even played the original one on the NES. So I kind of looked, I'm looking forward towards

739
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,540
13 years. You know, from what I see a trailer and whatnot, it looks like a, they took bits

740
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,500
and pieces of, uh, different final fantasies, a little bit of seven, a little bit of 10,

741
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:57,420
a little bit of 11, 12. So, you know, I really haven't played a bad Final Fantasy yet. This

742
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,940
one could be pretty good. I think that's a good point. You know, despite the fact that

743
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,620
there have been weak Final Fantasy titles and it's all controversial, depending on who

744
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,780
you ask, like I say Final Fantasy eight was one of the weakest ones they put out in a

745
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,820
long time. Some people say I'm fucking crazy. Eight was one of the best ones, but none of

746
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,540
them were bad. Like, have you ever played a Final Fantasy game that was just bad? Like

747
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,660
if anyone's going to say any of them are bad, they're going to say 11 is bad, but because

748
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,460
it was just such, those aren't really part of the, you know, they're not actual Final

749
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,900
Fantasy. I realize Final Fantasy 11 is an actual Final Fantasy game, but it's a little

750
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,580
bit kind of out of Canada. The rest of the game is pretty awesome. I know, I know. Anyway,

751
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:42,420
Spazinator thanks so much for the call. Have a good one. Sure. No problem. Later. Um, yeah,

752
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,340
has there ever been like just a Final Fantasy game where you just picked it up and I'm talking

753
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,140
about, I'm not talking about your mystic quests. I'm not talking about your tactics. I'm talking

754
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,820
about Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 12 didn't seem, I don't know.

755
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,380
I never played 12, but it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in. It wasn't,

756
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,860
but it wasn't bad. I don't know. I never played it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on with

757
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,860
some news. We're like 45 minutes into the show where we've barely touched a third of

758
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,040
what we wanted to touch on yet. All right. Well, there's another Sony, or was a Sony

759
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,460
property back in the PlayStation 1 days, but Spyro the Dragon is actually going to become

760
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:27,980
a 3D movie. Apparently, the company that did Aragon is actually going to be putting out

761
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,220
a CG animated film and they have a movie poster for it and it looks interesting. I

762
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,100
mean, Aragon, granted, was not a good movie and I'd probably say the best part about that

763
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,420
movie was the dragon, so hey, why not? Let's run with it. Run with what was good about

764
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:50,020
it. That sounds interesting. No word on when it's going to be out yet, but hopefully soon.

765
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:57,100
I imagine this would be something targeted towards children, though. Probably, yeah.

766
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:04,660
So I don't know. It's neat. Hmm. And I'm looking at Deft in Chat says, wait, that's true? I

767
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,540
guess some things came out that maybe doubted the trueness of this. I think it's true. It's

768
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:19,760
on their website, so I don't know. Huh. I don't know. Alright, well, we will see in

769
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,220
just a matter of time. Meanwhile, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently

770
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:32,000
there are Star Trek costumes coming to PlayStation Home. Did you hear about this? Yeah. The link

771
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,580
to my story broke, but I do remember from reading it earlier in the week that there

772
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,940
was about, like, I guess to celebrate the release of the movie there's going to be some

773
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,180
new costumes coming to PlayStation Home that look like kind of the old classic Star Trek

774
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:48,700
costumes. That sounds about right, yeah. Now, you've actually paid for downloadable costumes

775
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,700
in home, right, Loki? Only the Santa Claus stuff, and that's the only costume that I'll

776
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,100
be wearing. Would you not pay for a Star Trek costume? I don't know if you're supposed to

777
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,660
be a fan of Star Trek. No, I am not a fan of Star Trek, at least not to the point of

778
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:06,140
where I'd buy a costume, or even a virtual costume. So folks in Chat would seem to like

779
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,820
that though. Actf says Star Trek costumes do want. Kurosaki87 says cool. Yeah. Well,

780
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,540
something else that's coming out available on the PlayStation Network, and also Xbox

781
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,780
Live Arcade. Konami announced that they're Gamers' Night, that they're going to be putting

782
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:29,180
out the third installment of Vandalhearts, their strategy RPG series. Now the new game

783
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,300
is going to be Vandalhearts Flames of Judgment. It'll be out on both the PlayStation Network

784
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,940
and Xbox Live Arcade. I think it's been the first Vandalhearts game we've had in a long

785
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,180
time. I want to say like the original PlayStation. I don't know if they did the PlayStation 2

786
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,660
game, but it's been a long time coming. So that's kind of neat. See, once again, figuring

787
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:59,140
out that the online digital distribution method is still a very viable business model. Interesting.

788
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,260
Indeed. Now this is part of what they announced that they're big Gamers' Night, right? And

789
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,620
I'm sure we'll have other stories from that a little later, but I guess that was probably

790
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,980
one of the pleasant surprise things they got into. Oddly enough, no DDR news. Unless they're

791
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:18,340
saving that for E3. Ooh, do you think that's good news or bad news? Neither. It's got to

792
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,540
be something DDR in the works, right? They're going to do like, oh look, holidays party

793
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:28,060
3, I bet you didn't see that coming, oh! Or like, you know, universe 4, I bet you didn't,

794
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,900
we surprise you. Well, something else that probably is not a surprise, probably about

795
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:39,140
as much of a surprise as, you know, I don't know. A silver DualShock 3 controller is on

796
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,220
its way out. It is from a listing that has showed up on GameStop's website. What's weird

797
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,100
though is that if you think about it, why would they release a silver controller when

798
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:53,580
there's no silver PlayStations? But why not? Because somebody will buy it, right? No. Oh.

799
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,940
It's probably going to be a silver system, I bet you. Do you know something I don't know?

800
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,300
No, I don't know anything yet. No, but I would assume that there's probably going to be a

801
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,500
silver system. A silver system that plays PlayStation 2 games again? Maybe? I don't think

802
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,340
they'll do that, but there'll probably be another bundle they'll announce or something,

803
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,900
maybe with God of War 3 or something. But if you remember, they did a gunmetal grey

804
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,460
one, I mean, that's sort of silver. Now wasn't there a white one also at some point? No,

805
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,060
not in the US, that was overseas. There's also been a silver one, I think, overseas,

806
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:31,500
so yeah. Well I guess there is a silver PlayStation 3 available right now in Asia, actually. So

807
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,380
we just don't have it here. But this controller would match that, so I don't know. Boy, Sony

808
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,980
really loves to mix and match the regions. I can't think of many companies that really

809
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,980
mix and match their regions like Sony does. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like with all

810
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,860
the weird colors and stuff, well I guess Nintendo kind of does it too. I don't know. Alpha

811
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,780
Nanogram in chat asks, why would they release a clear blue DualShock 2 controller if there

812
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,220
isn't a clear blue PlayStation 2? I mean, fair enough. I mean, there doesn't have to

813
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:02,140
be a silver PlayStation 3, but it's just kind of weird. The reason why I think that is because

814
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,100
there's one already in another region. It's not just, you know. Could they just be unloading

815
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,340
the extras from the other region, maybe? Very possible. I mean, I don't see why they couldn't,

816
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:20,020
but you know, I think that it's probably an indicator of something else though. That seems

817
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:26,940
to be the way Sony rules. Oh, if only E3 were tomorrow, but it's not. Well, let's take a

818
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,260
look really quickly at some release dates of some upcoming games. I'll go ahead and

819
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,940
start with Europe, because Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so I'll go ahead and read

820
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,860
the releases for Europe. This week, some of the games you have to look forward to in Europe,

821
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:42,300
Xenoclash coming out for the PC, Saints Row 2, Ultor Exposed coming out for the Xbox 360

822
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,260
and PlayStation 3. That's download content. That's download content. That's what I thought,

823
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:51,100
I was going to say. It was delayed, too. It sucks. Minion Everyday Hero comes out on the

824
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,740
Wii, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Little King's Story

825
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,900
on the Nintendo Wii, as well as the new play control version of Pikmin 2, and the Chronicles

826
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:05,460
of Riddick, Assault on Dark Athena, all come out on the 24th of this month over in Europe.

827
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,620
Again, those are Europe release dates. How about the US here locally, Loki? The US, whole

828
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:16,700
lot of not much. This week, really only one game that you need to worry about picking

829
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:23,940
up anyways, Excitebots Trick Racing. Supposed to be out on the 20th or tomorrow. That's

830
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:29,400
my gaming week right there, basically. There will be a version if you want to, if you're

831
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:37,340
ever so inclined with a wheel as well. Why? Honestly, I think it's stupid, but hey, if

832
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,260
you want to play at the wheel, go right ahead. I'm thinking of getting Excitebots, I'll have

833
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,980
to do some online. Oh yeah, it'll be awesome. I want to play Nelly. I told her, I'm like,

834
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,620
dude, you can start playing against other people. She's like, I don't care. It hurts

835
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:57,460
me. Some other stuff, there's a PZ game called Cryostasis. Also, Dynasty Warriors Gundam

836
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:05,860
2 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360 this week. I love horses on the DS, and

837
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:11,340
sadly enough, that's it. The week after that, there's going to be a bunch of crap coming

838
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,660
out on the DS, and then X-Men Origins, Wolverine. Looking at chat, by the way, this is coming

839
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,660
from Justin TV chat, because I'm trying to keep an eye on that, even though our main

840
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,340
chat room is at chat.orangelandrager.com. I know we have quite a few people on Justin

841
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,260
TV who have never listened to this show before, because of the Final Fantasy 13 demo. I want

842
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,180
to point out though, AkumaJP, one of our Justin TV chatters, actually responded to something

843
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:38,060
AlphaKananagram said earlier, there is a clear blue PlayStation 2 in Japan. That's seriously

844
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,180
part of the reason I love this show. Most radio hosts, we get pissed off when listeners

845
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,860
correct them on things, but I think we realize we can't be everywhere. We do something pretty

846
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,460
ambitious here by trying to keep in mind, yes, there are gamers in Europe. Yes, there

847
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,140
are gamers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, all those places. We have listeners throughout

848
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:02,060
the world, but we can't be all those places. We don't always know what colors and what

849
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,580
things you guys have, so you guys are always there to correct us. Love it. Speaking of

850
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,860
Japan, let's talk about some Japanese release dates. Sometimes Japan gets things way before

851
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,540
us, sometimes they get things way after us. One game that's coming out in Japan this week

852
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:21,020
on the Xbox 360, a game called Death Smiles, which is a shooting game that's actually getting

853
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,340
its own little arcade stick, and this game looks like a cute little Japanese shooter.

854
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,820
This looks like the type of thing that Dark Sakura would be all over. I know she's not

855
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,020
here tonight, but it looks like, this looks very similar to the one, god, what's that

856
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,760
game she loves on the Sega with the witch flying in the broom? It's like her favorite

857
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,880
game ever? I don't know. One of the chatters will know it. This looks very similar to that

858
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,500
where it's a very comic style and everything in the game is little like demons, like, you

859
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:52,300
know, little, I don't know, this game looks kind of neat actually. Death Smiles. That's

860
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,140
just a cute name too, by the way. That is coming out this week on the Xbox 360. There's

861
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,980
also an arcade stick coming out just for that game. Also in Japan, Tom Clancy's HAWX comes

862
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,980
out as well. Hawks, yeah. Hawks. Also on the Playstation 3 this week, Killzone 2 makes

863
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,880
its Japanese debut. Check that out if you are into that. On the Nintendo Wii this week

864
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,900
in Japan, Monster Hunter G, that's going to be a big one coming out over there, as well

865
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,500
as Tomb Raider Underworld finally gets its Japanese release. Those are the big releases

866
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,500
on the Wii this week. Coming out on the Playstation 2, Little Anchor. Also Tomb Raider Underworld

867
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:33,500
and a game called Kanuchi Kuroki Subasa no Shu comes out from Idea Factory, which looks

868
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:40,380
to be an adventure game, probably based on another anime if the box art is any indication.

869
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,900
On the Nintendo DS, we have Another Time, Another Leaf. That's what it's called. Kagami

870
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,860
no Naka no Tante comes out. Last Bullet is another game coming out on the DS this week,

871
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:56,620
as well as something called, I don't know what this is, DS Vision Dual Masters Box Set.

872
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,500
I guess it's some type of like dual master with the cards, like the actual cards, but

873
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,860
it's something for the DS. Kind of weird. I don't know what the heck this is. It's probably,

874
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,060
I don't know, maybe something for the DSi or something that you. That could be, oh maybe

875
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,780
something that scans the cards, like an Eye of Judgment type thing with the DS. Am I thinking

876
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:18,500
too far? I don't know. I'm totally guessing, so I don't really know if that's the case

877
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,940
or not. And thank you Chatters, you got it. Alpha Kananagram, was he first? No, Dark Tetsuji

878
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,620
said Cotton. Panorama Cotton was the game I was trying to think of earlier. That Death

879
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:32,420
Smiles looks a little bit like Panorama Cotton. Thank you guys. Sony PlayStation Portable

880
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,980
in Japan sees the release of Hoshigari Empusa Portable, which is coming out on the PSP,

881
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:43,820
which looks to be another little school kid adventure game coming out on the PSP. And

882
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:48,420
Chronicle of Dungeon Maker, Nantama. If you're into Dungeon Maker, that's coming out as well.

883
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,180
That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates. Let's do a few more news items. We'll

884
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:59,180
get into the Classic Game of the Week, and then we will get into a break here. So, Loki,

885
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,220
alright. Sorry, you gotta pause Final Fantasy XIII if you can. Or are you in the middle

886
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:08,340
of a battle? I was in the middle of a battle, but that's alright. Alright, good. So anyways,

887
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:16,460
there was some interesting stuff. There was a new action game coming from Square Enix,

888
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:24,220
and it's a little bit different than... Oh, this is the one I'm thinking of. Nevermind.

889
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:30,660
Vanguard Storm is the name of the game, and if you may remember a game back on the PlayStation

890
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:37,980
called Vanguard Hearts, I have a feeling it's a sequel to that. And no word exactly on what

891
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:45,540
it is, but apparently the May issue of the PlayStation official magazine made an announcement

892
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:51,620
that they're working on an unannounced title, so tie that in with that trademark for Vanguard

893
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:57,420
Storm. Probably what they're working on, a new Vanguard Hearts game, which would be pretty

894
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,260
awesome. It's interesting, we've heard kind of a flurry of stuff from Square Enix just

895
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,860
in the last year or so. I remember picking up Vanguard Hearts so I could get the demo

896
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:11,180
for Final Fantasy VIII. I thought that came with Brave Fencer Musashi. Oh, maybe that

897
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,780
was Brave. I thought it was both. Was it? I don't remember. Or maybe I'm mixing them

898
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,900
up. Maybe one of them had the VII demo or something. I don't remember. I don't think

899
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,620
they had a demo for VII. Yeah, they did. They did? Oh yeah, they did. Yeah, they had a demo

900
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:29,500
for VII. Really? Yeah. I know they did. Yeah, because it was just the... It might have been

901
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,580
multiple demos, because they used to do that where there was a disc. Yeah, I seem to remember

902
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,880
that. They'd have an early demo, then a later demo that had extra stuff or something. Just

903
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:44,420
weird Square-type stuff to do. Brave Fencer Musashi had the demo for Final Fantasy VII,

904
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:51,140
says Act Deft. Oh, maybe I did play that demo, because I'd pop Brave Fencer Musashi. I seem

905
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:58,940
to remember having that demo. I don't remember if I rented it or what I did. And then Henderson

906
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:03,080
Man, 77, says it was actually with Toeball number 1. Had the demo to VII as well. I'm

907
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,420
sure it was... I think there were a couple of demos that came out. It was so long ago,

908
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,920
though. Alright, anyhow. Phone lines are open, by the way. 1877 Game OLR. I know some folks

909
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,200
might want to call in to talk about this one, but there were some drums in the music game

910
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,720
world this week. That's right, some big drama between DJ Hero, Activision, and Scratch the

911
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,580
Ultimate DJ. Apparently, what happened? The developers of the people that are making Scratch

912
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:30,780
the Ultimate DJ, they have actually filed suit against VII Studios and Activision, forget

913
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,380
this, intentional interference with contract, breach of contract, and misappropriation of

914
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:41,740
trade secrets. Basically, you have a publisher who's suing the people that made the game,

915
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,980
because didn't Activision try to pick them up then? They bought them. They bought them,

916
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,860
and now this company's trying to say Activision sabotaged it, because Scratch got delayed,

917
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,600
didn't it? Yeah. You spoke very highly of this game, because you've actually seen more

918
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,940
of this game than a lot of people have, because the developers came to your work or something,

919
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,940
right? Yeah, well, the publisher came to my work, Genius, and they showed us a video of

920
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,940
the developer showing off the game, and it's really awesome. I mean, granted, it's not

921
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,760
the most original thing. Everyone's like, oh, Beat Me and You Rip Off, and yeah, it's

922
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,660
very similar to Beat Mania. The really separate is because the scratching's actually very

923
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,300
unique, the way you do the scratching system and stuff, and how it detects different tricks

924
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,780
and that kind of thing. Let's go to the phone. We got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch

925
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:29,180
Radio. Who's this? Death Wishing. Death Wishing. And I say, welcome to America. Welcome to

926
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,620
Sue Happy America. Where you can sue anybody for anything. Where you can sue your own people

927
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,880
that helped you get to where you are. You can sue the pants off of them. This is almost

928
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:44,580
like Coke suing Coke Zero for sucking. This is like Coke suing New Coke for sucking. This

929
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:51,580
is what it is. This is like suing your mom for getting your umbilical cord cut. But seriously,

930
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,580
though, if this is true, if everything that they're saying is true, basically, you know,

931
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,860
that Activision bought this company because originally they were going to sell it off

932
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,420
to Activision or something like that, and Activision's basically in cahoots with them

933
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,340
to delay this game so DJ Hero comes out. I just want to say, to be fair, to cover both

934
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,860
sides of the story, before we open up and let the listeners comment, Activision did

935
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,720
publish a statement after the fact a little later in the week that says they, quote, strongly

936
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,380
deny the allegations made by Genius Productions and Newmark Industries. The claims are disingenuous

937
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:28,120
and lack any merit. They're just trying to get petty. Well, I'm sure Activision has more

938
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,860
lawyers than Genius does, and so, unfortunately, I don't think anything's going to happen.

939
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:35,460
I think they're going to announce DJ Hero and show it off at E3, and it'll probably

940
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,180
come up before scratch, and it's unfortunate that this, you know, game will come out, and

941
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:45,060
I think they could have given them a run for their money. I've noticed, though, that Activision,

942
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,220
whereas they should be called Activision Blizzard, and strange thing is I'm drinking Coke right

943
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,140
now, dude, just to be random, because I see Coke stuff in chat, but, uh, Activision Blizzard,

944
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:57,380
I've noticed they never want to sue. I can't help but notice they always seem to lose,

945
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:03,220
or they always get dropped. I bet you this one will be dropped because the judge is just

946
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:10,060
going to go, you guys are little children, get out. Can't we all just get along? No,

947
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,300
but seriously, though, basically, they're saying that, you know, Activision and Genius

948
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,240
met together, and they signed NDAs, and they showed each other each other's games, why

949
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,980
they did that is beyond me. I guess they were trying to sell them scratch or something,

950
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,220
and, you know, now they're saying that 7 Studios, since they have all this insider knowledge

951
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,500
of how the game works, and, you know, we're developing the game, that they gave that knowledge

952
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,300
to Activision, breaching their contract, and at the same time, because they were behind

953
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,780
schedule anyways on everything, you know, they weren't meeting their quotas, and they

954
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:46,560
were demanding more and more and more and more money, that now they're basically kind

955
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:53,560
of dragging their feet so that, you know, the Activision game gets out first. They're

956
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,960
still little babies. Death Wishing, okay, you're saying they're babies, but why? Explain

957
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:07,460
a little bit here. Who do you think is the good guy in this scenario, and why? This is

958
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:15,420
hard because they're both kind of just freaking out, in my opinion. I don't know. It's really

959
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:23,040
hard, but it's like, one guy is suing because he's being sued, and then the other guy is

960
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:30,700
suing the side company, I forgot what they're called, but, uh, because they, it's like,

961
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:36,940
in a way, I kind of see this as false claims. Do you think it's really important which one

962
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:42,140
of these games gets out first? Uh, right now, yeah. This will be important. This will, which

963
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,040
one gets out first will probably be the more popular one. But wasn't Guitar Hero out before

964
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,000
Rock Band? I mean, granted, Guitar Hero is more popular, I guess, in the long run, but

965
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,720
I think a lot of people recognize Rock Band. Actually, Guitar, uh, Rock Band's made much

966
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,480
more money than Guitar Hero has. In fact, I think there, wasn't the, Guitar Hero's fault

967
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:08,280
is behind, uh, Rock Band's, uh, sales. Yeah, but the problem is, I think, that it's all,

968
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,820
it's really the way people perceive everything, is if Scratch comes out first, say it came

969
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:18,400
out when it was supposed to, which would have been June, um, and it had, you know, a lead

970
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,040
on DJ Hero for at least three months or so, when DJ Hero comes out, everyone's like, hey,

971
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,680
that's just a rip-off of Scratch. You know, and it kind of... It's like Rock Band was

972
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,940
coming out. Yeah, exactly. It's, it, people perceive it, you know, they want DJ Hero out,

973
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:37,160
so people go, oh, that's just a crappy knock-off of DJ Hero, why would I want to play that?

974
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,440
You know, it's the thing is... The thing is, is Rock Band, though, was different, because

975
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,760
it did have a full band while Guitar Hero was just Guitar, so that's maybe why it sold

976
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,120
better, but these are the same games, you know, this is like saying Guitar Freaks is

977
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,720
better than, you know, it's like Guitar Freaks, you know, Guitar Hero. Well, and if you want

978
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,040
to be, if you want to put it that way, Guitar Freaks came out years before any of these

979
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,280
games did, and it's, uh, look at how wonderfully Rock Revolution did, which you could say would

980
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,040
be the new innovation of Guitar Freaks. That's not a funny joke, that's just sad. It's really

981
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,680
not. In fact, actually, one thing I did do with my gaming week, I didn't talk about earlier

982
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,520
in the show, I bought a new guitar, I finally have a wireless guitar that I bought, I ended

983
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,180
up buying a new Guitar Hero guitar because I had more friends that wanted to play Rock

984
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:22,800
Band, but I preferred the Guitar Hero guitar, I'm weird. So I bought that, but, oh my god,

985
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,400
stacks and stacks of Rock Revolution drum kit plus games for 30 bucks.

986
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:34,640
Poor guys. Poor guys. Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up part

987
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,560
A and get to our break, but anything else you want to say for our listeners?

988
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:43,080
People, I need a chat. Should I get Final Fantasy XI a line?

989
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,880
Oh god, you're gonna open a whole can of worms with that one. Um, you know what, they have

990
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,400
a two week trial now, my advice, try the trial.

991
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,400
Okay.

992
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Alright.

993
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,400
Bye bye.

994
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,040
Bye bye. Alright. 1-877-GAMELR if you want to give us a call, but we do want to move

995
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,480
through some of the other news. Uh, Loki, you have another story for us.

996
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:10,200
Uh, good. Guitar Hero Van Halen has been spotted on the European rating system there. Basically,

997
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,040
the German ratings board has the game listed, and to be honest, I thought I've already said

998
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,480
this on the show, it's absolutely coming out. I mean, I don't think they've announced it

999
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,600
yet, but, um, it's been leaked out on all these different retailer sites and stuff like

1000
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,600
that.

1001
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,460
It's coming up again on the show because I saw it on about three different video game

1002
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:32,200
websites from three different sources saying, oh, Van Halen, Guitar Hero's still being speculated.

1003
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,840
It is fucking happening. It's already, god, how many people do you have to hear it from?

1004
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:41,040
Really? End of August. What more do you want to know? I mean, seriously.

1005
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,220
They're trying to keep it in their pants, tell E3, because they want to probably parade

1006
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,840
Van Halen out on stage. Because they know that something big is going to happen with

1007
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,180
the Rock Band Beatles thing. So they're trying, I mean, Van Halen is no Beatles, no matter

1008
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:58,160
how much you want to argue. Um, but, they'll do whatever they can to put a dent in the,

1009
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,780
because you know that is going to be the huge thing from, you know, EA, Harmonix is Rock

1010
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,780
Band Beatles.

1011
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:09,000
Exactly. But, I just, I don't, good for them if they want to put out another game, but

1012
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,200
I just don't like their business model. I don't like how it's not downloadable content,

1013
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,920
or that you can't load it into your Rock Band 2 game, you know, if it were a Rock Band,

1014
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,760
you know, equivalent content. That they can't load it into like a Guitar Hero game or anything

1015
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,640
like that. It's just all separate. And they do that because they want you to buy these

1016
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,320
games. They want you to pay, you know, the $60 instead of, you know, whatever it would

1017
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,560
be to download everything. Or if you might not want all the tracks or something like

1018
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:39,680
that. Whatever. I mean, that's what they want to do, fine. And people buy it if they want.

1019
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,400
But yeah, it's definitely coming. It's not like a, you know, they're calling it a rumor

1020
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,800
because they haven't announced it yet, but, dude, I mean, seriously, everyone's saying

1021
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,040
it's coming out. It's coming out. If it's rated, it's coming out.

1022
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,400
They're just trying to keep, it's the world's worst secret right now because they're going

1023
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:00,160
to, I was, I will bet you money they are parading Van Halen out on stage, or what's left of

1024
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,120
them anyway, at E3.

1025
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:06,360
I'm sure. It'll be during their conference or something. I don't know.

1026
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,920
All right. Anyhow, Sing Star Queen is a game that I thought was supposed to come out some

1027
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:11,320
time ago.

1028
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,800
It was supposed to come out in March.

1029
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,360
I have a friend who is very excited about Sing Star Queen because she loves Freddie

1030
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,520
Mercury. I mean, how could you not? Right? I mean, what a fucking rock star. Just a great

1031
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,000
band that I would also wouldn't mind seeing Guitar Hero Rock Band game made out of. However,

1032
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,720
they are making a Sing Star game out of it, or I guess you could say it's already been

1033
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,240
made. Didn't this actually come out overseas already?

1034
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,240
I think so.

1035
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,760
Well, we are finally going to get it on August 18th is when the game will come out on PlayStation

1036
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,840
2 and PlayStation 3. Just like Sing Star Abba, the PlayStation 3 version has five more songs

1037
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,160
than the PlayStation 2, so 20 and 25 songs each.

1038
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,440
By the way, just on a side note, Sing Star also got a big update, or I think is getting

1039
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,560
one this coming week, where they're finally putting trophies in the game. And apparently,

1040
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,960
if you go in and read some of the trophy descriptions, they talk about unlocking trophies in PlayStation

1041
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,960
Home. So you've got to wonder if that's right around the corner as well. I wonder if that's

1042
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,280
going to be one of the things they parade out at E3, is that finally all the trophy

1043
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
rooms are open.

1044
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,120
Well, it's about time they parade something they've been showing off for years now.

1045
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,040
I would bet anything that's going to be an E3 thing too, if not just before. But yeah,

1046
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,760
Sing Star is getting a big update. I guess the Sing Store is going to get a little bit

1047
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,760
of a tune-up too.

1048
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:25,160
Honestly, I haven't been in Home since it came out, basically. I mean, it's just no

1049
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,520
interest whatsoever.

1050
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,560
You know what? I've revisited it a couple times. I checked out the new Guitar Hero area.

1051
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,720
I checked out the new Resident Evil area. It is kind of interesting to see what they're

1052
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:40,600
building, but I still have yet to see... I know this sounds really harsh, but the point?

1053
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:45,000
You know what I mean? I guess I'll go into the Guitar Hero area to play the little Guitar

1054
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,560
Hero mini-game, which was kind of dopey. It was just basically Simon Says. It wasn't even

1055
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,960
like Guitar Hero. But I mean, I couldn't see logging into these places to actually try

1056
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,000
to talk to people. But I guess there's an audience for it. Because, you know, every

1057
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,520
time I go in there, it seems like there's quite a few people on it, using it. I mean,

1058
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:09,440
it's not like Home is empty. There's lots of people just dancing away in the town square.

1059
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:15,440
I know. But yeah, I'm with you. I don't get the point. But whatever.

1060
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,440
I do and I don't. I get the point. I just don't think it's what we all were hoping it

1061
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,360
would be. Which, I don't know.

1062
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,580
It's not revolutionizing anything, I don't think, right now.

1063
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,280
I'm very curious to see, though, because I believe... Wasn't Namco supposed to put some

1064
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,720
stuff into PlayStation Home? Or at least that's happened overseas. But it hasn't happened

1065
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
here yet.

1066
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,280
Yeah, they have their games that you can play and stuff.

1067
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,760
I would kind of like to see what happens when that gets enabled. Because now we're starting

1068
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,200
to talk about a point. You know what I mean? Having some of these games that you actually

1069
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,080
get in Home. Curious. Curious.

1070
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:54,120
So this is kind of interesting. Apparently a lot of people got the first look at the

1071
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:02,740
new Rock-A-Bam Beatles game. It actually came out. They had special footage that was being

1072
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:09,880
broadcast at Coachella. Paul McCartney's new performance that he did. And basically when

1073
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:16,580
they're playing Got To Get You Into My Life, they had behind them some actual footage from

1074
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,120
Rock-A-Bam with the digital artists singing and stuff.

1075
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,560
You know how they do at concerts. They have images playing behind the band when they're

1076
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,240
singing or what have you. So Paul McCartney at this... In Coachella, I don't know how

1077
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:32,200
many of you guys listening have ever been. The last time I went was in 2002, I think.

1078
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Maybe 2003, I went to Coachella. And it's huge. I went whatever year Bjork and Chemical

1079
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,560
Brothers were headlining. It's just ginormous. Like, oh my god, so many people there. I thought

1080
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,080
I was going to die during Bjork because there were just so many people there.

1081
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:51,000
So obviously this was not a small concert to be debuting this in front of. And you know

1082
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,520
everybody talks about Coachella. It's kind of like, since there is no Lollapalooza, Lilith

1083
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,720
Fair. Well, I take that back. I guess they do a Lollapalooza in the Chicago area. But

1084
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,960
there's no big tours and things like that. This is one of the big festivals people talk

1085
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,240
about in this day and age. So this is no small concert.

1086
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,960
Very interesting. Although they have this thing at the middle of nowhere. You know about

1087
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,440
Coachella? They do it at this big polo field that is literally in the middle of nowhere.

1088
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,120
It's in Indio, California. So you have to drive like two hours outside of L.A. to get

1089
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,900
there. It is literally in the middle of frickin' nowhere. But I guess that's so people don't

1090
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:30,180
complain about the noise. So anyhow. Also, something about the Beatles game is going

1091
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,120
to have multiple microphones and harmonizing. There's a rumor, yeah.

1092
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,160
Huh. You think that'll actually turn out to be?

1093
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Eh, maybe. That might be kind of fun.

1094
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,880
I'm still trying to figure out why it's $250. I wouldn't spend too much money on it.

1095
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,880
Didn't they finally announce it?

1096
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,080
They announced what's in it, but it seems like there's stuff missing, to be honest.

1097
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:52,540
Because it's like a bass and drum or something like that. Microphone and mic stand. That's

1098
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:59,840
not $250 worth unless that bass guitar is really awesome and that drum says really awesome.

1099
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,920
Alright, well earlier we talked about SingStar. SingStar, their biggest competitors are probably

1100
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,680
the Lips franchise, which has had mediocre success, and Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

1101
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:16,560
Well, it was announced at Konami Gamer's Night this week that Blitz Games is developing a

1102
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,400
reboot, I guess you could say, of the Karaoke Revolution franchise. We're calling it a reboot

1103
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,920
because they are calling it simply Karaoke Revolution.

1104
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,240
At least right now, yeah.

1105
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,720
It's a game being developed for the PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii. And it's going to have

1106
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,720
50 recordings on the disc. You're going to be able to have a pretty comprehensive character

1107
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:38,000
creator mode in it, and you'll have customizable venues apparently and original music videos

1108
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,160
for all the songs. That's kind of cool.

1109
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,560
Apparently they're going to have song and item download content in the game, very similar

1110
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:51,040
to Rock Band. However, it is Karaoke Revolution. It is singing only. What's kind of interesting

1111
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,960
though is that I noticed right away, the first thing I noticed, I don't know if you noticed

1112
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,280
this, where did American Idol go? Because that was one thing Konami was very proud of

1113
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,760
a couple years ago. Do you remember there was a Codemasters American Idol game that

1114
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,640
was just atrocious? Like you just hit buttons or something. It was really terrible. I think

1115
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,080
it was Codemasters. I'm sorry if I misappropriating that. But that game came out when the show

1116
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,920
was first out. And then a couple years later, Konami got the franchise because they were

1117
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,500
one of the first to go into this Karaoke genre with Karaoke Revolution. They had a couple

1118
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,420
of those games, which ironically, Harmonix, had developed for them. And they had pretty

1119
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:28,020
good success with it, so they came out with American Idol Karaoke Revolution. But that's

1120
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,760
nowhere to be found now. So does this indicate they lost the American Idol franchise? They're

1121
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,880
not interested in it, which I would have a hard time believing, or what? No, I doubt

1122
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,120
that. I think, if anything, what was kind of neat about it is that they also had...

1123
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:50,600
it's all Master Tracks now, too. It's not covers. That is one big difference, I suppose.

1124
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:56,600
So that's kind of cool. And then you can also create your own characters in this. You know,

1125
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,760
like customize actual characters and stuff, with sliders and all that fun stuff. So really

1126
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,920
detailed there. But yeah, they're kind of trying to reinvent themselves with that. Why

1127
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,460
not like DDR or something? I just don't understand. By the way, they're also saying this setlist

1128
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,920
will be very party-centric, and it's going to have a drop-in-and-out duet mode. Doesn't

1129
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,160
that sound exactly like what they did in Lips? Also, though, there's going to be online play,

1130
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,240
it sounds like, which I can't think of a lot of other games outside of the Rock Band Guitar

1131
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,440
Hero games, the karaoke games that do this. Does Lips do that? I don't know. Lips is

1132
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:35,440
the one karaoke game I haven't played, because I have SingStar. SingStars online is the SingSpace,

1133
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,940
or whatever they call it. The community download people videos making asses themselves, dancing

1134
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:48,720
around in Star Trek outfits and stuff to the various songs, which is actually kind of funny,

1135
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:55,560
some of it. SSJ-100 Matt is hoping for a Karaoke Revolution Susan Boyle edition, because she's

1136
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:04,560
all the rage this week. I dreamed a dream. Well, you know what? You can always recreate

1137
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,960
her character in American Idol. Maybe if the Avatar creation is very good, you'll start

1138
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,240
seeing that. And who's to say that they won't come out with an American Idol game? Because

1139
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:21,240
usually those typically come out in the spring, or the winter, between November and February.

1140
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,440
And honestly, this new karaoke game could possibly come out in October, and then they

1141
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,200
announce a new game, and then it comes out later. I don't think they're going to drop

1142
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,120
American Idol anytime soon, but I think it's too early for them to announce the new Karaoke

1143
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,400
Revolution American Idol games coming out when they just released one. It was a few

1144
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,600
months ago, but still. And remember how Paula Abdul wasn't actually

1145
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,640
in the Karaoke Revolution American Idol games? They had a third judge named Laura. They had

1146
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:53,120
Randy and Simon and Laura. Yeah, she wasn't the newest one though, I

1147
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,360
think. Well, now they could just have Kara, who's

1148
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,520
the actual- Get rid of Paula off the show.

1149
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,320
I mean, everybody's saying just get Paula off the regular show anyway, because she talks

1150
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,880
too damn much, and just have Kara be the third judge.

1151
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,920
She's also high on something. Methamphetamines?

1152
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,320
Meth, I don't know. Say, hey!

1153
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,240
I saw the colors that you were singing! What? It's like, stop talking!

1154
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:22,240
When you were singing Ring of Fire, I felt fire, because you were just flaming up there

1155
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,520
on stage. You were so flaming. I was like, I should get a fire extinguisher,

1156
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,920
because he's on fire! But then I was like, no!

1157
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,320
Have you actually been watching American Idol? Yes.

1158
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,120
Because I know the wife makes you watch it. She likes watching it, and it's okay, but

1159
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,360
we always skip the results show, because that's a big waste of time.

1160
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,160
We just read online who loses, and honestly, you already know who's going to win now, anyways.

1161
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,720
But seriously, she is smoking crack or something, and a lot of times, now because, for whatever

1162
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,960
reason, their producers suck so bad that they can't keep the show on time, even when they

1163
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:01,400
cut it down to only two judges talking per performance, Paula wastes so much damn time

1164
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:06,200
about, you know, talking about whatever she's talking about. No, I was like, staring her

1165
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:11,920
down, like, what the fuck did you just say? Oh, and yes, I'm just on TV now, playing a

1166
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,200
trailer for Final Fantasy Versus, because apparently I got killed in 13, and so, I don't

1167
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,600
feel like replaying half an hour of demo again. Good job.

1168
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,040
Alright, so check that out. What, are you going to switch to Fat Princess a little later

1169
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,040
here? Yeah, probably.

1170
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Alright. Second half.

1171
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,720
Well, hey, you got another story you gotta cover, and then we're going to get to the

1172
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,200
classic game of the week, which you don't even know what I'm doing tonight, unless you

1173
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,520
took a peek, but I think you'll like the game I picked tonight.

1174
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
I didn't.

1175
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
We'll see. We'll see.

1176
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:42,880
Anyways, so we've got a, this is kind of cool, they're going to have Video Game Live at E3,

1177
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,800
you know, I remember last time we went, I think they did, was it the Final Fantasy concert,

1178
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,920
you know, whatever they called that, Voices or something, but yeah, Video Games Live,

1179
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:59,320
going to be at the LA Greek Theater on June 4th. I almost thought about going to this,

1180
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:05,600
but then June 4th is my wife's birthday, and that might not be good.

1181
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,280
She definitely may not like that. Nice. Hitstun in chat says, wait, it's a $70 fucking demo

1182
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:19,320
and you can't even save? No. Bummer. I kind of want to go to Video Games Live at E3, just

1183
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,120
because I know they're going to really pull off the stops for that one, but I don't know,

1184
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,000
it just may not work out, I may be kind of, there's a very strong possibility I'm actually

1185
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,600
going to Vegas, like, that same weekend. Huh. Kind of funny. That was interesting. What?

1186
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,960
I noticed at the end of the Final Fantasy Versus 13 trailer it said, PlayStation 3 only

1187
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:41,120
worldwide. I didn't realize it was coming out in the US. Yeah, of course Versus is coming

1188
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,380
out in the US. I thought it was Japanese only. No, it's been coming out in the US, but it

1189
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,440
still is reiterating that it's not coming out on the 360. Eh, whatever, I don't care,

1190
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,940
big deal. It's not going to like, you know, break my heart if I have to buy one of them

1191
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:59,520
on the 360 or one of them on the PS3, or both on the PS3. I really don't care at this point,

1192
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,080
so. Alright. Well let's get into the classic video game of the week. We like to close out

1193
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,560
part A every week of our program by taking a look in the archives and digging through

1194
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,480
the archives and finding a game that speaks to us as a classic that you all should be

1195
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,340
playing. Usually DarkSakura does this and picks a game from the archives, however, she's

1196
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,880
not here tonight. Again, for those that joined us mid-show, she is celebrating her birthday,

1197
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,560
which actually is today. I would say how old she's turning, but she'll probably punch me

1198
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,380
if I did that, so you'll just have to... It starts with a three. That's a whole set. She's

1199
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:36,320
turning three. Congratulations, DarkSakura. She's gonna act her age for once. Yes, because

1200
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:42,440
she's at Disneyland today. Acting three. So that's where she's at. So I'm filling in,

1201
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,280
I believe the last time we did this, Loki did Twisted Metal, so it's my turn, and I

1202
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,560
picked a game. I did? I don't even remember anymore. Yeah, you did. I tried to go back.

1203
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,320
Maybe I'm being unfair. I don't know, but I picked a game I thought you would also like,

1204
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,800
Loki. This is a game I remember. I wanted to pick a Commodore 64 game, because you know

1205
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,200
I love the Commodore 64, but I found a game that was not only on the Commodore 64, but

1206
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,160
it was actually ported to the Nintendo as well, and the game is called Spy vs. Spy.

1207
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:14,080
Did you ever play this game on the NES? No, I'm aware of it. All right, Spy vs. Spy is

1208
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,960
the game I picked for the Classic Game of the Week. It's actually kind of like the series.

1209
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,600
Now, Spy vs. Spy, of course, is the, you know, you might know this from the Mad Magazine,

1210
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,640
the comic books, you basically have a black spy and a white spy that are out to kill each

1211
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:29,720
other. Well, here's what makes the game kind of unique, Spy vs. Spy. It was a game that

1212
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,320
actually came out on the Commodore 64 first. They actually ported it to the NES later.

1213
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:38,200
It came out on a handful of systems at first, but it was actually one of the first games

1214
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,240
that had split-screen multiplayer, because you actually would have the white spy on the

1215
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,000
top and the black spy on the bottom, and basically you were trying to kill each other. That was

1216
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,320
the game. Let me tell you a little bit more about the game here, pull up some more information

1217
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,360
I have on this. I actually own this game and the sequel, which I'll talk about in a minute,

1218
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:59,360
on the Commodore 64. But, yeah, this was a game that was published by Firstarstoff, where

1219
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:05,160
it came out in 1984, and it started off on the Atari 8-bit computer systems, Apple II

1220
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,080
and Commodore 64, which probably would have been the most technically powerful out of

1221
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,000
those systems. It actually had split-screen simultaneous two-player gameplay. What you

1222
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,360
basically do in this game, you want to kill your opponent as many times as possible, but

1223
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,840
while you're trying to do that, you're trying to collect items to get out of the little

1224
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,600
compound. You're basically in a little compound looking thing, and you're trying to collect

1225
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:30,420
various items, and get out of there, be the first one out of there. Whenever you perish,

1226
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,920
you drop all of the items that you have, and you have to sit out of the game for a few

1227
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:39,020
moments while your person you're playing against gets to free run. Now here's the thing that

1228
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,960
makes this game kind of cool. While you're running through the embassy collecting items,

1229
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,820
Not only do you if you run into the other player can you start beating each other up with a stick?

1230
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:51,720
but you actually set traps for the other player because what you're doing is trying to dig through things to find the pieces like the

1231
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,380
You know passport and everything you need to get on the plane

1232
01:21:53,380 --> 01:22:00,180
But you can actually set a bomb a spring a water bucket and like a time bomb you can actually set these things and blow

1233
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,440
Up your opponent if they search the wrong thing

1234
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:09,700
Unless you have a remedy you can find umbrellas and things to counter so it's like this really fucking elaborate game of pop

1235
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:15,120
Rock paper scissors is what it is basically this giant game of rock paper scissors that's going on

1236
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,680
What's kind of cool about this game though what I always liked about it

1237
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:23,740
Is that you know because it is split-screen multiplayer on the same screen part of winning the game was?

1238
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:29,640
Memorizing what your opponent was doing on the lower screen and the bigger the compound the harder it is to do that because you know

1239
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:34,180
We're talking about an old computer system where a lot of the rooms looked the same

1240
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:39,840
It was just the colors would be different and so on so there's the guy taking off in the plane. He actually won there

1241
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,540
You go let me show you or not show you because it's radio

1242
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,920
But let me play for you a little clip of the NES version of the game that came out a little later

1243
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,660
And you can hear like the souped-up music that was in this version of the game which by the way

1244
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:54,720
They say is coming to the Europe virtual console very soon if it hasn't already

1245
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:01,080
But also very similar you know was a Nintendo game that had the same same screen multiplayer

1246
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,080
I was always thinking this would be a fun game for them to put out on Xbox Live or the DS

1247
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,760
With like with like but like four players, but not have

1248
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,640
Everybody have their own screen you could still see what everybody is doing on the same screen because that was part of that

1249
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,280
That's how you win the game you have to memorize what your other people are doing and where they've set the traps

1250
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,980
It's kind of interesting by the way there was a spy versus spy game that came out later on the Xbox

1251
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:26,140
But it was like a 3d reimaging. That's not the game. I'm talking about definitely not the game

1252
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:30,860
I'm talking about I'm talking about the old-school Commodore 64 game. There was a couple of sequels released for this game

1253
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,720
There are actually two sequels released. They were not released on the NES though

1254
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,240
So I don't think quite as many people know about these games

1255
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,520
But I'm gonna play a little bit of music from the second one which I actually own this game

1256
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,060
It was spy versus spy to the island caper and yes

1257
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,620
That means they left the building and they actually went on to an island

1258
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:48,680
But the interesting thing about this is that you were no longer in rooms

1259
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:53,880
But you were in giant horizontal lines like imagine you had giant rectangles

1260
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,500
So you still could go up and down between the different rectangles

1261
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:02,000
But you know you had more side scrolling going on and this time you were digging in the ground and you could set bombs you

1262
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,180
Could set like rope traps that would hang you from the tree you could set napalm coconuts that you know

1263
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,300
The other spies would dig up pretty cool stuff

1264
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,480
That was the second game that came out and there was a third game that came out and I didn't even own this game

1265
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,280
But I did play it once it was called Arctic antics

1266
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,480
So basically the antithesis of being on the island would be being on the North Pole and it was the same type of thing except

1267
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,440
You had a body heat meter and you could regenerate it by being an igloos whatever but kind of interesting

1268
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:31,680
that the you know the series went on for quite a while on the computer and then got rebooted a few years later, but I

1269
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,740
Remember playing this with friends when I was like eight or nine years old and having fun with this because this is you know

1270
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:42,280
This is a great trash-talking game when you're in the same room and just just the sound you make

1271
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,820
When two people kind of discover each other in the same room, which is like

1272
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:50,880
To start hammering on the joystick trying to kill the other spy good times good times

1273
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,840
So that's a classic video game of the week spy versus spy on the Commodore 64 is where I remember it

1274
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,280
Most fondly but a lot of you probably are more familiar with it on the Nintendo Entertainment System

1275
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:05,460
So there you have it classic video game of the week. I'm surprised you never played that Loki

1276
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,100
I thought for some reason you had said in an earlier show you'd actually played it once so that was part of the reason I

1277
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,800
Picked it because it definitely seemed like a you type of game

1278
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,280
If that makes sense, I guess it makes sense. All right. Anyhow, we are gonna take a break here on orange launch radio

1279
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,720
We're gonna come back and we have plenty more of the show to get into Xbox 360

1280
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,200
We haven't even talked really about the 360, but we have news about

1281
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,280
the warranties for the e74 errors talk about bionic commando and

1282
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,980
Sega games coming to Xbox Live Arcade. Do you really need them?

1283
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:37,760
I know we'll talk about that when we come back all that and more including your chat and your phone calls

1284
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,840
We come back with more of orange lounge radio

1285
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:53,840
And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this lovely Sunday evening April the 19th of 2009 where we're back for more of orange lounge radio

1286
01:25:54,440 --> 01:26:01,000
Myself Rob Roberts and Loki joining you tonight not dark Sakura. She's off. She's at Disneyland having a gay old time with her girlfriends

1287
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:07,100
Not that kind of gay old time, but she's her in about five other girls all giggling girls all went to

1288
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,220
Disneyland and I did see on her Facebook

1289
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:15,860
She updated a picture from Space Mountain and they're all screaming and throwing up metal signs and all that kind of stuff

1290
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,300
So it looks like they're having a fun time, but not here tonight

1291
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,100
But Loki and I are holding down the fort and boy dark Sakura

1292
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,380
Picked a hell of a night to miss I mean it is her birthday

1293
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:27,260
So I understand but we got Final Fantasy 13 demo here in house, which we're checking out here

1294
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:31,980
And I'll tell you what, it's much different to be looking at it than watching it on YouTube. You know what I mean?

1295
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:35,060
It's pretty cool. It's much different to be playing it too. Yes, it is Loki

1296
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,500
Well, you know I haven't really touched it, but Loki. How have you been enjoying it? It's okay

1297
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,340
I mean it just gives you an idea what the games can be like obviously

1298
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:44,940
I can't understand any Japanese. I can read all the translations for it, but

1299
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:50,380
It's neat. You know I'm looking forward to playing the actual game when it comes out

1300
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,300
Later all right well

1301
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,740
Let's get back into some gaming news Loki and by the way just in case you're just joining us

1302
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:59,220
Partway through the show if you're joining us on all games radio

1303
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:04,020
We are doing something a little differently tonight our skype line is open all night long if you want to comment on the stories

1304
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,620
We're talking about one eight seven seven game

1305
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:13,020
Olr or our username on skype is orange launch radio Justin TV if you're joining us there because we have Final Fantasy 13 in our description

1306
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,020
And some people are finding us that way

1307
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:19,820
You are going to hear a bunch of people talking because we are taping a radio show as we've done every week for the past seven

1308
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:23,360
Years it just happens. We have this uber hot hot demo in studio right now

1309
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,100
But if you guys want to give us a call too as long as it's on topic

1310
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,180
We don't care one eight seven seven game, Olr. We'd love to hear from some new people

1311
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:33,480
Let's give them some top topics to talk about we haven't even hit on the Xbox 360

1312
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:39,680
And there's been a lot of news in Microsoft's world this week right Loki. Yeah this week. They announced that they're gonna start supporting

1313
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,240
The e74 errors in their three-year Xbox 360 warranty

1314
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,540
you know you may remember that before the

1315
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:57,160
Announced that they're going to increase the warranty to three years for red rings or the red light of death. I guess or our ODS and

1316
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:04,080
You know those are basically general hardware failures well people are like well

1317
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:10,280
What's an e74 error? And they're like that's a general hardware failure. They're like was that the same thing as like say

1318
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,480
The red you know lights of death or whatever

1319
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,120
Well, no, but yes

1320
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,280
so

1321
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,760
You know basically yes, it's basically the same thing as you know the three rings of death

1322
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,440
Let me go to the phones real quick because we do have a call coming in hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1323
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,600
Hi, this is called anthro. Hey golden. How's it going good?

1324
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,800
We're talking about Xbox 360 in the e74 era have you been a victim of this I?

1325
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,220
Know I I be honest with you. I wish I just had an Xbox 360

1326
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,760
Yeah, that's what the next console. I want to get but I to be honest with you. I'm 17

1327
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,480
I still don't even have a part-time job, so that'll be my first target is to get a 360 well

1328
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:54,360
It's good to have goals, so to what do we attribute this call then tonight like?

1329
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:00,880
What I want to talk about yes, what are you calling it about? Oh, okay? Yeah about that um I?

1330
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Was I wasn't gonna bring it up in let

1331
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:11,480
Loki chose to bring it up again the Bob's game fan. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to open up a fight, but

1332
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,040
If I'm if I'm correct to bring up a point Rob you guys are trashing on it

1333
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,520
But you said you don't like to judge things based on demos

1334
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:29,200
Yes, and no I mean I here's the thing I'm not trashing the game because I haven't played the game Loki's

1335
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,040
I guess somehow played or whatever I have not played the game, so I'm not trashing the game

1336
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,440
But the designer is a butt nugget like I don't like reading about him

1337
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,520
I don't like hearing about all his antics going on on the blogs going on right now

1338
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,620
I think he's kind of an attention whore, and he's doing a decent job at it. I mean props to him

1339
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,040
I just don't want to buy into it, so yeah

1340
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,840
I do have a little steam cloud that's being brought up right now, but whatever

1341
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,080
It's every gamer gets a voice so if you want to bring it up then fine, but look

1342
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,000
No, I know I'm just saying you know and I don't really want to talk about him on the show

1343
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,480
I'm sorry I even mentioned. I played the demo again, but

1344
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:06,800
Really, I mean yeah, you shouldn't judge a game based on the demo

1345
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,400
but the demo gives you a good idea of how the game is gonna be and

1346
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,320
You know that's how you base. You know when you play a demo for a game. That's basically what it is

1347
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,920
it's to get an idea what the full game is going to be so you can make a decision whether you want to purchase it or

1348
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,400
Not and based on what I've seen so far. It looks very amateurish

1349
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:31,920
It's not very good gameplay, and there are some really annoying parts that just would drive me crazy, and I

1350
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:39,160
Not plan on picking it up ever if it even ever comes out, and I could definitely see why Nintendo wouldn't want to

1351
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,960
You know if it were up to them to publish the game or something I would see them

1352
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,600
Not picking this up most definitely. I mean there's avenues

1353
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,320
He can go through there's like for example a company called graffiti interactive that

1354
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:55,720
They've put out a game or they're about to put out a game if it ever comes out

1355
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,040
black sigil

1356
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,880
the

1357
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,880
Say the mark of the exile or something like that

1358
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,960
it used to be a homebrew game and

1359
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,960
They developers worked on it, and they made an actual full-fledged

1360
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,880
Ds game, and it looks okay, it looks like a pretty good RPG

1361
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,800
But that's the way you do it you go through one of these smaller companies to publish your game until your game is you know?

1362
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:25,560
Hot shit, you know if it comes out, and it's really awesome then cool, but honestly based of what I see if this game

1363
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,480
If this is a half an hour worth of his game say and you know his full games like you know hundreds of hours long

1364
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,720
Or something like that. I could not see myself playing this game for another 30 minutes let alone hundreds of hours gold anthro

1365
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,080
Let's let you make a counterpoint because obviously you feel differently

1366
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,600
What do you want to say well well?

1367
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,400
Okay, I'm gonna throw the echo in and stuff

1368
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:54,460
Sorry, this is getting really distracting you guys kind of I can hear myself right now

1369
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,160
Make sure your speakers are turned down there in-house or whatever sometimes. We have those issues on Skype

1370
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:04,280
I have I have a headset. I'm just gonna keep talking like nothing happened. Basically. I don't know

1371
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:08,160
I'm gonna wait till a full review comes out for the game first and

1372
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:12,780
If people say it sucks, then then I'm going to probably leave them

1373
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:19,160
Very I'm just it's my opinion fair enough, and you know that's cool, but here's my my question to you

1374
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,300
What do you think about all the antics such as the?

1375
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,960
leafing of the Nintendo store and the locking himself in the room I

1376
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,240
Think that was a little overboard and

1377
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:38,400
If it really well even if it really was an act it got it got all these people like to create drama on the internet

1378
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,640
And not that I should really care what people in the internet think but yeah, it's kind of I

1379
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,240
Can see what where he was trying what he was trying to do is trying to be original, but?

1380
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,880
The echoing went away, which is good, and it, but I think he's trying to see how it was trying to be original

1381
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,880
But I think he also got a lot of people falsely worried over something that really didn't even happen

1382
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,760
So I guess I can see where that came from the game for itself though. I

1383
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,000
Think it's my it is my kind of game

1384
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,680
I I'm just interested in alone in the fact that it's it was made by one person

1385
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:16,180
And it took that long and not much effort, so I am going to probably give it a try

1386
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,880
But it was made by one person

1387
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,720
So you gotta say that again look yeah, I had us muted. I was gonna say let me put it this way

1388
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,680
It looks like it was made by one person. I mean it shows and that is not a compliment all

1389
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,300
Right both anthro. We got to let you go, but you know what that's fine. No fine

1390
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:37,680
And this will be the last hopefully that we get to talk about I just wanted to put my opinion

1391
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,960
I was thinking about that

1392
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,120
The whole time that you guys have been talking about this ever since you first started. That's fine

1393
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,800
You know what we don't mind being called out, so thank you for the call and have a good one

1394
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,840
Okay, all right later

1395
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:55,080
It's the show where every gamer has a voice even if you're a Bob fan even if the guy is kind of a what?

1396
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,080
Did I say butt nugget which the chat room see?

1397
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:02,360
Cuz I'm so mature all right, so 80s. Did you finish your talk?

1398
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:07,680
I don't think you quite finished the Xbox 360 e74 thing do we talk about the warranties are now extended

1399
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:12,120
Yeah, they're basically extended it basically if you had a failure

1400
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,960
You know recently I guess they're going to

1401
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:23,720
Refund you know you your money by July 1st 2009 and you can claim

1402
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,720
I guess you'll need to claim

1403
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Your repair something on

1404
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,880
xbox.com support before November 1st

1405
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,120
But so you have some time to go and if you were one of those people that got screwed didn't we have a caller that?

1406
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,920
Was in that predicament

1407
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,480
I want to say we got a call about this somebody got an e74 error and had to send it back and they were pissed

1408
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:46,000
Cuz it's gonna cost $100 so a god. I hope you're still listening to the show go

1409
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:51,200
Back and get your money back. I'm gonna take another call before we get into the next story. Hi. You're on orange launch radio

1410
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,200
Who's this?

1411
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:59,560
Breath law breast law I am so glad you called in because I did not get a chance to talk about the contest

1412
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,120
Did you hear about the train wreck that was our show last week?

1413
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:09,160
I we actually went over it on under sedation alive last night. Oh god, and I can only imagine

1414
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:13,960
Oh, and I please don't tell me Travis has a recording. Please don't tell me Travis is recording

1415
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,960
Well, it's Travis. What do you expect? Oh god. Alright, so so okay. Well quickly what happened on under station life

1416
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,760
Well, we just went over it cuz I hadn't heard it and I just heard you go off and I'm like wow

1417
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,760
I have never heard or I'll go off like that. That was a little surprising

1418
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:32,720
You know, I thought like I saw the context of the conversation that sparked and I'm like

1419
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,920
I might have done the same thing in this situation

1420
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,360
So yeah, I gotta say though

1421
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,840
I did listen to the playback because there is an archive of it somewhere I'm not gonna advertise where but um

1422
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,560
I I just I laughed my ass off literally laughed my ass off at how Loki just

1423
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,080
Didn't miss a beat and after I stormed out of the room Loki was just like, okay

1424
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:56,080
Well, let's get back in in the news. Like I just I was just laughing so hard at that like Loki

1425
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:00,600
So I didn't have a Perrier water. I mean for those of you don't know I was there a couple years ago

1426
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:04,580
He needs his Perrier water or he gets grumpy. Shut up. Oh, alright

1427
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:08,540
But well, what did you call it to talk about tonight? Let's get out of the way first

1428
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:12,740
Well, I was obviously a director program at soccer con

1429
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:17,020
I'm on the executive board and that was this past weekend and I had a fantastic time and

1430
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:21,220
I actually gave Rob a call Thursday night because we had our

1431
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:25,180
Industry guest autograph session and I had brought with me to this session

1432
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:32,060
My personal copy of Dance Dance Revolution supernova for the PlayStation 2 and for those of you who have heard me

1433
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:37,780
Fanboy about the con for the past year. One of the guests was smile DK

1434
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,060
And

1435
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,280
That's big for D

1436
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,620
I like I know they're like some of our listeners are not gonna know who the hell that is and then there's gonna be other

1437
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:49,500
People that are like, oh my god, that's like the DDR band

1438
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:56,040
Basically the people who know who smell DK as were the people who voted DDR into the sweet 16 orange on radio March Madness

1439
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,040
However, I digress. Yes

1440
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,700
Um Veronica and uh, Hannah

1441
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:07,000
Both signed the copy of DDR supernova in the colors scheme of the game

1442
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,640
so one signatures in black ones in red and I have it and

1443
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,400
I don't want it

1444
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,380
How rude I know

1445
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:22,360
So well and also what was really cool about it is not a lot of people knows

1446
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,960
Let's listen to it. So I've been on a cane for about five six months

1447
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,400
so

1448
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,180
Smell DK actually signed my cane. Oh, wow

1449
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,000
You're on a king there. What the hell happened to you? Are you okay?

1450
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,440
well

1451
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:40,460
You're going with a BMW and I didn't win. So I'm sorry to hear that

1452
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:45,240
It's all good. But actually here in the coming weeks here on orange launch radio

1453
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:51,680
Rob or myself or somebody will be organizing a contest and the prize will be this signed copy of Dance Dance Revolution

1454
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:58,080
Supernova signed by smile DK which for if you're like a Bamani fan. This is a huge collector's item

1455
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
This is this is priceless

1456
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,200
It's it's really awesome. And um, I I do have to say that I

1457
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:12,160
Mean I've been with the con for five years and this is the first time actually gave a crap about a guest being there and

1458
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
The girls are so nice

1459
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:21,480
Let me give you a little sample if you have no idea who smile DK is. Here you go. So

1460
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,280
Happy you'll barf

1461
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
Yeah, I

1462
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:40,860
Mean and yeah anybody who's played even a lick of DDR is sort of smile DK

1463
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:46,500
But we're gonna be coming up with a contest here in the coming weeks to give this away to one lucky listener

1464
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,220
So I'd hope to do it tonight, but with everything else that have been going on with last week

1465
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:55,140
We didn't get to it, but it would definitely probably next week or the week after but it'll definitely be something not just for life

1466
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,860
But for podcast listeners

1467
01:38:56,860 --> 01:39:03,700
Yeah, it will be awesome. I will say definitely keep an eye on orange lounge radio.com. We will be thinking of something

1468
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:09,980
Also, I in my incredibly late to the boat review

1469
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,700
I finally got to play fallout 3 and

1470
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:19,020
And I have to say it is one of the 10 greatest games I've ever played. That's a pretty shining review

1471
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,700
Why do you like it so damn much?

1472
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,420
well

1473
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:25,600
It's basically oblivion for one. It's oblivion without the suck

1474
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:31,100
Wait a minute. Wait a damn. Yeah oblivion does not suck, sir

1475
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:36,100
I'm sorry Rob if you want to if you want to compare it tomorrow wind it it's it's a horrible game

1476
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:42,660
Whatever. All right. All right, whatever. Well and no and the the older school series has progressively gotten better

1477
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:45,340
and then oblivion just kind of took the series in a nosedive, but

1478
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:53,980
It was just the combat system was fun, you know a little if you're listening to the radio stations and you're walking around that's hilarious

1479
01:39:56,140 --> 01:40:00,260
The story kept kept me going it was really one of the it was the first game

1480
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:04,940
Since like I was back in my ps1 days is like a Final Fantasy fanboy

1481
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:08,780
Where I stayed up till 4 in the morning to play the freaking game Wow

1482
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,860
Was that because you were still on a high from Sakura condo?

1483
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:15,540
No, this is before soccer con like, okay

1484
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:20,380
I I've been on an unemployment spat and I that's over with but um, I've

1485
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:26,740
basically my week my weeks have been consisted of playing Wow or some video game and I played fallout 3 for a week straight and

1486
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,740
Then beat it

1487
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:32,440
But uh, yeah, it's it's seriously that good

1488
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:38,640
Well that I have yet to play the game. I feel so out of touch, but one of these days I'll sit down with it

1489
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,200
Yeah, DMN bring us back on track here a little bit if you can because we got to get back into Xbox 360 news and

1490
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:50,520
Back into the show, but we've been talking about how the warranties were just recently extended for the e74 errors for Xbox 360

1491
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,880
I don't know if there's any any comment you have on that whole thing, but

1492
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:01,280
I'm not I actually cannot comment on it. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot where you're at now. All right

1493
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,920
That's fine. Sorry Rob. Do you kill joy? Let me well, how about Final Fantasy 13?

1494
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:12,360
Can you say anything about Final Fantasy 13 and and the hype surrounding it since that's something we're demoing on Justin TV tonight. I

1495
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,160
I will say from the footage I've seen

1496
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:23,760
This game better live up to the hype or I am I'm not touching a Final Fantasy game from from 13 on

1497
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
It looks like it might be pretty hot

1498
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,720
Because 12 12 was a step up because I think the series has progressively gone down since 8 I hated 9

1499
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,960
I hated 10 don't get me started about 10 to if I say anything bad about 11, you're gonna hang up on me

1500
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,400
and

1501
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,680
12 12 was a step in the right direction. It was a good game

1502
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:48,040
It brought it back to the fantasy roots and kept and the game kept being fun

1503
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:54,320
So I have high hopes for 13, but if 13 is a disappointment, I'm I'm done with Final Fantasy

1504
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,880
All right, fair enough. All right

1505
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,160
Well Dman, we're gonna let you go so you get back into the show and have a good one

1506
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,760
And we'll definitely be hearing from you in the coming weeks and your own show

1507
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,760
Give it a plug real quick for you. Hang up on you

1508
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:10,400
under sedation live every Saturday here on all games at 8 Pacific 11 Eastern if you like

1509
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,000
vulgarity and

1510
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:19,360
Geekery and whatnot and laughs be sure to tune in dick fart jokes sci-fi talking boobs pretty much, right?

1511
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,500
Yep. All right. Sounds great. Have a good one Dman

1512
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:27,620
Hey later, buddy. Bye our breasts Lowell. I keep forgetting he changed his name officially

1513
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:30,140
It's like you know, everyone still calls Prince Prince after he changed his name

1514
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:35,100
All right back into some news back as some gaming news bubble bobble is actually returning to the Xbox 360

1515
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,980
Bubble bobble is apparently coming out

1516
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:45,780
I guess it's Taito bringing this out bubble bobble neo is the name of the game and apparently this is discovered on some foreign release

1517
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:51,140
Date list is from Germany's video game rating board. It's actually for Xbox Live arcade

1518
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:56,180
They're thinking I want to say didn't we have a story on this a while ago where we heard that this is coming out for

1519
01:42:56,180 --> 01:43:02,460
Arcade I thought I don't remember that. I thought I remember we were a while ago. Oh, yeah, we were I think so

1520
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,500
this is probably just a port of it for Xbox 360 and

1521
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:10,340
There's probably a PlayStation 3 one around the corner as well. It makes sense. I'm sure it is

1522
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:15,980
Yeah act deaf in our chat room chat that orange lesser day comm says bubble bobble neo. You are the one

1523
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,140
Get it old-school joke, by the way. I saw a matrix reloaded for

1524
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:24,020
Six dollars on DVD at Suncoast the other day. Yeah

1525
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:30,420
Those older catalog tiles are cheap and one more comment from dark Tetsuya Rob, but can you get past level 30?

1526
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:35,100
They will never live that down and rightfully so Christ. Yeah

1527
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:43,220
Well, Jonathan blow the creator of the hit puzzle game braid has

1528
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,660
Revealed that there's a hidden level editor within the PC version

1529
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:56,460
Apparently, he's been kind of teasing it. He says one more people have played a slash finished the game

1530
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,140
There will be an update to unlock it

1531
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,620
You know, it says basically a level editor will allow players

1532
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,580
to extend the life of the puzzle title with

1533
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:14,340
The potential to add up to another full game worth of puzzles Wow, and you can also implement

1534
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:20,020
New things into it including importing your own images from Photoshop. What's manics?

1535
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,700
You know stuff like that. So

1536
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:27,580
That's gonna be pretty neat. I wonder is this something that you know, will you be able to share levels with other people?

1537
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:31,340
Maybe I'm sure you probably could that's a bummer that the Xbox 360 crowd missed out on that

1538
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:35,580
Yeah, that kind of sucks. But you know, there could always be that happens, I guess

1539
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:43,180
Alright, uh, let's see to also talk about Xbox 360 bionic commando is gonna be getting a multiplayer demo very soon coming to Xbox live

1540
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:48,460
As in this month if you want to check that out no word about the PlayStation 3 version of the demo yet

1541
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:53,060
But apparently you will get a full 8 player bionic commando multiplayer demo

1542
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:57,140
The map is called vertigo that you're gonna get technically the map is built for 16

1543
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:03,420
But of course, this is just a demo they're gonna limit it to 8 that is coming out later this month in April both team

1544
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:08,020
That's deathmatch and capture the flag mode. So that should be interesting

1545
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:11,820
I mean, I don't know how I feel about these, you know, I love old-school bionic commando

1546
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:15,980
But I'm not sure if I'm gonna be into it as a first-person shooter type game, but we'll see

1547
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,860
I definitely want to give it a shot. I guess that's the whole reason behind a demo, right?

1548
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:21,940
Yeah, so check that out when it comes out a little later this month

1549
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:27,900
I'm very interested in the demo demo looks all the game looks awesome. So yeah, I definitely give it a try

1550
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:29,780
You know as we heard from the caller earlier

1551
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:32,420
I shouldn't base my whole opinion on the game off a demo

1552
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:37,780
But here's one of those cases where it's like it's definitely gonna sway me like either it's gonna show me that I'm interested in this

1553
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:42,380
Game whatsoever or that I just know I can sit this one out and just I think no

1554
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,620
I think you can't you can't review a game based off of demo

1555
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:48,700
I mean you can't just say okay this game's gonna suck because of the demo

1556
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:52,260
But at the same time it gives you a good impression of how the game's gonna be it

1557
01:45:52,940 --> 01:46:00,220
Usually a demo I've never seen a demo that was just absolute crap and the game was just awesome. You know, so I

1558
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,820
Don't know it usually

1559
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:07,060
It's a good indicator of how the game's gonna be I gotta read some comments from chat before you get into the next story

1560
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:11,740
Loki some comments from chat SSJ 100 Matt says on the braid story in the level editor

1561
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,380
the real question is why haven't hackers found the code for this feature already and

1562
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:21,980
Death wishing says Photoshop levels Oh God penis land platformer. Yeah, you know, you're gonna see plenty of those levels on YouTube

1563
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,660
I don't know why people haven't found it yet. Maybe they weren't looking for it

1564
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:28,820
Maybe part of its missing and that's what's in the patch maybe

1565
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,660
Maybe it's a whole Resident Evil

1566
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,980
You know multiplayer type situation

1567
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,980
Um

1568
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:39,940
Interesting enough this we've been hearing you

1569
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:47,020
Constant rumors of some old-school arcade games from Sega coming to Xbox Live arcade

1570
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:53,000
well now there's a little bit more confirmation about it including achievements that have basically been

1571
01:46:54,020 --> 01:47:01,740
Appearing online my gamer card has dug up achievements for altered beasts comic zone and shinobi all three of those

1572
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:09,380
Tiles belonging to the you know, kind of classic arcade collection that's been available or will be available online

1573
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:11,740
so

1574
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:17,580
You know, it's interesting those they didn't mention anything about Sonic 3 Gunstar Heroes and Phantasy Star 2

1575
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:22,780
But you maybe those are coming later on but at least these three probably soon enough

1576
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:30,140
Now, why would I care though if I already have that other collection? I don't know it just this seems kind of useless

1577
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:34,860
I mean, you're wrong. These games are pretty rad. But well, it's the same reason why they release, you know

1578
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:40,940
Pac-man on Xbox Live arcade one, you know, it's available in you know, the Namco collection as well

1579
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:43,380
You know, it's just another way for people who died

1580
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,380
But I mean Pac-man is like ten dollars and that collections like, you know, 30 or 40

1581
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:51,860
You're talking about this collection is 30 bucks and you get what like 25 30 games

1582
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:59,140
40 40 games or some shit. Okay, so I think it's like $40 40 games, whatever versus being like five dollars for one individual game

1583
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:03,060
That's a huge difference huge difference. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean

1584
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:07,720
It's this just doesn't make sense. This is for definitely the impulse buyer or something, right?

1585
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,300
Maybe achievement horse. Oh, I guess achievement horse

1586
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:15,900
Well, they were unless they are going back and altering the actual code of the games, but I highly doubt that

1587
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:18,660
Yeah, I doubt it. I'm sorry

1588
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:21,740
I thought Xbox got a little stricter on what they were gonna let get on the the

1589
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:26,220
Service and they weren't just gonna let all these old ports get on there, but it seems like that's what's happening

1590
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:28,220
We

1591
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,900
They

1592
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:34,740
Go where the money is, I guess I guess I guess if they can even make $20 off it. It's worth it

1593
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:35,620
I guess

1594
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:40,700
All right. Well anyhow, we're gonna get in the part of the show where you get to interact with us through the email

1595
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:45,860
This is a good way for the podcasters to get involved when they can't listen live mailbag orange launch radio calm

1596
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:48,380
Let's open up eat old mailbag. Let's see what's in there

1597
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:54,460
Again we always invite your emails and mailbag orange launch radio calm

1598
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:58,540
We've got a shitload to get through tonight because we haven't been able to do it for a week or so

1599
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:02,260
First email tonight is gonna come to us from James

1600
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:06,020
Patrick is the username. I've recently moved to Taiwan

1601
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:09,180
I was wondering how easy is it to mod a 360 to play import games?

1602
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:12,180
Can I mod my 360 be region 3 and play online?

1603
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,620
Games that release over here are much cheaper about 40 to 45 dollars after conversion

1604
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:21,820
Depending on the store in the current exchange rate plus a lot of the Asian versions over here are marked saying the manual and game

1605
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:25,540
Is in English I'd like to buy these games since the cheaper price tag adds up fast

1606
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:29,820
I'm not experienced with modding, but I know Loki is basically I'd like to have a region 3 360

1607
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,480
Plus I have a lot of American games don't want to have two of them any advice

1608
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:37,820
There's no way to have a region free 360. You can either buy region free games or you can

1609
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:47,080
You know get a mod chip and change your region of your 360 to be an agent Asian region free now 360. That's it

1610
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:52,680
Next question comes from stir lock. Hi guys stir lock here from Sonoma County. Hey, that's almost a neighbor of ours

1611
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:57,400
Howdy, I've been great wine by the way. I've been listening for a couple years now and love the show

1612
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:01,040
I want to thank dark Sakura for mentioning mentioning the FC mobile last week

1613
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,640
I picked one up and it totally rocks despite the button layout being a bit strange

1614
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:11,000
Nothing beats playing Mike Tyson's punch-out on the bus. Anyway, keep up the great work PS. Where can I find brilliant to rave?

1615
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,080
I've been looking for a while and can't seem to find it anywhere what he's mentioning you guys is

1616
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:21,080
A song that was played in the live only segment of our show because obviously we can't play licensed music on the podcast

1617
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:25,080
But there was a remix of an old song from DDR called brilliant to you

1618
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:30,080
But the song was brilliant to rave that's from the new diverse system film diverse systems

1619
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,080
Where can they order that if they want to get that diverse dot?

1620
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,080
JP

1621
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,080
Next email comes from Robert M

1622
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:42,080
The first question was for Jamie about samurai showdown anthologies. I can't answer that sadly. She's not here

1623
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:48,080
Secondly is the Sanrio character officially named Hello Kitty or she just named Kitty and her franchise is Hello Kitty. Just curious

1624
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:53,080
I believe the franchise is Hello Kitty, but I don't know as much I think it's she's called Hello Kitty

1625
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:57,080
I'm yeah as much as I claim to be the whore of

1626
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:04,080
Sanrio I actually don't know maybe one of our chatters knows, but I'm pretty sure it's still Hello Kitty

1627
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:09,080
Anyway, he continues on with some follow-up emails. Sorry to hear about Rob Smith

1628
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:14,080
He continues on with some follow-up emails. Sorry to hear about Rob's video card and hopefully the idiot who made that comment is banned

1629
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,080
I can't seem to get in chat myself lately

1630
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,080
Which may be related to a Java era on my end since I can't seem to get into chat room for Bobby shows either

1631
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:24,080
If I want to make a donation to help out and don't really want to use PayPal for whatever reason

1632
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,080
Where can I send a check because I'm really looking forward to hearing next week's show

1633
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:33,080
It sounds like the other listeners took care of that and that's a very generous thing to offer hang on to it

1634
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:39,080
I'm hoping in in the coming weeks we can have other ways that you guys can throw money at us if you really really want to

1635
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:43,080
That we'll put to good use. I know we've been talking shirts for like three years

1636
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:48,080
I really want to make that happen in the near future. It's just it's just time and everything else going on

1637
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,080
Hopefully soon, so we'll let you know

1638
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:58,080
Also, there was one other follow-up email that came in

1639
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:04,080
I apologize if I was out of line stating that the chatter who asked why Rob bothered trying to run out of the show again should be banned

1640
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:08,080
As I said I wasn't in chat, so I have no context of the comment just Rob's reaction

1641
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,080
I absolutely understand that in a stressful situation

1642
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:14,080
Especially as one as serious as computer failure such criticism is most unwelcome and hurtful

1643
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,080
I have no intention of defending his comments, but I can't say I have the right to condemn them either

1644
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,080
That said I still hope the situation with your hardware improves

1645
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:25,080
I find not being able to listen to my favorite podcast to be as frustrating as you not being able to get it running

1646
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,080
If I'm able to contribute a small donation, et cetera, et cetera

1647
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,080
So thank you very much for the kind words

1648
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:35,080
And you know it looks like we're all in good shape now and everything's hunky-dory happy

1649
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:38,080
And you know it was just it was just a bad week

1650
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:42,080
Some weeks are good weeks and some weeks are bad weeks and let's just leave it at that

1651
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,080
An email from Cheeseburger asks

1652
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,080
I was wondering if there is an Xbox Live OLR clan name like the OL Army

1653
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,080
Or at least a motto that all OLR listeners can have

1654
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,080
Why yes we do have one, the OLR clan is the OL Army

1655
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,080
That is the official clan

1656
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,080
We have a Steam community available

1657
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:02,080
If you look a lot of our clans are right there on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1658
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,080
If you look on that little left side there's a box that says like

1659
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:09,080
God it has all the other logos of the other sites

1660
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,080
And it's like OLR around the net or something like that

1661
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,080
And I can't remember the name of it

1662
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,080
Son of a gun I'm going to OrangeLaunchRadio.com right now

1663
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,080
Extended Play that's what it's called

1664
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:20,080
And it has links to a lot of our communities we're in including the Steam community

1665
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,080
Yes the OL Army motto is

1666
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,080
Loki, do you know it?

1667
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,080
Don't be a dick

1668
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,080
Don't be a dick that is the OLR motto

1669
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,080
Because if you're going to play games online with listeners of our show

1670
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:30,080
Please don't be a dick

1671
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:33,080
Because there's enough of those there out on Xbox Live

1672
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,080
People that are just absolute jerks and all of that

1673
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:40,080
So if you want to be in the OL Army you need to swear that you're not going to be a dick

1674
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,080
Alright next up from

1675
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:46,080
Let's see this listener goes by

1676
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:51,080
It's not signed, oh it's Spazinator in the email address

1677
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,080
Hi everyone I thought I would email you folks some questions and comments

1678
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:56,080
Well more of a recommendation than a comment but I won't get into semantics

1679
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:00,080
Since you three have professed the love of all things DDR on numerous occasions

1680
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,080
Well hold on

1681
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,080
Hold on I wouldn't go that far

1682
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:08,080
We used to all love DDR but DDR got really stale in the past few years

1683
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,080
I just want to clarify that

1684
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,080
So we don't love all things DDR

1685
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:16,080
I think there will always be love for DDR because without it we would have never met

1686
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:19,080
But that doesn't mean we love each and every game that comes out of the franchise

1687
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,080
Perhaps you can explain something to me

1688
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,080
What exactly is the reasons that you get into these games

1689
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:25,080
I get stuff like Rock Band and Guitar Hero

1690
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:29,080
But the idea behind pushing arrows to music I've never heard of before doesn't seem very interesting

1691
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,080
Well to me anyway

1692
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,080
Oh that was just fun

1693
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,080
I know it was just fun it was such a different type of arcade game

1694
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:37,080
I mean you moved you know what I mean

1695
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,080
Like it wasn't just you stood there

1696
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,080
And for me here's the thing also and maybe it's just me

1697
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,080
I suck at fighting games

1698
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,080
I was never very good at them

1699
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:49,080
I wasn't very good at a lot of the types of games like shooter games that were in the arcade

1700
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,080
But when it came to the music games like I was pretty good at it

1701
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,080
You know what I mean like it was the type of game I could get into and be good at

1702
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,080
Because I was into music in high school

1703
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,080
And I know Jamie has a musical background

1704
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,080
I know Loki likes to mix music

1705
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:05,080
He's a big fan of music and has like music as a hobby you could say

1706
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,080
I think that's one common thing we all have

1707
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,080
Not to say you're not into music

1708
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:13,080
But definitely I think it's something that enables us to be into DDR so much more

1709
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:15,080
I think would be a big part of it

1710
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,080
Makes sense fair enough

1711
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,080
Yeah

1712
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,080
Have any of you played Comet Crash yet?

1713
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,080
If not I recommend picking it up from the PSN store

1714
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:26,080
It's another tower defense game like Pixel Junk Monsters

1715
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,080
It has more of a sci-fi feel and you can send vehicles on the offensive

1716
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,080
Whereas PJ Monsters is purely defensive

1717
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,080
Personally after playing this game for a week I would recommend getting this title

1718
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,080
For my last subject question and on a semi related note

1719
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:40,080
Have you played Ragdoll Kung Fu yet?

1720
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,080
If so what are your impressions of the game?

1721
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,080
Haven't played it

1722
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,080
Haven't played it yet, it looked okay

1723
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:46,080
Is it worth getting?

1724
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,080
From what little I've seen it looks like a cross between the Super Smash Brothers games

1725
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:52,080
And parodies of classic Hong Kong Kung Fu movies from the 60s and 70s

1726
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,080
Is this a fair assessment?

1727
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:57,080
I heard it wasn't as fun as it seemed really

1728
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:02,080
Since neither of us have played it we'll have to ask the chat room if there's any follow up comments on that one

1729
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,080
Lastly

1730
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,080
I want to read

1731
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:11,080
He sent another email later in the week

1732
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:14,080
That went into this

1733
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,080
I've come across some rumors or speculation from another websites and podcasts within the relatively near future

1734
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:22,080
PSN will either be receiving more PS1 titles for download

1735
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,080
Or at least a minimum we will hear some kind of official announcement of some kind

1736
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,080
That will reportedly occur no later than E3

1737
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,080
Furthermore it's been suggested that if new PS1 games do become available

1738
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,080
This batch will be some of Capcom's classic PS1 titles

1739
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,080
Oh I hope Mega Man Legends is in there

1740
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:40,080
I thought I remember seeing something from Capcom and more PS1 games

1741
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,080
Well I remember seeing something about Marvel vs Capcom 2 achievements on 360

1742
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,080
Remember that

1743
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:49,080
Also another rumor suggested that in tandem with the release of Capcom PS1 titles

1744
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:52,080
An upgraded version of SNK vs Capcom 2 will be coming out at the same time

1745
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,080
Oh shit I hope that's true

1746
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,080
That's one fighting game I can get into

1747
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,080
That is like one of my favorite fighting games ever

1748
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:01,080
It's been suggested that SVC2 will

1749
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,080
Wasn't it Capcom vs SNK?

1750
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:09,080
Anyway we'll get the same HD remix treatment as Super Puzzle Fighter and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo did before this

1751
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:13,080
As I've stated these are still just rumors until some kind of official announcement is made one way or another

1752
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:17,080
But this does give us something to possibly look forward to if proven to be true

1753
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,080
That would be cool

1754
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,080
Interesting

1755
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:23,080
Let me read this last thing because this will be the last email here for me about tonight

1756
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,080
Also from Spaznator

1757
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:29,080
As you probably already know PS3 owners at their discretion can install another operating system on their system

1758
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,080
Usually Yellow Dog Linux

1759
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,080
What benefit does this ultimately give you if any?

1760
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,080
What's the appeal in doing this?

1761
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:38,080
Does this ultimately give you open source equivalents to like Microsoft's Word, Excel and so on?

1762
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:42,080
I already know I won't be able to play Linux supported PC games due to RAM limitations

1763
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,080
That's a given

1764
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,080
Furthermore should I decide to take the proverbial plunge

1765
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:47,080
Where can I buy the disc to install Linux?

1766
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:50,080
You don't buy the disc you can download it off the internet

1767
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,080
You can burn an ISO that way

1768
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,080
You could buy, they have Linux that's available

1769
01:57:55,080 --> 01:58:00,080
I one time bought it at Best Buy because that was back when I was on dial up

1770
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:06,080
And if I remember correctly I think I was doing that because of something about installing some sort of mod or something

1771
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,080
On a PlayStation 2 or something, I don't remember what it was

1772
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:14,080
But yeah, basically you would download it off the internet and then burn your own disc

1773
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:17,080
Now that doesn't answer though, why?

1774
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,080
Why? To tinker with

1775
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:25,080
That's really the only reason, I mean you're going to be able to basically run a few things

1776
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,080
Probably like some emulators and stuff like that

1777
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,080
You're not going to be able to run any big games or anything

1778
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,080
But it's basically just to tinker with

1779
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:37,080
I'm kind of getting the impression that if you would be interested in this you already know

1780
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:41,080
You know what I mean? Like if this is something that would really interest you, you already know this would interest you

1781
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,080
Right?

1782
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,080
Yeah

1783
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:47,080
Alright, if you're the type of person that wants to try and put Linux on a toaster and all this shit then you already know

1784
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:51,080
And it also stops people from trying to hack the system to put Linux on it

1785
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:52,080
By just opening it up?

1786
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,080
Yep

1787
01:58:53,080 --> 01:59:00,080
And that's a really fair response, you know, Sony kind of bowed down to the hackers in that regard I guess, I don't know

1788
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,080
Alright, well there you have it, that's our mailbag

1789
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:06,080
If you want to send us some more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

1790
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,080
Let's get back into some gaming news, we have a few more

1791
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,080
Loki

1792
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,080
Yes, this was fun

1793
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:17,080
I got an email from my boss regarding this game because he saw a little thing on MTV about it

1794
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:25,080
But apparently there's a developer putting out a, well right now it basically exists as an Unreal 3 mod

1795
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,080
But a game called Ghetto Golf

1796
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:33,080
Basically they describe the game as kind of combining Happy Gilmore with Friday

1797
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:37,080
And the game itself looks very interesting

1798
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:43,080
Kind of cool actually, this was actually a full fledged download for Unreal Tournament 3

1799
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:51,080
And I don't think it's available yet, but if it was, I would probably pick up Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 to at least install this

1800
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:57,080
Because you remember they do run, those mods will work on the PS3 version

1801
01:59:57,080 --> 02:00:02,080
But as of right now it's basically just a mod

1802
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:09,080
But it's kind of cool though because it kind of combines combat with golf and, I don't know, it just looks neat

1803
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:12,080
It's different

1804
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:17,080
Interesting, but no idea if there's any release because they still need somebody to pick it up basically right?

1805
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:23,080
Yeah, basically it says right now Ghetto Golf exists as an Unreal Tournament 3 mod

1806
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:30,080
Illphonic, the publisher, the developer wants a publisher to support its development into a standalone download game

1807
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:34,080
For Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam

1808
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:38,080
But apparently you can check out the Ghetto Golf

1809
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,080
It's GhettoGolf.illphonic.com

1810
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:48,080
And you can check out the game's official website which has nothing other than a splash screen saying coming soon

1811
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:56,080
But I don't know, I would like to download this at least if it's available and try it out as a mod

1812
02:00:56,080 --> 02:01:03,080
I love their website which is awesome, it's got three links here

1813
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:06,080
The business, upcoming shit, and contact us

1814
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:08,080
Nice, very professional

1815
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:12,080
By the way, ActDeft in our chat room right now brings up a really good point

1816
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:15,080
I don't know if maybe somebody else said it but I noticed ActDeft is posting the link

1817
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:21,080
Kind of a follow up to the question we got in the email bag about where can I join an OLR army or how can I be part of an OLR clan

1818
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:26,080
In case you forgot, in the midst of all the avatars and all this on Xbox 360

1819
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:33,080
OLR does have an official gamer pic that actually is available for download officially through Microsoft on the gamer marketplace

1820
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:39,080
And now with the whole online integration, ActDeft is posting a link in chat right now

1821
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,080
You can just click on that and it will put it in your queue to download

1822
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:45,080
It is free and it's part of a gamer pic collection of a bunch of all games radio shows

1823
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:52,080
So you get all games interactive, Bobby Blackwolf and some of the other video game outsiders and some of the other shows that are on the network

1824
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:56,080
All have a little gamer pic that you can wear with pride on your little gamer card

1825
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:00,080
Because everybody has a freaking avatar so now it's unique to not have an avatar

1826
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:04,080
You know what I mean? So check that out if you would like

1827
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:09,080
Meanwhile I want to move into another story here real quick about the game Demigod

1828
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:15,080
I did not, I barely know anything about this game but I know it was a game put out by Stardock

1829
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:20,080
And I know that they were trying like a new kind of thing where they weren't going to try to combat piracy so much in this game

1830
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:23,080
But here's the thing, I don't know if this came back to bite him in the butt or what

1831
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:30,080
But apparently he went to the blog and said that 120,000 people connected to this game on launch day

1832
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:33,080
Only 18,000 were legitimate customers

1833
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:39,080
And here's the thing too about, this was a compound problem basically

1834
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:44,080
Can I say this real quick though? Is that they had tested this for 50,000 players at peak times

1835
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,080
They were not ready for this type of load

1836
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:57,080
Yeah and it also hurt them the fact that the game was released by Gamestop early because they broke street on it

1837
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:04,080
And of course they claim it's Stardock's problem for not telling them it had a street date which is a load of crap

1838
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:08,080
But according to them that's why and so because it leaked out there early

1839
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:15,080
Not only did they have to basically stay Easter weekend to get the servers online and that kind of stuff

1840
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:22,080
But also hacker groups got a hold of the game earlier and so now less people

1841
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:30,080
Now that it's available for download before the game actually really comes out everywhere else

1842
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:35,080
A lot of people just said screw it I'm just going to go download it because I really want to play this game

1843
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,080
Which is too bad

1844
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:42,080
That's a bummer because Stardock was really taking a risk by not putting copy protection on the games

1845
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:45,080
And to kind of have it come back and bite him in the ass kind of sucks

1846
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:53,080
I mean yeah well now gamers can't bitch if you know the Stardocks next game has some sort of DRM on it

1847
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:57,080
Well too bad you guys didn't buy the last one so oh well

1848
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:01,080
Alright so you know I don't know but this whole situation just gets us a little bit angsty

1849
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:21,080
And just seemed like the appropriate time to drop in a regular segment we do here on the show called the FUs of the week

1850
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:26,080
Now DarkSakura isn't here tonight to start us off but I'm sure if she were here she would say something along the lines of

1851
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:32,080
God I hate traffic on the way to LA and there was this one driver who really pissed me off and blah blah blah

1852
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:34,080
FU to stupid drivers

1853
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:37,080
I'd say FU to stupid parents because she's at Disneyland obviously

1854
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:39,080
That could be too

1855
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,080
Alright well Loki what's your FUs of the week

1856
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:50,080
FU to a sore throat that I have right now because I hope I'm not getting sick because I don't really like being sick right now

1857
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,080
That sucks

1858
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:56,080
FU to candy for being so delicious I've been sitting here and I've eaten like 30 little butterscotch disc things

1859
02:04:56,080 --> 02:05:01,080
And I thought that was the type of candy that like 70 year olds are supposed to enjoy but I love those little butterscotch discs

1860
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:05,080
I don't know what it is I got like a giant bag of them for a dollar at Walmart

1861
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:09,080
And they're so addicting and I know I'm going to break all my teeth on them but I don't care

1862
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:11,080
FU to candy for being delicious

1863
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:13,080
Well that was a short FU segment

1864
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:17,080
Alright well Loki has some news about the PSP

1865
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:23,080
Yes I do, the PSP of course you may remember that there was an exploit that came out

1866
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,080
Another TIFF file overflow

1867
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:29,080
You would think that they would figure out not to do that

1868
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:35,080
Or to at least protect against that because almost every single version of the PSP has been broken that way

1869
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:48,080
But apparently the new PSP 3000's there is a TIFF exploit that they're now kind of working into a new version of the HEN operating system or homebrew enablers

1870
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,080
What basically they call it

1871
02:05:50,080 --> 02:06:01,080
So the HEN will now be, they're going to be stripping it down, the enabler and they're going to be adding some features of the M33 custom firmwares

1872
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:08,080
And it will allow you to boot up homebrew regardless but maybe restrictive to certain applications right now

1873
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:17,080
So looks like they're not coming out with a new firmware yet but they are going to be adding a program that will allow you to run homebrew on a PSP 3000

1874
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:25,080
Which is the first step to an actual custom firmware being installed onto this new system so it's only a matter of time

1875
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:32,080
You just can't stop them, you just can't stop those hackers from getting in the PSP

1876
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:36,080
Even when the PSP 2 comes out, I'm sorry, it's not going to be un-hackable

1877
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,080
Even when it's all digital download?

1878
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:42,080
Even when it's all, it doesn't matter, this is all digital file so it doesn't matter

1879
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:52,080
Alright, well anyhow, MotionPlus on the Nintendo Wii, don't expect that your old Wii games are suddenly going to support MotionPlus

1880
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:59,080
Apparently you might be thinking, wouldn't it be great if they would release a patch that would patch some of my old games to support MotionPlus

1881
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:04,080
Well, here's the thing, I guess it's according to Game Daily who ran a report on this

1882
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:09,080
With a nearly two month span of time between the accessory release and the game's arrival at retail

1883
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:14,080
We expect that Nintendo will release patches that will make the new accessory work with your already existing library

1884
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,080
And the first would be of course Wii Sports

1885
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:25,080
But a fat chance, Game Daily, according to Nintendo, quote, the Wii MotionPlus accessory is only for games that are designed to make use of its abilities

1886
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:31,080
But also something to consider, the Wii really can't patch its games, if you think about it

1887
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:34,080
It can patch the firmware, but they can't really patch the games

1888
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:42,080
Yeah, they don't have anything built in to where it will read a common area of the Broadway CPU

1889
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:46,080
A very thorough article on this, by the way, at HackMii.com

1890
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:54,080
Yes, and unfortunately because of all these restrictions and stuff on where the games can read data from

1891
02:07:54,080 --> 02:08:00,080
It would be physically impossible for them to release any patches whatsoever

1892
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:05,080
So that's how you get problems like missing Switches and stuff in Tomb Raider or Underworld for the Wii

1893
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:09,080
And there's nothing they can do about it, because they can't patch their game afterwards

1894
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:17,080
Way to be forward thinking Nintendo, in fact they basically say that all in all the Wii software stack is designed with little to no future proofing

1895
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:24,080
There's basically zero provisions for any future updates, even obvious things like new storage devices or game patches

1896
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:32,080
What's worse is that this will affect compatibility mode of any future Wii successor

1897
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:44,080
Just like the DS titles won't get any WPA support on the DSi, effectively making the DSi's WPA mode useless if you want to use DS titles online

1898
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:50,080
And it says the DS Wi-Fi drivers and configuration stack are built into every game

1899
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:53,080
Well don't worry, that's why you'll have new new play control

1900
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:56,080
For your favorite games like Metroid and Pikmin

1901
02:08:56,080 --> 02:09:07,080
It's just really sad that such a company that thinks ahead that really is innovative can be so uninnovative at the same time

1902
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:12,080
It's like they're so far ahead and they're so far behind at the same time

1903
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:14,080
Oh well

1904
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:18,080
Alright, we've got a couple more stories for you guys and then believe it or not we're getting towards the end of this show

1905
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:26,080
We'll open up the Skype line one more time in just a minute to take your kind of potpourri any thoughts you have after a couple more stories here

1906
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,080
And then get ready to close out the show believe it or not

1907
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:38,080
Yes, well you may remember that there was a lawsuit with the NFL players and basically EA and the NFL and all that stuff

1908
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:48,080
Basically they were entitled royalties for using their likenesses and stuff like that in games. This is basically retired NFL players

1909
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:55,080
They've already received 28 million dollars in a settlement before

1910
02:09:55,080 --> 02:10:01,080
But now they're going to be targeting John Madden and EA exclusively

1911
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:10,080
And apparently I guess a whole other mess to try to get some more money

1912
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:19,080
Granted they should be guaranteed some money for having their likenesses shown but I don't know

1913
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,080
Whatever

1914
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,080
Money money money

1915
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:28,080
Just another sue happy thing or do they have something legitimately to complain about?

1916
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,080
EA is profiting off these names

1917
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,080
That's why they pay license fees right?

1918
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:40,080
Yeah, according to Cleveland Browns Bernie Parrish on a blog he put

1919
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:50,080
The retired NFL players who were used in Madden EA video games will be suing Madden and EA for using us in those games without compensating us

1920
02:10:50,080 --> 02:11:04,080
We will probably not use the attorneys who obtained a 28.1 million dollar verdict for us against the NFLPA for scrambling retired players' identities in those video games

1921
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:15,080
The jury found it a grossly fraudulent action taken so that they wouldn't have to pay retired players

1922
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:23,080
In my opinion Madden should have been included in our licensing suit against the NFLPA and so should EA

1923
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:29,080
So basically hey we won against the NFLPA but you know what we think that there's some more blood to take out of them

1924
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:32,080
So we're going to try suing them as well

1925
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:34,080
Good lord

1926
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:38,080
We'll see what happens. We'll keep you posted with any further developments

1927
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:43,080
I just have to laugh at this random comment that came up in our chat room chat.orangelandraday.com

1928
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:50,080
Kurosaki87 says OMG Beyonce is playing Rhythm Heaven on DS on my TV. I actually saw that same commercial

1929
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:53,080
I don't remember what it was during but I've seen that same thing

1930
02:11:53,080 --> 02:12:00,080
So Nintendo is still using the kind of female big names like you know

1931
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:07,080
Because Carrie Underwood was in a DS commercial before right? Was there somebody else? Some other kind of chick you'd see on Lifetime?

1932
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:14,080
I mean you can't say Beyonce is for women only though because tons of dudes think she's hot because she is

1933
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,080
You know I don't know

1934
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:22,080
Yeah they had a bunch of you know what was it

1935
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:24,080
Lisa Kudrow thank you for deciphering that

1936
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:29,080
Yeah Lisa Kudrow and I don't remember the other ones but yeah it's just

1937
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:33,080
I guess if a woman is playing the game it must be okay for all women to play the game

1938
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:38,080
She's just crazy in love with the game

1939
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:41,080
Alright one more story for you guys and we're going to open up the skype line

1940
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:46,080
1877 Game OLR and this was a story that made a lot of people say Woot this week

1941
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:52,080
Of course the popular sales site woot.com which if you've never been there that's when you can buy just a piece of random somethings

1942
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,080
For a very very low price

1943
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:59,080
Now often times these random somethings are like refurbished or they're you know

1944
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:04,080
They're kind of altered you know they're fixed up in some way but you can still get some damn good deals on there

1945
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:09,080
I have never bought a damn thing from woot.com but I have a friend that buys stuff from there quite frequently and gets pretty good stuff

1946
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:14,080
Well one thing they sold on woot this week and sorry but you guys missed it because it was yesterday's woot

1947
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:23,080
Microsoft Xbox 360 with 20 gigabyte hard drive and HDMI $139 plus $5 shipping

1948
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:29,080
So you could have bought a 360 with the HDMI and a 20 gig hard drive $145 shipped to your house

1949
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,080
That's a good deal

1950
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:36,080
That is a fucking great deal and even comes with a controller and yeah they're sold out

1951
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:40,080
Now granted these are refurbished systems so you have to not be bothered by that

1952
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:45,080
But honestly when you put that next to what $199 for an arcade system with no hard drive

1953
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:47,080
That's a pretty great deal I think

1954
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:51,080
So unfortunately they're all gone sorry guys who are listening right now

1955
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:56,080
But I did want to mention that because one interesting thing about that is I noticed the word of mouth on that one really spread

1956
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:02,080
And that sometimes happens with the woot deals like if you don't check the site every night then once the blogs go wild with it

1957
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:08,080
Then they're gone you know that's what I saw like probably like 50 tweets on my personal Twitter

1958
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:14,080
From people retweeting Major Nelson posting about it which I'm sure just made it spread like wildfire when he posted it

1959
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,080
I'm sure he did

1960
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:22,080
Although I finally de-friended Major Nelson this week and it's nothing personal but I de-friended all the celebrities on my Twitter

1961
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:29,080
Because I'm just sick of the celebrity Twitter thing like I think god damn one of our listeners said it best who I follow on Twitter

1962
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:33,080
I think it was Justin or Justin with some bazeros said something like

1963
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:41,080
I think when Ashton Kutcher hit a million users that was I don't remember the exact tweet I apologize

1964
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:48,080
He said something like that was the shark that we all just jumped over when he hit a million users and all that garbage was going on

1965
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:53,080
You know like Oprah getting on Twitter too I mean you know now I'm just like okay this is garbage

1966
02:14:53,080 --> 02:15:02,080
I feel awful because I actually followed that stupid just or the whole Twitter to a million because I wanted to be in Sims 3

1967
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:07,080
I did to an extent too but I instantly de-friended him once it was over and I wasn't the millionth person

1968
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:15,080
I haven't done it yet just because they haven't announced who won that yet and I don't want to compromise anything

1969
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:21,080
To be honest though I understand what he was trying to do with it but at the same time I didn't give a shit

1970
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:29,080
It was like oh this is the new wave of media basically anybody can go on here and have their voice heard and stuff

1971
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:35,080
At the same time I'm like I don't want all you having your voice heard because I really don't give a shit what you have to say

1972
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,080
But at the same time I guess you don't have to friend them

1973
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:43,080
I guess at first it felt like ooh I'm a little closer to these celebrities but they're not reading what you have to say

1974
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:47,080
Do you think Oprah gives a shit about what you just did you know what I mean?

1975
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:55,080
Well they don't care but it's something like they're actually responding back to you like if you Twitter Ashton Kutcher and he responds back to you

1976
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:59,080
It's Ashton Kutcher responding back to you and not like some PR guy

1977
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:06,080
It's basically you know these guys are so into this crap you know that they're doing it on their phones and that kind of stuff

1978
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:12,080
It's interesting but the problem for me is that Twitter doesn't have a lot of the customization tools that it needs right now

1979
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:16,080
And Twitter is having so many problems on the back end you know what I mean?

1980
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:20,080
Like they're just having so many problems with being able to handle the server load

1981
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:25,080
Like even today I've been trying to post Twitter updates about how our show has been going on our own Twitter at OLR

1982
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:28,080
And I can barely get through because the site's just been down down down

1983
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:34,080
Like I might add more celebrities and put them on a separate filter and I guess there's plugins and stuff that'll do it but I don't know

1984
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:40,080
It's kind of like staying ahead of trends basically you know everybody gets a MySpace page

1985
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:45,080
Twitter's gonna go the way of Friendster they're gonna be screwed because they could never keep up with the demand

1986
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:50,080
It's basically like you know okay people get a MySpace page and oh my god that's the cool shit you know

1987
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:53,080
I've got MySpace page you know we're one of the first people to do it

1988
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:58,080
You know I can say that everybody's like oh my god I gotta get on MySpace because that's the thing to do

1989
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:02,080
And then everybody follows and then we move to Facebook oh everybody's got you know face book now

1990
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:06,080
And then everybody's like oh what's this Facebook stuff? Let's do some reporting on it

1991
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:10,080
You know and then like Twitter is like what the hell is Twitter? Let's do some reporting on it

1992
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:14,080
It's like oh my god are you people so not in touch with everything?

1993
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:17,080
And I guess there are a lot of people out there that just don't know what the fuck's going on

1994
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:21,240
as the show we have to get on everything you know exactly that's been part of how

1995
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:25,240
we've stayed relevant for seven years you know we would never we would not

1996
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:29,800
have the listenership we have now if we do we're not on podcasting right when

1997
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:33,040
iTunes launch to store if that makes any sense yeah all right hey how we got a

1998
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:38,640
phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi you're on orange

1999
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:44,840
launch radio who's this caller if you can hear us your cast is a piece of

2000
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:49,680
crap I'm sorry to hear that hello for crying out loud that I listen to the

2001
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:53,620
whole conversation I'm minding my own business I'm enjoying the conversation

2002
02:17:53,620 --> 02:18:02,560
and then Comcast drops me out for that five seconds I'm so sorry well they got

2003
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:07,840
hit when they got hit with a fail whale what can we say introduce yourself hi

2004
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:13,200
orange on radio land it's Jason hi Jason one of our fearless web team people with

2005
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:20,520
the fabulous deep man owned by Comcast again as it's been so often lately what's

2006
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:26,400
on your mind buddy the quote you were looking for was I think a plus K Ashton

2007
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:30,960
Kutcher's Twitter handle I think a plus K is the shark and when he hit a million

2008
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:34,760
we all jumped over him on water skis is exactly what I was looking for I would

2009
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:39,880
have read it myself but Twitter would not fucking load for me and then on an

2010
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:43,140
unrelated note I said something that I think was kind of interestingly along

2011
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:46,740
the same line it's interesting that Twitter's last great hurrah was Obama's

2012
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:50,480
election and now that everyone else is following suit everyone's complaining

2013
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:55,560
it's it's just surprising to me that it's a problem now I would have think I

2014
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:59,680
would have thought that the political all of the political madness for that

2015
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:02,760
whole year and a half primary an election would have been where everybody

2016
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:05,820
started complaining it's a problem because Twitter can't fucking handle it

2017
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:10,400
it's telling Twitter is the new Friendster I swear to God this is exactly

2018
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:13,600
you're gonna see so many similarities somebody's gonna take the Twitter model

2019
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:19,000
they're gonna do it better and they're gonna be the new Facebook Facebook

2020
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,600
themselves does not become new Twitter cuz that's what they're trying to do

2021
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:26,920
with their latest update everybody says that and I guess like I said like I've

2022
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:30,960
said before I guess I just don't use it enough to really know I don't use

2023
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:33,840
Facebook as much as a lot of other people I know and that includes people

2024
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:39,440
like co-workers and stuff which I'm kind of surprised that use you know Facebook

2025
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:44,000
as much as they do I don't use Facebook quite a you know what I do on Facebook

2026
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:53,040
more than anything else play yes I play blitz that is the number one thing I do

2027
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:56,920
on Facebook seriously and once in a while I'll upload a picture comment on a

2028
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:02,200
picture upload your Hawaii pictures yeah and all of that it's a good it's a

2029
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:05,640
great way to share pictures I'll say that but yeah otherwise Facebook is

2030
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:09,600
great for bejeweled that's about it I don't like all the other crap on there

2031
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:13,400
are so many applications like you know and once in a while I'll take a quiz I

2032
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:17,560
don't know I you know what I love LiveJournal I love LiveJournal I've loved

2033
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:21,120
LiveJournal for so long I think it's the out of all the social networking sites

2034
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,000
I've ever been on LiveJournal was my favorite like four years ago and you

2035
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,880
need to put your 175 bucks $175 permanent account to use well yeah that

2036
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:34,000
and well just the fact that you know just all these other sites that have

2037
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,880
come into play have kind of made LiveJournal go downhill a little bit

2038
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:43,080
especially twatter has really ruined LiveJournal and I I miss I miss the hey

2039
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:46,120
days of LiveJournal I missed LiveJournal circa four years ago and people have

2040
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:50,040
more to say on it but you know LiveJournal now is just a repost of all

2041
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:53,880
your Twitter posts and that's not on my friends list I found a code that filters

2042
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:57,360
that shit right off of there cuz I wait so fucking sick of it you know what I

2043
02:20:57,360 --> 02:21:03,760
mean I got so fucking sick of it anyway sorry I cut my Jamie cut hers I don't

2044
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:07,520
mind the LJ cut people but I had people that would have like 20 pages of tweets

2045
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:11,400
and it's all nonsensical because it's your applies to people but when I read

2046
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:15,360
it on Twitter it filters that that's the thing I hate about Twitter the most it's

2047
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:17,720
like all these replies and stuff and you're trying to figure out what the

2048
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:21,680
hell they're talking about and it's just I don't know I understand the whole

2049
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:25,840
people want to archive it or all this stuff but please go in figure out how to

2050
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:30,800
change your settings make them private posts if you just want to archive it but

2051
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:34,360
I just well it doesn't matter I filtered it out I think live journals have an

2052
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:37,400
easier way for just click a button and you I won't see Twitter crap on my

2053
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:40,480
friends page anymore that would be the greatest thing LiveJournal could do but

2054
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:43,600
they'd have to stop firing their staff in order to do that hey let's talk video

2055
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:47,240
games Jason what kind of video games you've been playing this week Ryan's

2056
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:50,440
hovering over my shoulder and she told me she had a question so I'm gonna start

2057
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:56,240
with that real quick sure so I want to know why is it that when Jason calls

2058
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:01,280
through Skype he gets through first time when we're driving and I'm trying to

2059
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:06,920
call from my phone we can't get through at all I haven't the foggiest idea it's

2060
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:10,760
just okay here's the thing I can tell you this much back in the day Skype used

2061
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:14,520
to every time we'd get a call it would open up multiple tabs for each call we

2062
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:17,560
were getting so I would see 20 tabs up on the screen and the great thing about

2063
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:20,960
that is I could see who was calling in and this way we could share the love a

2064
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:23,680
little bit like if there was a person that was calling in every week I

2065
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:26,520
wouldn't take their call one week so that somebody else could get through

2066
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:30,820
that's only fair right now ever since about a year ago Skype changed something

2067
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:34,240
and I've I have combed the settings up and down this is something they did on

2068
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:38,080
their end where I only get one tab at a time now so whoever gets through gets

2069
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:42,100
through and locks everybody else out and the natural delay with the phones I can

2070
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:45,600
even attest to of course if it has been somebody yeah and phones just have a

2071
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:49,960
natural delay if it's somebody who's really been on the show a lot lately and

2072
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:53,760
like me there's other well but it and other people are trying to get through

2073
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,720
I'll just consistently hang up on the person's that way somebody else gets

2074
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:00,960
through I don't like to do that but I just I want everybody to have a chance

2075
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:04,960
you know it's only fair right every gamer every gamer gets the voice exactly

2076
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:08,040
but tonight's setup has actually been very nice having the people sprinkled

2077
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:10,360
out throughout the show I don't know if this is something we'll do long term but

2078
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:14,520
it's something we're considering in fact with a third computer dot dot dot

2079
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:20,960
we're thinking of ideas so is it that it actually comes up and shows you a phone

2080
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:24,280
number when somebody calls from like a cell phone yes it will show me a phone

2081
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:27,160
number and I almost always take the phone numbers because they're usually

2082
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:32,800
new people that haven't called before gotcha almost always almost I don't

2083
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:36,000
want people thinking they can circumvent it by calling on the phone because I

2084
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,160
know my head and those people like me whose ISP decides to suck and they have

2085
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:41,960
to go to the phone instead I mean I don't want people thinking like I pick

2086
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:45,480
and choose I don't but like if the same if the if a person was on like the last

2087
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:48,520
three weeks in a row I try not to take their call a fourth week you know what I

2088
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:54,520
mean so just to show me the traffic's coming in to warrant the need to ignore

2089
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:57,480
them in favor of somebody else exactly exactly but if it's a slow night we'll

2090
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,960
hear from anybody so all right well Jason speaking of which I want to share

2091
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,080
the love and let some more people call in thank you so much for your call though

2092
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:07,440
as always wow she completely took my question oh no okay Jason quickly please

2093
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:10,960
please go ahead we got we got we got sidetracked with Twitter talk go ahead

2094
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:14,640
yeah blame Twitter Twitter's the I will blame Twitter fuck Twitter

2095
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:20,120
wearing Comcast I was just and of course now that we've had this whole tangent I

2096
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:24,840
completely forgot all of my details somebody in chat earlier you we were

2097
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:28,520
talking about all the Nintendo all of the Nintendo update stuff this that and

2098
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:31,880
the other and then somebody in chat talked about Nintendo where games go to

2099
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:36,600
die that rang really true right now because I really want to play Fatal

2100
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:42,760
Frame 4 I really want to see what they did with that game but the problem is

2101
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:46,160
apparently if you if you did see it in the news they are not going to bring it

2102
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:48,760
to our region or at least that they haven't announced it yet and they're

2103
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:53,240
saving it for e3 because they have to have something to announce at e3 yeah

2104
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:57,200
the the whole licensing snap food like that thing seems kind of weird for I

2105
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:00,400
don't think it's licensing at all I think it's like okay look at this it's a

2106
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:04,920
game that's done that all they have to do is localize of course they want the

2107
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:08,560
easy way out okay that's what Nintendo does is the easy way out that's that's

2108
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:12,800
all they do nowadays so if there's a game that people want a lot you know

2109
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:17,520
maybe mother of three of course but you know that's a different reason all

2110
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,080
together but still I have a feeling that they could be announcing this at e3

2111
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:27,320
because they're like hey look see core core game nice I would be so pleased if

2112
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:31,200
it were especially if I was there but then again likes to disappoint as well

2113
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:37,040
so you know it's hard to say well put and a small plug there is a Facebook

2114
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:42,360
group trying to get emails to Nintendo to try to get it localized we've been

2115
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:46,040
going on the scorns of social media we need not your Facebook chatter here oh

2116
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:52,360
what the hell let her give it out don't do emails do actual letters yeah cuz

2117
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:59,880
that'd be more effective yes that's been uh other than that I admit and very I

2118
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:08,320
admit the sadness that I finally broke down a lot of that last night we'll have

2119
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,360
to have a pickle party at some point Jason I really do have to let you go now

2120
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:14,080
those who get some other callers but thank you and Ry as well for calling in

2121
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:20,280
okay yes everybody just a note to the Justin TV folks our phone calls don't go

2122
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:24,960
through to Justin TV I don't know why that's weird well I sometimes they work

2123
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:28,560
sometimes it just remember it's a simulcast guys we actually they should

2124
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:32,240
they should be unless it's it see the problem is I think is it's mono and I

2125
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:35,200
think it's coming in one side or the other and I don't know which side so I

2126
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:39,240
tried flipping it but it if it's I could try flipping it again don't worry about

2127
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:43,880
it don't worry I mean honestly Justin TV is not the focus I know they think they

2128
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:47,120
are it's the thing so if we hear it of the speakers it's just split from the

2129
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,280
speakers so all right we got another hello hi you're on orange launch radio

2130
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:59,640
who's this hey this DS master 26 hey DS master 26 what is on your mind not much

2131
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:05,040
just came across one of my old favorite enemies from my childhood that's no

2132
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:10,800
longer on the air in America though still in Japan hmm

2133
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:17,200
Sailor Moon what did you want to do what you want to talk about with Sailor Moon

2134
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:24,120
yeah it's you know it was actually kind of like one of those crossovers between

2135
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:29,320
like Harry Potter meets the Power Rangers try how my friends kind of put

2136
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:34,720
it sort of but do you think the soil on the hand that would make a good game do

2137
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:38,480
they have Sailor Moon games I've had multiple Sailor Moon games in Japan

2138
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:42,720
they'll have been brought over here right no I think they have had Sailor

2139
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:46,800
Moon games come out over here but the thing is it's not a popular franchise

2140
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:49,320
anymore it's just like for some reason when I'd also thought it was a great

2141
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:53,920
idea to put out was it wacky races the cartoon series that ran in the 80s and

2142
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:59,840
originally came from like the 60s I mean come on I wouldn't I would support a

2143
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:03,200
Sailor Moon game if it was the live-action Sailor Moon because the when

2144
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:07,480
the cat is actually a stuffed cat that's pretty amazing so maybe we could get

2145
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:11,600
some like old-school say get CD style live-action Sailor Moon games I would

2146
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:19,760
support this yes sure would I and you know besides that I've been hearing a

2147
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:25,200
whole lot about that rack band unplugged for PST you know the question is well

2148
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:30,760
let's have download content if it does I'm almost thinking of splurging for

2149
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:35,520
that 32 gigabyte memory stick which is probably gonna drop me 600 bucks it will

2150
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:38,560
have a rock band source so yeah there will be download content for sure there

2151
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:41,400
definitely will be download content but you probably won't need it just drive

2152
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:45,240
that big I mean I don't download every song that comes out on rock band that

2153
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:48,920
that would be a little bit much don't you think

2154
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:54,760
probably but then again if there's a lot of good songs from a certain I say like

2155
02:28:54,760 --> 02:29:02,120
I'd probably get the whole album it's on there and because I'm already kicked off

2156
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:10,080
that Nintendo is kind of this shafted for the Metallica content for guitar

2157
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:16,960
hero is us we owners we only get three tracks from the death magnetic album

2158
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:21,520
while you use 316 ps3 owners not hate in here but you guys are getting the full

2159
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:27,400
album fall as we owners here getting shafted sort of for the guitar hero

2160
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:33,480
Metallica content that does suck that's why the we should honestly part of me

2161
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:37,840
thinks that we shouldn't even have rock band and guitar hero because you're not

2162
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,840
really getting the same game but at the same time you all know what you're

2163
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:46,440
getting into with the we but it's it's the weed is not up it does not have the

2164
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:49,920
power of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 when I say power I mean storage space

2165
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:57,840
as well you know what I mean yeah even though I have like an extra 2 gig micro

2166
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:02,920
SD that can transfer into a normal IC card which I'd really love to fill up

2167
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:06,720
with other stuff I mean I always figured out how to get my virtual console

2168
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:12,240
palace and everything on to there and what you can copy from I figured I had

2169
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:18,320
to do from the Wii memory finally figured that out but it's a pain the

2170
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:28,280
butt though but isn't we fit awesome hard drive we fit stinks and we played it

2171
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:31,840
once never played it again yeah here's the thing about we fed I learned you

2172
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:34,760
really do have to be committed to it in order for it to work I just want to

2173
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:37,200
throw I just want to throw that in there because it seems like it's one of the

2174
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:40,920
only you know good things about the Wii right now all right DS master we gotta

2175
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,880
let you go because we're gonna wrap up the show but thanks so much for your

2176
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:46,200
call well one more thing before I let you guys

2177
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:53,360
all right my favorite and my lines Boone prism tower and rock on keep the good

2178
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:59,280
shows guys thank you here wow all right that's gonna do over the

2179
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:02,400
skyline tonight we're gonna close up shop on the skyline so that we can get

2180
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:05,880
through some last-minute stories and get to the end of the show look at this boss

2181
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:09,840
is so cheap it keeps tossing me in the air is this further than you got last

2182
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,760
time that's the same place I got last time you know it's probably one of those

2183
02:31:12,760 --> 02:31:15,560
things where it's giving you hints too but they're always like giving me hints

2184
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:19,320
at all it's just cheap I heard I heard someone else that was talking about the

2185
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:24,400
demo they got tossed in the air 26 times fine it's just it's being cheap hey

2186
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:29,600
that's that's why it's a demo so they can fix that crap so anyways some stuff

2187
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:34,200
we we didn't talk about here but the ESRB has rated Ghostbusters and two

2188
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:39,120
other Atari DS titles for the DSI now you may think oh well that's not that

2189
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:44,000
big deal because if you think about it you know it DS games playing the DSI

2190
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:51,680
well does it is a big deal because DSI games are only for the DSI basically

2191
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:58,040
they're DSI where or DSI special enhanced versions of the game so those

2192
02:31:58,040 --> 02:32:02,320
three games Ghostbusters and plus and the chase Felix meet Felicity the

2193
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:09,560
thought is perhaps Nintendo is going to start allowing publishers to put up full

2194
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:13,640
copies of their games on the DSI where store to download and the be honest as

2195
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:19,000
the person that has downloaded his fair share of games for the DS and ROM form

2196
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,200
to play on you know things allow that sort of thing they aren't that big so I

2197
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:30,040
could see something like this happening so interesting and it says no Atari of

2198
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,000
course has responded back saying unfortunately no official word from

2199
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,360
Atari we'll let this stay a rumor for now so hmm announcement at e3 basically

2200
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:44,880
there's gonna be a new shiny force game coming out from Sega although you may

2201
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:47,920
not guess what platform is actually coming out on it's actually being

2202
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:53,000
brought to the arcade shiny force cross is the brand new game it is going to be

2203
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:01,040
an RPG oriented game but it is more a turn-based strategy I guess and it's

2204
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:06,360
weird though it's actually played on cabinets linked via Sega's all dotnet

2205
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:15,440
net platform and apparently it's only in Japan so that kind of sex then also the

2206
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:20,040
first round of songs picked for guitar heroes smash hits have been announced

2207
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:24,320
and these were all based on people's votes the first round that they've had

2208
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:27,640
can I just say though who cares fuck this game I mean this is just the

2209
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:30,880
further milking of the franchise not I'm not saying that to you personally Loki

2210
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:34,240
but just when I read the story I just rolled my eyes I was like God I

2211
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:38,000
understand you know these game that these songs are being re-released with

2212
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:43,160
the full band and what have you but my god it's just like can you hear them

2213
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:47,560
money-sucking just the masses this is this is going to kill music games right

2214
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:51,920
here yeah but if you want to know here you go yeah and they're all from guitar

2215
