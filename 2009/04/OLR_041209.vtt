00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
Hi everybody out there on the internet welcome to a special podcast for this

00:04.700 --> 00:10.140
Sunday April the 12th of 2009. Let me try to explain quickly if possible

00:10.140 --> 00:13.820
what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything

00:13.820 --> 00:19.300
like that tonight. The show started, we began taping as usual about six

00:19.300 --> 00:23.260
o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time and about 30 minutes into the show

00:23.260 --> 00:27.200
during part A tonight the video card on the system we used to tape the show

00:27.200 --> 00:31.280
started freaking out and dying so basically the video card overheated mid

00:31.280 --> 00:35.920
taping of the show and it caused a lot of stuff to happen basically we we lost

00:35.920 --> 00:40.440
all of part A unfortunately we weren't able to recover what we had taped so far

00:40.440 --> 00:44.360
so it's gone and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it and then

00:44.360 --> 00:49.200
basically the computer we use to tape OLR is fucked. Now don't worry you guys

00:49.200 --> 00:52.440
we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week

00:52.440 --> 00:55.400
so I don't want people like freaking out like oh my god is OLR dead no we're not

00:55.400 --> 00:59.040
gonna let a stupid video card keep things down but it did screw us over

00:59.040 --> 01:02.800
for tonight however what I've done I have two computers in the house it's

01:02.800 --> 01:06.200
just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing

01:06.200 --> 01:09.480
or any of that sort so we're actually not broadcasting on all games right now

01:09.480 --> 01:13.000
because it's not configured for that we're actually live on all games radio

01:13.000 --> 01:20.840
or not not all games radio sadly however we are live on Justin TV and we're gonna

01:20.840 --> 01:24.860
tape a mini show tonight Doc Sakura is here with us as always me and my lungs

01:24.860 --> 01:29.360
and Dan was joining us tonight and I'm really sorry to Dan cuz it's very rare

01:29.360 --> 01:33.320
he gets here but you're here to get for not listening live we're so much more

01:33.320 --> 01:39.020
of me and I'm awesome and Loki's here as well yeah yeah you guys really missed a

01:39.020 --> 01:44.480
lot life tonight I had a diva I had a diva breakdown what what's the other

01:44.480 --> 01:47.780
special guest jelly beans the jelly beans are here delicious all right but

01:47.780 --> 01:51.440
you guys sadly missed a lot I but they don't want they don't want to hear about

01:51.440 --> 01:54.640
what they missed on the podcast they just want at least to hear a little bit

01:54.640 --> 01:59.160
about what's going on in the news this week so quickly let's talk about our

01:59.160 --> 02:01.720
gaming weeks let's recap what's been going on in our gaming weeks this week

02:01.720 --> 02:11.440
dark soccer I played shit Dan maim Loki I've been playing that Grand Theft Auto

02:11.440 --> 02:18.480
for the lost and damned and recently during the show Arroyo Muramasa which is

02:18.480 --> 02:24.000
Muramasa Dean blade on the week and I have been playing we fit surprisingly

02:24.000 --> 02:26.840
enough I've been playing a lot of we fit I'm on a new little diet where I'm gonna

02:26.840 --> 02:31.680
use we fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before e3

02:31.680 --> 02:36.640
so okay so that was our gaming weeks let's move into what's going on in the

02:36.640 --> 02:41.420
gaming world tonight housekeeping our show was completely borked to this week

02:41.420 --> 02:48.960
and we apologize but that's live radio good bad and ugly all on live radio so

02:48.960 --> 02:53.720
Loki start us off quickly with some news tonight okay so I'm gonna kind of let's

02:53.720 --> 03:02.040
see here is interesting enough Sony is actually patented a PSP controlled car

03:02.040 --> 03:08.560
which I don't really you know that's interesting I guess it looks like of

03:08.560 --> 03:13.100
course you're not real car obviously it's more of a you know RC car type of

03:13.100 --> 03:16.560
thing but that's kind of neat and apparently the patent looks like based

03:16.560 --> 03:20.280
off the instructions on there it's like it's gonna have some sort of camera or

03:20.280 --> 03:23.840
something like that on it and you can kind of control it using the PSP maybe

03:23.840 --> 03:30.040
an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees will be interesting

03:30.040 --> 03:34.000
they're actually because if you remember the Sony I will actually had you know a

03:34.000 --> 03:37.600
camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter Egg features about is

03:37.600 --> 03:42.520
you could actually control the eyeball with your PSP so this is something like

03:42.520 --> 03:50.160
that I don't know it's kind neat maybe we'll see this at e3 I wonder if it's

03:50.160 --> 03:53.640
just like I don't know this is what this is what this is I look at and go what

03:53.640 --> 03:58.720
huh really like Loki do you think this is going to be something cool or do you

03:58.720 --> 04:04.400
think this is like I have judgment this is probably not anything cool yeah well

04:04.400 --> 04:10.120
we'll see the car judgment dark dark Sakura what what kind of story did you

04:10.120 --> 04:14.920
want to cover tonight well there were a couple I was thought would be cool go

04:14.920 --> 04:24.000
for it well just to do it in inch just to do it in short order there is gonna

04:24.000 --> 04:29.760
be a Silent Hill shattered memories on ps2 and PSP and we we version you can

04:29.760 --> 04:33.320
use a flashlight we talked about this last week though it's basically gonna be

04:33.320 --> 04:36.520
a revamping I don't think we had confirmed that the we thing was gonna be

04:36.520 --> 04:39.080
a flashlight but then they kind of confirmed it this week it's confirmed

04:39.080 --> 04:42.640
that's awesome also silent scope is coming out iPhone which is pretty cool

04:42.640 --> 04:48.360
the Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the

04:48.360 --> 04:54.360
Beatles rock band version and each of the records is going to have a little

04:54.360 --> 05:00.680
documentary with it and also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc

05:00.680 --> 05:07.280
collection to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in

05:07.280 --> 05:11.960
that record quality also Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for

05:11.960 --> 05:17.240
virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours

05:17.240 --> 05:25.200
and also there's gonna be a grudge game and I'm totally gonna get it yeah but

05:25.200 --> 05:27.560
isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that

05:27.560 --> 05:34.160
you love I don't care I'll still play it all right well some things I wanted to

05:34.160 --> 05:39.560
cover really quickly Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates

05:39.560 --> 05:43.720
we heard rumors about July last week on the show it looks like they've been

05:43.720 --> 05:46.040
somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves they did a quick press

05:46.040 --> 05:49.160
conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and then

05:49.160 --> 05:52.720
an overseas release will follow the next month overseas meaning of course the US

05:52.720 --> 05:57.400
in that circumstance Squeenix has created games for myspace they're

05:57.400 --> 06:03.040
actually gonna they've created this new game called what's it called dive hunt

06:03.040 --> 06:09.240
to dive to hunt sorbet's great adventure that's right it's a very strange kind of

06:09.240 --> 06:16.320
not Final Fantasy it's Oh sorbet I said sorbet I don't know whatever this looks

06:16.320 --> 06:19.880
very strange and not like any other type of game but what's kind of cool about it

06:19.880 --> 06:23.360
is that it does use one of the moogles but the design from Final Fantasy 12

06:23.360 --> 06:27.720
where they look more like rabbits so I thought it was kind of interesting but

06:27.720 --> 06:30.600
yeah very interesting they're launching a game on myspace don't they know that

06:30.600 --> 06:35.680
everybody went to Facebook by now no apparently not apparently not metal gear

06:35.680 --> 06:39.240
is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed that that

06:39.240 --> 06:43.840
is a trademark that happened the Konami is filed metal gear and tactical online

06:43.840 --> 06:48.400
action apparently they are arcade games you know there was that shooter game the

06:48.400 --> 06:51.360
Silent Hill shooter game this doesn't seem something that's completely

06:51.360 --> 06:55.480
unbelievable to me I don't know there's also a game I saw e3 a few years ago

06:55.480 --> 07:02.400
that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades

07:02.400 --> 07:08.440
yeah no problem with that though that was and a mirror it was in the mirror

07:08.440 --> 07:14.280
Metal Gear look did you have anything else like do I talk to chat really quick

07:14.280 --> 07:20.880
yeah there's some other stuff they put Honda put out a press release saying

07:20.880 --> 07:25.320
that they're gonna be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live primetime which

07:25.320 --> 07:28.720
what's kind of funny though is they're actually gonna have a plane away a

07:28.720 --> 07:35.280
plane win campaign and while you're waiting in queue to play you know the

07:35.280 --> 07:40.280
big primetime games you'll have to watch ads for the car and then it kind of

07:40.280 --> 07:43.800
slipped out that primetime will be launching May 15th with that which I

07:43.800 --> 07:48.640
think is kind of the bigger point of the story but somehow that slipped in there

07:48.640 --> 07:53.440
I don't know some other interesting stuff that's kind of just slipped out

07:53.440 --> 07:59.520
there apparently perfect dark is going to be coming back to watch you coming to

07:59.520 --> 08:06.100
the Xbox Live Arcade this was actually revealed in a teaser that they the

08:06.100 --> 08:09.840
people at rare were showing off some of their premium themes for banjo-touille

08:09.840 --> 08:17.320
and lo and behold in one the latest games there is an icon for perfect dark

08:17.320 --> 08:22.680
in there for one of the I guess rare members that jug go so he had a lace

08:22.680 --> 08:27.240
game he played as being one of those haha slipped out there that's kind of

08:27.240 --> 08:35.680
funny and I'll see here Final Fantasy 7 has come out on the PlayStation 3 at

08:35.680 --> 08:39.640
least the original game on the PlayStation Store however only in Japan

08:39.640 --> 08:44.960
don't but if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account you

08:44.960 --> 08:50.360
can actually purchase the game I guess if you have your way to you know pay in

08:50.360 --> 08:56.440
Japan and it is the international version which does have the English

08:56.440 --> 09:04.120
language available as well for it so that's kind of cool and finally Konami

09:04.120 --> 09:10.160
is putting out a new military action game called six days in fluja and this

09:10.160 --> 09:15.520
is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon

09:15.520 --> 09:22.560
but either way it is coming out and you know I was kind of surprised this week

09:22.560 --> 09:27.280
with Konami's kind of gamers night going on we didn't really hear anything about

09:27.280 --> 09:31.240
the stuff that was there I bet you the embargoed stuff did we get him by one

09:31.240 --> 09:34.960
year we went yeah but it was usually embargoed until the next day you know

09:34.960 --> 09:38.000
this was on a Thursday last week I mean unless they're just doing everything

09:38.000 --> 09:42.560
next week but I don't know I surprised just nothing really coming out other

09:42.560 --> 09:48.280
than this and you know the iPhone games that kind of stuff but oh well and

09:48.280 --> 09:54.360
that's pretty much all I've got oh oh one last thing is gonna comment on

09:54.360 --> 09:58.640
there's a rumor going around that there was going to be elite systems coming out

09:58.640 --> 10:05.520
for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it yeah that's true so those

10:05.520 --> 10:09.920
will be coming by the end of this month and they're gonna be around for about

10:09.920 --> 10:14.200
two months and that's it rock band unplugged is coming out June 9th I know

10:14.200 --> 10:17.360
what I'm getting that's that's the week right after e3 did you see the video for

10:17.360 --> 10:21.280
it it looks just like well not exactly like amplitude but they've got a four

10:21.280 --> 10:24.360
different you know tracks you switch between and of course they're the four

10:24.360 --> 10:30.000
you know the same bass drum and guitar I'm very excited in a naughty spot it's

10:30.000 --> 10:34.200
proof that harmonix loves us it really is harmonic and we love harmonix for

10:34.200 --> 10:38.680
giving us this game honestly really they just need to just do frequency and

10:38.680 --> 10:42.440
amplitude for the PSP it's got to happen mm-hmm well doesn't really need to

10:42.440 --> 10:46.880
happen anymore now I mean think about it well sure but I mean they should just do

10:46.880 --> 10:50.880
it anyway because those games are both great and I can't find a copy of

10:50.880 --> 10:56.640
amplitude it is very hard to find now yes even for me and I can find anything

10:56.640 --> 10:59.880
I want to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this

10:59.880 --> 11:03.160
was interesting about the whole you know digital stuff and downloads and things

11:03.160 --> 11:09.120
like that Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games and I'm not

11:09.120 --> 11:11.760
talking about like the tangible kind I'm talking about they actually have an

11:11.760 --> 11:16.000
Xbox live store now you actually can purchase the games through Amazon calm

11:16.000 --> 11:19.600
and I guess the way you do it you go on there you buy with your Amazon account

11:19.600 --> 11:22.920
and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360 so this is kind of a way you

11:22.920 --> 11:27.320
can get around using Microsoft points if you don't want to rumor is this coming

11:27.320 --> 11:31.000
out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well and this means you would be able to

11:31.000 --> 11:34.480
bypass Nintendo points and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in

11:34.480 --> 11:39.360
Sony's wallet which is kind of interesting if true rumor I was actually

11:39.360 --> 11:42.520
wondering though if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon

11:42.520 --> 11:48.440
sure that's what I told you earlier Amazon right now is the stripping the

11:48.440 --> 11:56.760
the sales ranks off of the gay lesbian authors so that when you try to look up

11:56.760 --> 12:02.440
a product you won't find anything from them it's really just to keep they say

12:02.440 --> 12:06.200
it's to keep children from finding adult content yet run Jeremy's our biography

12:06.200 --> 12:10.600
is still easily accessible his strip his ranks haven't been stripped so there is

12:10.600 --> 12:14.920
a movement going to Google bomb them so just go to Google and type in Amazon

12:14.920 --> 12:20.040
rank that's all interesting everyone should do it at least five times huh

12:20.040 --> 12:27.240
what'd you read about this I'm curious several friends huh all right well

12:27.240 --> 12:30.720
sometimes we get on side rants on the show I'm passing on the word if if you

12:30.720 --> 12:36.240
support you know I'll check it out I don't want to go off until I know a

12:36.240 --> 12:41.420
little more I've already gone off once tonight when we live so let me let me do

12:41.420 --> 12:45.160
a little more research on it before I miss my shit if you want to the

12:45.160 --> 12:50.000
information is out there no I'll check it out I'm curious I'm curious um I guess

12:50.000 --> 12:54.920
