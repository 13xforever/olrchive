WEBVTT

00:14.446 --> 00:15.367
[SPEAKER_03]: and I, April 19th, 2009.

00:15.868 --> 00:19.752
[SPEAKER_03]: A new PSP game is set to be released with no UMDs.

00:20.153 --> 00:25.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Karaoke Revolution looks to be getting a reboot, but what is the hidden bonus feature in the PC version of Braid?

00:31.670 --> 00:36.114
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.214 --> 00:43.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are back and here to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.164
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining you every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

00:48.904 --> 00:52.387
[SPEAKER_11]: Not with us tonight, unfortunately, is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.407 --> 00:58.371
[SPEAKER_11]: It's her birthday today, and she's celebrating her birthday at Disneyland, because, you know, they have that whole get-in-free-for-your-birthday thing going on.

00:59.251 --> 01:02.314
[SPEAKER_11]: Joining us, though, of course, as always, say hello to TechMasterLoki.

01:02.634 --> 01:02.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

01:03.254 --> 01:03.775
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing, Loki?

01:03.915 --> 01:04.075
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

01:04.455 --> 01:04.775
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:05.595 --> 01:07.796
[SPEAKER_11]: Before anybody asks, yes, we have a new video card.

01:07.976 --> 01:08.196
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

01:08.336 --> 01:08.996
[SPEAKER_11]: We're taking care of it.

01:09.516 --> 01:10.497
[SPEAKER_10]: Old video card, yes.

01:10.757 --> 01:13.277
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about it a little more during the housekeeping segment tonight.

01:13.337 --> 01:19.739
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're excited here because in studio right now we're playing the Final Fantasy XIII demo and actually streaming it on Justin.TV.

01:19.759 --> 01:21.780
[SPEAKER_11]: And, yes, I know we're not the first to do it.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.461
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like there's some people out there that were in the main All Games chat room earlier doing the whole Simpsons did it thing.

01:27.481 --> 01:28.021
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:28.081 --> 01:29.141
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, okay, we get it.

01:29.441 --> 01:30.322
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, you know what?

01:30.342 --> 01:31.222
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:32.142 --> 01:38.183
[SPEAKER_11]: And this may not be as big for you guys, but for me, it's one thing to watch it on YouTube and watch somebody else play it on Justin.TV.

01:38.563 --> 01:42.744
[SPEAKER_11]: But to actually see it on my little TV here in the garage is like, wow.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that looks nice.

01:44.364 --> 01:46.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, because it's not pixelated at all or anything like that.

01:46.765 --> 01:48.285
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's pretty nice.

01:48.505 --> 01:52.846
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you haven't seen it at all for whatever reason yet, you can check out our Justin.TV channel while we're live.

01:53.426 --> 01:58.267
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are listening on podcast, hopefully there's some archived footage over there on Justin.TV that you can look at.

01:59.874 --> 02:03.977
[SPEAKER_11]: So Loki, tell us about a little bit how you got this demo and how you ordered it and all that and why you did it.

02:04.537 --> 02:10.801
[SPEAKER_10]: I just imported the Final Fantasy VII Adventurer and Complete, the Final Fantasy XIII trial version.

02:11.581 --> 02:15.144
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did it because, one, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIII.

02:15.444 --> 02:21.207
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, this is probably the only way I could play it for a year until it comes out.

02:21.227 --> 02:22.188
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming spring 2010 for us.

02:24.629 --> 02:31.394
[SPEAKER_10]: And also because I like Advent Children a lot and I wanted to see the movie all high def with extra scenes.

02:31.914 --> 02:33.155
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a win-win.

02:33.455 --> 02:43.042
[SPEAKER_10]: And because PlayStation 3 games are region free and because the Blu-ray movie is the same region for both... You know, it just wouldn't be OLR without tech problems.

02:43.082 --> 02:43.502
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

02:43.742 --> 02:46.424
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the same region for Japan and US.

02:48.305 --> 02:48.666
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

02:48.906 --> 02:52.688
[SPEAKER_10]: And plus the movie itself actually has the English dub track in it.

02:52.788 --> 02:52.989
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

02:54.161 --> 02:56.202
[SPEAKER_10]: It works, and it's pretty awesome.

02:56.222 --> 03:02.005
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually watched more of the movie than I have played of the demo, so I've only played about 10 minutes of the demo right now.

03:02.546 --> 03:03.046
[SPEAKER_10]: And so far?

03:03.466 --> 03:03.726
[SPEAKER_10]: So far.

03:03.746 --> 03:04.066
[SPEAKER_10]: You like it?

03:04.327 --> 03:05.507
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's going to be good.

03:05.547 --> 03:07.868
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's got a lot in common with Final Fantasy VII.

03:07.888 --> 03:15.593
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts off with the train, sort of futuristic, you know, there's a lot of battle stuff going on.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.534
[SPEAKER_10]: It just feels very VII-ish.

03:17.854 --> 03:20.775
[SPEAKER_11]: But which Final Fantasy game have they been able to whore unlike any other?

03:21.216 --> 03:21.316
[SPEAKER_11]: VII.

03:21.456 --> 03:21.856
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

03:21.876 --> 03:23.157
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and they're going to whore this like crazy, but...

03:23.937 --> 03:24.798
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what, though?

03:25.118 --> 03:29.781
[SPEAKER_10]: It's without a doubt going to be the best RPG that's ever going to grace the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

03:30.841 --> 03:34.083
[SPEAKER_10]: Without a doubt, it's going to be the one that's going to be on these systems.

03:34.123 --> 03:36.465
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the PS3.

03:36.545 --> 03:37.425
[SPEAKER_10]: I can guarantee it.

03:38.026 --> 03:38.286
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

03:38.746 --> 03:42.188
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it'll probably be on... I mean, because they're going to whore XIII out for a while.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.730
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got like three... With Versus and everything?

03:44.970 --> 03:48.232
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still Versus and then all the other ones they're going to put out.

03:48.292 --> 03:49.653
[SPEAKER_10]: XIV probably won't be out for a long time.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.614
[SPEAKER_10]: And by that time, there'll be probably a new system.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.535
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if XIV won't be another MMO.

03:54.275 --> 03:58.119
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it'll be part of the series if that's the case.

04:18.599 --> 04:20.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even going to resemble this by the time.

04:20.220 --> 04:27.862
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of like the 8 demo, because the 8 demo came out warily, and then 8 came out, and it was quite a bit different.

04:28.883 --> 04:34.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Loki's going to do his best to kind of go back and forth from actually playing the demo to doing what he needs to do on the show.

04:34.445 --> 04:39.887
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be very difficult tonight because DarkSakura's not here, so it's just Loki and I here to cover the news tonight.

04:40.627 --> 04:42.168
[SPEAKER_11]: But he'll play the game as much as he can.

04:42.208 --> 04:48.330
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we have stragglers come into the Justin TV room that aren't really familiar with the show, if our regular listeners would help them understand.

04:48.470 --> 04:50.151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I haven't figured out what we want to do with audio.

04:50.171 --> 04:56.255
[SPEAKER_10]: If we want to do half Final Fantasy XIII, half us talking, you know, because we can only do one channel at a time or whatever.

04:56.275 --> 04:57.076
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably half and half is good.

04:57.376 --> 04:57.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Half and half?

04:57.857 --> 04:58.437
[SPEAKER_10]: Half and half is good.

04:58.597 --> 04:58.917
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

04:59.017 --> 05:00.058
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

05:00.278 --> 05:01.039
[SPEAKER_10]: And then...

05:02.728 --> 05:04.530
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, that's it.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.232
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the movie itself looks awesome.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.754
[SPEAKER_10]: And the HD, oh, it's sweet.

05:09.035 --> 05:10.957
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what else has been going on in your gaming week, Loki?

05:11.577 --> 05:12.558
[SPEAKER_10]: What other stuff have you been playing?

05:12.699 --> 05:15.562
[SPEAKER_10]: I finished Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.

05:16.703 --> 05:18.505
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing that online a bit.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.507
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a lot of people cheating out there.

05:20.907 --> 05:23.670
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, apparently I'm not the only one that knows how to modify the 360 version.

05:25.865 --> 05:26.346
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:41.916 --> 05:45.758
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded the demo for Outrun, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet.

05:46.819 --> 05:54.984
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually looking at some of the XNA games that they had on there, the community stuff, and there was not a lot that I'm interested in, but there's a few that I was going to try.

05:55.404 --> 05:57.165
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet.

05:57.745 --> 06:01.508
[SPEAKER_10]: I did on the DS, I tried giving...

06:03.001 --> 06:05.643
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob's Game, another try, and no, it still sucks.

06:05.763 --> 06:06.304
[SPEAKER_10]: Really bad.

06:06.444 --> 06:08.665
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it sucks even more than the last time I played it.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.648
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just so poorly put together.

06:11.868 --> 06:13.049
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

06:14.570 --> 06:18.573
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried a little bit of... What was it?

06:18.693 --> 06:19.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Trackmania DS.

06:19.934 --> 06:20.474
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fun.

06:21.935 --> 06:25.198
[SPEAKER_10]: And last week we played Muramasa, the Demon Blade.

06:25.258 --> 06:29.982
[SPEAKER_10]: That game, actually, I'm thinking I'm not going to pick it up when it comes out in the US.

06:30.642 --> 06:31.343
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not...

06:32.441 --> 06:32.841
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.184
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite how I pictured it.

06:35.204 --> 06:37.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that what we were looking at last week at the Bort show?

06:37.426 --> 06:38.647
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it was the Japanese one.

06:39.128 --> 06:43.632
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually I'll pick it up when they come over here.

06:44.032 --> 06:48.196
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks good, but it's just not something I can see myself putting a lot of time into.

06:51.139 --> 06:52.521
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm trying to think what else I played.

06:53.442 --> 06:53.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

06:54.980 --> 06:56.342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it right now.

06:56.362 --> 06:57.263
[SPEAKER_10]: I have just a lot of stuff.

06:57.283 --> 07:01.127
[SPEAKER_10]: I got into the Fat Princess beta, which if we have time, I may show some of that.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.131
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know if that plays offline or not.

07:05.372 --> 07:06.693
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

07:06.713 --> 07:07.374
[SPEAKER_10]: I just downloaded it.

07:08.075 --> 07:08.435
[SPEAKER_10]: And then...

07:11.064 --> 07:13.565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it for right now for games.

07:13.585 --> 07:14.986
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just been busy.

07:15.406 --> 07:16.026
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, sounds good.

07:16.046 --> 07:19.847
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you unpause the demo and let the folks see a little more of it while... I'm going to hook up the audio again.

07:20.047 --> 07:20.508
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sounds good.

07:20.528 --> 07:23.789
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to talk a little bit about My Gaming Week, and we're going to do something a little different tonight.

07:23.829 --> 07:29.731
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's just Loki and I, just the two of us, us two here holding down the fort, we're actually going to do something different tonight.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.672
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to let our Skype line be open all night long.

07:31.792 --> 07:37.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually we only will take Skype calls at the end of the show, but tonight you guys are truly in the passenger seat.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.415
[SPEAKER_11]: You will be able to call in, and if you want to...

07:39.815 --> 07:40.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

08:06.144 --> 08:06.805
[SPEAKER_11]: My Gaming Week.

08:07.586 --> 08:10.049
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, not totally eventful.

08:10.129 --> 08:11.650
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still on my Wii Fit plan.

08:11.991 --> 08:17.417
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been two weeks since I started actually taking Wii Fit seriously, and I'm trying to get in as much of it as I can every day.

08:17.777 --> 08:23.023
[SPEAKER_11]: I did go through a two or three day streak where I didn't play at all just because I had other stuff going on, but I've been trying to get in a good...

08:23.423 --> 08:23.943
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Leo Shen.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.819
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a little bit of Arcana Heart 2.

08:54.859 --> 08:56.260
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to give it another shot on the PS2.

09:17.331 --> 09:18.031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a piece of shit.

09:18.051 --> 09:19.732
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the all-girl fighting game.

09:19.772 --> 09:21.292
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got major slowdown and it was a pretty bad port.

09:44.364 --> 09:44.804
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

09:45.165 --> 09:46.846
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a port of an arcade version?

09:47.827 --> 09:48.247
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

09:49.007 --> 09:49.448
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

09:50.729 --> 09:52.029
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just a bad port?

09:52.210 --> 09:52.970
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it pixelated?

09:52.990 --> 09:53.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it run crappy?

09:54.051 --> 09:55.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it just not fun?

09:55.832 --> 09:58.154
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could put your finger on what it is, what is it?

10:00.776 --> 10:01.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

10:02.617 --> 10:11.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever, okay, all the old characters are fine, but when you try to use the new characters, their frame rate slows down majorly and it

10:11.721 --> 10:16.825
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much makes the game, like, you can play it, but it's just not fun waiting for it.

10:17.845 --> 10:20.647
[SPEAKER_11]: If it was in the arcade and on PS3, maybe.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.848
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

10:36.400 --> 10:42.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I've been playing a lot of Street Fighter 4 because I just received my tournament edition Madcap stick.

10:43.245 --> 10:44.285
[SPEAKER_11]: How does it play with the new stick?

10:45.886 --> 10:47.067
[SPEAKER_08]: It plays amazing with the stick.

10:48.908 --> 10:49.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.769
[SPEAKER_11]: How much of an investment was that for you?

10:53.231 --> 11:03.378
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I play a lot of fighters and I'm thinking that this could serve me well in BlazBlue, King of Fighters 12, and Tekken 6.

11:04.258 --> 11:05.219
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I picked it up.

11:06.857 --> 11:07.337
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, so you're very busy with fighting games.

11:11.518 --> 11:13.899
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like your primary genre of games you enjoy?

11:15.659 --> 11:18.960
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I play all sorts.

11:19.940 --> 11:23.841
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently I've been playing a lot of eroge, which is Japanese pornography games.

11:23.861 --> 11:25.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are fun.

11:26.102 --> 11:26.442
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

11:27.202 --> 11:27.822
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like fun.

11:28.143 --> 11:29.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you a role-playing game fan?

11:29.843 --> 11:30.983
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you excited about Final Fantasy XIII?

11:31.003 --> 11:31.043
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

11:34.540 --> 11:39.864
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking with Lost Odyssey I'm liking Lost Odyssey a lot I don't like Final Fantasy at all No problem, you too

11:57.808 --> 11:58.808
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

11:58.868 --> 11:59.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy those fighting games.

12:00.149 --> 12:03.510
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I'm actually a little bit distracted by this Final Fantasy XIII demo.

12:03.530 --> 12:03.950
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is this?

12:03.970 --> 12:05.611
[SPEAKER_11]: This is that one new character that was announced.

12:05.651 --> 12:07.592
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and he has a chocobo that lives in his afro.

12:07.752 --> 12:10.253
[SPEAKER_11]: A little chocobo that lives in the dude's afro, and he just kind of let it go.

12:10.553 --> 12:11.853
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm watching this.

12:11.973 --> 12:14.214
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all like the in-game engine, isn't it?

12:14.534 --> 12:14.694
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

12:15.054 --> 12:15.615
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my gosh.

12:16.315 --> 12:16.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.335
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks nice.

12:18.096 --> 12:18.356
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

12:18.396 --> 12:19.596
[SPEAKER_11]: We got another call coming in, so why not?

12:19.616 --> 12:20.176
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take this call.

12:20.496 --> 12:21.337
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

12:21.357 --> 12:21.657
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

12:22.397 --> 12:23.317
[SPEAKER_11]: It's GS68.

12:23.457 --> 12:24.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, GS68.

12:24.158 --> 12:24.518
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

12:26.485 --> 12:26.985
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

12:27.245 --> 12:27.986
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

12:28.646 --> 12:30.207
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, so you've had a pretty busy week.

12:30.227 --> 12:36.131
[SPEAKER_07]: So even after all these years, you're still playing Para Para Paradise?

12:36.151 --> 12:36.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

12:54.099 --> 12:55.941
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, whenever I get a little penis girlfriend.

12:56.982 --> 13:02.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on Friday, I had a male friend and a female friend with me, and they encouraged me to play, so I played around.

13:04.048 --> 13:04.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Parapara Paradise

13:27.228 --> 13:33.337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier to maintain the machines because instead of stepping on pads, you just move your hands under sensors so you're not wearing out the sensors.

13:34.960 --> 13:40.969
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, not only is it easier to freestyle, but the game actually encourages you to freestyle.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.552
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a guy locally who used to play Para Para Paradise.

13:44.592 --> 13:49.536
[SPEAKER_11]: He was very good at the freestyle, but he didn't do the Para girl type moves.

13:49.616 --> 13:51.838
[SPEAKER_11]: He did this weird rave dancing thing.

13:51.858 --> 13:53.720
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember that guy with the little hat?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.642
[SPEAKER_11]: He was really good at that stuff.

13:55.662 --> 13:56.562
[SPEAKER_11]: He would do break dancing.

13:56.582 --> 13:58.444
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he'd do break dancing to Para Para Paradise.

13:58.484 --> 14:00.786
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, that's Para freestyle to me.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.948
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty cool.

14:03.228 --> 14:08.913
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Para kind of got teased a little bit over here because it's such a girl game or what have you, but it's fun.

14:08.933 --> 14:09.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck it.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.365
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember myself as more manly for playing that game.

14:15.406 --> 14:18.507
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, you know, most men would not bother with that game.

14:19.387 --> 14:21.868
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting, the cultural differences from there to here.

14:23.529 --> 14:23.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

14:24.749 --> 14:26.970
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

14:27.410 --> 14:34.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I gave... Yeah, I got... I played the Bare Knuckle 3, the Japanese version of Streets of Rage 3 with the English patch.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.474
[SPEAKER_07]: The story's much more comprehensible, and I...

14:38.479 --> 14:44.342
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually get to play on the real normal difficulty instead of this American normal that's really Japanese hard BS.

14:45.182 --> 14:45.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

14:46.023 --> 14:49.844
[SPEAKER_11]: So, wait, then Japanese normal is like easy mode.

14:51.565 --> 14:53.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there are a lot of changes to the American version.

14:53.646 --> 14:55.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, all the difficulties got bumped up by one.

14:56.007 --> 15:01.950
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, on the US version, easy is the equivalent of normal on Japanese version.

15:02.910 --> 15:08.133
[SPEAKER_07]: And what really sucks about it is that if you play on easy on the US version...

15:08.885 --> 15:12.427
[SPEAKER_07]: The game ends on stage 5 with a bad ending, which I think is retarded.

15:15.069 --> 15:18.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, excuse me, I just coughed.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to hear about the bad ending.

15:21.133 --> 15:25.316
[SPEAKER_11]: My god, if it's not the computer breaking, it's me breaking here at OLR.

15:25.336 --> 15:25.797
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, sorry.

15:26.077 --> 15:28.398
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry to hear about the bad ending of the game.

15:28.619 --> 15:30.680
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get back to our gaming weeks, but thanks for the call, buddy.

15:30.900 --> 15:31.360
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one.

15:32.381 --> 15:34.483
[SPEAKER_11]: And keep dancing the par-a-par no matter what anyone else says.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.464
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye.

15:37.776 --> 15:38.537
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:59.955 --> 16:00.616
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

16:30.175 --> 16:42.869
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's very buggy right now and it's having a lot of lag and bug issues and some of the WoW and Blizzard folks have been taking a lot of heat from the fans for not testing this patch thoroughly enough because they're having a lot of problems on the main server.

16:43.110 --> 16:46.754
[SPEAKER_11]: People have been getting stranded in the Uldular dungeons where they've been locked out of their characters.

16:47.514 --> 16:48.955
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, people have been having problems.

16:49.035 --> 16:51.635
[SPEAKER_11]: I was having problems today with the jousting in Argon Tournament.

16:52.035 --> 16:58.697
[SPEAKER_11]: You're supposed to do, like, you want to collect five emblems every day, and that's the most you can collect, and then you can advance quicker through the levels.

16:58.717 --> 16:59.998
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to collect my five every day.

17:00.338 --> 17:07.420
[SPEAKER_11]: And while I was trying to do my fights to get one of the emblems, the game was just, like, I was losing when it was halfway through the fight.

17:07.840 --> 17:08.840
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of buggy.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.621
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was disappointing a little bit.

17:11.261 --> 17:11.781
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but you...

17:12.481 --> 17:14.062
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe these people, blah blah blah blah

17:32.799 --> 17:33.640
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:52.398 --> 17:55.340
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's the battle system, it's transitioned into this.

17:55.740 --> 18:01.503
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a little bar that's like your AP bar or whatever, and you can pick attacks and they have different lengths.

18:01.603 --> 18:08.786
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one attack will do one, I can do three normal attacks, and it'll do just kind of like a little hack and slash thing.

18:09.527 --> 18:18.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, for example, I can do Fagra, which will do all three, and then that attacks everything.

18:19.434 --> 18:20.516
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

18:28.148 --> 18:29.629
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, especially if you're trying to find a cure spell.

18:29.649 --> 18:31.930
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, uh, where is it out here?

18:32.010 --> 18:34.572
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, uh, maybe it's this menu.

18:34.612 --> 18:41.776
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these other menus, I think it's, if I remember correctly, I think that's attack, skill, and I think that's white magic, maybe.

18:41.796 --> 18:45.518
[SPEAKER_11]: You can probably guess it's very similar to the layout of most other Final Fantasy games, too.

18:45.598 --> 18:47.119
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, your top command's always going to be attack.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.360
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, you can just do, like, three different things.

18:49.380 --> 18:52.042
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I don't even know what I just did there, but...

18:52.782 --> 19:05.250
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's interesting because having played a lot of Final Fantasy XII, it looks like in a way they've taken a step back to not even XI because XI was so different, but X. This is more like Final Fantasy X's battles.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.392
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's supposed to be like XII because you can actually avoid battles.

19:08.453 --> 19:11.815
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to not walk into the creature.

19:12.015 --> 19:13.396
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of a hybrid of X and XII.

19:13.476 --> 19:14.557
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

19:14.637 --> 19:15.137
[SPEAKER_10]: Strange.

19:15.897 --> 19:16.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Very strange.

19:17.609 --> 19:17.829
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

19:18.029 --> 19:21.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you want to join us and chat with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.590
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be reading comments from chat all night.

19:22.610 --> 19:23.631
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll also have the phone lines open.

19:23.651 --> 19:31.152
[SPEAKER_11]: I am trying to keep a little eye on the Justin TV chat, but I'm not always the best at balancing two chat rooms, especially when we're down a host tonight.

19:31.772 --> 19:35.073
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all very, very busy in multitasking right now here in studio.

19:35.413 --> 19:37.814
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will do our best to try and get through the show tonight.

19:38.554 --> 19:40.214
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start to get into some gaming news.

19:40.254 --> 19:42.195
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, I want to talk about some housekeeping tonight.

19:43.155 --> 19:43.595
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com.

20:07.950 --> 20:09.630
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the computer was a doorstop, yes.

20:10.411 --> 20:11.751
[SPEAKER_11]: The video card was just sitting there.

20:12.051 --> 20:12.691
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hilarious.

20:13.151 --> 20:14.672
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, now we're getting some use out of it.

20:14.932 --> 20:16.032
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is what I wanted to say.

20:16.352 --> 20:33.736
[SPEAKER_11]: It has come to my attention that the listeners, a lot of the people that were listening last night, or not last night, last week, actually ended up taking up a collection because of, and I don't know if it was inspired by my frustrations and venting that was going on that night with all the problems and what have you,

20:34.096 --> 20:35.457
[SPEAKER_11]: or what it was.

20:35.577 --> 20:38.358
[SPEAKER_11]: But regardless, the listeners took up a collection.

20:38.378 --> 20:43.201
[SPEAKER_11]: They collected something like, I'm not even kidding, $250 or $280 I think they got, almost $300.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.562
[SPEAKER_11]: They've bought us a new studio computer.

20:45.762 --> 20:48.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Some type of refurbished thing I think they got on Newegg.

20:48.343 --> 20:50.304
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got us a new studio computer that's on its way.

20:50.344 --> 20:51.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's awfully nice.

20:51.505 --> 20:51.705
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

20:51.745 --> 20:52.786
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.

20:52.806 --> 20:53.326
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a Mac.

20:53.846 --> 20:54.507
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not a Mac.

20:54.547 --> 20:55.227
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a Mac, Loki.

20:55.468 --> 20:56.909
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, guys, you didn't have to do that.

20:56.929 --> 20:58.651
[SPEAKER_11]: We just needed the video card.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.291
[SPEAKER_11]: We're fine.

20:59.371 --> 21:06.638
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, now that we know there's a third one coming, we're kind of like, okay, well, come to think of it, there is a lot we could do with a third computer.

21:07.539 --> 21:11.603
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have one in the house so we could stream more from the TV in there.

21:12.003 --> 21:16.968
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have a satellite computer at DarkSakura's for nights that we want to broadcast from her house.

21:17.008 --> 21:17.968
[SPEAKER_11]: There's things we can do with it.

21:18.389 --> 21:19.170
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's...

21:20.362 --> 21:21.443
[SPEAKER_11]: or Loki can tear it apart.

21:21.924 --> 21:23.586
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to tear it apart.

21:23.626 --> 21:30.135
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just... It might come in handy with Skype later on.

21:30.475 --> 21:31.076
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, okay.

21:31.116 --> 21:31.737
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, sure.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.579
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do some fancy things with Skype.

21:33.599 --> 21:35.081
[SPEAKER_11]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

21:35.121 --> 21:36.242
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good.

21:36.523 --> 21:37.264
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm liking this idea.

21:39.415 --> 21:40.637
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, great.

21:40.757 --> 21:45.061
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, Brad from PodCulture in the chatroom is clarifying it's a lot of new parts as well.

21:45.182 --> 21:45.822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all new parts.

21:46.463 --> 21:48.105
[SPEAKER_11]: And all the chatters are being very nice.

21:48.285 --> 21:50.567
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says, we didn't have to, but we wanted to.

21:51.148 --> 21:52.189
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are very, very nice.

21:52.229 --> 21:55.453
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm almost at a loss for words, like, when I read about it.

21:55.653 --> 21:57.855
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, my reaction is just like, guys, you really don't, I mean, like...

21:58.416 --> 22:03.559
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of pride ourselves on the fact that we've done this for seven years and really not made a lot of money off of it.

22:04.059 --> 22:07.622
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't think we've made any money off of it.

22:07.662 --> 22:15.446
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks to another very generous donation we had a couple years ago on Christmas, you might remember, we got to do some travel the next year and do some shows that we wouldn't normally do.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.408
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I want to say something about shows in a minute.

22:19.289 --> 22:21.050
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's just been...

22:22.090 --> 22:29.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Just very thankful and very floored and just really shows you the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio and it's just amazing.

22:30.132 --> 22:31.693
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very thankful.

22:31.833 --> 22:32.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

22:32.453 --> 22:34.313
[SPEAKER_10]: They say that I'm going to fill it full of porn.

22:34.773 --> 22:35.454
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wrong.

22:35.634 --> 22:38.514
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a PC at home and a PSP to fill full of porn.

22:38.575 --> 22:40.335
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need any more porn on this computer.

22:40.455 --> 22:42.597
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying Loki will have to put it together, which is fine.

22:42.777 --> 22:43.177
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

22:44.939 --> 22:48.742
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to put the old drives in it so we don't lose any of the shows and all that, so we'll figure it out.

22:48.762 --> 22:49.063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

22:49.303 --> 22:50.224
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to call Ranma.

22:50.264 --> 22:53.346
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been trying to get a hold of me, and I've been so busy trying to get everything together.

22:54.648 --> 22:56.249
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have more to come.

22:56.349 --> 22:57.270
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll put it to good use.

22:57.630 --> 22:58.591
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we will.

22:58.731 --> 23:01.053
[SPEAKER_11]: One way or another, we will definitely get good use out of that machine.

23:02.034 --> 23:02.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Very excited.

23:03.295 --> 23:03.896
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

23:05.869 --> 23:07.291
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, what else do I want to mention?

23:07.351 --> 23:20.982
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of travel, I am going to be attending, after being requested to do so for about the past three years by various listeners, it is true, which you may have heard, I am going to ASAN, Anime Central in Chicago.

23:21.543 --> 23:24.265
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only am I going, I'm going to be doing a panel there.

23:24.345 --> 23:26.287
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called So You Think You Can Podcast.

23:26.827 --> 23:42.175
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm going to take my seven years of podcasting experience well, radio slash podcasting experience and talk about how if you are an independent gamer independent anime fan it's not going to be just about video games it's about fandom if you have a fandom you want to make a podcast about

23:42.355 --> 23:44.176
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura and Loki not able to go.

23:44.216 --> 23:44.296
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

24:07.868 --> 24:09.329
[SPEAKER_11]: because the wife won't let Loki go.

24:10.129 --> 24:12.250
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have travel budget.

24:13.951 --> 24:18.433
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing the E3 thing just because... I'm using my tax return to do it.

24:18.753 --> 24:20.234
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not something that was paid for by anybody.

24:20.374 --> 24:26.157
[SPEAKER_10]: I got paid for by my work because our work gave us each $1,500 trips, basically.

24:27.037 --> 24:33.400
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm using it to go to LA and we're staying at a nice hotel, E3, and then a slum hotel in Disneyland.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.342
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go do that.

24:36.502 --> 24:36.522
[SPEAKER_10]: I

24:37.282 --> 24:39.603
[SPEAKER_10]: Find something for the wife to do while I'm at E3, though.

24:40.484 --> 24:50.989
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to get her in, but I thought about it, and even if I could get her in, which wouldn't have been exactly the most up-and-up ways, she would have been bored out of her mind.

24:51.069 --> 24:53.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

24:53.611 --> 24:53.851
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

24:54.757 --> 25:17.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby is in chat right now, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us on All Games Radio I have considered going to ASEN just to crash Rob's panel, that's very sweet That's alright because I was going to go to DragonCon and crash yours But then I guess they have, now PAX and DragonCon are the same weekend or whatever PAX is looking very likely this year as well, it's just, I think we're all in the mindset of Let's get past E3 first, then we'll talk PAX Yeah, I'm not going to PAX No

25:17.876 --> 25:19.397
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I definitely want to go.

25:19.997 --> 25:23.820
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be the last trip I take for a long time, unfortunately.

25:23.860 --> 25:24.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough, fair enough.

25:24.780 --> 25:25.601
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to do what you got to do.

25:25.761 --> 25:26.482
[SPEAKER_11]: Personal life first.

25:26.902 --> 25:27.102
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

25:27.922 --> 25:32.325
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news because the Justin TV-ers are like, are you going to unpause the damn game?

25:32.345 --> 25:33.046
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

25:33.286 --> 25:33.926
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to do a show.

25:34.006 --> 25:35.387
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't multitask like that.

25:35.527 --> 25:36.168
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I probably could.

25:36.188 --> 25:37.368
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

25:37.408 --> 25:39.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it say Final Fantasy XIII television?

25:39.490 --> 25:39.690
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

25:39.710 --> 25:41.551
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to do both tonight.

25:41.591 --> 25:41.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

25:42.131 --> 25:42.312
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

25:42.332 --> 25:42.732
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's all right.

25:43.212 --> 25:44.213
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't apologize, Loki.

26:13.345 --> 26:13.925
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

26:32.714 --> 26:34.254
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, here's what you're going to get.

26:35.014 --> 26:36.115
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get this case.

26:36.235 --> 26:37.955
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have a voucher in it.

26:38.035 --> 26:40.356
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have a printed manual, and it'll be $20.

26:40.516 --> 26:45.156
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if you don't give a crap about your printed manual, you can download it for $15.

26:47.257 --> 26:52.738
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I think $5 for a case that you're basically going to throw away in a manual is a ripoff to me.

26:52.838 --> 26:57.479
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is something that they're trying, that they're testing out, apparently.

26:59.352 --> 27:02.094
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling, though, that this is not going to be a test.

27:02.314 --> 27:14.481
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if that PSP 2 rumor, or whatever, 4000 or whatever you're going to call it, happened to be true, and there is a no UMD port in the new upcoming system, then all of the PSP games will be like this.

27:16.007 --> 27:26.821
[SPEAKER_10]: or at least they're going to have this option so that you can those who may not have this new system will be able to download it or be able to play it on the original system as well.

27:26.841 --> 27:28.804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this sounds like a little more than a test to me.

27:29.304 --> 27:33.470
[SPEAKER_11]: This is letting the middle man down gently is I think what this is about.

27:33.510 --> 27:34.031
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think?

27:34.471 --> 27:34.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

27:34.951 --> 27:38.854
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is very successful, which I actually don't think it's going to be.

27:39.394 --> 27:40.635
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to be that successful.

27:40.715 --> 27:42.837
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think this is going to sell any more than the regular arcade title.

27:42.877 --> 27:48.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I think if they were smart, they would not put it in stores and just leave it as a download, and that's it.

27:48.761 --> 28:00.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think they're wasting money putting it in stores, because really, if you're an informed buyer, an informed consumer, you're going to realize, huh, it's $5 cheaper online.

28:00.269 --> 28:01.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hell would I pay for it in the store?

28:01.890 --> 28:02.030
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

28:02.210 --> 28:02.531
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

28:19.063 --> 28:24.587
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's just going to be the same price online versus buying it in the store, why do I even bother buying it in the store?

28:25.268 --> 28:35.955
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this for grandma, mom, relative who just wanders into the game store and thinks this looks like a good family-friendly title to buy the children?

28:36.215 --> 28:40.258
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, but at the same time, it also might be for the people that had pre-orders on it.

28:41.479 --> 28:41.879
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

28:42.159 --> 28:42.800
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time...

28:44.226 --> 28:44.847
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

29:10.748 --> 29:12.169
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't sell it used.

29:12.409 --> 29:13.630
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no used copies.

29:14.031 --> 29:16.793
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all new all the time.

29:16.813 --> 29:18.475
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to comment on this.

29:18.895 --> 29:19.916
[SPEAKER_11]: We are open all night tonight.

29:20.516 --> 29:28.443
[SPEAKER_11]: Decipher in chat says they're not really wasting money putting it into stores as it will let people who didn't know about the online store find out about it and how to use it.

29:28.823 --> 29:30.405
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cheeseburger says this could be for a gift.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are coming from our chat room, chat.orangeonsradio.com.

29:32.967 --> 29:36.929
[SPEAKER_10]: But they could easily do a gift online or something with a voucher and that kind of stuff.

29:37.029 --> 29:37.990
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that can be done.

29:38.570 --> 29:38.950
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.031
[SPEAKER_10]: But Grandma can't exactly go on the PlayStation Store.

29:41.192 --> 29:41.652
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

29:42.012 --> 29:42.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

29:42.672 --> 29:45.594
[SPEAKER_11]: They know, oh, my grandson loves video games.

29:45.614 --> 29:47.255
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to GameStop and buy a game.

29:47.415 --> 29:49.756
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this Patapon looks very nice and cutesy.

29:49.776 --> 29:50.357
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll buy this.

29:50.757 --> 29:50.997
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

29:51.757 --> 29:52.538
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, yeah.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.479
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, I don't know how... Is it going to be enough?

29:55.519 --> 29:59.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there really going to be enough of that to justify this whole strange way of releasing titles?

30:00.002 --> 30:00.342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

30:01.463 --> 30:01.483
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

30:02.481 --> 30:06.944
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a test, and I have a feeling, though, it's not going to be just a one-time test, despite what they said.

30:08.544 --> 30:12.667
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling it's going to be something that we're going to see a lot more of.

30:15.328 --> 30:21.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, everyone's kind of going to the online digital stuff, especially now with the iPhone app store doing well by itself.

30:21.632 --> 30:26.915
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're realizing they don't need to sell stuff in a traditional marketplace.

30:26.935 --> 30:28.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, are you trying to blame Apple for this whole thing?

30:31.402 --> 30:32.362
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of it, I guess.

30:32.782 --> 30:34.743
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not even so much Apple.

30:34.783 --> 30:38.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at Xbox Live Arcade or even just the normal PlayStation Network.

30:38.964 --> 30:43.926
[SPEAKER_10]: They've figured out that you can put stuff out just digital only and it still sells pretty well.

30:44.106 --> 30:44.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the lines.

30:44.866 --> 30:45.326
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a call.

30:45.386 --> 30:46.286
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

30:46.306 --> 30:46.687
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

30:47.727 --> 30:48.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

30:48.607 --> 30:49.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Actdeft.

30:49.307 --> 30:49.688
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

30:49.708 --> 30:50.448
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about this?

30:50.528 --> 30:56.490
[SPEAKER_11]: Patapon 2, digital release only, but kind of $5 more if you want the case and manual in stores.

30:56.510 --> 30:56.950
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

30:58.015 --> 30:59.936
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's a good idea.

31:00.836 --> 31:08.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily in the United States, but in the whole world, especially down in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

31:09.260 --> 31:14.983
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those listeners that don't listen to the show regularly, you actually are from Mexico, so I'm kind of curious your perspective on this.

31:15.063 --> 31:15.223
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

31:16.782 --> 31:17.283
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

31:17.363 --> 31:25.652
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the PSN store in Mexico, it's barely updated on time.

31:26.273 --> 31:34.441
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't get all the stuff the US gets, like some games, demos, videos, and other stuff.

31:35.342 --> 31:55.689
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Fata Ponteo goes to only download on the PSN, I don't know if it would get released on time, but having to go to the store and having something you can use to download, it would be very useful.

31:56.636 --> 31:59.197
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, have you heard anything about what's going to happen outside the US?

32:00.138 --> 32:03.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I would think, wouldn't these codes be region locked on top of everything else?

32:04.179 --> 32:05.880
[SPEAKER_10]: They released as UMD in Europe.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.682
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is only in Japan, I think they also released it as a UMD.

32:10.842 --> 32:14.224
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's only in the US that they're trying this right now.

32:16.765 --> 32:21.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the things they release in the US, it's brought over here.

32:21.387 --> 32:23.948
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I'm concerned about this.

32:24.870 --> 32:31.694
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a PSP, but I tried the Patapon 1 demo on a friend's PSP, and I liked it.

32:31.754 --> 32:35.497
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm getting a PSP soon, probably will, I do want to get Patapon 2.

32:35.537 --> 32:35.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

32:49.011 --> 32:56.775
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you do end up getting the PSP or if your friend does it, I'd be kind of curious how easy or difficult it is for you to do so.

32:57.055 --> 32:58.376
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll have to follow up with us later.

33:00.697 --> 33:00.877
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

33:01.098 --> 33:01.878
[SPEAKER_11]: And let us know how it goes.

33:02.158 --> 33:03.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well thanks for the call, Actdeft.

33:04.179 --> 33:04.700
[SPEAKER_11]: And have a good one.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

33:05.200 --> 33:05.340
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

33:06.140 --> 33:07.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

33:08.041 --> 33:14.565
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing a little bit different and keeping it open all night tonight for your calls if you want to call in at any time and comment on what have you.

33:15.045 --> 33:18.107
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go ahead and move on to another story and talk a little bit about Gears of...

33:18.487 --> 33:19.287
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Gears of War 3.

33:19.567 --> 33:20.128
[SPEAKER_11]: God of War 3.

33:20.368 --> 33:21.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I see G-O-W, I think Gears of War.

33:22.008 --> 33:23.029
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually God of War 3.

33:24.189 --> 33:24.769
[SPEAKER_11]: God of War 3.

33:24.829 --> 33:26.670
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there was a survey going on out there.

33:27.110 --> 33:29.351
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's going to be a God of War 3 collector's edition.

33:29.391 --> 33:37.574
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing they've actually been exploring, putting into this, per a survey that went out earlier this week, that there could be re-releases of God of War 1 and 2 on Blu-ray.

33:40.031 --> 33:41.851
[SPEAKER_11]: God of War 2 Cinematic Movie Compilation

34:03.474 --> 34:18.780
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's feasible to actually be able to play PlayStation 2 games and emulate them on Blu-ray, then that means that they've built an emulator that runs in software, which means that they can do an update that will be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games.

34:18.840 --> 34:22.081
[SPEAKER_10]: But why would they do that if they can resell the game just like Nintendo does?

34:22.381 --> 34:32.805
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, that's true, but I think that they would want to do it as a patch so that you can have it on the system so that you can download PlayStation 2 games, just like you can PlayStation 1 games.

34:32.865 --> 34:38.828
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling this is where it's going to go, and I have a feeling they're playing this down right now because that's going to be an announcement that they're going to make.

34:39.688 --> 34:41.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if this ever comes to fruition.

34:41.229 --> 34:42.850
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it could be just all talk right now, but...

34:43.590 --> 34:48.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and if a later comment from Sony is to be believed, this is just all talk right now.

34:48.834 --> 34:55.059
[SPEAKER_11]: There was actually an unnamed Sony Computer Entertainment representative that said, It is simply a marketing survey.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.881
[SPEAKER_11]: The goal of it is to do focus testing.

34:57.321 --> 35:01.965
[SPEAKER_11]: If that was the number one requested thing, that would be something they would need to see if it was technically feasible.

35:02.685 --> 35:05.487
[SPEAKER_10]: That is retarded.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.308
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

35:06.408 --> 35:09.290
[SPEAKER_10]: They would not offer something if it was completely unfeasible.

35:10.111 --> 35:12.693
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

35:36.451 --> 35:40.982
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm sorry but I have a feeling if this is on this survey that it's going to happen.

35:42.968 --> 35:46.309
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not offer that, but it's something that they're working on, obviously.

35:46.429 --> 35:51.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't these companies usually use an outside marketing vendor to do this type of crap anyway?

35:51.210 --> 35:51.310
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

35:51.330 --> 35:54.091
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's just say the outside marketing vendor didn't just pull this out of their butt.

35:54.271 --> 36:00.292
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that they would do that because they're wanting to see, okay, we're going to make this box set or whatever of God of War.

36:00.812 --> 36:03.033
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the components that we're thinking about putting in it.

36:03.513 --> 36:09.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what people want in there and most people are looking for so we can cut our costs and not put everything in there.

36:09.614 --> 36:11.775
[SPEAKER_10]: We just put the stuff that people are mostly interested in.

36:12.375 --> 36:12.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

36:26.428 --> 36:27.548
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:49.798 --> 37:08.191
[SPEAKER_10]: and I will bet you anything this was a rumor from last E3 that they're you know figured out a way to have downloadable PlayStation 2 games and if they've got an emulator built of course they're going to use it because now you can reissue all those old PlayStation 2 games because you know a lot of them are out of print now and let's start making a lot more money you can sell them for 20 bucks a pop I would be so

37:08.251 --> 37:13.734
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy if a software emulator comes out for PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility, because I do have a lot of PS2 games I would like to play.

37:14.134 --> 37:18.356
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, I do still have a working PS2, but I'm running out of shelf space, for Christ's sake.

37:18.416 --> 37:22.258
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a 360, a Wii, and a PS3, and a cable box.

37:22.899 --> 37:25.640
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of crap in my living room.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.584
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also would be fine right now, too, because they dropped the price of the PlayStation 2.

37:29.884 --> 37:35.809
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it might cut into their PlayStation 2 system sales, but really at this point, who gives a crap about their system sales?

37:36.069 --> 37:37.751
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 44 million units out there.

37:38.011 --> 37:39.473
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares if it cuts down?

37:40.033 --> 37:41.895
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to catch up with the PlayStation 3, so...

37:43.841 --> 37:48.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, now we can say, hey, we're fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 stuff, and that would be a big thing.

37:48.564 --> 37:50.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's something thought-provoking from chat.

37:50.165 --> 37:57.170
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad from PodCulture says, Rob, Sony can make their buckage by selling the PlayStation 2 emulator as a purchase in the Sony online store.

37:57.270 --> 37:58.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God, don't give them ideas.

37:59.211 --> 38:01.193
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't give them ideas, because that sounds very feasible.

38:01.953 --> 38:02.494
[SPEAKER_11]: It really does.

38:02.874 --> 38:06.516
[SPEAKER_11]: HitStun says they could sell the PlayStation 2 emulator for $100 and people would buy it.

38:06.836 --> 38:08.538
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I draw the line.

38:08.658 --> 38:09.218
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pay $20.

38:11.266 --> 38:12.468
[SPEAKER_11]: I would pay probably up to $20.

38:13.410 --> 38:17.236
[SPEAKER_11]: More than that, I'll just say fuck it, I'll bring the PlayStation 2 in the house if there's something I really want to play.

38:17.536 --> 38:22.123
[SPEAKER_11]: But for that convenience of being able to get rid of my PS2 practically, I might actually pay like $20.

38:22.163 --> 38:23.626
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know.

38:25.168 --> 38:26.229
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

38:27.570 --> 38:32.033
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, GameGuru says E3 will obviously have Sony announce the end of the PlayStation 2.

38:32.553 --> 38:34.154
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's necessarily true.

38:34.394 --> 38:36.155
[SPEAKER_11]: They're never going to announce that.

38:37.096 --> 38:42.199
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they would ever come out on stage and say, and just so you know, we killed the PlayStation 2.

38:42.840 --> 38:43.480
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to do that.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.662
[SPEAKER_11]: We took it out to the barn last night and put a hole in it.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.103
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still making money.

38:47.343 --> 38:48.183
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not ever going to do that.

38:48.303 --> 38:52.266
[SPEAKER_11]: If the PlayStation 2 ever dies, which it won't, they're still making PS1 games.

38:52.726 --> 38:53.047
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're not.

38:53.067 --> 38:53.627
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people aren't.

38:54.367 --> 38:54.668
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they?

38:54.908 --> 38:54.988
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

38:55.288 --> 38:57.810
[SPEAKER_11]: Not Sony, but third-party developers are still supporting.

38:58.090 --> 38:58.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

38:58.991 --> 39:01.093
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they saw PlayStation 1 support years ago.

39:01.513 --> 39:05.976
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're still making PlayStation 2 games, and it's still doing pretty well for them.

39:06.577 --> 39:07.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

39:07.858 --> 39:08.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

39:08.138 --> 39:08.678
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's take a call.

39:09.819 --> 39:11.340
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Spazinator.

39:11.441 --> 39:12.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Spazinator.

39:12.361 --> 39:17.345
[SPEAKER_11]: So PlayStation 2 games possibly coming to the PlayStation 3, would you pay for an emulator?

39:18.726 --> 39:19.647
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

39:20.127 --> 39:23.870
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they don't go overly expensive with it.

39:25.316 --> 39:26.716
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's a pretty good idea.

39:27.657 --> 39:39.959
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense, I agree with you because you may have multiple systems and don't tend to sell you all the games.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.240
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a backwards compatible system would be great.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.241
[SPEAKER_01]: Less clutter, less wires, that kind of thing.

39:49.281 --> 39:50.642
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but...

39:52.403 --> 40:02.347
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at least with the original launch, you know, PlayStation 3s, you know, they were fully backwards compatible with the Emulsion Engine.

40:02.907 --> 40:05.708
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really find those new anymore, which kind of sucks.

40:06.664 --> 40:07.325
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, at least with me.

40:07.345 --> 40:08.025
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to have the 60GB model.

40:32.574 --> 40:57.983
[SPEAKER_01]: but as I had mentioned before last year that was stolen and unfortunately before the system was stolen I had sold my PlayStation 2 kind of thinking well since my system was backwards compatible why keep the PS2 around now after the theft I kind of regret that because my new system isn't backwards compatible but

40:58.766 --> 41:17.528
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I figure, you know, if they're going to do, like, some kind of update where they put Emily on it, you know, that'll be great, you know, because now I can go back and play all my old PlayStation 2 games over again, and a lot of them I haven't even finished yet, so, you know.

41:18.722 --> 41:25.588
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to go back and play some of my games I haven't finished or play some of the ones all over again.

41:25.648 --> 41:27.249
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are classics.

41:28.170 --> 41:30.252
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see them kind of unlock.

41:30.272 --> 41:35.856
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be a really sweet treat for Sony to kind of give people is the fact that you could suddenly play all your PlayStation 2 games again.

41:35.876 --> 41:36.316
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

41:36.597 --> 41:38.578
[SPEAKER_11]: The realist in me just thinks it's not happening.

41:38.758 --> 41:40.680
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still selling so many PlayStation 2s.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.662
[SPEAKER_11]: They realize that people have both.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.244
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Sony wants to live in this bubble.

41:45.344 --> 41:46.805
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they literally think.

41:46.865 --> 41:47.946
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there are people there.

41:48.326 --> 41:51.688
[SPEAKER_11]: And to kind of touch on what you were saying before you took my call

42:12.327 --> 42:22.574
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, granted, yeah, they just dropped the price on the PlayStation 2, and at least right now, the PlayStation 2 is selling better than the PlayStation 3.

42:24.035 --> 42:40.047
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to boost their PlayStation 3 sales dramatically, they would make some kind of emulator available on PSN ditch the

42:40.902 --> 42:48.246
[SPEAKER_01]: the physical PlayStation 2 all together and say, you know, we want you to buy this system.

42:48.446 --> 42:52.588
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play all your old games on it.

42:52.648 --> 43:08.916
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to pay some kind of fee for downloading, but you'll still be able to play your old games plus they'll buy all these new games and hopefully they'll see their sales on PlayStation 3 increase as a result, you know.

43:09.454 --> 43:14.536
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, Spazinator, I think we can all agree, though, that wherever Sony's going to think they're going to make the most money, that's what they're going to end up doing, right?

43:14.556 --> 43:15.816
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

43:16.356 --> 43:17.197
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a good one.

43:17.897 --> 43:19.377
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Spazinator, wait real quick before you go.

43:19.958 --> 43:22.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIII, you excited or don't care?

43:24.579 --> 43:25.359
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.

43:25.379 --> 43:29.221
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking forward to getting it.

43:29.321 --> 43:32.622
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a real big fan of the series for some years now.

43:34.512 --> 43:39.397
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, I even played the original one on the NES, so I'm kind of looking forward to it.

43:40.158 --> 43:50.628
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I see of trailers and whatnot, it looks like they took bits and pieces of different Final Fantasies, a little bit of 7, a little bit of 10, a little bit of 11, 12.

43:50.688 --> 43:58.856
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I really haven't played a bad Final Fantasy yet, so this one proved to be pretty good.

43:59.238 --> 43:59.398
[SPEAKER_11]: X2, or X2.

44:25.973 --> 44:27.355
[SPEAKER_11]: Spazinator, thanks so much for the call.

44:27.395 --> 44:27.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one.

44:27.835 --> 44:27.915
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

44:27.935 --> 44:28.676
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem, everybody.

44:40.462 --> 44:46.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, has there ever been just a Final Fantasy game where you just picked it up?

44:46.204 --> 44:48.504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not talking about your mystic quests.

44:48.524 --> 44:49.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not talking about your tactics.

44:49.885 --> 44:51.545
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

44:52.405 --> 44:54.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Have any of them been bad?

44:54.506 --> 44:55.866
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 didn't seem... I don't know.

44:55.906 --> 44:59.227
[SPEAKER_10]: I never played 12, but it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in.

44:59.367 --> 45:00.087
[SPEAKER_10]: But it wasn't bad?

45:01.228 --> 45:01.528
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

45:01.548 --> 45:02.088
[SPEAKER_10]: I never played it.

45:02.588 --> 45:02.828
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

45:02.888 --> 45:04.289
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, let's move on with some news.

45:04.689 --> 45:04.849
[SPEAKER_11]: We're...

45:06.235 --> 45:07.056
[SPEAKER_11]: Spiral of the Dragon Aragon

45:25.672 --> 45:29.773
[SPEAKER_10]: is actually going to be putting out a CG animated film.

45:30.533 --> 45:33.913
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have a movie poster for it, and it looks interesting.

45:34.294 --> 45:40.095
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Eragon, granted, was not a good movie, and I'd probably say the best part about that movie was the dragons.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.435
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hey, why not?

45:41.515 --> 45:42.195
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's run with it.

45:42.515 --> 45:43.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Run with what was good about it.

45:43.795 --> 45:46.156
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that sounds interesting.

45:47.156 --> 45:49.896
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on when it's going to be out yet, but hopefully soon.

45:50.216 --> 45:52.777
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine this will be something targeted towards children, though?

45:53.517 --> 45:54.377
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, yeah.

45:57.088 --> 45:57.869
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

45:57.969 --> 45:58.269
[SPEAKER_11]: It's neat.

46:01.372 --> 46:04.114
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm looking, Actdeft in chat says, wait, that's true?

46:04.755 --> 46:08.318
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess some things came out that maybe doubted the truth.

46:08.358 --> 46:09.219
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's true.

46:09.499 --> 46:11.901
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on their website, so I don't know.

46:12.542 --> 46:13.723
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

46:15.705 --> 46:16.065
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

46:17.126 --> 46:17.406
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

46:17.466 --> 46:20.589
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we will see in just a matter of time.

46:21.370 --> 46:21.910
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile...

46:22.950 --> 46:29.313
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently there are Star Trek costumes coming to PlayStation Home.

46:29.373 --> 46:30.093
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear about this?

46:30.753 --> 46:31.774
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

46:45.322 --> 46:46.383
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds about right, yeah.

46:46.703 --> 46:49.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you've actually paid for downloadable costumes at home, right, Loki?

46:50.226 --> 46:53.469
[SPEAKER_10]: Only the Santa Claus stuff, and that's the only costume that I'll be wearing forever.

46:53.489 --> 46:54.990
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you not pay for a Star Trek costume?

46:55.230 --> 46:56.371
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you're supposed to be free or what.

46:56.391 --> 46:57.352
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I am not a fan of Star Trek.

46:57.592 --> 46:59.874
[SPEAKER_10]: At least not to the point of where I'd buy a costume.

47:01.795 --> 47:02.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even a virtual costume.

47:04.678 --> 47:06.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in chat seemed to like that, though.

47:06.459 --> 47:08.441
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says, Star Trek costumes do want.

47:08.921 --> 47:09.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Kurosaki87 says, cool.

47:09.502 --> 47:09.622
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

47:13.496 --> 47:18.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something else that's coming out available on the PlayStation Network and also Xbox Live Arcade.

47:18.578 --> 47:27.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami announced at their Gamers Night that they're going to be putting out the third installment of Vandal Hearts, their strategy RPG series.

47:28.202 --> 47:31.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the new game is going to be Vandal Hearts Flames of Judgment.

47:31.383 --> 47:34.644
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be out on both the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

47:35.725 --> 47:39.386
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's been the first Vandal Hearts game we've had in a long time.

47:39.506 --> 47:40.767
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say the original...

47:41.952 --> 47:43.233
[SPEAKER_10]: Original PlayStation.

47:43.253 --> 47:49.259
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they did a PlayStation 2 game, but it's been a long time coming.

47:49.419 --> 47:57.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, figuring out that the online digital distribution method is still a very viable business model.

47:58.869 --> 47:59.229
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

48:00.541 --> 48:00.981
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed.

48:02.082 --> 48:04.224
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this is part of what they announced at their Big Gamers Night, right?

48:04.244 --> 48:09.468
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure we'll have other stories from that a little later, but I guess that was probably one of the pleasant surprise things they got into.

48:09.808 --> 48:11.069
[SPEAKER_10]: Oddly enough, no DDR news.

48:11.709 --> 48:12.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless they're saving that for E3.

48:13.010 --> 48:15.312
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, do you think that's good news or bad news?

48:16.353 --> 48:16.653
[SPEAKER_10]: Neither.

48:16.873 --> 48:19.575
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably... There's got to be something DDR in the works, right?

48:19.595 --> 48:21.757
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to do like, oh, look, Hottest Party 3.

48:21.797 --> 48:23.078
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you didn't see that coming.

48:23.398 --> 48:23.538
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

48:23.558 --> 48:25.960
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, or like, you know, Universe 4.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.100
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you didn't...

48:28.052 --> 48:30.014
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48:48.715 --> 48:50.216
[SPEAKER_11]: A silver system that plays PlayStation 2 games?

48:50.256 --> 48:50.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Again?

48:50.416 --> 48:50.817
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh...

49:04.248 --> 49:04.548
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe?

49:04.649 --> 49:08.192
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they'll do that, but there'll probably be another bundle.

49:08.212 --> 49:10.674
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll announce or something, maybe with God of War 3 or something.

49:10.994 --> 49:13.936
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you remember, they did a gunmetal gray one.

49:13.976 --> 49:16.038
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's sort of silver.

49:16.238 --> 49:17.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, wasn't there a white one also at some point?

49:18.400 --> 49:19.321
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not in the U.S.

49:19.341 --> 49:20.182
[SPEAKER_10]: That was overseas.

49:20.202 --> 49:22.223
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also been a silver one, I think, overseas.

49:24.986 --> 49:30.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess there is a silver PlayStation 3 available right now in Asia, actually.

49:30.723 --> 49:32.184
[SPEAKER_11]: So we just don't have it here.

49:32.805 --> 49:34.566
[SPEAKER_11]: But this controller would match that.

49:35.007 --> 49:35.427
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know.

49:35.707 --> 49:38.150
[SPEAKER_11]: Boy, Sony really loves to mix and match the regions.

49:38.270 --> 49:41.693
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't think of many companies that really mix and match their regions like Sony does.

49:42.633 --> 49:43.114
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

49:43.354 --> 49:43.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

49:43.674 --> 49:45.055
[SPEAKER_11]: Like with all the weird colors and stuff.

49:45.075 --> 49:46.357
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess Nintendo kind of does it too.

49:47.558 --> 49:47.838
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

49:48.585 --> 49:54.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Cananogram in chat asks, why would they release a clear blue DualShock 2 controller if there isn't a clear blue PlayStation 2?

49:54.511 --> 49:55.192
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, fair enough.

49:55.292 --> 49:59.256
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there doesn't have to be a silver PlayStation 3, but it's just kind of weird.

49:59.976 --> 50:03.800
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why I think that is because there's one already in another region.

50:04.080 --> 50:08.344
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just, you know... Could they just be unloading the extras from the other region, maybe?

50:09.566 --> 50:10.106
[SPEAKER_10]: Very possible.

50:10.707 --> 50:12.368
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't see why they couldn't, but...

50:15.187 --> 50:18.509
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's probably an indicator of something else, though.

50:19.070 --> 50:22.132
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that seems to be the way Sony rolls.

50:44.309 --> 50:44.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Download content.

50:44.829 --> 50:45.409
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I thought.

50:45.429 --> 50:47.750
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say it was delayed too.

50:47.970 --> 50:49.211
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucks.

50:49.411 --> 50:51.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Minion Everyday Hero comes out on the Wii.

50:51.712 --> 50:54.513
[SPEAKER_11]: Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

50:55.053 --> 50:58.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Little King's Story on the Nintendo Wii as well as the new Play Control version of Pikmin 2.

50:59.274 --> 51:02.936
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena all come out on the 24th.

51:07.478 --> 51:18.602
[SPEAKER_10]: This week, really only one game that you need to worry about picking up anyways, Excitebots Trick Racing.

51:18.622 --> 51:20.803
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be out on the 20th or tomorrow.

51:23.825 --> 51:25.725
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my gaming week right there, basically.

51:26.146 --> 51:31.708
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a version if you want to, if you're ever so inclined, with a wheel as well.

51:33.775 --> 51:35.056
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

51:48.975 --> 51:54.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other stuff, there's a PC game called Cryostasis.

51:56.020 --> 52:01.244
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, and Xbox 360 this week.

52:01.945 --> 52:06.889
[SPEAKER_10]: I Love Horses on the DS, and sadly enough, that's

52:07.729 --> 52:07.889
[SPEAKER_10]: It.

52:09.109 --> 52:13.470
[SPEAKER_10]: The week after that, there's going to be a bunch of crap coming out in the DS and then X-Men Origins.

52:14.610 --> 52:15.091
[SPEAKER_10]: Wolverine.

52:16.051 --> 52:22.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at chat, by the way, this is coming from JustinTVChat, because I'm trying to keep an eye on that, even though our main chat room is at chat.orange.com.

52:22.852 --> 52:27.573
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we have quite a few people in JustinTV who have never listened to this show before because of the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

52:28.113 --> 52:33.294
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to point out, though, AkumaJP, one of our JustinTV chatters, actually responded to something Alpha Catanagram said earlier.

52:33.714 --> 52:36.175
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a clear blue PlayStation 2 in Japan.

52:37.730 --> 52:39.671
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, part of the reason I love this show.

52:39.751 --> 52:45.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Most radio hosts, we get pissed off when listeners correct them on things, but I think we realize we can't be everywhere.

52:46.775 --> 53:00.403
[SPEAKER_11]: We do something pretty ambitious here by trying to keep in mind, yes, there are gamers in Europe, yes, there are gamers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, all those places we have listeners throughout the world, but we can't be all those places.

53:00.423 --> 53:04.325
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't always know what colors and what things you guys have, so you guys are always there to correct us.

53:05.953 --> 53:06.754
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

53:29.908 --> 53:36.229
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks very similar to the one... God, what's that game she loves on the Sega with the witch flying on the broom?

53:37.130 --> 53:38.230
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like her favorite game ever?

53:38.910 --> 53:39.230
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

53:39.330 --> 53:40.310
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the chatters will know it.

53:41.751 --> 53:46.752
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks very similar to that where it's a very comic style and everything in the game is little demons.

53:47.072 --> 53:49.893
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, this game looks kind of neat actually.

53:49.993 --> 53:50.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Death Smiles.

53:52.153 --> 53:52.854
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:10.868 --> 54:12.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Check that out if you are into that.

54:12.868 --> 54:20.430
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Monster Hunter G, that's going to be a big one coming out over there, as well as Tomb Raider Underworld finally gets its Japanese release.

54:20.610 --> 54:22.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the big releases on the Wii this week.

54:22.710 --> 54:38.794
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Little Anchor, also Tomb Raider Underworld, and a game called Kanuchi Kuroki Tsubasa no Shu comes out from Idea Factory, which looks to be an adventure game, probably based on another anime if the box art is any indication.

54:40.294 --> 54:55.442
[SPEAKER_11]: on the Nintendo DS we have another time another leaf that's what it's called Kagami no Naka no Tante comes out Last Bullet is another game coming out on the DS this week as well as something called I don't know what this is DS Vision Dual Masters Box Set

54:56.616 --> 55:01.541
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's some type of like dual master with the cards, like the actual cards, but it's something for the DS.

55:02.122 --> 55:02.562
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of weird.

55:02.582 --> 55:03.904
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the heck this is.

55:03.924 --> 55:07.347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably, I don't know, maybe something with the DSi or something.

55:07.387 --> 55:08.769
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be.

55:08.809 --> 55:11.792
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, maybe something that scans the cards, like an Eye of Judgment type thing with the DS.

55:12.272 --> 55:13.253
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I thinking too far?

55:13.714 --> 55:14.114
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

55:14.154 --> 55:17.418
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm totally guessing, so I don't really know.

55:17.978 --> 55:18.639
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's the case or not.

55:18.659 --> 55:20.920
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Chatters, you got it.

55:21.020 --> 55:22.361
[SPEAKER_11]: AlphaCananagram, was he first?

55:22.421 --> 55:23.502
[SPEAKER_11]: No, DarkTipsy said Cotton.

55:23.562 --> 55:26.304
[SPEAKER_11]: Panorama Cotton was the game I was trying to think of earlier.

55:26.384 --> 55:28.926
[SPEAKER_11]: That Death Smiles looks a little bit like Panorama Cotton.

55:28.946 --> 55:29.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, guys.

55:30.367 --> 55:42.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony PlayStation Portable in Japan sees the release of Hoshigari and Pusa Portable, which is coming out on the PSP, which looks to be another little school kid adventure game coming out on the PSP.

55:43.636 --> 55:45.037
[SPEAKER_11]: And Chronicle of Dungeon Maker

55:45.805 --> 55:48.106
[SPEAKER_11]: Nantama, if you're into Dungeon Maker, that's coming out as well.

55:48.886 --> 55:50.607
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

55:50.727 --> 55:51.808
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do a few more news items.

55:52.148 --> 55:56.030
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get into the classic game of the week, and then we will get into a break here.

55:58.411 --> 55:59.551
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki.

55:59.851 --> 56:02.413
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, you've got to pause Final Fantasy XIII if you can.

56:02.833 --> 56:03.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you in the middle of a battle?

56:04.153 --> 56:06.595
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in the middle of a battle, but that's all right.

56:07.315 --> 56:10.416
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, there was some interesting stuff.

56:12.287 --> 56:15.488
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a new action game coming from Square Enix.

56:16.389 --> 56:22.031
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a little bit different than... Oh, this is the one I'm thinking of.

56:22.291 --> 56:22.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

56:23.911 --> 56:26.952
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanguard Storm is the name of the game.

56:27.293 --> 56:34.535
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you may remember a game back on the PlayStation called Vanguard Hearts, I have a feeling it's a sequel to that.

56:35.196 --> 56:35.336
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

56:36.636 --> 56:47.365
[SPEAKER_10]: No word exactly on what it is, but apparently the May issue of the PlayStation Official Magazine made an announcement that they're working on unannounced titles.

56:47.505 --> 56:52.230
[SPEAKER_10]: So tie that in with that trademark for Vanguard Storm.

56:54.832 --> 56:57.774
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably what they're working on, a new Vanguard Hearts game, which would be pretty awesome.

56:58.375 --> 56:58.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

57:00.069 --> 57:00.609
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.

57:00.649 --> 57:03.911
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard kind of a flurry of stuff from Squeenix in just the past year or so.

57:03.931 --> 57:07.113
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember picking up Vanguard Hearts so I could get the demo for Final Fantasy VIII.

57:08.434 --> 57:10.235
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that came with a Brave Friends from Musashi.

57:10.755 --> 57:11.555
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, maybe that was Brave.

57:11.575 --> 57:12.336
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was both.

57:12.796 --> 57:13.076
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it?

57:13.256 --> 57:13.797
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

57:13.897 --> 57:14.857
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe I'm mixing them up.

57:14.937 --> 57:17.058
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe one of them had the VII demo or something.

57:17.078 --> 57:17.519
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

57:17.539 --> 57:19.059
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they had a demo for VII.

57:20.220 --> 57:20.680
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they did.

57:20.900 --> 57:21.161
[SPEAKER_11]: They did?

57:21.241 --> 57:21.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, they did.

57:22.121 --> 57:23.122
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they had a demo for VII.

57:23.282 --> 57:23.522
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

57:23.842 --> 57:24.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

57:24.863 --> 57:25.303
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they did.

57:27.126 --> 57:56.717
[SPEAKER_11]: um it was yeah because it was just that it was just it might have been multiple demos because they used to do that whereas a disc yeah I seem to remember that like they'd have an early demo then like a later demo that had extra stuff or something like just weird square type stuff to do uh our phone uh yeah Brave Fencer Musashi had the demo for Final Fantasy 7 says Actdeft oh yeah maybe I did play that demo because I bought Brave Fencer Musashi I I seem to remember um having that demo I don't remember if I rented it or what I did so

57:58.274 --> 58:01.217
[SPEAKER_11]: and then HendersonMan77 says it was actually with Toball No.

58:01.237 --> 58:01.217
1.

58:01.417 --> 58:02.599
[SPEAKER_11]: Had the demo to 7 as well.

58:02.999 --> 58:03.400
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it was.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.222
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there were a couple demos that came out.

58:05.522 --> 58:06.463
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so long ago, though.

58:06.844 --> 58:07.324
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyhow.

58:08.366 --> 58:09.767
[SPEAKER_11]: The phone lines are open, by the way.

58:09.787 --> 58:11.309
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:11.349 --> 58:15.935
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some folks might want to call in to talk about this one, but there were some drams in the music game world this week.

58:15.955 --> 58:16.756
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, some big drama.

58:17.876 --> 58:21.418
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Hero, Activision, and Scratch the Ultimate DJ.

58:41.345 --> 58:42.826
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

59:06.024 --> 59:06.264
[SPEAKER_10]: Deathwishing.

59:06.284 --> 59:07.245
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, welcome to America.

59:28.723 --> 59:30.124
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Sue Happy America.

59:30.144 --> 59:31.465
[SPEAKER_11]: Sue anybody for anything.

59:31.545 --> 59:35.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Where you can sue your own people that helped you get to where you are.

59:35.428 --> 59:37.050
[SPEAKER_11]: You can sue the pants off of them.

59:37.290 --> 59:41.113
[SPEAKER_11]: This is almost like Coke suing Coke Zero for sucking.

59:42.134 --> 59:44.416
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like Coke suing New Coke for sucking.

59:44.476 --> 59:45.096
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what it is.

59:45.316 --> 59:49.860
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like suing your mom for getting your umbilical cord cut.

59:50.661 --> 59:59.770
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously though, if this is true, if everything that they're saying is true, basically that Activision bought this company because originally...

01:00:00.915 --> 01:00:07.560
[SPEAKER_10]: They were going to sell it off to Activision or something like that, and Activision's basically in cahoots with them to delay this game so DJ Hero comes out.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.883
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say, to be fair, to cover both sides of the story before we open up and let the listeners comment.

01:00:13.244 --> 01:00:20.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision did publish a statement after the fact a little later in the week that says they, quote, strongly deny the allegations made by Genius Productions and Newmark Industries.

01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:23.451
[SPEAKER_11]: The claims are disingenuous and lack any merit.

01:00:24.568 --> 01:00:25.788
[SPEAKER_10]: They should be called Activision Blizzard.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:01:08.133
[SPEAKER_12]: and strange thing is I'm drinking coke right now dude just be random because I see coke stuff in chat but uh yeah I can't help to notice they always seem to lose or they always get dropped I bet you this one will be dropped because it's just the judge is just gonna go you guys are little children yeah we all just get along

01:01:09.884 --> 01:01:19.293
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but seriously though, basically they're saying that Activision and Genius met together and they signed NDAs and they showed each other's games.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:21.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Why they did that is beyond me.

01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:23.838
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they're trying to sell them Scratch or something.

01:01:23.858 --> 01:01:23.918
[SPEAKER_10]: And

01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:34.206
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're saying that 7 Studios, since they have all this insider knowledge of how the game works and we're developing the game, that they gave that knowledge to Activision, breaching their contract.

01:01:34.846 --> 01:01:50.238
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the same time, because they were behind schedule anyways on everything, they weren't meeting their quotas and they were demanding more and more and more money, that now they're basically dragging their feet so that the Activision game gets out first.

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.819
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still little babies.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.500
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying they're babies, but why?

01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Explain a little bit here.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do you think is the good guy in this scenario and why?

01:02:06.902 --> 01:02:12.044
[SPEAKER_12]: This is hard because they're both kind of just freaking out, in my opinion.

01:02:13.804 --> 01:02:15.005
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:02:15.105 --> 01:02:15.765
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard.

01:02:16.305 --> 01:02:21.487
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like one guy is suing because he's being sued and then

01:02:22.523 --> 01:02:26.366
[SPEAKER_12]: The other guy is suing the side company, I forgot what they're called.

01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:33.252
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of see this as false claims.

01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:38.276
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think it's really important which one of these games gets out first?

01:02:39.675 --> 01:02:41.357
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, yeah, this will be important.

01:02:41.397 --> 01:02:45.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one gets out first will probably be the more popular one.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.803
[SPEAKER_11]: But wasn't Guitar Hero out before Rock Band?

01:02:47.883 --> 01:02:52.887
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, Guitar Hero is more popular, I guess, in the long run, but I think a lot of people recognize Rock Band.

01:02:52.927 --> 01:02:58.392
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Rock Band's made much more money than Guitar Hero has.

01:02:58.573 --> 01:03:05.158
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I think Guitar Hero's fault is behind Rock Band's sales.

01:03:05.919 --> 01:03:07.201
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:26.242 --> 01:03:28.203
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like when Rock Band was coming out.

01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:28.984
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

01:03:29.824 --> 01:03:31.065
[SPEAKER_10]: People perceive it.

01:03:31.605 --> 01:03:35.888
[SPEAKER_10]: They want DJ Hero out, so people go, oh, that's just a crappy knockoff of DJ Hero.

01:03:35.908 --> 01:03:37.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would I want to play that?

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:43.772
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing is, Rock Band, though, was different because it did have a full band while Guitar Hero was just guitar.

01:03:43.812 --> 01:03:45.033
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's maybe why it sold better.

01:03:45.393 --> 01:03:46.454
[SPEAKER_12]: But these are the same games.

01:03:46.654 --> 01:03:48.595
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like saying Guitar Freaks is better than...

01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:50.396
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero

01:04:12.888 --> 01:04:17.592
[SPEAKER_11]: Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up part A and get to our break, but anything else you want to say for our listeners?

01:04:17.672 --> 01:04:17.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

01:04:38.388 --> 01:04:40.650
[SPEAKER_12]: People, I need a chat.

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:42.512
[SPEAKER_12]: Should I get Final Fantasy XI online?

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh God, you're going to open a whole can of worms with that one.

01:04:47.256 --> 01:04:47.636
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.897
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a two-week trial now.

01:04:48.997 --> 01:04:50.118
[SPEAKER_11]: My advice, try the trial.

01:04:51.139 --> 01:04:51.419
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:51.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

01:04:56.391 --> 01:04:56.951
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:05:16.398 --> 01:05:17.699
[SPEAKER_10]: It's absolutely coming out.

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:23.621
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't think they've announced it yet, but it's been leaked out on all these different retailer sites and stuff like that.

01:05:23.941 --> 01:05:32.124
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming up again on the show because I've saw it on about three different video game websites from three different sources saying, oh, Van Halen, Guitar Hero is still being speculated.

01:05:32.184 --> 01:05:34.004
[SPEAKER_11]: It is fucking happening already.

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:36.285
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people do you have to hear it from?

01:05:36.545 --> 01:05:37.606
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, end of August.

01:05:38.926 --> 01:05:39.647
[SPEAKER_10]: What more do you want?

01:05:39.847 --> 01:05:40.947
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, seriously.

01:05:40.967 --> 01:05:45.390
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to keep it in their pants until E3 because they want to probably parade Van Halen out on stage.

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:49.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they know that something big is going to happen with the Rock Band Beatles thing.

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:54.494
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're trying, I mean, Van Halen is no Beatles, no matter how much you want to argue.

01:05:55.615 --> 01:06:03.299
[SPEAKER_11]: But they'll do whatever they can to put a tent in the... Because you know that is going to be the huge thing from EA Harmonix is Rock Band Beatles.

01:06:03.579 --> 01:06:05.580
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, but I just, I don't...

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.292
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for them if they want to put out another game, but I just don't like their business model.

01:06:10.332 --> 01:06:22.138
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like how it's not downloadable content, or that you can't load it into your Rock Band 2 game, if it were Rock Band equivalent content, that you can't load it into a Guitar Hero game or anything like that.

01:06:22.238 --> 01:06:25.799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just all separate, and they do that because they want you to buy these games.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.320
[SPEAKER_10]: They want you to pay the $60 instead of...

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:29.662
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

01:06:45.945 --> 01:06:47.086
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I mean, seriously.

01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:48.386
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's saying it's coming out.

01:06:48.586 --> 01:06:49.227
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming out.

01:06:49.807 --> 01:06:50.887
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's rated, it's coming out.

01:06:50.968 --> 01:06:56.390
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just trying to... It's the world's worst secret right now because they're gonna... Just like Metallica.

01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:01.613
[SPEAKER_11]: I will bet you money they are parading Van Halen out on stage or what's left of him anyway at E3.

01:07:02.213 --> 01:07:02.713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure.

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:05.375
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be during their conference or something.

01:07:05.395 --> 01:07:05.735
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:06.375
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:07:06.715 --> 01:07:11.478
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, SingStar Queen is a game that I thought was supposed to come out some time ago.

01:07:11.518 --> 01:07:12.758
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to come out in March.

01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:16.840
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a friend who is very excited about SingStar Queen because she loves Freddie Mercury.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.641
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, how could you not?

01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:20.042
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what a fucking rock star.

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:25.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a great band that I also wouldn't mind seeing a Guitar Hero rock band game made out of.

01:07:25.245 --> 01:07:28.966
[SPEAKER_11]: However, they are making a SingStar game out of it, or I guess you could say it's already been made.

01:07:29.066 --> 01:07:30.827
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't this actually come out overseas already?

01:07:31.428 --> 01:07:31.868
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:37.631
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we are finally going to get it on August 18th is when the game will come out on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.

01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:45.435
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like SingStar ABBA, the PlayStation 3 version has five more songs than the PlayStation 2, so 20 and 25 songs each.

01:07:46.115 --> 01:07:53.599
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, just on a side note, SingStar also got a big update, or I think is getting one this coming week, where they're finally putting trophies in the game.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:08:00.303
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently, if you go in and read some of the trophy descriptions, they talk about unlocking trophies in PlayStation Home.

01:08:00.803 --> 01:08:03.444
[SPEAKER_11]: So you gotta wonder if that's right around the corner as well.

01:08:03.484 --> 01:08:05.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's going to be one of the things they parade out at E3.

01:08:06.744 --> 01:08:10.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's about time they parade something they've been showing off for years now.

01:08:10.225 --> 01:08:13.146
[SPEAKER_11]: I would bet anything that's going to be an E3 thing too, if not just before.

01:08:13.586 --> 01:08:15.507
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, SingStar's getting a big update.

01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:18.847
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the SingStore's going to get a little bit of a tune-up too.

01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:20.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I haven't been at home since...

01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:22.368
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.040
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:08.217
[SPEAKER_11]: There's lots of people just dancing away in the town square.

01:09:09.598 --> 01:09:09.938
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:12.619
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'm with you.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.281
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get the point, but whatever.

01:09:15.521 --> 01:09:16.242
[SPEAKER_10]: I do and I don't.

01:09:16.542 --> 01:09:17.502
[SPEAKER_11]: I get the point.

01:09:17.602 --> 01:09:21.625
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it's what we all were hoping it would be, which I don't know.

01:09:22.512 --> 01:09:25.574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not revolutionizing anything, I don't think, right now.

01:09:26.635 --> 01:09:34.100
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very curious to see, though, because I believe, wasn't Namco supposed to put some stuff into PlayStation Home, or at least that's happened overseas, but it hasn't happened here yet.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:36.302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they have their games that you can play and stuff.

01:09:36.382 --> 01:09:40.525
[SPEAKER_11]: I would kind of like to see what happens when that gets enabled, because now we're starting to talk about a point.

01:09:41.446 --> 01:09:41.946
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:09:42.427 --> 01:09:44.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Having some of these games that you actually get in Home.

01:09:45.949 --> 01:09:46.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Curious.

01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:47.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Curious.

01:09:48.175 --> 01:09:49.896
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:04.988 --> 01:10:07.669
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Paul McCartney's new performance that he did.

01:10:08.249 --> 01:10:19.051
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically when they're playing Got to Get You Into My Life, they had behind them some actual footage from Rock Band with the digital artists singing and stuff.

01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:20.292
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how they do at concerts.

01:10:20.312 --> 01:10:23.652
[SPEAKER_11]: They have images playing behind the band when they're singing or what have you.

01:10:23.672 --> 01:10:27.653
[SPEAKER_11]: So Paul McCartney at this – in Coachella, I don't know how many of you guys listening have ever been.

01:10:28.193 --> 01:10:29.174
[SPEAKER_11]: The last time I went was in 2002.

01:10:30.834 --> 01:10:32.075
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:56.624 --> 01:10:57.164
[SPEAKER_11]: I take that back.

01:10:57.204 --> 01:11:01.085
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they do a Lollapalooza in the Chicago area, but there's no big tours and things like that.

01:11:01.505 --> 01:11:03.726
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the big festivals people talk about in this day and age.

01:11:03.766 --> 01:11:05.126
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is no small concert.

01:11:05.966 --> 01:11:06.507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:11:08.047 --> 01:11:08.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

01:11:09.347 --> 01:11:11.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Although they have this thing at the middle of nowhere.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:12.468
[SPEAKER_11]: You know about Coachella?

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:15.349
[SPEAKER_11]: They do it at this big polo field that is literally in the middle of nowhere.

01:11:15.369 --> 01:11:16.649
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in Indio, California.

01:11:17.009 --> 01:11:19.190
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to drive like two hours outside of LA to get there.

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.070
[SPEAKER_11]: It is literally in the middle of frickin' nowhere.

01:11:22.031 --> 01:11:23.691
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess that's so people don't complain about the noise.

01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:26.351
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyhow.

01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:31.575
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, something about the Beatles game is it's going to have multiple microphones.

01:11:31.715 --> 01:11:33.176
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a rumor, yeah.

01:11:33.703 --> 01:11:34.323
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:12:01.325 --> 01:12:11.433
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, earlier we talked about SingStar, and, you know, SingStar, their biggest competitors are probably the Lips franchise, which, you know, has had mediocre success, and Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:19.279
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was announced at Konami Gamers Night this week that Blitz Games is developing a reboot, I guess you could say, of the Karaoke Revolution franchise.

01:12:19.619 --> 01:12:23.202
[SPEAKER_11]: We're calling it a reboot because they are calling it simply Karaoke Revolution.

01:12:23.222 --> 01:12:24.142
[SPEAKER_11]: At least right now, yeah.

01:12:24.202 --> 01:12:26.484
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game being developed for the PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii.

01:12:28.225 --> 01:12:30.347
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to have 50 recordings on the disc.

01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:33.668
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be able to have a pretty comprehensive character creator mode in it.

01:12:34.129 --> 01:12:38.831
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have customizable venues, apparently, and original music videos for all the songs.

01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:39.412
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of cool.

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:45.255
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they're going to have song and item download content in the game, very similar to Rock Band.

01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:47.456
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it is Karaoke Revolution.

01:12:47.516 --> 01:12:48.997
[SPEAKER_11]: It is singing only.

01:12:49.938 --> 01:12:56.662
[SPEAKER_11]: What's kind of interesting, though, is that I noticed right away, the first thing I noticed, I don't know if you noticed this, where did American Idol go?

01:12:57.262 --> 01:12:58.523
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:49.433
[SPEAKER_10]: and they had pretty good success with it so they came out with American Idol Karaoke Revolution but that's nowhere to be found now so does this indicate they lost the American Idol franchise they're not interested in it which I would have a hard time believing or what no I doubt that I think if anything what was kind of neat about it is that they also had it's all master tracks now too it's not covers that is one big difference I suppose um

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:51.367
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of cool.

01:13:51.828 --> 01:14:00.591
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can also create your own characters in this, you know, like customize actual characters and stuff like with sliders and all that fun stuff.

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:02.592
[SPEAKER_10]: So really detailed there.

01:14:03.312 --> 01:14:05.613
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they're kind of trying to reinvent themselves with that.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.352
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not like DDR or something?

01:14:08.372 --> 01:14:09.313
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.

01:14:09.814 --> 01:14:15.320
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, they're also saying this setlist will be very party-centric and it's going to have a drop-in and out duet mode.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.482
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't that sound exactly like what they did in Lips?

01:14:18.023 --> 01:14:26.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, though, there's going to be online play, it sounds like, which I can't think of a lot of other games outside of the Rock Band Guitar Hero games, the karaoke games that do this.

01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:27.514
[SPEAKER_11]: Does Lips do that?

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:27.994
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.337
[SPEAKER_11]: Lips is the one karaoke game I haven't played because I have SingStar.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:49.074
[SPEAKER_11]: SingStar's online is the SingSpace or whatever they call it, the community download people videos making asses themselves, dancing around in Star Trek outfits and stuff to the various songs, which is actually kind of funny, some of it.

01:14:51.347 --> 01:14:54.870
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt is hoping for a Karaoke Revolution Susan Boyle edition.

01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:56.552
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's all the rage this week.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.594
[SPEAKER_03]: I dreamed a dream.

01:15:02.317 --> 01:15:03.037
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

01:15:03.177 --> 01:15:05.279
[SPEAKER_10]: You can always recreate her character in...

01:15:06.738 --> 01:15:07.459
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com

01:15:29.427 --> 01:15:29.907
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:15:51.073 --> 01:15:53.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, she was in the newest one, though, I think.

01:15:53.214 --> 01:15:57.017
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now they could just have Kara, who's the actual... Just get rid of Paula off the show.

01:15:57.037 --> 01:15:57.577
[SPEAKER_10]: Just get rid of Paula.

01:15:57.597 --> 01:16:00.839
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everybody's saying just get Paula off the regular show anyway, because she talks too damn much.

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:01.859
[SPEAKER_11]: Just have Kara be the third.

01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:04.181
[SPEAKER_11]: She's also high on something.

01:16:04.221 --> 01:16:04.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Methamphetamines?

01:16:05.302 --> 01:16:07.643
[SPEAKER_10]: Methamphetamines.

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:08.043
[SPEAKER_10]: Say, hey!

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.745
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the colors that you were singing.

01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:11.945
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:16:11.965 --> 01:16:14.347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, stop talking.

01:16:14.367 --> 01:16:17.209
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, they're singing Ring of Fire.

01:16:17.389 --> 01:16:19.010
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt fire.

01:16:20.219 --> 01:16:20.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:40.369 --> 01:16:42.250
[SPEAKER_10]: We just read online who loses, you know.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.950
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, you already know who's going to win now anyways.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:48.191
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously, she is like smoking crack or something.

01:16:48.211 --> 01:16:54.332
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times now because for whatever reason their producer sucks so bad that they can't keep the show on time.

01:16:54.672 --> 01:16:58.673
[SPEAKER_10]: Even when they cut it down to only two judges talking, you know, per performance.

01:16:58.693 --> 01:17:04.134
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Paula wasting so much damn time talking about whatever she's talking about.

01:17:05.234 --> 01:17:07.715
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was like staring her down like, what the fuck did you just say?

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:19.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and yes, I'm on Justin.tv now playing a trailer for Final Fantasy Versus because apparently I got killed in XIII and so I don't feel like replaying half an hour of demo again.

01:17:19.654 --> 01:17:20.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

01:17:20.914 --> 01:17:21.775
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so check that out.

01:17:22.175 --> 01:17:24.115
[SPEAKER_11]: What, are you going to switch to Fat Princess a little later here?

01:17:24.155 --> 01:17:24.775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, probably.

01:17:24.795 --> 01:17:32.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hey, you got another story you got to cover and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week, which you don't even know what I'm doing tonight unless you took a peek, but I think you'll like the game I picked tonight.

01:17:32.677 --> 01:17:33.657
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

01:17:34.457 --> 01:17:35.978
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so we've got a...

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:38.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Video Game Live at E3

01:18:08.219 --> 01:18:08.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

01:18:09.582 --> 01:18:13.229
[SPEAKER_11]: Hitstun in chat says, wait, it's a $70 fucking demo and you can't even save?

01:18:14.892 --> 01:18:15.033
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:16.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Bummer.

01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:23.121
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want to go to Video Games Live at E3 just because I know they're going to really pull off the stops for that one, but I don't know.

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:24.722
[SPEAKER_11]: It just may not work out.

01:18:25.623 --> 01:18:29.067
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a very strong possibility I'm actually going to Vegas that same weekend.

01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:30.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

01:18:30.609 --> 01:18:31.390
[SPEAKER_10]: That was interesting.

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:36.855
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed at the end of the Final Fantasy Versus 13 trailer it said PlayStation 3 only worldwide.

01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:38.757
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize it was coming out in the U.S.

01:18:40.037 --> 01:18:41.738
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, of course Versus is coming out in the US.

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:42.959
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was Japanese only.

01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:47.582
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's been coming out in the US, but it still is reiterating that it's not coming out on the 360.

01:18:47.742 --> 01:18:48.862
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, whatever.

01:18:48.922 --> 01:18:49.463
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:50.003
[SPEAKER_10]: Big deal.

01:18:50.563 --> 01:18:57.007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to break my heart if I have to buy one of them on the 360 or one of them on the PS3 or both on the PS3.

01:18:57.588 --> 01:18:59.349
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't care at this point.

01:19:00.749 --> 01:19:01.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.722
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:19:30.279 --> 01:19:31.020
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:19:48.015 --> 01:19:48.295
[SPEAKER_10]: Spy vs. Spy

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.711
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:20:27.372 --> 01:20:28.053
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

01:20:47.154 --> 01:20:48.315
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:11.072
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:21:28.965 --> 01:21:31.287
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:21:53.644 --> 01:21:54.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:12.386
[SPEAKER_11]: is what it is.

01:22:12.426 --> 01:22:15.169
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's a giant game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that's going on.

01:22:15.609 --> 01:22:26.757
[SPEAKER_11]: What's kind of cool about this game, though, what I always liked about it is that, you know, because it is split-screen multiplayer on the same screen, part of winning the game was memorizing what your opponent was doing on the lower screen.

01:22:27.058 --> 01:22:29.219
[SPEAKER_11]: And the bigger the compound, the harder it is to do that.

01:22:29.259 --> 01:22:34.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, you're talking about an old computer system where a lot of the rooms looked the same.

01:22:34.663 --> 01:22:36.525
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just the colors would be different and so on.

01:22:36.845 --> 01:22:38.366
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's the guy taking off in the plane.

01:22:38.426 --> 01:22:39.107
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually won.

01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:40.208
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:54.962
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me show you, uh, or not show you because it's radio, but let me play for you a little clip of the NES version of the game that came out a little later, and you can hear, like, the souped-up music that was in this version of the game, which, by the way, they say is coming to, uh, the Europe Virtual Console very soon, if it hasn't already.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.164
[SPEAKER_11]: But also very similar, you know, was a Nintendo game that had the same screen multiplayer.

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:04.386
[SPEAKER_11]: I was always thinking this would be a fun game for them to put out on Xbox Live.

01:23:04.606 --> 01:23:05.226
[SPEAKER_11]: Or the DS.

01:23:05.667 --> 01:23:07.628
[SPEAKER_11]: With like four players.

01:23:07.988 --> 01:23:10.911
[SPEAKER_11]: But not have everybody have their own screen.

01:23:10.951 --> 01:23:12.992
[SPEAKER_11]: You could still see what everybody is doing on the same screen.

01:23:13.012 --> 01:23:14.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's how you win the game.

01:23:14.453 --> 01:23:17.395
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to memorize what other people are doing and where they've set the traps.

01:23:17.876 --> 01:23:18.556
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of interesting.

01:23:18.856 --> 01:23:22.139
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, there was a Spy vs. Spy game that came out later on the Xbox.

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:23.960
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was like a 3D re-imaging.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.161
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not the game I'm talking about.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.262
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the old school Commodore 64 game.

01:23:49.372 --> 01:23:49.952
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:09.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty cool stuff.

01:24:09.665 --> 01:24:10.645
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the second game that came out.

01:24:10.666 --> 01:24:14.688
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was a third game that came out, and I didn't even own this game, but I did play it once.

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:16.309
[SPEAKER_11]: It was called Arctic Antics.

01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:19.932
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically the antithesis of being on the island would be being on the North Pole.

01:24:20.312 --> 01:24:24.455
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was the same type of thing except you had a body heat meter and you could regenerate it by being in igloos.

01:24:24.896 --> 01:24:25.216
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:24:25.676 --> 01:24:30.940
[SPEAKER_11]: But kind of interesting that the series went on for quite a while on the computer and then got rebooted a few years later.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:50.091
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember playing this with friends when I was like 8 or 9 years old and having fun with this because this is a great trash talking game when you're in the same room and just the sound you make when two people kind of discover each other in the same room versus like you just start hammering on the joystick trying to kill the other spy good times

01:24:51.232 --> 01:25:01.558
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the Classic Video Game of the Week, Spy vs. Spy on the Commodore 64 is where I remember it most fondly, but a lot of you probably are more familiar with it on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:25:02.079 --> 01:25:03.720
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you have it, Classic Video Game of the Week.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.501
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised you never played that, Loki.

01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:08.903
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought for some reason you had said in an earlier show you'd actually played it once.

01:25:09.123 --> 01:25:12.886
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was part of the reason I picked it, because it definitely seemed like a you type of game.

01:25:14.126 --> 01:25:14.906
[SPEAKER_11]: If that makes sense.

01:25:15.567 --> 01:25:17.267
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it makes sense.

01:25:17.567 --> 01:25:19.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:19.287 --> 01:25:21.488
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to come back and we have plenty more of the show to get into.

01:25:22.068 --> 01:25:28.490
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox 360, we haven't even talked really about the 360, but we have news about the warranties for the E74 errors.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:32.871
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about Bionic Commando and Sega games coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:25:33.171 --> 01:25:34.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you really need them?

01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:34.772
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:35.892
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about that when we come back.

01:25:35.932 --> 01:25:39.893
[SPEAKER_11]: All that and more, including your chat and your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.080
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:30.936
[SPEAKER_11]: and I did see on her Facebook she updated a picture from Space Mountain and they're all screaming and throwing up metal signs and all that kind of stuff so it looks like they're having a fun time but not here tonight but Loki and I are holding down the fort and boy DarkSakura picked a hell of a night to miss I mean it is her birthday so I understand but we got Final Fantasy XIII demo here in house which we're checking out here and I'll tell you what it's much different to be looking at it than watching it on YouTube

01:26:31.536 --> 01:26:32.577
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:26:51.571 --> 01:26:52.512
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

01:27:11.129 --> 01:27:11.789
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIII

01:27:41.329 --> 01:27:46.833
[SPEAKER_10]: The E74 errors in their three-year Xbox 360 warranty.

01:27:46.853 --> 01:27:57.021
[SPEAKER_10]: You may remember that before they announced that they were going to increase the warranty to three years for the Red Light of Death, I guess, or RODs.

01:27:57.881 --> 01:27:58.041
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.739
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are basically general hardware failures.

01:28:02.859 --> 01:28:05.061
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, people are like, well, what's an E74 error?

01:28:05.222 --> 01:28:07.423
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, that's a general hardware failure.

01:28:07.443 --> 01:28:13.629
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, well, is that the same thing as, say, the red lights of death or whatever?

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:16.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, but yes.

01:28:16.952 --> 01:28:23.898
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, basically, yes, it's basically the same thing as the three rings of death.

01:28:24.078 --> 01:28:26.240
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go to the phones real quick because we do have a call coming in.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:27.521
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

01:28:28.488 --> 01:28:29.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Gold Anthro.

01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Gold Anthro.

01:28:30.769 --> 01:28:31.169
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

01:28:31.469 --> 01:28:31.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:34.250
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about Xbox 360 and the E74 era.

01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:35.650
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been a victim of this?

01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:37.051
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:28:37.731 --> 01:28:40.272
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest with you, I wish I just had an Xbox 360.

01:28:40.552 --> 01:28:42.272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next console I want to get.

01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:44.813
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be honest with you, I'm 17.

01:28:44.913 --> 01:28:46.534
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't even have a part-time job.

01:28:46.594 --> 01:28:49.194
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be my first target is to get a 360.

01:28:49.394 --> 01:28:50.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's good to have goals.

01:28:50.675 --> 01:28:52.495
[SPEAKER_11]: So to what do we attribute this call then tonight?

01:28:54.256 --> 01:28:56.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what I want to talk about?

01:28:56.697 --> 01:28:56.857
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:28:56.877 --> 01:28:57.577
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you calling in about?

01:28:58.121 --> 01:28:58.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:00.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about that.

01:29:02.942 --> 01:29:06.523
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to bring it up, but Loki chose to bring it up again.

01:29:07.263 --> 01:29:20.707
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bob's Game thing, and I'm sorry, I'm not trying to open up a fight, but if I'm correct to bring up a point, Rob, you guys are trashing on it, but you said you don't like to judge things based on demos.

01:29:23.027 --> 01:29:23.587
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes and no.

01:29:24.628 --> 01:29:25.168
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

01:29:25.788 --> 01:29:28.710
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trashing the game, because I haven't played the game.

01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:31.231
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's, I guess, somehow played or whatever.

01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:33.132
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not played the game, so I'm not trashing the game.

01:29:33.412 --> 01:29:35.533
[SPEAKER_11]: But the designer is a butt nugget.

01:29:35.693 --> 01:29:37.514
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't like reading about him.

01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:41.635
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like hearing about all his antics going on on the blogs going on right now.

01:29:41.996 --> 01:29:44.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's kind of an attention whore, and he's doing a decent job at it.

01:29:44.897 --> 01:29:45.697
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, props to him.

01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:47.458
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want to buy into it.

01:29:47.518 --> 01:29:51.080
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I do have a little Steam cloud that's being brought up right now, but whatever.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:51.240
[SPEAKER_11]: It's...

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.383
[SPEAKER_11]: Every gamer gets a voice, so if you want to bring it up, then fine.

01:29:54.403 --> 01:29:56.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I wasn't trying to start a new drama.

01:29:57.186 --> 01:30:00.069
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just saying, and I don't really want to talk about him on the show.

01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:02.491
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I even mentioned I played the demo again.

01:30:03.672 --> 01:30:10.079
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I mean, yeah, you shouldn't judge a game based on the demo, but the demo gives you a good idea of how the game is going to be, and

01:30:11.294 --> 01:30:15.375
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's how you base, you know, when you play a demo for a game, that's basically what it is.

01:30:15.455 --> 01:30:20.137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to get an idea of what the full game's going to be so you can make a decision whether you want to purchase it or not.

01:30:20.877 --> 01:30:36.541
[SPEAKER_10]: And based on what I've seen so far, it looks very amateurish, it's not very good gameplay, and there are some really annoying parts that just would drive me crazy and I'm not planning on picking it up ever, if it even ever comes out.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.162
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could definitely see why Nintendo wouldn't want to

01:30:40.356 --> 01:30:41.057
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:31:01.492 --> 01:31:02.953
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mark of the Exiled or something like that.

01:31:04.394 --> 01:31:12.319
[SPEAKER_10]: It used to be a homebrew game and the developers worked on it and they made an actual full-fledged DS game.

01:31:12.519 --> 01:31:13.260
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks okay.

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.001
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like a pretty good RPG.

01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:16.482
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's the way you do it.

01:31:16.562 --> 01:31:18.683
[SPEAKER_10]: You go through one of these smaller companies to publish your game.

01:31:18.983 --> 01:31:22.986
[SPEAKER_10]: Until your game is hot shit, if it comes out and it's really awesome, then cool.

01:31:23.266 --> 01:31:25.668
[SPEAKER_10]: But honestly, based on what I see, if this game...

01:31:26.568 --> 01:31:37.091
[SPEAKER_10]: If this is a half an hour worth of his game, say, and his full game is hundreds of hours long or something like that, I cannot see myself playing this game for another 30 minutes, let alone hundreds of hours.

01:31:37.271 --> 01:31:40.232
[SPEAKER_11]: Goldanthro, let's let you make a counterpoint, because obviously you feel differently.

01:31:40.312 --> 01:31:40.892
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want to say?

01:31:41.633 --> 01:31:48.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, I'm going to throw the echo in and stuff.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this is getting really distracting.

01:31:53.503 --> 01:31:54.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear myself right now.

01:31:55.005 --> 01:31:57.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure your speakers are turned down there in-house or whatever.

01:31:58.008 --> 01:31:59.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we have those issues on Skype.

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.851
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a headset.

01:32:01.071 --> 01:32:02.713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to keep talking like nothing happened.

01:32:03.093 --> 01:32:04.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I don't know.

01:32:04.374 --> 01:32:07.958
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wait until a full review comes out for the game first.

01:32:08.699 --> 01:32:13.063
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people say it sucks then, then I'm going to probably leave them alone.

01:32:14.655 --> 01:32:15.235
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my opinion.

01:32:15.416 --> 01:32:16.536
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

01:32:16.616 --> 01:32:17.036
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

01:32:17.336 --> 01:32:19.237
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's my question to you.

01:32:19.377 --> 01:32:26.839
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about all the antics such as the leafing of the Nintendo store and the locking himself in the room?

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.941
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was a little overboard.

01:32:33.201 --> 01:32:38.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it really was an act, it got all these people to create drama on the internet and

01:32:39.269 --> 01:32:50.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I should really care what people on the internet think, but yeah, it is kind of... I can see what he was trying to do, he was trying to be original, but the echoing went away, which is good.

01:32:51.015 --> 01:32:59.160
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he's trying to... I see how he was trying to be original, but I think he also got a lot of people falsely worried over something that really didn't even happen.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.880
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I can see where that came from.

01:33:01.221 --> 01:33:02.621
[SPEAKER_04]: The game for itself, though, I...

01:33:04.611 --> 01:33:07.073
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is my kind of game.

01:33:07.093 --> 01:33:13.537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just interested alone in the fact that it was made by one person and it took that long and that much effort.

01:33:14.097 --> 01:33:16.278
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am going to probably give it a try.

01:33:17.779 --> 01:33:18.880
[SPEAKER_10]: It was made by one person.

01:33:19.921 --> 01:33:20.921
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to say that again, Loki.

01:33:20.941 --> 01:33:22.182
[SPEAKER_10]: I had us muted.

01:33:22.882 --> 01:33:23.783
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me put it this way.

01:33:23.963 --> 01:33:25.844
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it was made by one person.

01:33:25.984 --> 01:33:26.685
[SPEAKER_10]: It shows.

01:33:27.205 --> 01:33:28.446
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is not a compliment.

01:33:29.946 --> 01:33:32.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Anthro, we gotta let you go, but you know what?

01:33:32.428 --> 01:33:36.511
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, that's fine, and this will be the last, hopefully, that we get to talk about.

01:33:36.531 --> 01:33:37.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to put my opinion in.

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:42.456
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about that the whole time that you guys have been talking about this, ever since you first started.

01:33:42.596 --> 01:33:44.057
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, you know what?

01:33:44.217 --> 01:33:47.840
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't mind being called out, so thank you for the call, and have a good one.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:48.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, bye.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:49.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, later.

01:33:50.219 --> 01:33:51.319
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:14.425 --> 01:34:21.349
[SPEAKER_10]: Recently, I guess, they're going to refund your money by July 1st, 2009.

01:34:22.609 --> 01:34:31.694
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can claim, I guess you'll need to claim your repair or something on xbox.com support before November 1st.

01:34:33.728 --> 01:35:02.271
[SPEAKER_11]: so you have some time to go and if you were one of those people that got screwed didn't we have a caller that was in that predicament I want to say we got a call about this somebody got an E74 error and had to send it back and they were pissed because it was going to cost $100 so God I hope you're still listening to the show go back and get your money back alright we're going to take another call before we get into the next story hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this Brest Law Brest Law I am so glad you called in because I did not get a chance to talk about the contest did you hear about the train wreck that was our show last week

01:35:04.316 --> 01:35:07.257
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually went over it on Under Sedation Live last night.

01:35:07.377 --> 01:35:07.918
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh God.

01:35:08.538 --> 01:35:09.318
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only imagine.

01:35:10.078 --> 01:35:12.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't tell me Travis has a recording.

01:35:12.579 --> 01:35:13.920
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't tell me Travis has a recording.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's Travis.

01:35:16.281 --> 01:35:16.841
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect?

01:35:17.021 --> 01:35:17.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh God.

01:35:17.461 --> 01:35:19.982
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so quickly, what happened on Under Sedation Live?

01:35:20.956 --> 01:35:24.218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we just went over it because I hadn't heard it, and I just heard you go off.

01:35:24.238 --> 01:35:26.820
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, wow, I have never heard Rob go off like that.

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:27.960
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a little surprising.

01:35:28.841 --> 01:35:34.925
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw the context of the conversation that sparked it, and I'm like, eh, I might have done the same thing in this situation.

01:35:35.845 --> 01:35:38.987
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to say, though, I did listen to the playback because there is an archive of it somewhere.

01:35:39.007 --> 01:35:40.068
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to advertise where.

01:35:40.448 --> 01:35:45.552
[SPEAKER_11]: But I laughed my ass off, literally laughed my ass off at how Loki just...

01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:47.893
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob didn't have his Perrier watered.

01:35:47.933 --> 01:35:50.535
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, for those of you who don't know, I was there a couple years ago.

01:35:50.575 --> 01:35:54.218
[SPEAKER_11]: He needs his Perrier watered or he gets grumpy.

01:35:54.278 --> 01:35:54.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

01:35:54.698 --> 01:35:56.639
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what did you call in to talk about tonight?

01:35:56.659 --> 01:35:57.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get out of the way first.

01:36:09.949 --> 01:36:10.329
[SPEAKER_06]: SmileDK

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:41.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Veronica and Hannah

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:07.058
[SPEAKER_06]: both signed the copy of DDR Supernova in the colors scheme of the game.

01:37:07.098 --> 01:37:09.260
[SPEAKER_06]: So one signature's in black, one's in red.

01:37:09.901 --> 01:37:10.461
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have it.

01:37:11.522 --> 01:37:13.283
[SPEAKER_06]: And... I don't want it.

01:37:14.685 --> 01:37:15.185
[SPEAKER_10]: How rude.

01:37:16.286 --> 01:37:16.626
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:37:17.547 --> 01:37:23.071
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Well, and also, what was really cool about it is not a lot of people know this unless you listen to it.

01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:25.153
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been on a cane for about five, six months.

01:37:26.254 --> 01:37:29.116
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... SmellDK actually signed my cane.

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:30.357
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:32.119
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know you were on a cane.

01:37:32.139 --> 01:37:32.279
[SPEAKER_06]: There...

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.222
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:38:02.005 --> 01:38:14.040
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really awesome, and I do have to say that I've been with Flacon for five years, and this is the first time I actually gave a crap about a guest being there, and the girls are so nice.

01:38:14.841 --> 01:38:16.403
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me give you a little sample.

01:38:16.503 --> 01:38:18.466
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have no idea who SmileDK is, here you go.

01:38:31.226 --> 01:38:32.307
[SPEAKER_11]: So happy you'll barf.

01:38:34.169 --> 01:38:34.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:38:36.551 --> 01:38:40.894
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, anybody who's played even a lick of DDR has heard of SmileDK.

01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:46.980
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to be coming up with a contest here in the coming weeks to give this away to one lucky listener.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd hoped to do it tonight, but with everything else that had been going on with last week, we didn't get to it.

01:38:51.083 --> 01:38:53.065
[SPEAKER_11]: But definitely probably next week or the week after.

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:56.088
[SPEAKER_11]: But it'll definitely be something not just for live, but for podcast listeners.

01:38:57.236 --> 01:38:59.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it will be awesome.

01:38:59.257 --> 01:39:02.339
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say definitely keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:39:02.619 --> 01:39:03.680
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be thinking of something.

01:39:06.162 --> 01:39:12.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in my incredibly late-to-the-boat review, I finally got to play Fallout 3.

01:39:13.446 --> 01:39:13.606
[SPEAKER_06]: And?

01:39:14.527 --> 01:39:17.249
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say it is one of the ten greatest games I've ever played.

01:39:17.809 --> 01:39:19.070
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty shining review.

01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:20.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you like it so damn much?

01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:24.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's basically Oblivion.

01:39:24.213 --> 01:39:25.634
[SPEAKER_06]: For one, it's Oblivion without the suck.

01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:27.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute!

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:28.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a damn minute!

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:31.123
[SPEAKER_11]: Oblivion does not suck, sir.

01:39:31.143 --> 01:39:32.004
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Rob.

01:39:32.604 --> 01:39:36.167
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to compare it to Morrowind, it's a horrible game.

01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:37.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:39:37.708 --> 01:39:38.348
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

01:39:38.608 --> 01:39:38.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:39:39.489 --> 01:39:52.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, and the Elder Scrolls series has progressively gotten better, and then Oblivion just kind of took the series in a nosedive, but it was just, the combat system was fun, you know, a little, if you're listening to the radio stations and you're

01:39:56.516 --> 01:39:59.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been on an unemployment spat, and that's over with, but...

01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:28.014
[SPEAKER_06]: I've, basically my weeks have been consisted of playing WoW or some video game and I played Fallout 3 for a week straight and then beat it.

01:40:29.294 --> 01:40:32.476
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's seriously that good.

01:40:34.557 --> 01:40:38.759
[SPEAKER_11]: I have yet to play the game, I feel so out of touch, but one of these days I'll sit down with it.

01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:50.601
[SPEAKER_11]: DMN, bring us back on track here a little bit if you can, because we've got to get back into Xbox 360 news and back into the show, but we've been talking about how the warranties were just recently extended for the E74 errors for Xbox 360.

01:40:50.701 --> 01:40:54.765
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there's any comments you have on that whole thing.

01:40:56.427 --> 01:40:58.570
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually cannot comment on it.

01:40:59.130 --> 01:40:59.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:40:59.931 --> 01:41:00.872
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot where you're at now.

01:41:01.073 --> 01:41:01.413
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:41:02.182 --> 01:41:02.642
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

01:41:02.882 --> 01:41:03.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Rob.

01:41:03.483 --> 01:41:04.563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm such a killjoy.

01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:07.065
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about Final Fantasy XIII?

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:12.187
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say anything about Final Fantasy XIII and the hype surrounding it, since that's something we're demoing on JustinTV tonight?

01:41:13.788 --> 01:41:23.913
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say from the footage I've seen, this game better live up to the hype, or I'm not touching a Final Fantasy game from XIII on.

01:41:25.534 --> 01:41:26.815
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it might be pretty hot.

01:41:27.735 --> 01:41:28.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Because XII...

01:41:29.369 --> 01:41:32.770
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 was a step up because I think the series has progressively gone down since 8.

01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:33.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated 9.

01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:34.690
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated 10.

01:41:35.071 --> 01:41:36.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me started about 10 too.

01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:38.972
[SPEAKER_06]: If I say anything bad about 11, you're going to hang up on me.

01:41:41.492 --> 01:41:43.073
[SPEAKER_06]: And 12 was a step in the right direction.

01:41:43.113 --> 01:41:43.753
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good game.

01:41:43.793 --> 01:41:48.094
[SPEAKER_06]: It brought it back to the fantasy roots and the game kept being fun.

01:41:49.455 --> 01:41:54.496
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have high hopes for 13, but if 13 is a disappointment, I'm done with Final Fantasy.

01:41:55.427 --> 01:41:56.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

01:41:56.688 --> 01:42:01.812
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, DMN, we're going to let you go so we can get back into the show and have a good one and we'll definitely be hearing from you in the coming weeks.

01:42:01.952 --> 01:42:04.374
[SPEAKER_11]: And your own show, give it a plug real quick before we hang up on you.

01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:09.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Undersedation Live every Saturday here on All Games at 8 Pacific, 11 Eastern.

01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:16.144
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like vulgarity and geekery and whatnot and laughs, be sure to tune in.

01:42:16.444 --> 01:42:18.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Dick, fart jokes, sci-fi talk, and boobs.

01:42:18.806 --> 01:42:19.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much, right?

01:42:20.447 --> 01:42:20.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:21.648
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, sounds great.

01:42:21.888 --> 01:42:22.529
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one, DMN.

01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:24.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, later, buddy.

01:42:24.391 --> 01:42:24.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

01:42:25.285 --> 01:42:26.166
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:42:49.342 --> 01:42:51.824
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually for Xbox Live Arcade, they're thinking.

01:42:51.884 --> 01:42:56.809
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say, didn't we have a story on this a while ago where we heard that this was coming out for Arcade?

01:42:57.249 --> 01:42:57.609
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought.

01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:58.470
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember that.

01:42:58.710 --> 01:43:00.612
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I remember this a while ago.

01:43:00.732 --> 01:43:02.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, WiiWare, I think.

01:43:02.373 --> 01:43:05.396
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is probably just a port of it for Xbox 360.

01:43:05.916 --> 01:43:09.039
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's probably a PlayStation 3 one around the corner as well.

01:43:09.059 --> 01:43:09.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

01:43:09.259 --> 01:43:09.619
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes sense.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:10.420
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it is.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:11.021
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:43:11.541 --> 01:43:16.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com says, Bubble Bobble Neo, you are the one.

01:43:16.909 --> 01:43:17.129
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it?

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:18.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Old school joke.

01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:23.294
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, I saw Matrix Reloaded for $6 on DVD at Suncoast the other day.

01:43:23.854 --> 01:43:24.615
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:43:25.055 --> 01:43:26.977
[SPEAKER_11]: All those older catalog titles are cheap.

01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:28.918
[SPEAKER_11]: And one more comment from DarkTetsuya.

01:43:29.099 --> 01:43:30.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, but can you get past level 30?

01:43:31.861 --> 01:43:32.942
[SPEAKER_11]: They will never live that down.

01:43:32.982 --> 01:43:33.862
[SPEAKER_11]: And rightfully so.

01:43:34.002 --> 01:43:34.443
[SPEAKER_11]: Christ.

01:43:34.983 --> 01:43:35.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:43:35.764 --> 01:43:35.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

01:43:37.885 --> 01:43:49.170
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan Blow, the creator of the hit puzzle game Braid, has revealed that there's a hidden level editor within the PC version.

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.452
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, he's been kind of teasing it.

01:43:52.492 --> 01:44:00.195
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, when more people have played slash finished the game, there will be an update to unlock it.

01:44:02.009 --> 01:44:12.097
[SPEAKER_10]: It says basically the level editor will allow players to extend the life of the puzzle title with the potential to add up to another full game worth of puzzles.

01:44:12.938 --> 01:44:13.238
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

01:44:13.338 --> 01:44:21.885
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can also implement new things into it including importing your own images from Photoshop and stuff like that.

01:44:21.985 --> 01:44:24.127
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to be pretty neat.

01:44:24.687 --> 01:44:27.810
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder, is this something that you'll be able to share levels with other people maybe?

01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:28.771
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you probably could.

01:44:28.891 --> 01:44:31.473
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer that the Xbox 360 crowd missed out on that.

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.007
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX 360 Bionic Commando XBOX 360 Bionic Commando

01:44:48.755 --> 01:44:49.876
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:45:15.689 --> 01:45:15.990
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:17.313
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely want to give it a shot.

01:45:17.333 --> 01:45:18.876
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's the whole reason behind a demo, right?

01:45:19.377 --> 01:45:20.179
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.083
[SPEAKER_11]: Check that out when it comes out a little later this month.

01:45:22.484 --> 01:45:23.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very interested in the demo.

01:45:24.408 --> 01:45:25.912
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game looks awesome.

01:45:26.866 --> 01:45:27.907
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely want to give it a try.

01:45:48.945 --> 01:45:49.526
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:46:01.539 --> 01:46:01.879
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:46:01.979 --> 01:46:04.740
[SPEAKER_10]: It usually is a good indicator of how the game's going to be.

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.501
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to read some comments from chat before we get into the next story, Loki.

01:46:07.721 --> 01:46:08.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Some comments from chat.

01:46:08.522 --> 01:46:15.244
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt says, on the braid story in the level editor, the real question is, why haven't hackers found the code for this feature already?

01:46:15.905 --> 01:46:19.686
[SPEAKER_11]: And DeathWishing says, Photoshop levels, oh god, Penisland Platformer.

01:46:20.106 --> 01:46:22.087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, you're going to see plenty of those levels on YouTube.

01:46:22.747 --> 01:46:24.148
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why people haven't found it yet.

01:46:24.688 --> 01:46:25.629
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they weren't looking for it.

01:46:25.949 --> 01:46:28.130
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe part of it's missing, and that's what's in the patch.

01:46:28.690 --> 01:46:28.890
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

01:46:30.069 --> 01:46:35.010
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's a whole Resident Evil multiplayer type situation.

01:46:37.171 --> 01:46:47.093
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting enough, we've been hearing constant rumors of some old school arcade games from Sega coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:47.453 --> 01:46:53.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now there's a little bit more confirmation about it, including achievements that have basically been...

01:46:55.759 --> 01:47:00.580
[SPEAKER_10]: MyGamerCard has a deck of achievements for Altered Beast, Comic Zone, and Shinobi.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:10.504
[SPEAKER_10]: All three of those titles belong to the classic arcade collection that will be available online.

01:47:12.384 --> 01:47:17.666
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting though is they didn't mention anything about Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.

01:47:18.847 --> 01:47:20.707
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least these three probably soon enough.

01:47:24.358 --> 01:47:27.040
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, why would I care, though, if I already have that other collection?

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.180
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:30.381
[SPEAKER_11]: This seems kind of useless.

01:47:30.441 --> 01:47:41.087
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, don't get me wrong, these games are pretty rad, but... Well, it's the same reason why they released, you know, Pac-Man on Xbox Live Arcade when, you know, it's available in, you know, the Namco collection as well.

01:47:41.227 --> 01:47:47.031
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's just another way for people to... But, I mean, Pac-Man is like $10 and that collection is like, you know, $30 or $40.

01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:50.493
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking about this collection is $30 and you get what?

01:47:50.553 --> 01:47:50.993
[SPEAKER_11]: Like 25, 30 games?

01:47:51.033 --> 01:47:50.993
$40. $40.

01:47:53.454 --> 01:47:54.355
[SPEAKER_11]: 40 games or some shit.

01:47:54.795 --> 01:47:59.157
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I think it's like $40 for 40 games, whatever, versus paying like $5 for one individual game.

01:47:59.177 --> 01:48:00.198
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a huge difference.

01:48:00.538 --> 01:48:01.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Huge difference.

01:48:01.739 --> 01:48:02.239
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:48:02.459 --> 01:48:03.120
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.121
[SPEAKER_11]: This just doesn't make sense.

01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:07.842
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for definitely the impulse buyer or something, right?

01:48:08.523 --> 01:48:08.783
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

01:48:09.003 --> 01:48:09.643
[SPEAKER_11]: Achievement horse?

01:48:09.823 --> 01:48:10.364
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:48:10.404 --> 01:48:12.145
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess achievement horse.

01:48:12.365 --> 01:48:16.227
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless they are going back and altering the actual code of the games, but I highly doubt that.

01:48:16.967 --> 01:48:18.028
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I doubt it.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:26.276
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Xbox got a little stricter on what they were going to let get on the service, and they weren't just going to let all these old ports get on there, but it seems like that's what's happening.

01:48:29.265 --> 01:48:31.248
[SPEAKER_11]: They go where the money is, I guess.

01:48:31.768 --> 01:48:32.269
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

01:48:32.369 --> 01:48:35.252
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess if they can even make $20 off it, it's worth it, I guess.

01:48:36.093 --> 01:48:36.333
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:48:36.353 --> 01:48:40.918
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyhow, we're going to get into the part of the show where you get to interact with us through the email.

01:48:41.358 --> 01:48:44.221
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a good way for the podcasters to get involved when they can't listen live.

01:48:44.622 --> 01:48:45.943
[SPEAKER_11]: MailbagOrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:48:45.963 --> 01:48:48.366
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's open up Ye Olde Mailbag and see what's in there.

01:48:51.994 --> 01:48:52.975
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:49:16.852 --> 01:49:17.273
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com

01:49:33.152 --> 01:49:35.073
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no way to have a region-free 360.

01:49:35.393 --> 01:49:43.959
[SPEAKER_10]: You can either buy region-free games, or you can get a mod chip and change your region of your 360 to be an Asian region 360.

01:49:43.999 --> 01:49:44.599
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

01:49:49.299 --> 01:49:51.060
[SPEAKER_11]: Next question comes from Sterlok.

01:50:11.347 --> 01:50:13.068
[SPEAKER_11]: Where can I find Brilliant to Rave?

01:50:13.388 --> 01:50:15.509
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been looking for a while and can't seem to find it anywhere.

01:50:15.929 --> 01:50:29.195
[SPEAKER_11]: What he's mentioning, you guys, is a song that was played in the live-only segment of our show, because obviously we can't play licensed music on the podcast, but there was a remix of an old song from DDR called Brilliant to You, but the song was Brilliant to Rave.

01:50:29.575 --> 01:50:31.416
[SPEAKER_10]: It's from the new Diverse System, though.

01:50:31.956 --> 01:50:32.616
[SPEAKER_11]: Diverse Systems.

01:50:32.636 --> 01:50:34.377
[SPEAKER_11]: Where can they order that if they want to get that?

01:50:34.437 --> 01:50:34.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Diverse.jp

01:50:37.708 --> 01:50:43.350
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email comes from Robert M. The first question was for Jamie about Samurai Showdown Anthologies.

01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.990
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't answer that.

01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:44.751
[SPEAKER_11]: Sadly, she's not here.

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:50.673
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly, is the Sanrio character officially named Hello Kitty, or is she just named Kitty and her franchise is Hello Kitty?

01:50:50.713 --> 01:50:51.193
[SPEAKER_11]: Just curious.

01:50:51.733 --> 01:50:54.854
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the franchise is Hello Kitty, but I don't know.

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:56.575
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she's called Hello Kitty.

01:50:57.155 --> 01:51:03.478
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as much as I claim to be the whore of Sanrio, I actually don't know.

01:51:03.538 --> 01:51:06.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe one of our chatters knows, but I'm pretty sure it's still Hello Kitty.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.863
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, he continues on with some follow-up emails.

01:51:11.224 --> 01:51:14.547
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to hear about Rob's video card and hopefully the idiot who made that comment is banned.

01:51:14.587 --> 01:51:20.734
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't seem to get in chat myself lately, which may be related to a Java error on my end since I can't seem to get into the chat room for Bobby's shows either.

01:51:21.275 --> 01:51:25.339
[SPEAKER_11]: If I want to make a donation to help out and don't really want to use PayPal for whatever reason, where can I send a check?

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm really looking forward to hearing next week's show.

01:51:28.122 --> 01:51:56.398
[SPEAKER_11]: it sounds like the other listeners took care of that and that's a very generous thing to offer hang on to it I'm hoping in the coming weeks we can have other ways that you guys can throw money at us if you really really want to that we'll put to good use I know we've been talking shirts for like three years I really want to make that happen in the near future it's just time and everything else going on hopefully soon so we'll let you know also there was one other follow up email that came in

01:51:59.391 --> 01:52:04.194
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize if I was out of line stating that the chatter who asked why Rob bothered trying to run out of the show again should be banned.

01:52:04.714 --> 01:52:08.036
[SPEAKER_11]: As I said, I wasn't in chat, so I have no context of the comment, just Rob's reaction.

01:52:08.076 --> 01:52:14.439
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely understand that in a stressful situation, especially as one as serious as computer failure, such criticism is most unwelcome and hurtful.

01:52:14.779 --> 01:52:17.980
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no intention of defending his comments, but I can't say I have the right to condemn them either.

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.782
[SPEAKER_11]: That said, I still hope the situation with your hardware improves.

01:52:20.882 --> 01:52:24.944
[SPEAKER_11]: I find not being able to listen to my favorite podcast to be as frustrating as you not being able to get it running.

01:52:25.404 --> 01:52:26.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the kind words.

01:52:32.792 --> 01:52:37.917
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like we're all in good shape now, and everything's hunky-dory happy, and it was just a bad week.

01:52:38.137 --> 01:52:42.040
[SPEAKER_11]: Some weeks are good weeks, and some weeks are bad weeks, and let's just leave it at that.

01:52:44.062 --> 01:52:52.369
[SPEAKER_11]: An email from Cheeseburger asks, I was wondering if there is an Xbox Live OLR clan named like the OL Army, or at least a motto that all OLR listeners can have.

01:52:52.769 --> 01:52:53.990
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, yes, we do have one.

01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:56.052
[SPEAKER_11]: The OLR clan is the OL Army.

01:52:56.252 --> 01:52:57.213
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the official clan.

01:52:57.473 --> 01:52:59.054
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a Steam community available.

01:52:59.094 --> 01:52:59.535
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look...

01:52:59.935 --> 01:53:00.895
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be a dick.

01:53:50.422 --> 01:53:53.524
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi everyone, I thought I would email you folks some questions and comments.

01:53:53.904 --> 01:53:56.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, more of a recommendation than a comment, but I won't get into semantics.

01:53:56.806 --> 01:54:01.049
[SPEAKER_11]: Since you three have professed the love of all things DDR on numerous occasions, well, hold on.

01:54:02.409 --> 01:54:03.570
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, I wouldn't go that far.

01:54:04.150 --> 01:54:08.413
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to all love DDR, but DDR got really stale in the past few years.

01:54:08.473 --> 01:54:09.314
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to clarify that.

01:54:10.274 --> 01:54:12.355
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't love all things DDR.

01:54:12.395 --> 01:54:16.018
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there will always be love for DDR, because without it we would have never met.

01:54:16.923 --> 01:54:19.445
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean we love each and every game that comes out of the franchise.

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:21.447
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps you can explain something to me.

01:54:21.507 --> 01:54:23.469
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly is the reasons that you get into these games?

01:54:23.609 --> 01:54:29.515
[SPEAKER_11]: I get stuff like Rock Band and Guitar Hero, but the idea behind pushing arrows to music I've never heard of before doesn't seem very interesting.

01:54:29.555 --> 01:54:30.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, to me anyway.

01:54:30.956 --> 01:54:31.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was just fun.

01:54:32.216 --> 01:54:32.857
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it was just funny.

01:54:33.037 --> 01:54:34.739
[SPEAKER_11]: It was such a different type of arcade game.

01:54:34.819 --> 01:54:36.881
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you moved.

01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:37.742
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:54:37.822 --> 01:54:38.843
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't just you stood there.

01:54:39.303 --> 01:54:40.244
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, here's the thing.

01:54:40.585 --> 01:54:43.588
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, and maybe it's just me, I suck at fighting games.

01:54:44.188 --> 01:54:45.330
[SPEAKER_11]: I was never very good at them.

01:54:45.730 --> 01:54:48.933
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't very good at a lot of the types of games like shooter games that were in the arcade.

01:54:49.214 --> 01:54:52.397
[SPEAKER_11]: But when it came to the music games, I was pretty good at it.

01:54:53.137 --> 01:54:59.301
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the type of game I could get into and be good at because I was into music in high school and I know Jamie has a musical background.

01:54:59.401 --> 01:55:01.643
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Loki likes to mix music.

01:55:01.963 --> 01:55:05.205
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a big fan of music and has music as a hobby, you could say.

01:55:05.605 --> 01:55:07.306
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's one common thing we all have.

01:55:07.706 --> 01:55:13.210
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to say you're not into music, but definitely I think it's something that enables us to be into DDR so much more.

01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:14.411
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be a big part of it.

01:55:18.152 --> 01:55:20.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Have any of you played Comet Crash yet?

01:55:20.672 --> 01:55:22.973
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, I recommend picking it up from the PSN store.

01:55:23.013 --> 01:55:31.294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another tower defense game, like PixelJunk Monsters, but has more of a sci-fi feel and you can send vehicles on the offensive, whereas PJ Monsters is purely defensive.

01:55:31.374 --> 01:55:34.095
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, after playing this game for a week, I would recommend getting this title.

01:55:34.775 --> 01:55:40.496
[SPEAKER_11]: For my last subject question, and on a semi-related note, have you played Ragdoll Kung Fu yet?

01:55:40.876 --> 01:55:42.397
[SPEAKER_11]: If so, what are your impressions of the game?

01:55:42.977 --> 01:55:43.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't played it.

01:55:43.717 --> 01:55:44.577
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played it yet.

01:55:44.857 --> 01:55:45.537
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked okay.

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:46.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it worth getting?

01:55:46.738 --> 01:55:49.458
[SPEAKER_11]: From what little I've seen, it looks like a cross between the Super Smash Bros.

01:55:49.498 --> 01:55:52.779
[SPEAKER_11]: games and parodies of classic Hong Kong Kung Fu movies from the 60s and 70s.

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:54.300
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a fair assessment?

01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:56.420
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it wasn't as fun as it seemed.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:57.040
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:02.742
[SPEAKER_11]: Since neither of us have played it, we'll have to ask the chat room if there's any follow-up comments on that one.

01:56:04.142 --> 01:56:11.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly... I want to read... He sent another email later in the week.

01:56:11.804 --> 01:56:11.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

01:56:13.157 --> 01:56:13.777
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:56:34.683 --> 01:56:36.065
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, I hope Mega Man Legends is in there.

01:56:36.085 --> 01:56:43.091
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I remember seeing something from Capcom and more PS1 games, but... Well, I remember seeing something about Marvel vs. Capcom 2 achievements on 360.

01:56:43.191 --> 01:56:43.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:56:43.431 --> 01:56:44.713
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that.

01:56:45.473 --> 01:56:52.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, another rumor suggests that in tandem with the release of Capcom PS1 titles, an upgraded version of SNK vs. Capcom 2 will be coming out at the same time.

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.021
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit, I hope that's true.

01:56:54.401 --> 01:56:55.823
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one fighting game I can get into.

01:56:56.123 --> 01:56:57.845
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, like, one of my favorite fighting games ever.

01:56:58.665 --> 01:56:58.705
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

01:56:59.426 --> 01:57:02.549
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been suggested that SVC2 will... Wasn't it Capcom vs. SNK?

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:03.130
[SPEAKER_11]: Other way around?

01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:03.510
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:09.516
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we'll get the same HD Remix treatment as Super Puzzle Fighter and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo did before this.

01:57:09.616 --> 01:57:16.803
[SPEAKER_11]: As I've stated, these are still just rumors until some kind of official announcement is made one way or another, but this does give us something to possibly look forward to if proven to be true.

01:57:17.483 --> 01:57:18.044
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be cool.

01:57:18.684 --> 01:57:19.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

01:57:20.104 --> 01:57:23.067
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me read this last thing, because this will be the last email here from Mailbag tonight.

01:57:23.867 --> 01:57:24.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Also from Spazinator.

01:57:25.068 --> 01:57:30.733
[SPEAKER_11]: As you probably already know, PS3 owners, at their discretion, can install another operating system on their system, usually Yellow Dog Linux.

01:57:31.093 --> 01:57:33.015
[SPEAKER_11]: What benefit does this ultimately give you, if any?

01:57:33.095 --> 01:57:34.276
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the appeal in doing this?

01:57:34.356 --> 01:57:38.299
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this ultimately give you open source equivalents to Microsoft's Word, Excel, and so on?

01:57:38.659 --> 01:57:42.082
[SPEAKER_11]: I already know I won't be able to play Linux-supported PC games due to RAM limitations.

01:57:42.122 --> 01:57:42.662
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a given.

01:57:43.023 --> 01:57:47.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Furthermore, should I decide to take the proverbial plunge, where can I buy the disc to install Linux?

01:57:47.546 --> 01:57:49.948
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't buy the disc, you can download it off the internet.

01:57:50.909 --> 01:57:52.190
[SPEAKER_10]: You can burn ISO that way.

01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:54.851
[SPEAKER_10]: You could buy, they have Linux that's available.

01:57:55.212 --> 01:58:00.015
[SPEAKER_10]: I one time bought it at Best Buy because that was back when I was on dial-up.

01:58:00.576 --> 01:58:07.521
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I remember correctly, I think I was doing that because of something about installing some sort of mod or something on a PlayStation 2 or something.

01:58:07.541 --> 01:58:08.281
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what it was.

01:58:08.742 --> 01:58:12.705
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, basically you would download it off the internet.

01:58:13.632 --> 01:58:14.613
[SPEAKER_10]: and then burn your own disc.

01:58:15.013 --> 01:58:16.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that doesn't answer the why.

01:58:17.474 --> 01:58:17.694
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

01:58:17.894 --> 01:58:18.575
[SPEAKER_10]: To tinker with.

01:58:18.775 --> 01:58:19.896
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really the only reason.

01:58:20.516 --> 01:58:26.779
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're going to be able to basically run a few things, probably like some emulators and stuff like that.

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:32.002
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to be able to run any big games or anything, but it's basically just to tinker with.

01:58:32.383 --> 01:58:36.705
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of getting the impression that if you would be interested in this, you already know.

01:58:37.225 --> 01:58:37.806
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

01:58:37.826 --> 01:58:41.188
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is something that would really interest you, you already know this would interest you, right?

01:58:41.668 --> 01:58:41.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:58:43.252 --> 01:58:47.375
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're the type of person that wants to try and put Linux on a toaster and all this shit, then you already know.

01:58:47.395 --> 01:58:50.478
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also stops people from trying to hack the system to put Linux on it.

01:58:51.358 --> 01:58:52.399
[SPEAKER_11]: By just opening it up?

01:58:52.519 --> 01:58:53.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:55.742
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a really fair response.

01:58:56.082 --> 01:58:59.464
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony kind of bowed down to the hackers in that regard, I guess.

01:58:59.544 --> 01:58:59.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:59:00.646 --> 01:59:01.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well there you have it.

01:59:01.706 --> 01:59:02.327
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our mailbag.

01:59:02.367 --> 01:59:06.068
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us some more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:59:06.188 --> 01:59:07.309
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

01:59:07.349 --> 01:59:08.029
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a few more.

01:59:08.489 --> 01:59:08.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:10.750
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, this was fun.

01:59:11.631 --> 01:59:12.911
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an email from my boss.

01:59:14.582 --> 01:59:15.363
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghetto Golf Happy Gilmore Friday

01:59:34.343 --> 01:59:37.206
[SPEAKER_10]: And the game itself, it looks very interesting.

01:59:37.707 --> 01:59:38.588
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of cool, actually.

01:59:39.368 --> 01:59:45.976
[SPEAKER_10]: This was actually a full-fledged download for Unreal Tournament 3, and I don't think it's available yet.

01:59:46.317 --> 01:59:52.904
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it was, man, I would probably pick up Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 to at least install this, because you remember, they do run...

01:59:54.525 --> 01:59:55.146
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

02:00:12.225 --> 02:00:17.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting, but no idea if there's any release, because they still need somebody to pick it up, basically, right?

02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:21.731
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, basically, it says right now, Ghetto Golf exists as an Unreal Tournament 3 mod.

02:00:23.452 --> 02:00:33.099
[SPEAKER_10]: Illphonic, the developer, wants a publisher to support its development into a standalone download game for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam.

02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:47.356
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently you can check out the Ghetto Golf... It's GhettoGolf.ilphonic.com And you can check out the game's official website, which has nothing other than a splash screen saying coming soon.

02:00:47.997 --> 02:00:48.197
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

02:00:49.690 --> 02:00:49.990
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:55.817
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to download this at least if it's available and try it out as a mod.

02:00:55.917 --> 02:01:00.863
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, I love their website, which is awesome.

02:01:00.963 --> 02:01:02.845
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got three links here.

02:01:03.126 --> 02:01:06.309
[SPEAKER_10]: The business, upcoming shit, and contact us.

02:01:06.710 --> 02:01:06.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

02:01:07.571 --> 02:01:08.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Very professional.

02:01:09.865 --> 02:01:12.707
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Actdeft in our chatroom right now brings up a really good point.

02:01:12.747 --> 02:01:15.529
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if maybe somebody else said it, but I noticed Actdeft is posting the link.

02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:22.335
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of a follow-up to the question we got in the email bag about where can I join an OL Army or how can I be part of an OLR clan.

02:01:22.656 --> 02:01:33.525
[SPEAKER_11]: In case you forgot, in the midst of all the avatars and all this on Xbox 360, OLR does have an official gamer pick that actually is available for download officially through Microsoft on the gamer marketplace.

02:01:33.985 --> 02:01:34.105
[SPEAKER_11]: It's...

02:01:35.166 --> 02:02:03.895
[SPEAKER_11]: and now with the whole online integration Actdeft is posting a link in chat right now you can just click on that and it will put it in your queue to download it is free and it's part of a gamer pick collection of a bunch of all games radio shows so you get like all games interactive Bobby Blackwolf and some of the other like video game outsiders and you know some of the other shows that are on the network all have a little gamer pick that you can wear with pride on your little gamer card because everybody has a freaking avatar so now it's like unique to not have an avatar you know what I mean so check that out if you would like

02:02:04.215 --> 02:02:04.475
[SPEAKER_11]: Demigod

02:02:34.235 --> 02:02:37.659
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the thing, too, about... This was a compound problem.

02:02:37.699 --> 02:02:40.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically... Can I say this real quick, though?

02:02:40.803 --> 02:02:44.207
[SPEAKER_11]: They had tested this for 50,000 players at peak times.

02:02:44.588 --> 02:02:46.870
[SPEAKER_11]: They were not ready for this type of load.

02:02:47.591 --> 02:02:50.294
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and it also hurt them the fact that...

02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:55.312
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:34.289
[SPEAKER_10]: but also, you know, hacker groups got a hold of the game earlier and so now less people, you know, now that it's available for download, you know, before the game actually really comes out everywhere else, you know, a lot of people just said, ah, screw it, I'm just going to go download it because I really want to play this game.

02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:36.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is too bad, but, you know.

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:44.373
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer because Stardock was really taking a risk by not putting copy protection on the games and to kind of have it come back and bite them in the ass kind of sucks.

02:03:44.773 --> 02:03:45.214
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:03:45.574 --> 02:03:45.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:03:46.377 --> 02:03:52.582
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now gamers can't bitch if, you know, Star Trek's next game has some sort of DRM on it.

02:03:53.022 --> 02:03:56.245
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, too bad you guys didn't buy the last one, so, oh well.

02:03:57.466 --> 02:04:06.273
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, you know, I don't know, but this whole situation just gets us a little bit angsty and just seemed like the appropriate time to drop in a regular segment we do here on the show called the FUs of the Week.

02:04:21.294 --> 02:04:31.859
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, DarkSakura isn't here tonight to start us off, but I'm sure if she were here, she would say something along the lines of, God, I hate traffic on the way to L.A., and there was this one driver who really pissed me off, and blah, blah, blah.

02:04:31.979 --> 02:04:33.180
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to stupid drivers.

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:36.802
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say F you to stupid parents, because she's at Disneyland, obviously.

02:04:37.562 --> 02:04:38.262
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be, too.

02:04:39.423 --> 02:04:40.964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Loki, what's your F you of the week?

02:04:41.504 --> 02:04:47.627
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to a sore throat that I have right now, because I hope I'm not getting sick, because I don't really like being sick right now.

02:04:51.387 --> 02:04:53.147
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to Candy for being so delicious

02:05:12.136 --> 02:05:13.497
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a short FU segment.

02:05:14.878 --> 02:05:16.920
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have some news about the PSP?

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:17.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

02:05:18.221 --> 02:05:22.544
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP, of course, you may remember that there was an exploit that came out.

02:05:23.204 --> 02:05:25.866
[SPEAKER_10]: Another TIFF file overflow.

02:05:26.527 --> 02:05:28.829
[SPEAKER_10]: You would think that they would figure out not to do that.

02:05:30.049 --> 02:05:34.413
[SPEAKER_10]: Or to at least protect against that because almost every single version of the PSP has been broken that way.

02:05:34.853 --> 02:05:34.993
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP-3000

02:05:56.441 --> 02:06:25.320
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're going to be adding some features of the M33 custom firmwares and it'll allow you to boot up Homebrew regardless but may be restrictive to certain applications right now so looks like they're not coming out with a new firmware yet but they are going to be adding a program that will allow you to run Homebrew on a PSP3000 which is the first step to an actual custom firmware being installed onto this new system so it's only a matter of time

02:06:27.677 --> 02:06:28.638
[SPEAKER_11]: You just can't stop them.

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:32.163
[SPEAKER_11]: You just can't stop those hackers from getting in the PSP.

02:06:32.183 --> 02:06:35.947
[SPEAKER_10]: Even when the PSP 2 comes out, I'm sorry, it's not going to be unhackable.

02:06:35.987 --> 02:06:38.590
[SPEAKER_10]: Even when it's all digital download?

02:06:38.771 --> 02:06:39.271
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

02:06:39.371 --> 02:06:40.533
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all digital file.

02:06:41.094 --> 02:06:42.235
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it doesn't matter.

02:06:43.527 --> 02:06:45.228
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Daily ran a report on this.

02:06:45.569 --> 02:06:50.732
[SPEAKER_11]: With a nearly two-month span of time between the accessory release and the game's arrival at retail...

02:07:09.326 --> 02:07:14.328
[SPEAKER_11]: We expect that Nintendo will release patches that will make the new accessory work with your already existing library.

02:07:15.029 --> 02:07:16.710
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first would be, of course, Wii Sports.

02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:24.713
[SPEAKER_11]: But Fat Chance Game Daily, according to Nintendo, quote, the Wii Motion Plus accessory is only for games that are designed to make use of its abilities.

02:07:25.154 --> 02:07:30.856
[SPEAKER_11]: But also something to consider, the Wii really can't patch its games, if you think about it.

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:34.178
[SPEAKER_11]: It can patch the firmware, but they can't really patch the games.

02:07:34.318 --> 02:07:41.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they don't have anything built in to where it will read a common area of the Broadway CPU.

02:07:42.244 --> 02:07:45.747
[SPEAKER_10]: A very thorough article on this, by the way, at HackMe.com, M-I-I.

02:07:46.007 --> 02:07:54.033
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and unfortunately, because of all these restrictions and stuff on where the games can read basically data from...

02:07:56.047 --> 02:07:59.569
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be physically impossible for them to release any patches whatsoever.

02:07:59.849 --> 02:08:09.013
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how you get problems like, you know, missing switches and stuff in Tomb Raider Underworld for the Wii, and there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch their game afterwards.

02:08:09.653 --> 02:08:11.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Way to be forward-thinking, Nintendo.

02:08:11.454 --> 02:08:17.457
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they basically say that all in all, the Wii software stack is designed with little to no future-proofing.

02:08:17.477 --> 02:08:24.540
[SPEAKER_10]: There's basically zero provisions for any future updates, even obvious things like new storage devices or game patches.

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:44.330
[SPEAKER_10]: What's worse, it says this will affect compatibility mode of any future Wii successor, just like the DS titles won't get any WPA support on the DSi, effectively making the DSi's WPA mode useless if you want to use DS titles online.

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:49.972
[SPEAKER_10]: And it says the DS Wi-Fi drivers and configuration stack are built into every game.

02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:52.874
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't worry, that's why you'll have new new play control.

02:08:54.955 --> 02:09:07.747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's really sad that, you know, such a company that thinks ahead, you know, that really is innovative can be so un-innovative at the same time.

02:09:07.987 --> 02:09:11.851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like they're so far ahead and they're so far behind at the same time.

02:09:13.567 --> 02:09:13.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

02:09:14.827 --> 02:09:15.128
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:09:15.348 --> 02:09:18.669
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then, believe it or not, we're getting towards the end of this show.

02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:28.293
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll open up the Skype line one more time in just a minute to take all your potpourri, any thoughts you have, after a couple more stories here, and then get ready to close out the show, believe it or not.

02:09:28.633 --> 02:09:28.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:09:29.853 --> 02:09:38.697
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you may remember that there was a lawsuit with the NFL players and basically EA and the NFL and all that stuff over...

02:09:40.177 --> 02:09:46.279
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they were entitled royalties for using their likenesses and stuff like that in games.

02:09:46.299 --> 02:09:50.660
[SPEAKER_10]: This is basically retired NFL players.

02:09:51.561 --> 02:10:00.804
[SPEAKER_10]: They've already received $28 million in a settlement before, but now they're going to be targeting John Madden and EA exclusively.

02:10:01.464 --> 02:10:04.865
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, I guess, you know, the...

02:10:06.778 --> 02:10:09.941
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, a whole other mess to try to get some more money.

02:10:10.221 --> 02:10:18.527
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, granted that they should be guaranteed some money for having their likenesses shown, but I don't know.

02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:20.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

02:10:21.604 --> 02:10:22.744
[SPEAKER_11]: Money, money, money.

02:10:23.165 --> 02:10:23.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:10:23.465 --> 02:10:24.065
[SPEAKER_11]: Money.

02:10:24.105 --> 02:10:26.126
[SPEAKER_11]: Just another Sue Happy thing?

02:10:26.166 --> 02:10:27.826
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do they have something legitimately to complain about?

02:10:27.846 --> 02:10:30.067
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, EA is profiting off these names and everything.

02:10:30.147 --> 02:10:33.148
[SPEAKER_11]: According to... That's why they pay license fees, right?

02:10:33.328 --> 02:10:33.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:10:33.528 --> 02:10:36.209
[SPEAKER_10]: According to Cleveland Brown's Bernie Parrish...

02:10:39.712 --> 02:10:50.241
[SPEAKER_10]: The retired NFL players who were used in Madden EA video games will be suing Madden and EA for using us in those games without compensating us.

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:55.286
[SPEAKER_10]: We will probably not use the attorneys who obtained a $28.1 million verdict.

02:10:58.028 --> 02:11:04.649
[SPEAKER_10]: for us against the NFLPA for scrambling retired players' identities in those video games.

02:11:04.829 --> 02:11:15.311
[SPEAKER_10]: It says the jury found it a grossly fraudulent action taken so that they wouldn't have to pay retired players.

02:11:15.691 --> 02:11:22.652
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, Madden should have been included in our licensing suit against the NFLPA and so should EA.

02:11:23.233 --> 02:11:25.753
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, hey, we won against the NFLPA.

02:11:26.113 --> 02:11:26.734
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

02:11:26.774 --> 02:11:29.597
[SPEAKER_10]: We think that there's some more blood to take out of them.

02:11:29.677 --> 02:11:32.300
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to try suing them as well.

02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:33.141
[SPEAKER_10]: Good lord.

02:11:35.274 --> 02:11:36.075
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what happens.

02:11:36.115 --> 02:11:37.997
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep you posted with any further developments.

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:42.981
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have to laugh at this random comment that came up in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com.

02:11:43.561 --> 02:11:45.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Kurosaki87 says, OMG!

02:11:45.983 --> 02:11:48.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyonce is playing Rhythm Heaven on DS on my TV.

02:11:48.766 --> 02:11:50.047
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually saw that same commercial.

02:11:50.067 --> 02:11:52.709
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what it was during, but I've seen that same thing.

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:56.352
[SPEAKER_11]: So Nintendo is still using the kind of...

02:11:57.113 --> 02:11:59.855
[SPEAKER_11]: all female big names.

02:11:59.895 --> 02:12:03.117
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, because Carrie Underwood was in a DS commercial before, right?

02:12:03.497 --> 02:12:04.258
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there somebody else?

02:12:04.338 --> 02:12:06.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other kind of chick you'd see on Lifetime?

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.304
[SPEAKER_11]: There was... I mean, you can't say Beyonce's for women only, though, because tons of dudes think she's hot, because she is.

02:12:13.985 --> 02:12:14.265
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

02:12:15.125 --> 02:12:15.426
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:12:16.006 --> 02:12:20.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they had a bunch of, you know, what was it?

02:12:22.130 --> 02:12:22.791
[SPEAKER_10]: Lisa Kudrow.

02:12:22.831 --> 02:12:23.311
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Decipher.

02:12:23.331 --> 02:12:24.452
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Lisa Kudrow and...

02:12:25.936 --> 02:12:32.707
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember the other ones, but yeah, it's just... I guess if a woman's playing the game, it must be okay for all women to play the game.

02:12:33.088 --> 02:12:34.891
[SPEAKER_10]: She's just crazy in love with the game!

02:12:36.915 --> 02:12:37.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, boy.

02:12:37.956 --> 02:12:38.276
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:12:38.576 --> 02:12:41.358
[SPEAKER_11]: One more story for you guys, and we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:12:41.378 --> 02:12:42.318
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:12:42.959 --> 02:12:46.101
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was a story that made a lot of people say Woot this week.

02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:53.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the popular sales site, Woot.com, which if you've never been there, that's when you can buy just a piece of random somethings for a very, very low price.

02:12:54.126 --> 02:12:57.968
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, oftentimes, these random somethings are refurbished or they're...

02:12:58.368 --> 02:12:59.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:13:17.336 --> 02:13:22.820
[SPEAKER_11]: with 20GB hard drive and HDMI, $139 plus $5 shipping.

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:27.903
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could have bought a 360 with the HDMI and a 20GB hard drive, $145 shipped to your house.

02:13:27.923 --> 02:13:29.224
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good deal.

02:13:29.404 --> 02:13:30.845
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fucking great deal.

02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:32.746
[SPEAKER_11]: And it even comes with a controller.

02:13:33.887 --> 02:13:35.488
[SPEAKER_11]: And, yeah, they're sold out.

02:13:35.848 --> 02:13:39.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, granted, these are refurbished systems, so you have to not be bothered by that.

02:13:39.991 --> 02:13:46.876
[SPEAKER_11]: But, honestly, when you put that next to, what, $199 for an arcade system with no hard drive, that's a pretty great deal, I think.

02:13:47.556 --> 02:13:49.397
[SPEAKER_11]: So, unfortunately, they're all gone.

02:13:49.477 --> 02:13:50.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys who are listening right now.

02:13:51.038 --> 02:13:56.102
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did want to mention that because one interesting thing about that is I noticed the word of mouth on that one really spread.

02:13:56.502 --> 02:13:58.163
[SPEAKER_11]: And that sometimes happens with the Woot deals.

02:13:58.223 --> 02:14:03.086
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, if you don't check the site every night, then once the blogs go wild with it, then they're gone.

02:14:03.586 --> 02:14:13.873
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw probably like 50 tweets on my personal Twitter from people retweeting Major Nelson posting about it, which I'm sure just made it spread like wildfire when he posted it.

02:14:15.336 --> 02:14:15.916
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure he did.

02:14:16.436 --> 02:14:24.578
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I finally defriended Major Nelson this week, and it's nothing personal, but I defriended all the celebrities on my Twitter, because I'm just sick of the celebrity Twitter thing.

02:14:24.698 --> 02:14:41.083
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, god damn, one of our listeners said it best, who I follow on Twitter, I think it was Justin with some zeros, said something like, I think when Ashton Kutcher hit a million users, that was... I don't remember the exact tweet, I apologize.

02:14:41.103 --> 02:14:41.643
[SPEAKER_11]: He said something like...

02:14:42.843 --> 02:14:47.825
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the shark that we all just jumped over when he hit a million users and all that garbage was going on.

02:14:48.185 --> 02:14:50.006
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like Oprah getting on Twitter too.

02:14:50.566 --> 02:14:53.407
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, now I'm just like, okay, this is garbage.

02:14:53.468 --> 02:15:02.491
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel awful because I actually followed that stupid whole Twitter to a million because I wanted to be in Sims 3.

02:15:03.071 --> 02:15:06.673
[SPEAKER_11]: I did to an extent too, but I instantly defriended him once it was over and I wasn't the millionth person.

02:15:06.693 --> 02:15:11.495
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't done it yet just because, you know, they haven't announced who won that yet and, you know, I don't want to...

02:15:13.425 --> 02:15:20.470
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to compromise anything, but to be honest though, I understand what he was trying to do with it, but at the same time, I didn't give a shit.

02:15:20.890 --> 02:15:24.793
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, oh, this is a new wave of media.

02:15:25.353 --> 02:15:29.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, anybody can go on here and have their voice heard and stuff.

02:15:29.355 --> 02:15:34.419
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, I'm like, I don't want all you having your voice heard because I really don't give a shit what you have to say.

02:15:35.299 --> 02:15:37.120
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I guess you don't have to friend them.

02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.783
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess at first it felt like, ooh, I'm a little closer to these celebrities.

02:15:40.903 --> 02:15:43.444
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're not reading what you have to say.

02:15:43.504 --> 02:15:46.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think Oprah gives a shit about what you just did?

02:15:46.386 --> 02:15:46.907
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:15:47.067 --> 02:15:52.150
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they don't care, but it's something like they're actually responding back to you.

02:15:52.190 --> 02:15:59.175
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you Twitter Ashton Kutcher and he responds back to you, it's Ashton Kutcher responding back to you and not some PR guy.

02:15:59.255 --> 02:16:01.817
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically these guys are so...

02:16:02.597 --> 02:16:03.638
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:16:25.027 --> 02:16:27.650
[SPEAKER_11]: and I can barely get through because the site's just been down, down, down.

02:16:28.271 --> 02:16:33.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I might add more celebrities and put them on a separate filter and I guess there's plugins and stuff that'll do it but I don't know.

02:16:33.857 --> 02:16:38.422
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like staying ahead of trends basically.

02:16:38.502 --> 02:16:40.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody gets a MySpace page.

02:16:40.283 --> 02:16:41.785
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter's going to go the way of Friendster.

02:16:42.105 --> 02:16:45.369
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be screwed because they could never keep up with the demand.

02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:46.109
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:09.398
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a phone call.

02:17:09.418 --> 02:17:10.498
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:17:10.518 --> 02:17:10.958
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:17:37.895 --> 02:17:39.055
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:17:39.075 --> 02:17:39.416
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:17:41.456 --> 02:17:42.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Caller, if you can hear us.

02:17:42.557 --> 02:17:45.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Comcast is a piece of crap.

02:17:45.798 --> 02:17:46.538
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to hear that.

02:17:46.598 --> 02:17:46.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:48.799
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, for crying out loud.

02:17:49.119 --> 02:17:50.860
[SPEAKER_13]: I listened to the whole conversation.

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.200
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm minding my own business.

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:53.681
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm enjoying the conversation.

02:17:54.141 --> 02:17:57.222
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Comcast drops me out for that five seconds.

02:17:57.242 --> 02:17:58.063
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:17:58.083 --> 02:17:59.303
[SPEAKER_11]: You piece of crap.

02:17:59.403 --> 02:18:00.583
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't you stay up?

02:18:00.884 --> 02:18:01.744
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's our fault.

02:18:02.104 --> 02:18:04.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they got hit with a fail whale.

02:18:04.185 --> 02:18:04.665
[SPEAKER_11]: What can we say?

02:18:06.066 --> 02:18:06.866
[SPEAKER_11]: Introduce yourself.

02:18:07.745 --> 02:18:09.667
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi Orange Lines Radio Land, it's Jason.

02:18:09.847 --> 02:18:14.771
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Jason, one of our fearless web team people with the fabulous Dekeman.

02:18:15.372 --> 02:18:15.832
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

02:18:15.852 --> 02:18:19.255
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm continually owned by Comcast again as it's been so often lately.

02:18:20.236 --> 02:18:21.017
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:18:22.298 --> 02:18:32.883
[SPEAKER_13]: The quote you were looking for was, I think A plus K, Ashton Kutcher's Twitter handle, I think A plus K is the shark, and when he hit a million, we all jumped over him on water skis.

02:18:32.923 --> 02:18:34.423
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what I was looking for.

02:18:34.443 --> 02:18:37.384
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have read it myself, but Twitter would not fucking load for me.

02:18:39.045 --> 02:18:43.787
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on an unrelated note, I said something that I think was kind of interestingly along the same line.

02:18:44.327 --> 02:18:49.990
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting that Twitter's last great hurrah was Obama's election, and now that everyone else is following suit, everyone's complaining.

02:18:52.151 --> 02:18:54.712
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just surprising to me that it's a problem now.

02:18:55.312 --> 02:19:03.475
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have thought that all of the political madness for that whole year and a half primary and election would have been where everybody started complaining.

02:19:03.555 --> 02:19:07.157
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a problem because Twitter can't fucking handle it.

02:19:07.277 --> 02:19:08.677
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter is the new Friendster.

02:19:08.837 --> 02:19:12.138
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, you're going to see so many similarities.

02:19:12.178 --> 02:19:15.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's going to take the Twitter model and they're going to do it better and they're going to be the new Facebook.

02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.520
[SPEAKER_13]: If it isn't Facebook!

02:19:17.661 --> 02:19:22.402
[SPEAKER_11]: If Facebook themselves does not become the new Twitter, because that's what they're trying to do with their latest update.

02:19:24.283 --> 02:19:30.286
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody says that, and I guess, like I said before, I guess I just don't use it enough to really know.

02:19:30.506 --> 02:19:40.950
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't use Facebook as much as a lot of other people I know, and that includes people like coworkers and stuff, which I'm kind of surprised that use Facebook as much as they do.

02:19:41.170 --> 02:19:45.112
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't use Facebook quite... You know what I do on Facebook more than anything else?

02:19:46.564 --> 02:19:47.464
[SPEAKER_13]: Play Bejeweled?

02:19:47.544 --> 02:19:49.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I play Bejeweled Blitz.

02:19:49.745 --> 02:19:51.186
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen your scores.

02:19:51.626 --> 02:19:53.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that is the number one thing I do on Facebook.

02:19:53.847 --> 02:19:54.407
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

02:19:54.927 --> 02:19:57.188
[SPEAKER_11]: And once in a while I'll upload a picture or comment on a picture.

02:19:58.629 --> 02:20:01.670
[SPEAKER_13]: Upload your Hawaii pictures and all of that.

02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:03.071
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great way to share pictures.

02:20:03.351 --> 02:20:03.851
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say that.

02:20:04.691 --> 02:20:06.212
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, Facebook is great for Bejeweled.

02:20:06.232 --> 02:20:06.612
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

02:20:08.257 --> 02:20:09.578
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like all the other crap on there.

02:20:09.598 --> 02:20:10.579
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many applications.

02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:13.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Once in a while I'll take a quiz.

02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:13.921
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:20:14.361 --> 02:20:15.122
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I love?

02:20:15.522 --> 02:20:16.082
[SPEAKER_11]: LiveJournal.

02:20:16.282 --> 02:20:17.123
[SPEAKER_11]: I love LiveJournal.

02:20:17.203 --> 02:20:18.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I've loved LiveJournal for so long.

02:20:19.765 --> 02:20:24.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Out of all the social networking sites I've ever been on, LiveJournal was my favorite four years ago.

02:20:24.788 --> 02:20:29.112
[SPEAKER_13]: And you need to put your $175 permanent account to use.

02:20:29.193 --> 02:20:29.953
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, that.

02:20:30.073 --> 02:20:40.203
[SPEAKER_11]: And, well, just the fact that, you know, just all these other sites that have come into play have kind of made LiveJournal go downhill a little bit, especially Twatter has really ruined LiveJournal.

02:20:40.684 --> 02:20:44.007
[SPEAKER_11]: And I miss the heydays of LiveJournal.

02:20:44.087 --> 02:20:46.870
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed LiveJournal circa four years ago, and people have more to say on it.

02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:47.530
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know.

02:20:48.311 --> 02:20:51.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Live Journal Now is just a repost of all your Twitter posts.

02:20:51.153 --> 02:20:52.794
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not on my friends list.

02:20:52.874 --> 02:20:57.056
[SPEAKER_11]: I found a code that filters that shit right off of there because I'm so fucking sick of it.

02:20:57.096 --> 02:20:57.537
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:20:57.597 --> 02:20:59.318
[SPEAKER_11]: I got so fucking sick of it.

02:20:59.738 --> 02:21:00.378
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry.

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:01.619
[SPEAKER_13]: I cut mine.

02:21:01.739 --> 02:21:02.640
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie cut hers.

02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:13.266
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind the LJ Cut people, but I had people that would have like 20 pages of tweets and it's all nonsensical because it's replies to people, but when I read it on Twitter, it filters that out.

02:21:13.286 --> 02:21:15.167
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing I hate about Twitter the most.

02:21:15.247 --> 02:21:19.050
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all these replies and stuff and you're trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about and it's just...

02:21:19.850 --> 02:21:20.150
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:26.611
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the whole people want to archive it or all this stuff, but please go in, figure out how to change your settings.

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:29.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Make them private posts if you just want to archive it.

02:21:30.652 --> 02:21:32.492
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just... Well, it doesn't matter.

02:21:32.532 --> 02:21:33.212
[SPEAKER_11]: I filtered it out.

02:21:33.313 --> 02:21:38.113
[SPEAKER_11]: I think LiveJournals have an easier way for just click a button and I won't see Twitter crap on my friend's page anymore.

02:21:38.133 --> 02:21:40.034
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be the greatest thing LiveJournal could do.

02:21:40.374 --> 02:21:42.474
[SPEAKER_11]: But they'd have to stop firing their staff in order to do that.

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:44.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, let's talk video games.

02:21:44.275 --> 02:21:46.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

02:21:46.955 --> 02:21:51.083
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan's hovering over my shoulder and she told me she had a question, so I'm going to start with that real quick.

02:21:51.103 --> 02:21:51.303
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

02:21:52.233 --> 02:21:58.438
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know, why is it that when Jason calls through Skype, he gets through first time?

02:21:59.038 --> 02:22:04.522
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're driving and I'm trying to call from my phone, we can't get through at all.

02:22:05.163 --> 02:22:06.924
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't the foggiest idea.

02:22:07.205 --> 02:22:07.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here's the thing.

02:22:07.845 --> 02:22:08.566
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you this much.

02:22:09.086 --> 02:22:14.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day, Skype used to, every time we'd get a call, it would open up multiple tabs for each call we were getting.

02:22:15.311 --> 02:22:19.274
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would see 20 tabs up on the screen, and the great thing about that is I could see who was calling in.

02:22:19.614 --> 02:22:43.168
[SPEAKER_11]: and this way we could share the love a little bit like if there was a person that was calling in every week I wouldn't take their call one week so that somebody else could get through that's only fair right now ever since about a year ago Skype changed something and I have combed the settings up and down this is something they did on their end where I only get one tab at a time now so whoever gets through gets through and locks everybody else out and the natural delay with the phones I can even attest to of course

02:22:43.368 --> 02:22:46.250
[SPEAKER_11]: If it has been somebody... Yeah, and phones just have a natural delay.

02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:51.633
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's somebody who's really been on the show a lot lately... Like me.

02:22:52.393 --> 02:22:57.036
[SPEAKER_11]: And other people are trying to get through, I'll just consistently hang up on the person so that way somebody else gets through.

02:22:57.296 --> 02:23:01.078
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to do that, but I want everybody to have a chance.

02:23:01.418 --> 02:23:02.479
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only fair, right?

02:23:02.619 --> 02:23:03.519
[SPEAKER_13]: Every gamer has a voice.

02:23:03.539 --> 02:23:05.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Every gamer gets the voice, exactly.

02:23:05.441 --> 02:23:08.662
[SPEAKER_11]: But tonight's setup has actually been very nice, having the people sprinkled out throughout the show.

02:23:08.722 --> 02:23:11.224
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is something we'll do long-term, but it's something we're considering.

02:23:11.684 --> 02:23:16.127
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, with a third computer, dot, dot, dot, we're thinking of ideas.

02:23:17.928 --> 02:23:23.231
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it that it actually comes up and shows you a phone number when somebody calls from like a cell phone?

02:23:23.391 --> 02:23:24.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it will show me a phone number.

02:23:24.832 --> 02:23:28.494
[SPEAKER_11]: And I almost always take the phone numbers because they're usually new people that haven't called before.

02:23:29.115 --> 02:23:29.575
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

02:23:30.510 --> 02:23:31.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost always.

02:23:32.573 --> 02:23:35.256
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want people thinking they can circumvent it by calling on the phone.

02:23:35.796 --> 02:23:40.081
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's people like me whose ISP decides to suck and they have to go to the phone instead.

02:23:40.441 --> 02:23:42.384
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want people thinking I pick and choose.

02:23:42.644 --> 02:23:48.150
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, but if a person was on the last three weeks in a row, I try not to take their call a fourth week.

02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:48.671
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:23:50.034 --> 02:23:51.175
[SPEAKER_13]: So, just to share.

02:23:51.215 --> 02:23:55.639
[SPEAKER_13]: Assuming the traffic's coming in to warrant the need to ignore them in favor of somebody else.

02:23:55.739 --> 02:23:56.359
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, exactly.

02:23:56.379 --> 02:23:58.060
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's a slow night, we'll hear from anybody.

02:23:59.221 --> 02:24:02.144
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Jason, speaking of which, I want to share the love and let some more people call in.

02:24:02.184 --> 02:24:03.445
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your call, though, as always.

02:24:03.985 --> 02:24:05.907
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, she completely took my question away.

02:24:06.027 --> 02:24:07.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, okay, Jason, quickly.

02:24:07.268 --> 02:24:08.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, please, go ahead.

02:24:08.069 --> 02:24:10.070
[SPEAKER_11]: We gotta sidetrack with Twitter talk.

02:24:10.090 --> 02:24:10.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

02:24:11.832 --> 02:24:12.732
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, blame Twitter.

02:24:12.832 --> 02:24:14.294
[SPEAKER_13]: Twitter's the cause of all of our problems.

02:24:14.314 --> 02:24:15.454
[SPEAKER_13]: Twitter and Comcast.

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:36.867
[SPEAKER_13]: and of course now that we've had this whole tangent I completely forgot all of my details somebody in chat earlier we were talking about all the Nintendo all of the Nintendo update stuff this that and the other and then somebody in chat talked about Nintendo where games go to die that rang really true right now because I really want to play Fatal Frame 4

02:24:38.192 --> 02:24:40.957
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to see what they did with that game.

02:24:42.039 --> 02:24:46.687
[SPEAKER_13]: But the problem is, apparently, if you did see it in the news, they're not going to bring it to our region.

02:24:46.828 --> 02:24:51.075
[SPEAKER_10]: Or at least that they haven't announced it yet and they're saving it for E3 because they have to have something announced at E3.

02:24:52.063 --> 02:24:57.666
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah... The whole licensing snafu like that thing seems kind of weird for something as simple as that.

02:24:57.686 --> 02:24:58.607
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's licensing at all.

02:24:58.647 --> 02:25:00.107
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's like, okay, look at this.

02:25:00.167 --> 02:25:01.148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game that's done.

02:25:01.308 --> 02:25:03.309
[SPEAKER_10]: All they have to do is localize.

02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:05.710
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course they want the easy way out.

02:25:05.971 --> 02:25:07.932
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what Nintendo does is the easy way out.

02:25:08.012 --> 02:25:09.893
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all they do nowadays.

02:25:10.333 --> 02:25:15.096
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's a game that people want a lot, you know, maybe Mother of Three, of course, but...

02:25:16.531 --> 02:25:23.655
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a different reason altogether, but still, I have a feeling that they could be announcing this at E3 because they're like, hey, look, see, core game.

02:25:24.676 --> 02:25:25.216
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be nice.

02:25:25.517 --> 02:25:28.699
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be so pleased if it were, especially if I was there.

02:25:29.259 --> 02:25:32.681
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, Nintendo likes to disappoint as well, so it's hard to say.

02:25:33.982 --> 02:25:34.442
[SPEAKER_10]: Well put.

02:25:35.142 --> 02:25:41.726
[SPEAKER_00]: And a small plug, there is a Facebook group trying to get emails to Nintendo to try to get it localized.

02:25:42.067 --> 02:25:44.048
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been going on the scorns of social media.

02:25:44.088 --> 02:25:45.849
[SPEAKER_13]: We need not your Facebook chatter here.

02:25:46.417 --> 02:25:47.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what the hell, let her give it out.

02:25:47.878 --> 02:25:50.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do emails, do actual letters.

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:51.860
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.221
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would be more effective.

02:25:55.722 --> 02:26:02.546
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's been, other than that, I admit in very, I admit the sadness that I finally broke down and bought Peggle.

02:26:03.947 --> 02:26:06.568
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was through a lot of that last night.

02:26:06.588 --> 02:26:09.770
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll have to have a Peggle party at some point, Jason.

02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:14.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I really do have to let you go now, though, to get some other callers, but thank you and Rye as well for calling in, okay?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:15.160
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:15.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good night, guys.

02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:17.101
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one, buddy.

02:26:17.141 --> 02:26:18.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a note to the Justin TV folks.

02:26:19.442 --> 02:26:21.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Our phone calls don't go through to Justin TV.

02:26:21.243 --> 02:26:21.864
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

02:26:22.824 --> 02:26:23.425
[SPEAKER_11]: That's weird.

02:26:24.265 --> 02:26:25.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

02:26:25.786 --> 02:26:27.487
[SPEAKER_11]: Just remember, it's a simulcast, guys.

02:26:27.687 --> 02:26:29.048
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually tape on allgames.com.

02:26:29.068 --> 02:26:38.713
[SPEAKER_10]: They should be, unless it's... See, the problem is, I think it's mono, and I think it's coming in on one side or the other, and I don't know which side, so I tried flipping it, but if it's... I could try flipping it again.

02:26:38.933 --> 02:26:39.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry about it.

02:26:39.553 --> 02:26:39.773
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry.

02:26:39.793 --> 02:26:42.855
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, honestly, Justin TV is not the focus.

02:26:42.975 --> 02:26:43.355
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

02:26:43.435 --> 02:26:44.256
[SPEAKER_11]: They think they are.

02:26:44.276 --> 02:26:44.556
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's...

02:26:44.756 --> 02:26:45.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Sailor Moon

02:27:14.498 --> 02:27:16.680
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you want to talk about with Sailor Moon?

02:27:18.081 --> 02:27:30.011
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's, you know, it was actually kind of like one of those crossovers between like Harry Potter meets the Power Rangers, how my friends kind of put it, sort of.

02:27:30.651 --> 02:27:33.554
[SPEAKER_09]: But do you think the storyline behind that would make a good game?

02:27:34.662 --> 02:27:36.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have Sailor Moon games?

02:27:36.303 --> 02:27:38.384
[SPEAKER_10]: They've had multiple Sailor Moon games in Japan.

02:27:38.404 --> 02:27:40.665
[SPEAKER_10]: But none that have been brought over here, right?

02:27:41.325 --> 02:27:43.686
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think they have had Sailor Moon games come out over here.

02:27:43.726 --> 02:27:47.168
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is, it's not a popular franchise anymore.

02:27:47.208 --> 02:27:51.390
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like for some reason when Eidos thought it was a great idea to put out, was it Wacky Races?

02:27:52.031 --> 02:27:55.312
[SPEAKER_10]: The cartoon series that ran in the 80s and originally came from the 60s.

02:27:55.552 --> 02:27:56.773
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on.

02:27:58.977 --> 02:28:06.363
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support a Sailor Moon game if it was the live-action Sailor Moon, because when the cat is actually a stuffed cat, that's pretty amazing.

02:28:06.723 --> 02:28:11.407
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we could get some old-school Sega CD-style live-action Sailor Moon games.

02:28:11.467 --> 02:28:12.147
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support this.

02:28:13.729 --> 02:28:23.757
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so would I. And, you know, besides that, I've been hearing a whole lot about that Rackman unplugged for PFT.

02:28:24.077 --> 02:28:26.659
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the question is, will it have download content?

02:28:27.239 --> 02:28:27.900
[SPEAKER_09]: If it does...

02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:35.133
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost thinking of forging for that 32 gigabyte memory stick, which is probably going to drop me 600 bucks.

02:28:35.333 --> 02:28:38.395
[SPEAKER_10]: It will have a Rock Band store, so yeah, there will be download content for sure.

02:28:38.435 --> 02:28:42.316
[SPEAKER_11]: There definitely will be download content, but you probably won't need to drive that big.

02:28:42.376 --> 02:28:44.918
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't download every song that comes out on Rock Band.

02:28:45.338 --> 02:28:46.919
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be a little bit much, don't you think?

02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:54.903
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, but then again, there's a lot of good songs from a certain artist I like.

02:28:55.423 --> 02:28:57.824
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd probably get their whole album if it's on there.

02:28:59.123 --> 02:29:10.688
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm already ticked off that Nintendo is kind of shafted for the Metallica content for Guitar Hero.

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:25.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Because us Wii owners, we only get three tracks from the Death Magnetic album while you three 16 PS3 owners, not hating here, but you guys are getting the full albums while us Wii owners here are getting shafted, sort of.

02:29:26.633 --> 02:29:28.534
[SPEAKER_09]: for the Guitar Hero Metallica content.

02:29:29.134 --> 02:29:29.995
[SPEAKER_11]: That does suck.

02:29:30.055 --> 02:29:38.999
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why the Wii should... Honestly, part of me thinks the Wii shouldn't even have Rock Band and Guitar Hero because you're not really getting the same game.

02:29:39.039 --> 02:29:41.660
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, you all know what you're getting into with the Wii.

02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:48.283
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Wii does not have the power of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

02:29:48.323 --> 02:29:50.564
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I say power, I mean storage space as well.

02:29:50.604 --> 02:29:51.045
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

02:29:52.645 --> 02:29:55.387
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, even though I have an extra 2GB

02:29:57.576 --> 02:30:04.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Micro SD that can transfer into a normal SD card, which I'd really love to fill up with other stuff.

02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:13.304
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I always figured I had to get my virtual console tiles and everything onto there, which you can copy from... I figured I had to do it from the Wii memory.

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:15.105
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally figured that out.

02:30:16.086 --> 02:30:19.007
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a pain in the butt, though.

02:30:20.008 --> 02:30:21.248
[SPEAKER_09]: But isn't Wii Fit awesome?

02:30:23.859 --> 02:30:26.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Wii Fit stinks.

02:30:26.441 --> 02:30:29.602
[SPEAKER_09]: I only played it once, never played it again.

02:30:29.842 --> 02:30:31.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one more thing before I let you guys go.

02:30:31.023 --> 02:30:31.743
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my favorite in my lines.

02:30:49.844 --> 02:30:52.627
[SPEAKER_09]: Moon, Prism, Power, and Rock On.

02:30:52.948 --> 02:30:54.089
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep the good shows, guys.

02:30:54.169 --> 02:30:54.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:55.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

02:30:57.252 --> 02:30:57.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:30:58.092 --> 02:30:59.914
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:30:59.934 --> 02:31:04.999
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to close up shop on the Skype line so that we can get through some last minute stories and get to the end of the show.

02:31:05.059 --> 02:31:07.000
[SPEAKER_10]: God, this boss is so cheap.

02:31:07.161 --> 02:31:08.482
[SPEAKER_10]: It keeps tossing me in the air.

02:31:08.922 --> 02:31:10.063
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this further than you got last time?

02:31:10.544 --> 02:31:11.705
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same place I got last time.

02:31:12.045 --> 02:31:14.808
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's probably one of those things where it's giving you hints, too, but they're all in Japanese.

02:31:14.828 --> 02:31:15.849
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not giving me hints at all.

02:31:15.869 --> 02:31:16.830
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just cheap.

02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:19.592
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard someone else that was talking about the demo.

02:31:19.612 --> 02:31:20.733
[SPEAKER_10]: They got tossed in the air 26 times.

02:31:20.773 --> 02:31:20.954
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

02:31:22.595 --> 02:31:23.736
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just being cheap.

02:31:24.536 --> 02:31:26.798
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, that's why it's a demo, so they can fix that crap.

02:31:28.699 --> 02:31:36.764
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, some stuff we didn't talk about here, but the ESRB has raided Ghostbusters and two other Atari DS titles for the DSi.

02:31:37.365 --> 02:31:40.927
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you may think, oh, well, that's not that big deal, because if you think about it,

02:31:42.782 --> 02:31:44.103
[SPEAKER_10]: DS games play on the DSi.

02:31:44.183 --> 02:31:51.046
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it is a big deal because DSi games are only for the DSi.

02:31:51.226 --> 02:31:56.769
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they're DSiWare or DSi special enhanced versions of the game.

02:31:57.189 --> 02:32:02.912
[SPEAKER_10]: So, those three games, Ghostbusters, N+, and The Chase, Felix, Meet Felicity, the thought is...

02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:12.625
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps Nintendo is going to start allowing publishers to put up full copies of their games on the DSiWare store to download.

02:32:12.905 --> 02:32:23.551
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest, as a person that has downloaded his fair share of games for the DS and ROM form to play on, you know, things that allow that sort of thing, they aren't that big.

02:32:23.711 --> 02:32:25.773
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could see something like this happening.

02:32:27.310 --> 02:32:27.931
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

02:32:27.951 --> 02:32:33.422
[SPEAKER_10]: And it says, you know, Atari, of course, has responded back saying, unfortunately, no official word from Atari.

02:32:33.442 --> 02:32:35.125
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let this stay a rumor for now.

02:32:35.626 --> 02:32:37.891
[SPEAKER_10]: So announcement at E3, basically.

02:32:40.199 --> 02:32:47.103
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a new Shining Force game coming out from Sega, although you may not guess what platform it's actually coming out on.

02:32:47.343 --> 02:32:49.024
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually being brought to the arcade.

02:32:49.864 --> 02:32:52.426
[SPEAKER_10]: Shining Force Cross is the brand new game.

02:32:52.486 --> 02:32:58.809
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be an RPG-oriented game, but it is more a turn-based strategy, I guess.

02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:01.531
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird, though.

02:33:01.551 --> 02:33:07.494
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually played on cabinets linked via Sega's all.net platform.

02:33:08.314 --> 02:33:08.454
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

02:33:10.378 --> 02:33:12.613
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it's only in Japan, so that kind of sucks.

02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:24.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, then also, uh, the first round of songs picked for, um, Guitar Hero Smash Hits have been announced, and these were all based on, uh, people's votes, um, the first round that they've had.

02:33:24.603 --> 02:33:26.064
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just say, though, who cares?

02:33:26.144 --> 02:33:26.744
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck this game.

02:33:26.984 --> 02:33:29.145
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is just the further milking of the franchise.

02:33:29.245 --> 02:33:33.186
[SPEAKER_11]: Not, I'm not saying that to you personally, Loki, but just, when I read the story, I just rolled my eyes.

02:33:33.246 --> 02:33:41.369
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, God, I understand, you know, these games, these songs are being re-released with the full band and what have you, but my God, it's just like...

02:33:42.689 --> 02:33:43.990
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear them money sucking?

02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:45.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the masses.

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:47.831
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to kill music games right here.

02:33:48.811 --> 02:33:50.251
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to know, here you go.

02:33:50.612 --> 02:33:52.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and they're all from Guitar Hero 1.

02:33:53.212 --> 02:33:55.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Pantera's Cowboys from Hell, the live version.

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:58.934
[SPEAKER_10]: Franz Ferdinand, Take Me Out, Queens of the Stone Age, No One Knows.

02:33:59.514 --> 02:34:01.855
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, I Love Rock and Roll.

02:34:01.975 --> 02:34:03.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Boston, More Than a Feelin'.

02:34:03.756 --> 02:34:05.796
[SPEAKER_10]: White Zombie, Thunderkiss 65.

02:34:06.056 --> 02:34:07.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Acer Cult, Godzilla.

02:34:08.037 --> 02:34:09.998
[SPEAKER_10]: Helmet, Unsung, the live version.

02:34:10.258 --> 02:34:11.258
[SPEAKER_10]: Queen, Killer Queen.

02:34:12.018 --> 02:34:33.026
[SPEAKER_10]: Incubus, Stellar, Ozzy Osbourne, Bark at the Moon, Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water The Donnas, Take It Off, and the Xyz, Hey You and of course this game is coming out in June and yeah it is kind of a milk in the franchise and then let's see here and that's all I've got right now

02:34:34.494 --> 02:34:37.476
[SPEAKER_11]: ExciteBots, Trick Racing, Hell Yeah Candy, More Candy, Need More Candy

02:35:01.974 --> 02:35:02.695
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:35:20.573 --> 02:35:22.274
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, just tell two friends about the show.

02:35:22.334 --> 02:35:22.975
[SPEAKER_11]: It's word of mouth.

02:35:23.015 --> 02:35:24.216
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of mouth helps get it out there.

02:35:24.636 --> 02:35:26.237
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we've ever asked for the past few years.

02:35:26.277 --> 02:35:27.258
[SPEAKER_11]: So just help us spread the word.

02:35:27.298 --> 02:35:28.298
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell two people about the show.

02:35:28.719 --> 02:35:30.160
[SPEAKER_11]: Leave us nice reviews on iTunes.

02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:33.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw a MySpace bulletin of somebody advertising the show earlier.

02:35:33.942 --> 02:35:34.763
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was really cool.

02:35:35.543 --> 02:35:37.404
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, stuff like that really means a lot to us.

02:35:37.484 --> 02:35:38.265
[SPEAKER_11]: Really appreciate that.

02:35:38.745 --> 02:35:39.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much.

02:35:39.966 --> 02:35:41.227
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll see you again next week.

02:35:41.627 --> 02:35:42.508
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura will be back.

02:35:42.548 --> 02:35:43.548
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have more to talk about.

02:35:43.949 --> 02:35:45.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki might have another game to look at here.

02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:49.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he can pry Excitebots away from the wife long enough to a show here on JustinTV.

02:35:49.933 --> 02:35:50.253
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

02:35:51.294 --> 02:35:53.257
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll do it all again next week here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:35:53.297 --> 02:35:54.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks you guys for tuning in.

02:35:54.238 --> 02:35:54.899
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next week.

02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.240
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week!

02:36:26.712 --> 02:36:27.876
Thanks for watching!
