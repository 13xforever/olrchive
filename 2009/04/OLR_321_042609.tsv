0	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco, here!
14000	16000	Tonight, April 26, 2009.
16000	19000	Could a popular MMO be coming to the iPhone?
19000	22000	Microsoft promises a barrage of games for Japan.
22000	27000	And the first details are announced for PAX 2009.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	44000	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
44000	49000	Leading in through the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, welcome back, DarkSakura.
49000	50000	Jamie Summers.
50000	51000	Hi.
51000	52000	How are you?
52000	53000	I left my lungs at Disneyland.
53000	54000	Yeah, how was Disneyland?
54000	55000	Oh my god!
55000	56000	It was Disneyland, right?
56000	60000	Oh, it was fun, and they have a new game, which I will touch on in my gaming week.
60000	64000	I think I might know what you're talking about, so I won't talk about it too, but it's the same one I remember.
64000	65000	Oh my god!
65000	67000	Alright, and also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
67000	70000	He was picking off pickles off of his double cheeseburger.
70000	74000	Why, are you not a pickle fan? Did you specifically ask no pickles and they gave you a different one?
74000	77000	Oh, I never do, because then that means they have to take longer.
77000	79000	Oh, I see. So you just pick them off?
79000	80000	Yes.
80000	82000	Interesting. I kind of do the same thing with tomatoes, actually.
82000	88000	Alright, and hello to you. How was your week? Everything good?
88000	89000	It was busy.
89000	90000	Yeah?
90000	91000	Yeah.
91000	93000	Alright, and joining us in the studio tonight, we have some special guests with us tonight.
93000	95000	Say hello to the doctor.
95000	97000	I'm the doctor.
97000	100000	How are you? How have you been? You've been a little while since you've been here.
100000	103000	It's been like a couple weeks, but yeah, I'm doing really good.
103000	104000	Woo!
104000	107000	A couple weeks is a long time, and Rice Princess is here too.
107000	110000	I don't think I can get the mic all the way over there, but say hello to Rice Princess is here.
110000	111000	Hi.
111000	113000	I don't know if you can hear that at all.
113000	117000	They are controlling the game that's playing right now on our Justin TV feed.
117000	120000	We don't have a new game, which is a little erratic tonight.
120000	123000	I apologize, guys. It's running off of Wi-Fi, so it's a little bit eh.
123000	128000	But they are playing right now Rescue Rangers on the 8-bit Nintendo.
128000	131000	Since we didn't have anything new to show tonight, we decided to have an old school night.
131000	134000	They are not. They're playing it on the Dreamcast.
134000	140000	Well, yeah, they're playing it so that they can switch to other games if they want to play something else really easy.
140000	143000	Loki was not able to bring Excitebots tonight, which we were hoping to look at.
143000	145000	What happened, Loki?
145000	148000	Well, I knew. I wasn't going to take it away from my wife.
148000	152000	She's been playing it constantly, so, you know, she'd be pissed off.
152000	154000	So it's past the wife test?
154000	155000	Yes, it's past the wife test.
155000	158000	All right, well, we'll hear a little more about your gaming week in just a little bit.
158000	160000	But let's get into it. How was your gaming week?
160000	162000	We'll start off with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?
162000	165000	I actually didn't play much of anything because of, you know, school.
165000	174000	But I did go to Disneyland, and I played, I'm going to call this a video game,
174000	180000	because really it's sort of like a midway game meets a video game,
180000	185000	was the new Toy Story ride over at California Adventure.
185000	188000	It's so much fun. I went on that one. I went March, yes.
188000	191000	Okay, now I have to lead up to this.
191000	196000	I was convinced, well, I had said the next time I go to Disneyland,
196000	199000	I was going to go on Tower of Terror.
199000	204000	And I sat between Tiara and Marissa,
204000	209000	and Marissa kept saying that I would like, that I would be okay on the drops
209000	212000	and that the part that would scare me would be the lead up.
212000	216000	Well, the lead up was the fun part, and the drop freaked me the hell out,
216000	218000	to the point that the only thing I could say on the entire ride was,
218000	223000	I'm not doing this again, or I hate this, or something like that.
223000	225000	And then I didn't make any more noise until I was off of it
225000	227000	and almost throwing up when I got outside.
227000	231000	Because I will tell everybody right now, my fear is falling.
231000	235000	Not high places, not motion, it's falling.
235000	237000	The Tower of Terror is really freaking scary.
237000	240000	I have been in an elevator when it fell two feet before,
240000	243000	so no, Jamie doesn't do this.
243000	246000	So I was actually so freaked out that I was actually going to go on
246000	253000	California Screamin', and I was actually relieved when the line was closed.
253000	256000	And, by the way, I want to give a shout out to Pete and Jasmine,
256000	259000	who hung out with us and were really awesome while we were there.
259000	261000	But, okay, back now to the story.
261000	262000	So they're like, let's go on Toy Story.
262000	264000	They're like, okay, let's go on Toy Story.
264000	267000	So Toy Story, it's like you wear 3D glasses,
267000	269000	like the same kinds you wear at the Muppet Show thing.
269000	273000	And then you stop in front of these screens, and you have these guns
273000	277000	that are the pop gun that you pull the big string on over and over again,
277000	283000	and you fire out 3D ammunition at targets on the screen.
283000	285000	You're basically having to flick your wrist back and forth
285000	286000	as fast as possible to pull the string.
286000	287000	So men are better at it.
287000	289000	Yeah, men have a distinct advantage at this game.
289000	290000	I made a good score.
290000	292000	Actually, I've got my score because I wrote it.
292000	293000	I took a picture of my score.
293000	295000	Are you really good at flicking your wrist back and forth real quick?
295000	299000	Well, you know, I am married.
299000	301000	But what kind of games are you playing with?
301000	304000	Like I remember there was like a ring toss game and a pop-up balloon.
304000	307000	I love the army men game where you have to shoot down the army men
307000	308000	as they jump out.
308000	310000	But there's also the pie toss.
310000	313000	There's just shooting plates.
313000	315000	The plate one was fun, except the ride stopped,
315000	317000	so we were shooting plates for zero points.
317000	319000	I was practicing my aim.
319000	321000	And it was just really cool.
321000	324000	There were all sorts of little mini games to do on it.
324000	330000	But my score for the first time playing it was 114,400.
330000	333000	And on top of that, you know what my animal was?
333000	335000	It was a beaver.
335000	337000	And as Game Guru says in the chat,
337000	339000	they're putting it out on the Wii as a Wii game.
339000	340000	Are they?
340000	341000	Yes.
341000	342000	And it will be in 3D.
342000	343000	Dude, yes.
343000	345000	That's kind of awesome, I have to say.
345000	346000	But I have to tell you, Rob,
346000	349000	did you notice this when you came out of the ride?
349000	350000	What is it?
350000	353000	When you walk out of the ride, if you look to the left
353000	356000	where the little desk and everything is and the room setting,
356000	359000	it shows the cutout box.
359000	362000	That's the ride that you're on.
362000	365000	It's like a paper box you set up in Inside Midway.
365000	368000	And if you look at the wallpaper that's inside the ride,
368000	370000	it's got little tabs and stuff
370000	372000	and instructions for where you stick everything,
372000	375000	like old paper doll houses.
375000	379000	It's an old Midway ride, like a child's Midway ride.
379000	380000	It's pretty cool.
380000	382000	Yeah, it was a great ride.
382000	385000	So real-life gaming, basically, this week.
385000	387000	So it was a lot of fun.
387000	391000	And then I came back and real-life intruded itself.
391000	394000	Loki did mention the chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com,
394000	396000	if you want to join us live for this chat.
396000	398000	And of course, there was that comment from Game Guru earlier.
398000	399000	Also, DarkTetsuya,
399000	402000	I still want that Mr. Toad's Wild Ride racing game.
402000	403000	That would be pretty awesome.
403000	405000	Only if you go to hell.
405000	406000	SSJ100Matt says...
406000	409000	I mean, in the game, not you go to hell.
409000	412000	How dare you tell our listeners to go to hell, DarkSakura?
412000	414000	You're gone for a week and you think you run the world.
414000	415000	I do.
415000	419000	SSJ100Matt says they need to have a Rad Racer remake that's 3D.
419000	421000	Just like the first one.
421000	423000	Alright, so DarkSakura played Disneyland for a gaming week.
423000	425000	How was your gaming week, Loki?
425000	428000	I played lots of Excitebots trick racing.
428000	431000	In fact, I finished the Excite race mode,
431000	433000	and now I'm in Super Excite race mode.
433000	436000	And it's really...
436000	439000	Well, it's about as hard as the first game.
439000	442000	Now, the game is really awesome itself,
442000	445000	but I don't care for some of their changes that they made.
445000	448000	Like, they have these stunt bars, basically,
448000	451000	that you have to grab and you can swing around.
451000	454000	They're gold ones that you swing around a few times
454000	456000	and then you just launch off and you get stars.
456000	458000	And then every track has a red bar
458000	461000	that you have to swing around and spin ten times.
461000	463000	And I guess they're kind of neat,
463000	465000	you know, to keep with the whole trick racing thing,
465000	467000	but I think it should be optional because
467000	469000	the red bar kind of breaks up the whole race.
469000	471000	You're going really fast, really fast,
471000	474000	and then you go swing around this stupid bar ten times
474000	476000	and then you boost off of it again.
476000	479000	I don't know, it's just a minor annoyance.
479000	481000	But other than that, the game's pretty fun.
481000	484000	If you're a fan of Excite Truck, you're going to love this game.
484000	486000	Definitely the way to go.
486000	489000	They have all the original tracks, actually,
489000	492000	from the old Excite Truck game in this one,
492000	494000	except they're kind of tweaked a little bit.
494000	496000	But all the original tracks are in there,
496000	499000	and plus they have a bunch of new ones.
499000	503000	And also, what was I going to say,
503000	505000	no support, unfortunately, for custom music,
505000	507000	which kind of sucks, but the music that's in the game
507000	509000	is not as annoying as the last game.
509000	514000	And I don't know, it's pretty hard,
514000	517000	but most of the Excite Truck games,
517000	521000	if you're going to try to actually S-rank the courses,
521000	523000	then yeah, you're going to have to play it a few times
523000	525000	to actually be able to do it perfectly.
525000	528000	But it's fun, lots of air.
528000	532000	Oh, I remember another gripe I had about that.
532000	535000	There's an icon that you can get that looks like a wrench
535000	538000	that puts you into leg mode, as they put it.
538000	540000	And in order to run in leg mode,
540000	542000	you have to shake the controller back and forth.
542000	545000	You kind of have to tilt it like a seesaw.
545000	547000	Well, that's great, except for the fact that you have to
547000	550000	actually use the controller to steer,
550000	553000	so you're kind of going all over the place.
553000	557000	So I don't really agree with the decision to control it that way.
557000	560000	Maybe even tapping A or just shaking the controller
560000	563000	like normal would be cool, but whatever.
563000	566000	That's the way they did it and kind of get over it.
566000	568000	But yeah, the game's really weird.
568000	571000	I made a Super Sandwich, so it's awesome.
571000	574000	Other than that, I played Rhythm Heaven on the DS,
574000	580000	which is definitely a fun music microgame collection,
580000	582000	very similar to the WarioWare stuff
582000	584000	because it's made by the same people.
584000	589000	The thing is, though, is it's very strict on accuracy.
589000	591000	So if you're not accurate in that,
591000	593000	or if you're just a little bit off,
593000	595000	it's going to penalize you big time.
595000	599000	So that kind of sucked, but fun game overall.
599000	603000	The other thing that I played, more Grand Theft Auto,
603000	605000	I was actually messing around with the PC version again,
605000	609000	editing some stuff, and I got cars to bounce into the sky
609000	612000	really far and come down and explode,
612000	614000	so that was kind of fun.
614000	618000	And I downloaded the new download content for Saints Row 2,
618000	620000	so hopefully I can get to play that this week.
620000	626000	And yeah, that's pretty much it, I think, for my gaming week.
626000	628000	All right, sounds pretty good.
628000	632000	Nothing else? Anything you're looking forward to in this next week, Logie?
632000	634000	Nope, not this week.
634000	639000	Nothing coming out really worthwhile, at least.
639000	641000	Basically, yeah, it's just X-Men Origins,
641000	643000	which doesn't look bad.
643000	650000	It's just not something I'd plan on picking up unless I get it for free.
650000	652000	And the other game I was waiting for, unfortunately,
652000	655000	I delayed to the end of next month, so I had to have Fuel,
655000	657000	which was originally supposed to be coming out in two weeks,
657000	660000	but now it's not until four weeks.
660000	662000	All right.
662000	664000	Let's see, we'll get to the Doctor and the Rice Princess
664000	666000	and their gaming weeks momentarily,
666000	667000	except now they're playing what?
667000	668000	You switched guides. You guys have been switching games.
668000	670000	I saw Contra flash by for a minute,
670000	672000	but now you're on, what, Double Dragon 2?
672000	673000	All right, fine.
673000	674000	Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.
674000	675000	It's pretty easy.
675000	678000	I haven't been playing a whole lot this week besides World of Warcraft,
678000	680000	because they had the new patch not that long ago,
680000	682000	so I had to check out Ulduar.
682000	683000	I finally got to check out this week,
683000	684000	although we didn't get very far.
684000	686000	We wiped on Razor Scale,
686000	688000	which is the second boss in there after a couple of attempts,
688000	691000	but I thought the Flame Leviathan fight was a lot of fun.
691000	694000	They've really incorporated vehicles now into the raids,
694000	695000	which is kind of interesting
695000	697000	because the first fight you actually do on the vehicles,
697000	699000	and it's kind of cool because I was driving around on a motorcycle,
699000	702000	and having to pick up the people that were getting launched from the cannons,
702000	706000	yes, you can launch yourself from a cannon onto the back of the boss to fight it,
706000	707000	and then the boss throws you off,
707000	709000	and you have to get picked up in a motorcycle
709000	710000	and get carried back to the cannon.
710000	711000	So it's really intricate.
711000	714000	It's kind of neat what they've done in Warcraft with this,
714000	717000	although I can say that, but at the same time say,
717000	720000	I don't know, I wish this boss wasn't a mandatory boss
720000	722000	because the lead up to it with the vehicle stuff
722000	725000	that takes about 20, 30 minutes to get through is kind of annoying.
725000	727000	I would only want to do that once.
727000	730000	I would want to have to do the clear every time to get to Flame Leviathan.
730000	733000	I think that's going to get annoying, but okay, whatevs.
733000	736000	I've also been leveling an alt, so it's been a pretty wildtastic week.
736000	739000	I haven't really been touching the consoles that much.
739000	740000	I played a little bit of Outrun,
740000	743000	but not enough for me to say a whole lot about it besides,
743000	747000	thankfully there's a cartoon arcade-style racing game on Xbox 360
747000	750000	I enjoy right now because pretty much all we've had otherwise
750000	754000	is more realistic type of racing games, and that's really it.
754000	755000	There hasn't been a whole lot otherwise.
755000	758000	Rock Band 2, I've been playing a lot of Rock Band still.
758000	760000	That game's getting a lot of value even today.
760000	762000	So that's really it for my gaming week.
762000	764000	The Doctor, Rice Princess,
764000	766000	anything you guys have been playing in your gaming week
766000	768000	besides what you're doing right now? The Doctor?
768000	771000	No, not really. I've been making movies.
771000	773000	You've been making movies, dirty movies?
773000	775000	Of course dirty movies.
775000	777000	So nothing that you've been really playing lately.
777000	778000	I know you're a big Nintendo fanboy.
778000	781000	Is there anything you're looking forward to on the Wii?
781000	783000	Definitely the Wii Motion Plus.
783000	785000	All right. Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
785000	786000	What have you been up to?
786000	788000	Playing well.
788000	790000	How's your Warcraft week going?
790000	793000	It's Noble Garden, so that's it.
793000	795000	That's right, there's a new holiday.
795000	797000	This is a new holiday in World of Warcraft, right?
797000	798000	What do you do in the Noble Garden event?
798000	800000	Explain to our listeners Rice Princess.
800000	802000	Put the damn game on pause.
802000	805000	It's the Easter stuff that they couldn't update in time
805000	808000	or something, I don't remember.
808000	810000	All right, she's busy playing Double Dragon.
810000	813000	All right, you go around and you hunt for eggs.
813000	814000	I kind of thought it was stupid.
814000	815000	I played it for about five minutes.
815000	816000	I thought it was stupid.
816000	818000	You're full of crap.
818000	820000	Why are you saying I'm full of crap?
820000	824000	All right, Rice Princess is screaming at me.
824000	825000	She has no microphone.
825000	826000	There you go.
826000	829000	All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here in just a moment.
829000	832000	Again, if you want to join us live, chat.orangeontrader.com
832000	833000	is the place to be.
833000	835000	You can also follow us on Twitter at OLR,
835000	838000	and we're looking at your tweets during the show.
838000	841000	And thanks to you guys who have been saying stuff
841000	843000	to kind of help plug the show.
843000	845000	I saw some retweets from Act Deaf and Gold Anthro.
845000	849000	Thank you guys very much over on Twitter.
849000	851000	Also, housekeeping, housekeeping.
851000	852000	We have a lot of housekeeping tonight.
852000	853000	I'm very excited.
853000	855000	In a couple weeks, I will be in Chicago.
855000	859000	I am going to Anime Central, ASEN for short.
859000	860000	I'm going to this convention,
860000	866000	and I will be doing a panel Friday at 4.30 in panel room 7?
866000	868000	Consult your program.
868000	870000	So You Think You Can Podcast is the name of the panel,
870000	873000	and I'll be talking about my seven years of experience
873000	875000	that I have in internet broadcasting
875000	878000	and talking about how Orange Launch Radio started as a podcast
878000	880000	and what you can do if you're curious about starting a podcast
880000	883000	or maintaining a podcast or selling your podcast, et cetera, et cetera.
883000	885000	So I'm really excited to be there.
885000	888000	I know we have a lot of listeners in that kind of area around Chicago
888000	890000	and the Midwest that go to this convention,
890000	892000	so I'm excited to finally meet a lot of you.
892000	895000	So please come to the panel if you're going to be there Friday at 4.30,
895000	897000	Anime Central.
897000	899000	Also, next week on the program,
899000	902000	you heard us tease this a little bit last week,
902000	904000	but next week on the program,
904000	907000	we're very excited because we're going to be giving away...
909000	911000	That's right, that's Smile DK.
911000	913000	We have an autographed copy
913000	916000	of one of the Dance Dance Revolution games on,
916000	918000	I believe it's Supernova 2,
918000	920000	Dance Dance Revolution, autographed by Smile DK
920000	922000	that we're giving away on the show next week.
922000	924000	So that should be pretty awesome.
924000	927000	Live or podcast, either way.
927000	929000	So you can listen to that and win it live.
929000	931000	It was signed at SakuraCon.
931000	934000	Thanks to the awesome breast lol for getting that for us.
934000	938000	So next week on the show, if you want to tune in live or in podcast form,
938000	940000	and I'll give you more details next week,
940000	942000	you'll have two weeks to do it.
942000	943000	Question from chat.
943000	945000	Will you be recording the panel at ASEN?
945000	947000	If I can.
947000	950000	It's not really about Orange Lounge Radio, though,
950000	955000	so I don't know if we'll put it on the podcast feed if we can do it,
955000	956000	but maybe like a bonus thing.
956000	958000	I would love to tape it if we can.
958000	960000	If nothing else, I'll have someone videotape it,
960000	961000	and I can dump the audio or something.
961000	963000	We'll figure something out.
963000	964000	Also, I want to say this.
964000	967000	This is very, very, very, very, very, very, very important.
967000	970000	I want to say a huge thank you to all the listeners.
970000	973000	I don't know if everybody in studio saw,
973000	977000	but there is a bunch of boxes sitting in the house.
977000	980000	There's a new used computer.
980000	981000	What do I mean by new used?
981000	982000	It's a refurbed computer.
982000	984000	The listeners pulled together money.
984000	987000	I don't know if you remember our meltdown on air two weeks ago
987000	989000	when everything broke, but the listeners pulled together
989000	991000	and got us a new computer that we can use for the show.
991000	992000	Sweet.
992000	993000	That's very, very exciting.
993000	995000	We weren't able to put it all together for tonight.
995000	996000	Thank you, guys.
996000	999000	Yeah, I mean, obviously, huge, huge amounts of thanks.
999000	1002000	Obviously, with us having probably a little break in a couple weeks
1002000	1005000	with me being off in the Midwest,
1005000	1007000	we'll probably have a lot of time to put that together
1007000	1008000	and get it up and running
1008000	1010000	and hopefully have some fun new stuff for the show.
1010000	1012000	So thank you, guys, so much for that.
1012000	1015000	That's very exciting, very, very exciting.
1015000	1017000	Yeah, now I feel like I have to get naked or something.
1017000	1018000	No, I'm kidding.
1018000	1019000	All right.
1019000	1020000	Thank you for everyone.
1020000	1021000	Let's see.
1021000	1024000	Actually, they say it's all new parts in chat.
1024000	1025000	I'm going to be honest.
1025000	1027000	I haven't cracked open the boxes.
1027000	1028000	I've just got them all,
1028000	1030000	so I don't really know what we do and we don't have yet.
1030000	1034000	I just know it's computer bits, and the whole computer is there,
1034000	1036000	so I want to say thanks again, everybody.
1036000	1038000	All right.
1038000	1039000	Let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1039000	1041000	I don't think there's anything else, really.
1041000	1043000	You follow us on Facebook, MySpace.
1043000	1044000	Does anyone use MySpace anymore?
1044000	1045000	Anyone?
1045000	1046000	I don't think so.
1046000	1047000	Stalkers.
1047000	1049000	Well, if you're there, you can get us on Orange Lounge Radio there.
1049000	1052000	But we're not on Craigslist because that's where the murderers are.
1052000	1055000	That's the one social site that we're not on is Craigslist.
1055000	1056000	I don't know.
1056000	1058000	Maybe we should have an O.L. Army on Craigslist.
1058000	1062000	I bought my first Xbox 360 in Craigslist.
1062000	1064000	Oh, okay.
1064000	1066000	But didn't you have to pay a huge markup for that?
1066000	1067000	Yes.
1067000	1069000	Nice.
1069000	1073000	Also, one other announcement I know that needs to be made
1073000	1075000	before we get into tonight's gaming news.
1075000	1077000	Loki mentioned something on his Twitter this week,
1077000	1080000	and I'm not sure if all the listeners got an opportunity to see this
1080000	1082000	because not all the listeners are on Twitter.
1082000	1085000	Why don't you share what your announcement is, Loki?
1085000	1089000	Well, my announcement is that my wife is pregnant with twins.
1089000	1091000	Congratulations.
1091000	1093000	Wow, that's pretty amazing.
1093000	1095000	So, December.
1095000	1096000	We're on Hanukkah.
1096000	1099000	Well, actually, because it's twins.
1099000	1103000	Twins are usually delivered earlier, so Hanukkah, Thanksgiving-ish.
1103000	1105000	Wow.
1105000	1106000	Well, congratulations.
1106000	1107000	That's so awesome.
1107000	1110000	And obviously the show will continue.
1110000	1111000	Get her a doula.
1111000	1113000	The show will continue, you guys.
1113000	1116000	Even if Loki's going to be out for a little while, we'll figure something out.
1116000	1118000	No, I was thinking Skyping it or something,
1118000	1122000	because obviously I'm not going to leave my wife home alone with two kids
1122000	1126000	by herself for the first few weeks or so.
1126000	1127000	We will figure something out.
1127000	1129000	We've got plenty of time to figure it out.
1129000	1131000	I'm going to leave my husband alone with my kid.
1131000	1133000	It's not even a worry right now.
1133000	1135000	Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
1135000	1138000	I'm not planning on going anywhere.
1138000	1141000	And the other thing, too, is we're going to be getting a house, actually.
1141000	1142000	Oh, my gosh.
1142000	1144000	We've already had our offer accepted.
1144000	1150000	We did the walk-through on yesterday, and it looked good.
1150000	1152000	So we're assuming.
1152000	1154000	I don't think anything's going to go wrong,
1154000	1157000	because we know what condition the roof is in, basically.
1157000	1161000	So probably, yeah, we'll be probably moving into a house by the end of next month.
1161000	1163000	Oh, my gosh, I didn't know the house was that far along.
1163000	1165000	Well, that's great, especially with twins on the way.
1165000	1166000	Yes, definitely.
1166000	1169000	And I've never known anyone that had twins, so that's kind of fun.
1169000	1171000	That's fertility drugs for you.
1171000	1176000	Small word of advice, check your pipes in the house.
1176000	1178000	Well, we have an inspector.
1178000	1182000	And Nellie should check her lady pipes, too, for the twins.
1182000	1185000	Comments, of course, lots and lots of congrats in our chat room.
1185000	1186000	You're in there, Loki.
1186000	1188000	I won't read them all for you, but some of the funnier ones.
1188000	1192000	Amaze Satsuma says, Loki is about to have eight crazy nights.
1192000	1194000	I think there's going to be more than eight of those.
1194000	1197000	Frisbee says you should try and make it happen on the 20th of November.
1197000	1198000	Lol.
1198000	1200000	Can I say the names?
1200000	1202000	The babies will come out when they come out.
1202000	1203000	I don't know.
1203000	1206000	Nellie doesn't want to do the one anymore.
1206000	1210000	Originally, she was really fond of the name Max.
1210000	1212000	And I was like, OK, that's cool.
1212000	1215000	I'm all, how about naming the other one Sam?
1215000	1216000	And she's like, OK.
1216000	1218000	I was like, Sam, Max, sweet.
1218000	1222000	If you name your twins Sam and Max, I'm going to laugh for a week.
1222000	1225000	I might literally die of laughter if you name the twins Sam and Max.
1225000	1231000	She doesn't want to name the one Max because she doesn't want to name the baby.
1231000	1233000	Actually, Max has to be the longer version of the name.
1233000	1236000	And Maximilian, you know, that would be kind of...
1236000	1238000	You don't know if they're going to be boys or girls yet, do you?
1238000	1239000	No, we don't know.
1239000	1241000	So it could be Maxine and Samantha.
1241000	1242000	Yeah.
1242000	1243000	That would be cool.
1243000	1246000	We don't know.
1246000	1250000	Yeah, we're not going to know what the sex of the babies are for a few months.
1250000	1252000	Because she's only like eight weeks along right now.
1252000	1253000	Right, right.
1253000	1255000	We know early because...
1255000	1257000	Actually, we didn't know it was going to be twins until last week.
1257000	1261000	Because we had to go in because she had cramping in her side or whatever.
1261000	1263000	And so she wanted to make sure everything was OK.
1263000	1266000	And so they did ultrasounds and stuff.
1266000	1267000	And they saw...
1267000	1269000	First, you know, the woman didn't see any heartbeats at all.
1269000	1271000	And then they found one.
1271000	1273000	And then we went to radiology.
1273000	1274000	And then they found a second one.
1274000	1276000	They're like, OK, there's two.
1276000	1280000	So, yeah, I mean, it's still a ways off.
1280000	1285000	We actually have our first real doctor's visit in two weeks.
1285000	1288000	So we get to see them slightly more growing up, I guess.
1288000	1290000	But, yeah, not until...
1290000	1292000	But remember, there's still tadpoles.
1292000	1294000	Not until, like, you know, August or so.
1294000	1296000	We know the sex of them.
1296000	1298000	We're going to find out for sure.
1298000	1300000	Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room says,
1300000	1302000	Sam and Max would be better than Ratchet and Clank as names.
1302000	1303000	So there you go.
1303000	1304000	That's true.
1304000	1307000	And, chat, he is not really going to name them Sam and Max
1307000	1312000	just to get a goddamn gift from the makers of the game, OK?
1312000	1313000	I wonder, though, if I...
1313000	1315000	These are children you're talking about.
1315000	1318000	When I have mine, if I name it Richter or Annette,
1318000	1320000	if Konami would give me a present.
1320000	1323000	Yeah, she really will name the damn kid Richter.
1323000	1324000	Konami will give you a present, all right.
1324000	1326000	They'll sue you.
1326000	1329000	Dan and I decided, like, ten years ago,
1329000	1331000	before I ever even thought of wanting children,
1331000	1332000	that if we had a boy, his name was Richter.
1332000	1334000	No, she, OK, she keeps...
1334000	1336000	My wife keeps suggesting the name Mason.
1336000	1338000	And I'm like, Mason is a stupid name.
1338000	1339000	I have a friend named Mason.
1339000	1341000	Mason's my little brother-in-law's name.
1341000	1343000	God, everybody names their kids Mason.
1343000	1346000	Wait a minute, he might actually listen to this show, you ass.
1346000	1349000	I'm sorry, it's a horrible name.
1349000	1351000	And no, Mario doesn't work because we're not Italian, so...
1351000	1352000	All right.
1352000	1353000	We'll figure out names later.
1353000	1356000	You know what's funny is that I have toyed around
1356000	1358000	the idea of naming a boy Strider,
1358000	1360000	but it has nothing to do with the game, I swear to God.
1360000	1362000	It's just a name I like.
1362000	1364000	Not from, oh, forget it.
1364000	1367000	All right, we need to stop naming children after video games.
1367000	1370000	Let's get on to the gaming news.
1370000	1372000	God, we're like 20 minutes into the show,
1372000	1374000	I haven't touched on a lick of gaming news.
1374000	1376000	Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.
1376000	1378000	Yes, there's more drama going on with the whole
1378000	1381000	Scratch the Ultimate DJ game.
1381000	1386000	First, Scratch actually was awarded their restraining order
1386000	1391000	against Seven Studios, and Seven Studios was basically
1391000	1395000	told to give back the controllers that they had been
1395000	1398000	holding hostage, I guess, and also all the development
1398000	1401000	materials and that kind of stuff.
1401000	1404000	So that's kind of cool victory for Genius there.
1404000	1408000	And then a weird chain event also led to Seven Studios
1408000	1414000	now countersuing, saying that it was actually Genius's fault
1414000	1418000	that they were behind schedule, and it was a...
1418000	1420000	I don't know, they had put them back several months
1420000	1424000	because they couldn't get licensed music,
1424000	1426000	or they couldn't provide licensed music for the game
1426000	1430000	and not obtain publishing approval.
1430000	1434000	So, I don't know, and apparently the game is still not
1434000	1436000	cleared for launch on the PS3 according to them.
1436000	1439000	So we'll find out what happens there.
1439000	1441000	I'm sure this is not going to be going away anytime soon,
1441000	1443000	which is very disappointing because I have a feeling
1443000	1445000	this is going to delay the release of this game
1445000	1448000	if it even comes out anymore now.
1448000	1453000	And I'm sure DJ Hero will not be affected by this at all.
1453000	1454000	Oh well.
1454000	1457000	Yes, because DJ Hero is being put out by the bigger company,
1457000	1460000	so regardless of quality, it will come out regardless.
1460000	1464000	And regardless of whether they find Activision accountable
1464000	1467000	for any wrongdoing whatsoever, it's still...
1467000	1470000	They have oodles of money to pay off any lawsuits
1470000	1472000	that could possibly happen.
1472000	1474000	They basically get what they're hinting at
1474000	1477000	they're trying to get.
1477000	1479000	Because at least I figured, hey, Scratch might not be
1479000	1482000	the more popular game, but at least if it's out first,
1482000	1484000	it has a fair chance.
1484000	1486000	But now it's like, I don't know.
1486000	1490000	I still think it'll do okay, but I'm wondering if we see
1490000	1493000	anything called DJ Revolution or something coming out.
1493000	1496000	That's going to be crap.
1496000	1499000	Come on, Konami, don't disappoint me.
1499000	1503000	Alright, well, I guess we'll see what further develops of this.
1503000	1505000	I'm sure to be continued, there's plenty more to have
1505000	1507000	on counter suits, appeals, et cetera, et cetera.
1507000	1509000	I've seen the controller, it looks awesome.
1509000	1512000	Of course, it's not done, but it looks awesome.
1512000	1515000	Alright, well, kind of going on a completely different note,
1515000	1517000	obviously we were talking about Warcraft a little bit
1517000	1518000	in the opening of the show tonight.
1518000	1521000	This is interesting, there's rumors going around the internet
1521000	1524000	about a World of Warcraft app on the iPhone.
1524000	1527000	Apparently, somebody had ported Second Life to iPhone
1527000	1529000	a little while ago, and now apparently there's this little movie
1529000	1532000	circulating around the internet that actually shows
1532000	1536000	a jailbroken iPhone that is running World of Warcraft.
1536000	1538000	Kind of interesting.
1538000	1541000	And there's kind of this no comment going on
1541000	1543000	when asked if it's officially or whatever,
1543000	1546000	that the company is apparently negotiating with Activision,
1546000	1548000	et cetera, et cetera, to try and get this going.
1548000	1550000	I think this is kind of a load of crap.
1550000	1552000	I don't think Warcraft, I mean,
1552000	1554000	I think people are kind of jumping to conclusions.
1554000	1555000	They see this and they assume,
1555000	1557000	oh, Warcraft must be on its way for the iPhone.
1557000	1559000	Come on, how stupid would Warcraft be on the iPhone?
1559000	1561000	You can't take a game like World of Warcraft
1561000	1563000	and put it on the small scale of the iPhone.
1563000	1564000	You can't.
1564000	1565000	You could.
1565000	1567000	Okay, but you could in the same way,
1567000	1570000	you could install Linux on a toaster to say you did it.
1570000	1572000	That's it, but why?
1572000	1573000	Not necessarily.
1573000	1575000	Basically what you'd do is you'd create a specific version
1575000	1577000	of the game for the iPhone.
1577000	1578000	It would still be the same game,
1578000	1580000	but the models would be a lot lower res.
1580000	1585000	So when it shows a model for whatever,
1585000	1587000	Dark Elf or something, it's going to look different.
1587000	1589000	Here's what I think they should do.
1589000	1590000	If they're going to have to do anything with this,
1590000	1592000	what they should do is they should go,
1592000	1593000	you got to go all the way back to,
1593000	1594000	I don't know if you remember,
1594000	1596000	Final Fantasy VIII on the PlayStation.
1596000	1599000	If you had that little thing that was only out in Japan,
1599000	1600000	and I forget the name of it,
1600000	1602000	but they had, that's it, PocketStation,
1602000	1604000	you could link with the PlayStation.
1604000	1607000	You could raise your chocobo on the PocketStation,
1607000	1610000	and then that would affect some chocobos that you had in game.
1610000	1613000	Maybe something like that where you have a spinoff game
1613000	1616000	where, I don't know, you do something in it
1616000	1618000	and it affects your character.
1618000	1621000	You can get loot that you can actually use in the game,
1621000	1624000	or enchantments or something that you can actually use in the game.
1624000	1627000	Something to enhance the World of Warcraft game
1627000	1628000	without throwing off the balance.
1628000	1632000	It wouldn't work because someone would hack it to be able to do that,
1632000	1635000	to automatically give them a lot of whatever it is.
1635000	1637000	Then they wouldn't necessarily be like,
1637000	1640000	maybe like new pets or new mounts
1640000	1642000	and things that are not going to throw off the balance of World of Warcraft.
1642000	1645000	The best part about the chocobo game and Final Fantasy VIII on the PocketStation,
1645000	1648000	because I actually owned a PocketStation for a while,
1648000	1651000	I still have it somewhere. I don't even know where it is.
1651000	1654000	Rice Princess and the Doctor right now are playing 8-bit Nintendo
1654000	1656000	through a Dreamcast emulator.
1656000	1658000	Dreamcast, the VMUs, that was huge.
1658000	1661000	They had little games that you could do on the VMUs exclusively.
1661000	1663000	With the PocketStation though, the best part about it was
1663000	1665000	is the game would play itself.
1665000	1668000	If you turned on a PlayStation and just let it sit there for five days or whatever,
1668000	1672000	just let it plug in so that it wouldn't turn off,
1672000	1677000	you'd come back and you'd have all this loot. It'd just be there. Done.
1677000	1680000	So I don't know. They'd have to be very careful with the balance of the game,
1680000	1685000	but it's not like Blizzard's never made major changes to their game.
1685000	1687000	Second Life, I mean...
1687000	1690000	I could see something with vehicular combat, like on the iPhone,
1690000	1692000	like a little side game, but I don't know.
1692000	1696000	I don't know. I believe it's not like a hoax or anything, I don't think,
1696000	1701000	because they're not showing that it's awesome framerate or anything like that.
1701000	1706000	But I could see if they could port it to the iPhone, I think it'd be pretty big,
1706000	1711000	because definitely portable World of Warcraft would be awesome for somebody, I'm sure.
1711000	1714000	I think there's no point, you know what I mean?
1714000	1717000	You can't party, you can't group.
1717000	1720000	It would just be slow, it would be clunky.
1720000	1723000	I think it would devalue Warcraft.
1723000	1726000	I think it would devalue World of Warcraft to put out a subpar game on the iPhone.
1726000	1731000	But that's why you would have to not necessarily make it look worse,
1731000	1739000	but dumb down the textures a bit so that you can cram what was in the actual PC game onto this platform.
1739000	1743000	That way you wouldn't have all the massive lag and that kind of stuff that you would experience.
1743000	1746000	It's just basically more stripped down.
1746000	1748000	I just think it's devaluing Warcraft.
1748000	1751000	If I were to show somebody, like, oh, here's World of Warcraft on my iPhone,
1751000	1754000	somebody's going to look at that and go, this looks like crap, I don't want to play this game.
1754000	1759000	Okay, well the other option is, and I'm not sure if they've actually installed Second Life on there,
1759000	1764000	if it's just streaming it from a PC or something like that and then using this interface to control it.
1764000	1766000	Maybe that's what this is.
1766000	1770000	Or maybe they should just stick with the mobile authenticator and that's it.
1770000	1773000	That's a good use of the iPhone, the mobile authenticator.
1773000	1777000	I heard they don't even sell the keychain authenticators anymore in favor of the mobile authenticators.
1777000	1781000	So what I have here on my keychain from BlizzCon that my friends brought me back
1781000	1784000	is going to be a collector's item that I actually use.
1784000	1786000	So, pretty cool.
1786000	1788000	The question being asked, what is an authenticator?
1788000	1791000	It's like, what do they call those, VPNs?
1791000	1793000	Like a lot of companies use them, you have a little thing on your keychain.
1793000	1798000	You press this button, it generates a number based on the seed that's on the sticker on the back of your card.
1798000	1801000	And so when you want to log, and that number changes every minute.
1801000	1804000	So it basically uses the seed and the time to generate a number.
1804000	1808000	And if you want to log into WoW, you have to have the keychain with the number.
1808000	1812000	Or somebody can't log in. It helps protect your account from hackers, basically.
1812000	1815000	So, there you go.
1815000	1818000	Looking at comments from chat, Brad from Pod Culture says,
1818000	1820000	Sky, you could have an iPhone app for WoW.
1820000	1824000	Here you do your single player quests and gather loot and or items for your character.
1824000	1828000	I still think it would be a lesser game than what you have on the PC.
1828000	1833000	I mean, I don't know. I mean, granted, okay, you have a lot of iPhone games that are lesser versions.
1833000	1840000	But I mean, Blizzard has resisted porting this game to consoles because they don't want a lesser version of the game.
1840000	1843000	I cannot see that they're going to bend the rule for the freaking iPhone.
1843000	1846000	Let's take a lesser game and put it onto the iPhone.
1846000	1851000	Let's take Ultima Online or something like that and put it on there.
1851000	1854000	I mean, iPhone should be able to handle Ultima Online.
1854000	1859000	Or like, I don't know, Fancy Star Online would be kind of cool.
1859000	1865000	I think there's other things you could do. I just don't think THE World of Warcraft game is going to fit on an iPhone.
1865000	1868000	Let's move on. I think we have more Warcraft news, right, Darksacra?
1868000	1874000	Oh, yes. You addicts. You've been thrown another boom by PopCap.
1874000	1881000	Now, there's a new command in World of Warcraft that I'm sure Rob has used.
1881000	1883000	It's slash peggle.
1883000	1887000	Yes, yes, yes, more yes. This is amazing what has happened this week.
1887000	1889000	It's freaking peggle.
1889000	1896000	Yeah, you type it in and you can play peggle, challenge each other, and have peggle duels.
1896000	1899000	You can have your friends do an enormous battle.
1899000	1902000	You can have a time limit, not a time limit.
1902000	1904000	Also, you can do peggle loot.
1904000	1909000	So you can decide who takes the loot instead of doing the roll command.
1909000	1918000	But you also have World of Warcraft themed backgrounds and points for using a special peggle talent tree.
1918000	1922000	And it's fucking peggle and fucking World of Warcraft.
1922000	1927000	And honestly, just reading about it or hearing about it right now does not do this justice.
1927000	1929000	Like, just how awesome this marriage is.
1929000	1931000	My soul cries.
1931000	1933000	No, I mean, really, you have to see it.
1933000	1938000	I mean, it's like, they really have adapted the game Peggle for free, put it into Warcraft,
1938000	1942000	and they have these all new stages that are based off the WoW levels.
1942000	1948000	They've made this talent tree, which is a WoW thing, but they made it about Peggle.
1948000	1950000	You can do duels through the game.
1950000	1951000	I mean, it's pretty odd.
1951000	1953000	Rice Princess, I know you've been playing the hell out of this.
1953000	1955000	I kicked your ass at a duel the other day.
1955000	1956000	No, you didn't.
1956000	1957000	Yes, I did.
1957000	1958000	Nuh-uh.
1958000	1959000	It wasn't me.
1959000	1960000	I have the screen cap to prove it.
1960000	1961000	No, it wasn't me.
1961000	1962000	Well, all right, tell them about Peggle.
1962000	1963000	It's great.
1963000	1964000	It's really awesome.
1964000	1965000	What do you want me to say?
1965000	1967000	Ew, you're eating clove gum? That's gross.
1967000	1969000	Talk about the game, Rice Princess.
1969000	1970000	No, it's really fun.
1970000	1971000	I love it.
1971000	1973000	Like, I love how the levels are based on...
1973000	1974000	What?
1974000	1975000	What?
1975000	1979000	I love how the levels are based on actual places in WoW.
1979000	1983000	Like, they have the pictures in the background, and all the Peggles are arranged, like, kind
1983000	1985000	of like in the regular Peggle.
1985000	1988000	And by the way, for those that have never played Peggle before, it's like Plinko as
1988000	1989000	a game.
1989000	1990000	Kind of.
1990000	1991000	From The Price is Right, kind of.
1991000	1992000	Yeah.
1992000	1995000	You have to, like, shoot at these little pegs and make them go away, and they bounce on
1995000	1996000	each other and stuff like that.
1996000	2000000	And it sounds like the most mediocre boring game ever, but it's so fun.
2000000	2001000	It's very addicting.
2001000	2003000	You'll spend, like, hours playing it.
2003000	2004000	Trust me.
2004000	2005000	So, yeah.
2005000	2008000	It's really awesome.
2008000	2011000	So, good times.
2011000	2012000	Very good times with this.
2012000	2013000	Totally good times.
2013000	2014000	I mean, just the marriage of two crack games.
2014000	2017000	But what I like about it, like, I'm not going to sign into WoW just to play Peggle, but
2017000	2021000	it's really great, because sometimes, especially, like, I'm leveling an alt right now, so I
2021000	2022000	don't have a mount.
2022000	2025000	I don't have a flying mount or anything like that, so when I'm using the flying taxi system,
2025000	2028000	it takes four minutes to go from one place to another.
2028000	2030000	Peggle's a great distraction to pass the time.
2030000	2031000	And it's integrated into the game.
2031000	2032000	Four whole minutes, Bob.
2032000	2033000	It's great.
2033000	2034000	I know.
2034000	2036000	It takes a long time to fly in WoW when you're low level.
2036000	2037000	It does.
2037000	2038000	Four whole minutes.
2038000	2039000	I know.
2039000	2041000	At least it's not Final Fantasy XI, Christ, where it would take you, like, you didn't
2041000	2046000	even have, like, you had to wait ten minutes for the airship to show up, then you get on
2046000	2051000	the airship, take a ten minute ride, and then it might be remotely near where you're trying
2051000	2052000	to go.
2052000	2055000	Yeah, that's why Final Fantasy XI's ridiculous.
2055000	2056000	I'm sure it's gotten a lot better.
2056000	2057000	It's more realistic, though.
2057000	2061000	I think they have more, uh, yeah, it is more realistic, but I think they have more teleport
2061000	2063000	spells and stuff now to help ease that up.
2063000	2065000	I don't give a crap it's still a crappy game.
2065000	2066000	Alright, shut up.
2066000	2071000	Alright, anyhow, so yes, Peggle is in WoW, and it's, uh, the amazing part is it's free.
2071000	2073000	But what a great thing for PopCap's brand.
2073000	2075000	I mean, everybody's talking about it this week.
2075000	2077000	Everybody's talking about Peg Crack.
2077000	2079000	We got sucked right in just like everybody else.
2079000	2081000	So, there you go.
2081000	2082000	Um, yes.
2082000	2084000	So, something not Peggle-related.
2084000	2089000	Um, but actually, oddly enough, it's something related to what's going on on Justin.TV.
2089000	2090000	The Dreamcast!
2090000	2094000	Yes, uh, Sega isn't making Dreamcasts anymore.
2094000	2096000	However, you can still purchase them.
2096000	2102000	In fact, ThinkGeek is now offering, um, brand new Dreamcasts for $100.
2102000	2104000	$99.99.
2104000	2113000	And, um, yes, and it includes, of course, uh, it's a version 2.0, um, with the web browser version 2.0,
2113000	2116000	including Sega Swirl and a demo disc.
2116000	2119000	And, um, yeah, awesome.
2119000	2121000	Brand new Dreamcast.
2121000	2126000	I remember when I got my Dreamcast, I wanted it at an all-nighter at QZAR.
2126000	2128000	I was like, Dreamcast? I don't want this.
2128000	2132000	But then I got, I got games for it, and I'm like, sweet, it has Power Stone.
2132000	2133000	That's awesome.
2133000	2136000	I didn't even think new Dreamcasts existed anymore.
2136000	2141000	That's the crazy part to me. Like, where did they find new Dreamcasts?
2141000	2142000	Where did they find these?
2142000	2143000	I don't know.
2143000	2144000	Maybe in a warehouse?
2144000	2147000	I guess so. Like, just collecting dust somewhere.
2147000	2151000	I do have to say, though, the article on this is amazing for, uh,
2151000	2156000	showing the last Sega to Sanchiro commercial when the Dreamcast came out.
2156000	2159000	I would really recommend picking up a Dreamcast.
2159000	2163000	If you have some extra money and you want a great system
2163000	2165000	with a lot of homebrew available out there,
2165000	2168000	you know, I realize the legality of some of this stuff is questionable,
2168000	2172000	but, I mean, the Dreamcast is a great, great system.
2172000	2173000	I mean, it has good games anyway.
2173000	2176000	And make yourself a boot disk and you can play in the import.
2176000	2178000	No problem. I mean, they're easy.
2178000	2180000	There's some real classics on Dreamcast.
2180000	2182000	I'm sure many classic games of the week that Dark Soccer has picked
2182000	2183000	have come from there.
2183000	2186000	Uh, Space Channel 5, Sonic Adventure, you know,
2186000	2189000	there's just great, great games on Dreamcast.
2189000	2193000	So, check it out if you don't already have one of these.
2193000	2195000	Um, speaking of old stuff...
2195000	2196000	Oh, they're sold out.
2196000	2198000	Are they all gone?
2198000	2201000	Probably because the blogs all picked up the stories. It's gone.
2201000	2202000	Maybe they'll...
2202000	2204000	Console sold out.
2204000	2206000	Maybe they'll get more in the future.
2206000	2209000	Um, speaking of old retro stuff,
2209000	2214000	old Sierra games, and I'm talking, like, Leisure Suit Larry 1,
2214000	2217000	Police Quest 1, Space Quest 1,
2217000	2222000	apparently there's a new website where you can actually play these games
2222000	2226000	in your browser, but it's kind of cool because the games run in Flash,
2226000	2228000	but there's this weird, like, multiplayer element
2228000	2231000	where you can watch other people solve puzzles,
2231000	2234000	and there's a new right-click menu system in the game.
2234000	2237000	If you want to check this out, the website is called sarian.net.
2237000	2239000	S-A-R-I-E-N dot net.
2239000	2244000	And so it's just kind of like a walkthrough of these classic old school Sierra games.
2244000	2247000	So if you were a Sierra game fan like I was back in the day,
2247000	2250000	then you definitely want to check that out.
2250000	2251000	They only have those three games right now,
2251000	2254000	the Leisure Suit Larry 1, Police Quest 1, and Space Quest 1.
2254000	2257000	No word when my favorite of the old Sierra games,
2257000	2261000	which would be King's Quest 4, is going to make the list.
2261000	2263000	So check that out.
2263000	2267000	Moving on with some more gaming news, over to Dark Sakura.
2267000	2273000	Well, I'm sure some of our regular listeners remember me talking about
2273000	2279000	getting a FC Mobile, which is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.
2279000	2284000	Now there is a new one, which I am going to be getting and selling my old one.
2284000	2289000	It's the FC Mobile 2, and it comes with stuff and things.
2289000	2296000	As in, it comes with controllers,
2296000	2299000	wireless controllers, and a light gun.
2299000	2306000	A wireless light gun that's pretty good in relation to the old NES Zapper.
2306000	2313000	So when you have it basically using the TV tuner mode and using it as your Nintendo,
2313000	2317000	you have actual controllers. You do not have to use the system.
2317000	2320000	So it's going to be out in May.
2320000	2325000	It will be $60, and it will have a black version and a white version.
2325000	2329000	And I'm going to have one.
2329000	2333000	Mine will go up for sale. My old one.
2333000	2335000	The end.
2335000	2339000	This is so interesting how the old school Nintendo stuff is making such a comeback,
2339000	2341000	thanks to, in part, this whole FC Mobile stuff.
2341000	2343000	So it's kind of cool.
2343000	2347000	How much money do you think you're going to end up spending on all this crap?
2347000	2351000	Not much. It's only $60. It should be cheaper elsewhere.
2351000	2355000	Hitstun in our chat room right now says,
2355000	2358000	Yeah, this week I bought an FC Mobile, tried it, realized the fucking A and B buttons were backwards,
2358000	2360000	and returned it for a refund.
2360000	2361000	Yeah, they're fixing that.
2361000	2362000	All in about a half hour's time.
2362000	2363000	They're fixing that.
2363000	2367000	They've reversed the A and B buttons to where they should be on the new version.
2367000	2371000	Does that have anything to do with the fact that in Japan, most games do have it flipped?
2371000	2374000	Or is that just, no, it really was messed up?
2374000	2379000	I think that they based the old FC Mobile off of the Famicom Mobile.
2379000	2382000	The U.S. one was based off of the Japanese one,
2382000	2387000	but I think that the U.S. release one is going to actually,
2387000	2391000	they were saying that the button should be corrected for American audiences.
2391000	2394000	Alrighty.
2394000	2397000	And I got a hug in chat for mentioning King's Quest IV.
2397000	2399000	That's like the quintessential Sierra game. I'm sorry.
2399000	2401000	That is the best.
2401000	2404000	If anybody were to ask me what old school Sierra game should I play
2404000	2406000	to check out why these games were so awesome,
2406000	2408000	because there's like 20 of them out there in all these different series,
2408000	2413000	I would say King's Quest IV is the one you should check out first.
2413000	2415000	I like King's Quest better than Space Quest IV.
2415000	2416000	I like Space Quest IV.
2416000	2417000	Oh yeah.
2417000	2418000	Really?
2418000	2419000	Yeah, I do. I like Legion Suit Larry too,
2419000	2422000	but I think King's Quest is more accessible for everybody.
2422000	2427000	You have to have a certain sense of humor to like Legion Suit Larry.
2427000	2429000	So there you go.
2429000	2431000	Alright, well, more news.
2431000	2432000	We've got release dates coming up.
2432000	2433000	Yes.
2433000	2436000	Well, this ought to make Jamie happy.
2436000	2439000	It's been confirmed that next week on the, or not virtual console,
2439000	2444000	on Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual On will be coming out.
2444000	2451000	Yes, on April 29th, you can expect Virtual On out on Xbox Live Arcade.
2451000	2456000	Apparently, though, it is going to be priced at 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.
2456000	2458000	So?
2458000	2460000	That is so for me.
2460000	2461000	It's Virtual On.
2461000	2462000	I'm totally getting it.
2462000	2463000	That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live.
2463000	2464000	Once wins six.
2464000	2466000	Because there's Virtual On.
2466000	2467000	Or an adapter.
2467000	2468000	An outrun.
2468000	2472000	Adapter, so I can use my Dreamcast twin sticks.
2472000	2474000	Random Xbox Live Arcade.
2474000	2477000	One thing I did play actually this week as well was Lode Runner.
2477000	2480000	I did check that out because I have fond memories of that game on the Commodore 64.
2480000	2484000	Personally, I don't think that game has aged very well.
2484000	2486000	They've tried to make it look nicer,
2486000	2488000	but I think the core game itself has not aged very well.
2488000	2489000	Yeah.
2489000	2492000	I think it's a game that's better left in my memory on the Commodore 64.
2492000	2497000	I don't want to base the review off the demo,
2497000	2499000	but as I was checking it out, I was kind of going,
2499000	2504000	this is one of those things that I remember a lot more fondly when I was younger.
2504000	2507000	They have nice new graphics.
2507000	2510000	It's like they put the same old game in this nice new packaging,
2510000	2514000	but it's still the same old game that I think is better left in the 80s.
2514000	2516000	So there you go.
2516000	2517000	All right.
2517000	2519000	Let's go to some release dates.
2519000	2523000	Over to Japan first.
2523000	2527000	We'll start tonight with some of the releases on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
2527000	2532000	Coming out on, I believe, what is their release date?
2532000	2534000	I think April 30th.
2534000	2536000	X-Blades is coming out on the Xbox 360.
2536000	2538000	That's really the only big game coming out this week.
2538000	2542000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, you also have X-Blades from Ubisoft,
2542000	2547000	as well as versions of NHL 2009 coming out there as well.
2547000	2550000	Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii,
2550000	2554000	you have GQO Powerful Major League 2009
2554000	2558000	and Mahjong Kakuto Club Wii come out as well.
2558000	2561000	It's kind of a slow release week, if you can imagine.
2561000	2562000	That's cool.
2562000	2565000	PlayStation 2 has a game called NHL 2009,
2565000	2568000	as well as Tiernanog is coming out as well.
2568000	2570000	Wasn't that a song in DDR?
2570000	2572000	No.
2572000	2573000	Oh, it is. It is.
2573000	2575000	It's a game based off the Mystic Knights of Tiernanog.
2575000	2577000	That's what it is. Huh?
2577000	2579000	I was going to say it's Celtic mythology.
2579000	2580000	That's what it is.
2580000	2581000	It's a role-playing game.
2581000	2582000	This actually looks kind of cool.
2582000	2584000	That neato.
2584000	2586000	That's on PlayStation 2 of all systems.
2586000	2589000	So that's coming out from SystemSoft this week in Japan.
2589000	2591000	That looks to be the most exciting thing I've seen yet.
2591000	2592000	Going to the handhelds,
2592000	2595000	we'll see if there's any big handheld stuff coming out this week.
2595000	2599000	That might explain why the lineup is kind of weak on the consoles.
2599000	2601000	We do have a Dragon Ball Z game coming out,
2601000	2606000	as well as WarioWare Myself comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
2606000	2612000	And Shinobi Retsuden 3 comes out as well.
2612000	2613000	And let's see.
2613000	2615000	That's all on the DS.
2615000	2616000	And on the Sony PSP.
2616000	2617000	Oh, there you go.
2617000	2620000	Persona comes out this week on the PSP.
2620000	2622000	That must be the big game that's coming out this week.
2622000	2627000	As well as a version of Tiernanog on Sony PSP.
2627000	2629000	You fail at Blaster Master.
2629000	2632000	That's kind of cool.
2632000	2633000	All right.
2633000	2636000	So they're playing Blaster Master on Justin TV right now,
2636000	2638000	but having a hard time with the Dreamcast controller.
2638000	2640000	There you go.
2640000	2641000	All right.
2641000	2644000	Let's move on with more release dates.
2644000	2647000	I have two.
2647000	2651000	We have on the 1st of May, which is May Day,
2651000	2653000	which is a fertility holiday.
2653000	2654000	Ooh.
2654000	2657000	We have Gardening Mama on the DS.
2657000	2661000	We have Marbles Balance Challenge on the Wii.
2661000	2663000	That's it.
2663000	2665000	This is a slow week.
2665000	2668000	I think the Marbles Balance Challenge I think is a WiiWare game.
2668000	2672000	They're too busy practicing fertility, right?
2672000	2674000	Dancing the maypole.
2674000	2678000	This week there's not a whole lot coming out as well in the U.S.
2678000	2682000	Starting off Backyard Baseball 2010 coming out on the PlayStation 2,
2682000	2685000	but you might as well skip that game because it sucks.
2685000	2691000	The Aquarium World, which is apparently a port of the DS Aquarium game,
2691000	2692000	also sucks.
2692000	2693000	Please avoid that one.
2693000	2695000	Horrible game.
2695000	2701000	Elite Forces Unit 77 coming out on the DS.
2701000	2703000	Still horrible, but okay.
2703000	2706000	Velvet Assassin coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
2706000	2708000	That one's supposed to be okay.
2708000	2714000	Dynasty Warriors Strike Force on PSP.
2714000	2717000	Maybe here, I think this is the wrong date,
2717000	2720000	but Klonoa on the Wii is supposed to be coming out.
2720000	2721000	Yay!
2721000	2724000	I think it's the week after, but we'll go with that I guess.
2724000	2727000	Super Robot Tyson OG Saga Endless Frontier,
2727000	2728000	which actually looks pretty cool.
2728000	2730000	That's coming out on the DS.
2730000	2732000	Tournament Pool coming out from Destiny Air,
2732000	2734000	which means that must suck.
2734000	2735000	That's on the Wii.
2735000	2741000	Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming out on the DS.
2741000	2742000	Okay.
2742000	2744000	Is it like Imagine Fuego?
2744000	2748000	No, not quite Imagine Fuego.
2748000	2750000	And then finally, probably the bigger game of the week,
2750000	2753000	and this is sad, but X-Men Origins Wolverine.
2753000	2756000	And if you happen to be buying it on the 360,
2756000	2759000	and on the PlayStation 3, the Uncaged Edition,
2759000	2761000	which means it's slightly more violent,
2761000	2764000	will be coming out in pretty much every system out there.
2764000	2767000	And then also some more crap from Destiny Air.
2767000	2770000	Party Pigs Farmyard Games on the Wii.
2770000	2774000	And that is it.
2774000	2777000	That is your week in games.
2777000	2779000	Why is it such a crap week for games?
2779000	2780000	I guess we're just...
2780000	2781000	April's usually light, that's why.
2781000	2783000	We're all busy doing it.
2783000	2785000	I guess everybody's prepped for the summer or something.
2785000	2789000	Alright, well, at least online looks to be a little more exciting
2789000	2791000	if you look at the stuff that's available on Virtual Console
2791000	2793000	and those types of places.
2793000	2795000	One thing that's coming out in Japan anyway,
2795000	2798000	sadly it's not here yet, but maybe someday,
2798000	2802000	the Wii Video Service is going to be launching in Japan on May 1st.
2802000	2804000	Here's the cool thing about it.
2804000	2806000	You will be able to connect with your DSi.
2806000	2809000	Notice how it doesn't say your DS, but your DSi.
2809000	2811000	It's called the Wii No Ma Channel,
2811000	2814000	and it's coming out from May 1st.
2814000	2817000	It's being launched by Nintendo,
2817000	2821000	and Dentsu is their publisher partner.
2821000	2823000	Well, it makes sense that you couldn't do the DS
2823000	2825000	because you can't download anything to the DS.
2825000	2828000	Well, you can't download programs.
2828000	2830000	Oh, to the regular DS, yeah.
2830000	2833000	Couldn't you download a movie to the regular DS,
2833000	2835000	close it, and have it later? I don't know.
2835000	2837000	As long as you don't turn it off.
2837000	2843000	I believe it uses flash memory for the demos.
2843000	2845000	Let me tell you a little bit more about how it works.
2845000	2847000	Basically, when you go into this app,
2847000	2849000	it looks like a little family room,
2849000	2852000	and eight of your Miis will show up gathering in this room.
2852000	2854000	If you go into the TV in the room,
2854000	2855000	you'll get to do the download service.
2855000	2858000	There will be both free and paid content.
2858000	2860000	They haven't announced what's going to be in it yet.
2860000	2863000	One of the demo videos uses this nature footage,
2863000	2865000	so I don't know if they just have some stock video
2865000	2867000	to kind of show the program off or what have you.
2867000	2871000	If you go on a house plant, you go to the sponsor area,
2871000	2874000	and you get some free trials of stuff from advertisers,
2874000	2876000	so I don't know, like a sponsor area.
2876000	2878000	I don't know how that ties into videos, but there you go.
2878000	2880000	You will also be able to use this on the DSi.
2880000	2883000	There's going to be a free app called Doko Demo Wii No Ma.
2883000	2886000	It's called Anywhere, translate what's it to, Anywhere Wii No Ma,
2886000	2890000	and you'll be able to download the video from the Wii to your DS,
2890000	2892000	as well as redeem coupons.
2892000	2894000	And apparently in one of the demo videos,
2894000	2898000	you get a fast food restaurant coupon that you get from this channel.
2898000	2901000	You'd get it to your DSi, and then they scan it on your DSi
2901000	2903000	at the restaurant to redeem it.
2903000	2905000	Kind of neat. A little different.
2905000	2908000	There's a trailer out there on the internet if you want to check that out,
2908000	2911000	but it isn't Japanese, so there you go.
2911000	2914000	Do you think they'll have something like this out here soon?
2914000	2916000	Too much trouble for us lazy Americans.
2916000	2918000	I don't think you'll have quite that cool functionality
2918000	2920000	like the fast food restaurant thing I was describing,
2920000	2923000	but why not the video service?
2923000	2926000	Because then that would mean that they actually are going to embrace online
2926000	2929000	for the U.S., and that's never going to happen.
2929000	2932000	But wasn't Japan always kind of holding them back?
2932000	2933000	Well, no.
2933000	2936000	Look at the one company that's braced online better than anybody else
2936000	2939000	is an American company, Microsoft.
2939000	2941000	Yes.
2941000	2944000	And Nintendo is a Japanese-run company.
2944000	2947000	I know, and Sony has been always having to run to catch up
2947000	2949000	with the online stuff.
2949000	2951000	At least they're willing to give it a shot.
2951000	2958000	After all, their systems did have support for online network games.
2958000	2960000	Granted, the GameCube did as well,
2960000	2963000	but honestly, how many games really used it?
2963000	2966000	Like, two.
2966000	2969000	I don't know. I don't think we'll see this.
2969000	2972000	I mean, after all, they haven't even brought the normal video download service
2972000	2977000	to the Wii yet, so why the video streaming?
2977000	2979000	I just don't see this as something they're just going to do,
2979000	2981000	because it doesn't really...
2981000	2983000	I mean, it adds, I guess, functionality to the Wii,
2983000	2985000	but really they don't need it,
2985000	2987000	because people want to buy Wii Sports,
2987000	2991000	and hopefully Wii Sports 2 or Wii Sports Resort.
2991000	2994000	All right. Well, we'll see if they give this a shot in the U.S. or not.
2994000	2996000	Probably not.
2996000	2999000	Anyway, moving on. More news.
2999000	3005000	Well, in other news, this is actually a statement made by American McGee,
3005000	3009000	and I fully endorse this, you know.
3009000	3017000	They're asked about the trend of using user-made content,
3017000	3024000	and American McGee was saying that it's actually extortion of the users
3024000	3027000	to make the content.
3027000	3029000	You know, they're basically using the users to make the game.
3029000	3032000	They just make the properties to go with it.
3032000	3035000	He thinks that there should be some kind of reward out there
3035000	3040000	for gamers who make the content, which I agree with.
3040000	3042000	I think that would be a good idea.
3042000	3046000	You know, or at least contests and things like that.
3046000	3054000	But it's really just, you know, partially laziness on part of the programs.
3054000	3059000	I think it actually, there's the immersive element of having people,
3059000	3061000	you know, the players provide content,
3061000	3063000	but at the same time, yeah, they should be rewarded for it.
3063000	3065000	When I was first hearing this story,
3065000	3068000	I couldn't help but think maybe it was a dig on LittleBigPlanet,
3068000	3071000	because that's a game that relies so much on the user-created content.
3071000	3073000	That's the big sell of the game.
3073000	3074000	You know what I mean?
3074000	3077000	LittleBigPlanet is the best game I played last year completely.
3077000	3086000	Certainly better than those American McGee, you know, the Grim Fairy Tales games they have out right now.
3086000	3089000	No, I don't agree with, you know, his statements at all,
3089000	3094000	because if you think about it, that's like saying if I buy a pencil and I do a drawing,
3094000	3097000	should the company that provided me with the pencil, you know,
3097000	3099000	they have to pay me for the drawing they made, because...
3099000	3102000	But are you going to go back and use the drawing afterwards?
3102000	3103000	What do you mean if I'm going to use the drawing?
3103000	3104000	Or let other people...
3104000	3107000	Is the pencil company going to sell your drawing, basically?
3107000	3108000	Are you going to...
3108000	3110000	Yeah, but they're not selling their online content.
3110000	3115000	Are you going to be drawing up for common use so that anybody else on the internet can use your piece?
3115000	3116000	Then don't make anything for it.
3116000	3117000	I mean, that's the thing.
3117000	3123000	It's like if you're going to be all butthurt about people using your, you know, stuff that you made,
3123000	3124000	then don't make anything.
3124000	3127000	The point is that the games rely on user-created content.
3127000	3131000	No, they don't, because they actually have their own standby levels,
3131000	3133000	and if you never touched online, it wouldn't matter anyways,
3133000	3135000	because you still got a full game's worth of stuff.
3135000	3137000	To be fair, I'm using LittleBigPlanet as an example.
3137000	3140000	We don't know exactly what kind of game he had in mind either.
3140000	3142000	Oh, he's full of crap.
3142000	3144000	I mean, his game, Grim, is...
3144000	3146000	I'm sorry, it's not that great.
3146000	3151000	But, whatever, you know, he thinks he's an expert because he's developed, you know, two game series.
3151000	3154000	Ooh, let's bow down to you.
3154000	3156000	Oh, wait, how was your Bad Day L.A. game?
3156000	3159000	Oh, that's right, it wasn't very good.
3159000	3163000	I mean, maybe if he had some user-created content, it would have made that game worth buying,
3163000	3166000	but, I don't know, it's just...
3166000	3167000	I'm kind of in the middle here.
3167000	3169000	Like, I kind of understand what he...
3169000	3172000	I do agree that if companies are going to use your stuff,
3172000	3175000	you should get rewards for that, you know what I mean?
3175000	3177000	You should be able to...
3177000	3180000	They could even go as far as compensation, you know what I mean?
3180000	3183000	I think that there should actually be contests.
3183000	3185000	You know, content contests.
3185000	3190000	And Sony does kind of reward, like, they give the crowns in Little Big Planet if you're super popular.
3190000	3193000	The trophies are based off the popularity of your levels.
3193000	3194000	Little perks, nothing big.
3194000	3196000	They should have, like, real prizes.
3196000	3197000	Real stuff.
3197000	3198000	Yeah, that's what I think.
3198000	3199000	Alright.
3199000	3204000	If you guys have a comment, chat.orangelandrader.com is the place you can leave us a comment on this.
3204000	3206000	Or you can always send us a tweet.
3206000	3209000	At OLR is the place you can go as well.
3209000	3212000	Some comments from chat right now over at chat.orangelandrader.com.
3212000	3214000	Leo Shen says, hopefully that new Alice game will be good.
3214000	3217000	I keep forgetting, they are working on a new Alice game, aren't they?
3217000	3219000	They're working on an Alice movie, too.
3219000	3220000	Well, Alice in Wonderland.
3220000	3223000	He was supposed to be working on an Alice movie as well, but...
3223000	3224000	I don't know.
3224000	3225000	It's just...
3225000	3227000	It's just because he...
3227000	3232000	For whatever reason, we hold these game developers up really high, and then they start getting a big head.
3232000	3234000	And thinking that they can comment on everything.
3234000	3237000	And granted, yes, they can make comments on everything, but then people...
3237000	3238000	We comment on everything.
3238000	3240000	It's just people don't give a shit what we say.
3240000	3241000	They don't get posts everywhere.
3241000	3247000	No one goes and posts our comments in a blog, and they'll present it as gospel on the industry.
3247000	3248000	I mean, it's just one person's opinion.
3248000	3250000	Just like his opinion.
3250000	3252000	He thinks that people should be compensated.
3252000	3253000	Well, great!
3253000	3256000	If he ever creates a game that has user-created content, then I want him to see him compensating everybody.
3256000	3258000	Since he's made such a fuss over it.
3258000	3259000	So...
3259000	3260000	Whatever.
3260000	3262000	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3262000	3263000	Loki?
3263000	3269000	Advent Children Complete, the brand new Blu-Ray box set that came out in Japan last week,
3269000	3270000	has actually been doing very well.
3270000	3275000	In fact, it's sold over 274,000 copies.
3275000	3280000	And the demo itself has actually pushed the PS3 to the top of the charts.
3280000	3285000	Because, yes, people do actually want to buy this box set for the game.
3285000	3287000	And, yeah, that's fine.
3287000	3288000	The movie's awesome, too.
3288000	3290000	But I think it's definitely...
3290000	3293000	I mean, they must be pretty confident in it.
3293000	3298000	After all, they did release a special edition PS3 in Japan with this box set.
3298000	3304000	So, you know, people love their Final Fantasy VII.
3304000	3308000	Even though it's really probably the Final Fantasy XIII demo that's driving all of this?
3308000	3310000	Yes.
3310000	3312000	I mean, how many of those came to America?
3312000	3315000	I mean, I haven't heard of people importing a game as much as I've heard of this.
3315000	3316000	Like, I seriously know.
3316000	3317000	I know you imported it.
3317000	3319000	One of my friends on LiveJournal imported it.
3319000	3321000	I know Bobby imported it.
3321000	3322000	And I don't...
3322000	3325000	Like, I haven't heard of that many people importing anything else.
3325000	3326000	You know what I mean?
3326000	3329000	Like, maybe one of you would import another game from Japan.
3329000	3331000	But, like, all of you guys got that Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3331000	3333000	You know, I think that you import...
3333000	3337000	You know, and it's probably maybe only, like, a thousand or two thousand of that is imports.
3337000	3339000	You can't say the whole bit is.
3339000	3340000	But that's still...
3340000	3342000	It just kind of shows you the popularity of it, if that makes sense.
3342000	3344000	Yes, it does make sense.
3344000	3345000	So, it's pretty popular.
3345000	3347000	And I'm sure, like, if, you know...
3347000	3351000	I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII actually comes out over there on PS3 and stuff,
3351000	3353000	people will be importing that bitch.
3353000	3355000	Oh, yeah, because it'll be region-free.
3355000	3356000	Yeah, it'll be region-free.
3356000	3358000	It'll be a few months early.
3358000	3361000	And then they'll buy it again in the U.S. because we're all consumer whores, right?
3361000	3362000	Yep.
3362000	3363000	That's right.
3363000	3364000	Already thinking about it.
3364000	3365000	There you go.
3365000	3366000	I'm kind of curious.
3366000	3367000	Chat room.
3367000	3368000	What kind of game...
3368000	3370000	Because I see Act Def Comments has imported three games.
3370000	3374000	What are some games, chat room, you've imported in the past year?
3374000	3375000	Because, you know, when you...
3375000	3379000	And the reason why I ask is because it costs a lot more money when you order import games from Japan.
3379000	3381000	So, I'm kind of curious, those of you in chat.
3381000	3382000	Give me some ideas.
3382000	3384000	What kind of games have you imported in the past year?
3384000	3386000	We'll say year or two.
3386000	3390000	Within this current console cycle, you know, what kind of stuff have you imported?
3390000	3393000	Is that the only thing you've imported during this cycle?
3393000	3394000	Nope.
3394000	3396000	I imported Smash Brothers Brawl.
3396000	3399000	I also imported...
3399000	3404000	I don't know why I imported this, but I imported Wangen Midnight on the PS3.
3404000	3405000	Oh, yeah.
3405000	3407000	Because it was not like the arcade one, for sure.
3407000	3411000	No, it was not, unfortunately.
3411000	3412000	There's some other games.
3412000	3416000	I thought about importing Africa, never got around to it.
3416000	3421000	Just because it can't run over the animals, and that's just not fun for me.
3421000	3423000	There's another RPG that came out over there.
3423000	3425000	I think it's Dark Souls or something like that.
3425000	3428000	That's actually all in English that I thought about importing.
3428000	3431000	But I haven't even played the PS3 games I have now.
3431000	3435000	Like, I have Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 that I still haven't played anything.
3435000	3438000	You know, I haven't even gotten past, like, the first level in...
3438000	3441000	Well, I passed the first level, but not the second level in Resistance 2.
3441000	3443000	I don't know.
3443000	3446000	I thought about getting a Japanese Xbox 360,
3446000	3450000	because I haven't figured out a good way to region-free my 360,
3450000	3455000	since most of the games that come out in Japan aren't region-free on the 360.
3455000	3456000	But that's pretty much it.
3456000	3460000	Yeah, just those three games.
3460000	3463000	Let me read some comments from our chat room about the imports,
3463000	3465000	the games that have been imported.
3465000	3473000	Act F says he's imported Happy Sky, Gya Kuten Saiban 2, and Street Fighter's Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.
3473000	3474000	Why can't I talk tonight?
3474000	3476000	Dark Knight says 2DX Red.
3476000	3479000	Liu Shen says 2DX Poppin' and Oz.
3479000	3483000	GS68 says kitsui Death Label, Poppin' Music 13 Carnival,
3483000	3486000	DJ Max Portable Black Square.
3486000	3489000	Jason says, current console cycle, I haven't.
3489000	3491000	Gold Anthro says, I've never really imported a game ever.
3491000	3493000	I don't have the extra money.
3493000	3495000	There you go.
3495000	3499000	Some of the comments from things that have been imported in the current cycle.
3499000	3503000	Funny enough, none of them said the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3503000	3505000	And the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3505000	3506000	All right.
3506000	3510000	Hey, PlayStation Home, another popular destination on the PlayStation 3.
3510000	3513000	There is an update coming for PlayStation Home.
3513000	3515000	There's going to be a new Disgaea Lounge,
3515000	3519000	and apparently in this new Disgaea area, you'll be able to play like a Disgaea test.
3519000	3522000	There'll be a card game, some type of block game available as well.
3522000	3524000	And of course, prettys.
3524000	3527000	Little pretty penguin people that you can see in this area.
3527000	3529000	Also, some other stuff coming to home this month.
3529000	3531000	Street Fighter IV Avatar items.
3531000	3534000	You can start Street Fighter IV within Home.
3534000	3536000	And Uncharted Waters Online.
3536000	3539000	Cruz del Sur is supposed to come out as well,
3539000	3543000	which offers some new home items within Home.
3543000	3546000	So there you go.
3546000	3548000	That's all coming to PlayStation Home.
3548000	3550000	Haven't been home in a while.
3550000	3553000	Neither, but, well, I guess only a couple weeks when I say a while.
3553000	3556000	So, you know, there you go.
3556000	3559000	That's all coming to PlayStation Home this month.
3559000	3562000	Well, that's special.
3562000	3565000	Very, very special.
3565000	3568000	Well, how about some different PlayStation 3 news?
3568000	3571000	This is definitely a reason that is if you
3571000	3575000	Sorry, the mics died for a minute.
3575000	3577000	It was my fault.
3577000	3579000	Live radio, boys and girls.
3579000	3581000	Did that work? Did you hear that microphone?
3581000	3582000	Yes, sorry.
3582000	3583000	Roar!
3583000	3585000	Okay.
3585000	3588000	If you have a problem, you can take it up with me.
3588000	3591000	Anyway.
3591000	3594000	So for fans of the PlayStation 3,
3594000	3597000	there is a very good reason to have
3597000	3599000	Arkham Asylum on that system,
3599000	3602000	because you get to play the Joker.
3602000	3605000	The Joker is cool.
3605000	3608000	Reviews so far of the game have been pretty positive,
3608000	3610000	so I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
3610000	3613000	But there's really, though, no comment on
3613000	3615000	if you're going to be able to use him at all
3615000	3618000	on Xbox 360 or PC.
3618000	3622000	You, basically, though, the way it's going to work
3622000	3626000	is that you'll go on to the PlayStation Store
3626000	3630000	to purchase him, but he's only playable on the challenge maps.
3630000	3632000	Mr. J.
3632000	3633000	Huh.
3633000	3636000	I wonder if Xbox 360 will have their own little special character.
3636000	3639000	If it's Catwoman, I gotta go with 360.
3639000	3640000	I gotta say.
3640000	3644000	I don't know, because Joker is Joker.
3644000	3646000	I want Harley.
3646000	3648000	Yeah, you don't know.
3648000	3651000	Like, maybe there's still going to be a special character on the 360
3651000	3653000	that's going to be, you know, everybody's going to want that, too.
3653000	3656000	I mean, obviously, the Joker's the big-ass deal with the movie and everything,
3656000	3658000	but, you know, I don't know.
3658000	3661000	Me, personally, I love Batman for years and years.
3661000	3664000	This will probably come out on the 360
3664000	3666000	after a certain amount of time.
3666000	3668000	It's just, you know, sweeten the deal,
3668000	3672000	because you've got to sell some PS3 units since there's not as many systems.
3672000	3675000	Only if one of the Joker's attacks is the magic trick.
3675000	3678000	This is Mark Hamill, Joker, so probably not.
3678000	3681000	That's right. X-Link is reminding us in chat that Mark Hamill is doing the voice.
3681000	3683000	Oh, my God.
3683000	3685000	I'm sorry.
3685000	3689000	Mark Hamill is the best voice actor ever for Joker The End.
3689000	3692000	It's also the guy with the same guy that's doing the voice
3692000	3695000	from the animated series for Batman as well,
3695000	3698000	and I think they have the writer doing the actual story of the game, too.
3698000	3700000	That's nice.
3700000	3702000	Too bad they can't get Eartha Kitt for Catwoman,
3702000	3705000	because she's, you know, dead, but that would have been great.
3705000	3709000	For what I've seen in the video trailer for it,
3709000	3711000	I think they have the same voice actor for Harley Quinn, too.
3711000	3714000	Yay! God, I love Harley.
3714000	3718000	I just think that she's great because she was totally made for the animated series,
3718000	3723000	and fans loved her so much that she made it into the comic universe.
3723000	3726000	Well, I hope the game's as good as the hype,
3726000	3728000	because everybody's getting excited about it.
3728000	3731000	Nobody's played the game yet.
3731000	3734000	Actually, some people have had their hands on early copies to review it,
3734000	3738000	and it did get some pretty good reviews.
3738000	3740000	Eurogamer really, really liked it.
3740000	3742000	They were just excited because they had early copies.
3742000	3746000	Well, Sony was teasing an electrifying announcement
3746000	3749000	that they were going to make on April 27th
3749000	3755000	regarding Uncharted Drake's Fortune 2 and also Infamous.
3755000	3759000	However, like any other secret announcement that they have,
3759000	3761000	it got ruined by Best Buy.
3761000	3765000	So apparently part of the announcement,
3765000	3768000	at least we can assume it's part, if not all, of the announcement,
3768000	3771000	if you buy your copy of Infamous,
3771000	3774000	you will get a downloadable demo,
3774000	3779000	as well as access to Uncharted 2 among thieves,
3779000	3783000	the multiplayer beta, one that launches in June.
3783000	3789000	So much like Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta,
3789000	3793000	you'll get to do a similar type of thing with Uncharted 2.
3793000	3795000	And of course, everyone's thought was,
3795000	3801000	hey, not only will you probably be able to play the Uncharted 2 beta,
3801000	3805000	but maybe the Infamous character is going to be an unlockable in Uncharted 2.
3805000	3807000	So that might be another theory as well.
3807000	3810000	But we'll hear the official announcement on the 27th,
3810000	3812000	and everybody act surprised.
3813000	3816000	Sorry the surprise got ruined by Best Buy, Sony.
3816000	3818000	This sad trombone's for you.
3825000	3828000	I know. We love sad trombone here on Orange Launch Radio.
3828000	3831000	We should make that official thing, that when this type of stuff happens,
3831000	3834000	we give them a sad trombone, and that's whatever.
3834000	3836000	The sad trombone of the week.
3836000	3838000	That's right, the sad trombone of the week.
3840000	3843000	All right, we got one more story for you that won't be a sad trombone,
3843000	3845000	for some people are going to be very excited to hear this,
3845000	3850000	but apparently Kojima is swearing there's not going to be another Metal Gear for a while.
3850000	3854000	But one of the other games he's looking at possibly revisiting,
3854000	3856000	Zone of the Enders.
3856000	3860000	That's right. Apparently they are interested in making a Zone of the Enders 3,
3860000	3863000	and this came up during one of the Metal Gear Solid 4 podcasts.
3865000	3868000	It's been six years since Zone of the Enders, the second runner.
3868000	3871000	But apparently Kojima is interested.
3871000	3875000	He wants gamers to email them if they're interested in seeing it happen.
3875000	3880000	So if you want to add to the email barrage I'm sure they're getting right now,
3880000	3885000	go check that out, the MGS4 podcast, and you can send them an email.
3885000	3890000	So I'm sure they're getting bombarded with them because since this hit the internet,
3890000	3894000	everybody's probably emailing saying, yes, Zone of the Enders.
3894000	3897000	And we have some folks in chat room that are getting very excited about hearing
3897000	3899000	the Zone of the Enders stuff as well.
3899000	3902000	So I don't know, are you guys interested in Zone of the Enders 3?
3902000	3904000	Yes.
3904000	3905000	Sure, why not?
3905000	3907000	As long as Sana sings the song.
3907000	3911000	All right, well let's get here to the end of part A,
3911000	3913000	we're going to get into part B in just a minute here,
3913000	3916000	but before we end part A we have to get to a segment we always do here
3916000	3918000	on Orange Lounge Radio.
3918000	3922000	Every week we like to dig through the old dusty gaming archive of video games
3922000	3925000	and pick out a classic video game that you kids should be revisiting.
3925000	3927000	We're revisiting a lot on Justin TV tonight actually.
3927000	3930000	It looks like Rice Princess is playing Willow right now.
3930000	3932000	Good times, that's a good pick.
3932000	3934000	That's a previous classic game of the week, that's already been done.
3934000	3937000	We have a brand new classic game of the week tonight,
3937000	3939000	and Dark Soccer is back, I picked one last week,
3939000	3941000	but Dark Soccer is back to pick one for you guys.
3941000	3948000	We did Spy vs. Spy, an old Commodore 64 game that they ended up on the NES,
3948000	3950000	and it had two sequels that a lot of people don't know about
3950000	3952000	because they were only on Commodore 64,
3952000	3956000	but one of the very first games ever to have same screen multiplayer.
3956000	3958000	That's what makes it unique.
3958000	3961000	All right, anyhow, that's so last week though.
3961000	3963000	Let's get into this week and the classic game of the week this week.
3963000	3967000	Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?
3967000	3973000	The game of the week is Klonoa, because Klonoa is great.
3973000	3975000	Let's have some music, Rob.
3975000	3979000	Yes, this is from the PlayStation 1 version of Klonoa.
3979000	3981000	Let's check it out.
3981000	3983000	Explosions.
3983000	3985000	I love music in this game.
3985000	3995000	I'm going to choke on the cue.
3995000	4004000	This is not the best music ever.
4004000	4007000	You can still just see how nauseously cued this game is from music.
4007000	4009000	There you go.
4009000	4014000	Well, it starts off nauseously cute, but how many people has actually played the damn game?
4014000	4020000	Basically, you start off in a world called Phantomile.
4020000	4023000	Klonoa lives in this little village called Breezegale.
4023000	4025000	He lives with his grandfather.
4025000	4038000	He goes and visits Dreamworld, where he has to go and save different people.
4038000	4042000	Basically, he meets up with his buddy named Q-Pal,
4042000	4048000	who lives in a ring that Klonoa found in the forest.
4048000	4054000	That's where Klonoa gets his power from.
4054000	4059000	He basically has to go and rescue this girl named Lola,
4059000	4073000	who is a...well, actually, wrong one, because he has to...no, I think it's Lola that he has to...was he rescued?
4073000	4079000	Anyway, he has to rescue some chick.
4079000	4083000	I thought it was either Lola or Lirina, one of those two.
4083000	4093000	He has to go through and actually rescue this priestess who was captured by Gaudius, who is the main bad guy.
4093000	4103000	He thinks that dark remotions should reign and that you should accept it as much as you do the light.
4103000	4110000	However, he's just doing this to do it.
4110000	4118000	As you go through the game, you're having to...I really don't want to spoil things too much,
4118000	4124000	but as it goes through, you have to go through the different stages and fight the different bosses.
4124000	4128000	The game plays sort of pseudo-3D.
4128000	4136000	It plays on a 2D platform, but you've got some three-dimensional elements thrown in,
4136000	4142000	like hitting stuff that goes into the background to pop eggs to get more jewels to power your stuff up with,
4142000	4148000	or you can also rescue these different people that live in different places.
4148000	4151000	You've got these people that look like Klonoa in the first level,
4151000	4154000	and you have these people that look like moon things in the next level,
4154000	4160000	but you have to go through and actually rescue people as you go along and fight the enemies
4160000	4164000	by picking up the smaller enemies and throwing them at the bigger ones
4164000	4166000	or using the different properties.
4166000	4172000	There's ones that fly, and you have to grab them, and they'll fly you upwards a little bit.
4172000	4177000	It's a ton of fun. We actually did get a sequel over here in the U.S.,
4177000	4183000	which was Klonoa 2, Limitee's Veil.
4183000	4188000	It used a cel shading for the game.
4188000	4192000	Actually, this is where those other characters came in.
4192000	4196000	I'll be perfectly honest. I haven't played the first Klonoa in a long, long time,
4196000	4200000	so I don't really remember all the people's names except for Joka and Gaudius,
4200000	4204000	and I remember his grandfather, which was very sad, and I guess that happens to him.
4204000	4208000	Joka, though, sucks. Sucks a lot.
4208000	4218000	But Klonoa 2 had the platformer levels and different types of boss battles
4218000	4222000	and time attack challenges and water parks and things like that, too.
4222000	4228000	But the thing about this game, about actually both of the games, I'd say,
4228000	4233000	is that for as cute and light as they look, and, you know,
4233000	4238000	it'd be a game that a little kid could play and not really understand the darker elements to,
4238000	4242000	it does have a ton of darker elements.
4242000	4245000	I mean, really, this game gets downright freaking depressing.
4245000	4250000	Just depressing. I mean, the further you get on in the game, you're like,
4250000	4254000	oh my god, can this get any more screwed up? And then it gets more screwed up.
4254000	4257000	So, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4257000	4260000	Now, did you happen to pick this game this week because there's that Wii version coming out very soon,
4260000	4262000	or just coincidence?
4262000	4266000	Well, I was thinking about it, and what I did now when I pick a classic game
4266000	4270000	is I looked at my own collection, which usually takes me quite a while.
4270000	4276000	But I happened to see Klonoa there. I was like, oh, Klonoa's coming out this week, so I might as well pick it.
4276000	4281000	But there's also other versions of the game, too.
4281000	4288000	There's a Klonoa 2 Dream Champ tournament that came out in Game Boy Advance in Japan.
4288000	4294000	And it actually did come out over here quite a bit later.
4294000	4298000	There's also Klonoa Moonlight Museum, which came out in Japan on WonderSwan,
4298000	4302000	which I might have.
4302000	4309000	But there's also Klonoa Empire of Dreams that also came out for Game Boy Advance.
4309000	4315000	And there's actually in 2002, there was Klonoa Heroes Legend of the Star Metal,
4315000	4318000	which is an action RPG.
4318000	4322000	So you can actually play through the game as an RPG.
4322000	4328000	For other things, Klonoa had a cameo in MotoGP in Alpine Racer 3.
4328000	4340000	Klonoa and another character, Goonps, were a playable pair in Namco X Capcom, or VS Capcom, or whatever.
4340000	4343000	And they had their moves from Klonoa Heroes.
4343000	4354000	You can also see Joka, Janga, and the moves as enemies, and also Lolo and Lalakusha,
4354000	4358000	who was another priestess, as non-playable characters.
4358000	4363000	And in Tales of Symphonia, you could put Priscia in a Klonoa costume.
4363000	4374000	There's also Shipputen Goku Kaze no Klonoa, which was a really just comedic manga about Klonoa,
4374000	4377000	who was a kid who wanted to be a superhero.
4377000	4385000	And really, that's it.
4385000	4388000	I mean, it's just a fun, fun, fun game.
4388000	4395000	It's really, really... it can get difficult, because you have to think ahead with the puzzles.
4395000	4397000	You have to always be keeping your eyes open.
4397000	4407000	But it does build up in such a way that the learning curve really is a bit more kind.
4407000	4414000	In fact, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the website I used to have a long time ago.
4414000	4417000	It was called the Anime and Video Game Alliance.
4417000	4420000	Yes, this was a long, long time ago.
4420000	4428000	But one of my banner characters was the picture of Klonoa.
4428000	4430000	I've liked this game for a very long time.
4430000	4433000	Definitely a classic, one that I know some of our listeners love.
4433000	4436000	They love that you picked this tonight.
4436000	4439000	So there you have it, Klonoa, your classic video game of the week.
4439000	4441000	Oh, wait, did you play the conversation track?
4441000	4442000	Yeah, I played it in the background already.
4442000	4445000	Oh, sorry. Well, if we can go back to the beginning of that one.
4445000	4446000	I will try, yes.
4446000	4449000	The other thing I wanted to bring up is that they have sort of a made-up language,
4449000	4453000	which I tried to see if they were speaking Japanese or something.
4453000	4458000	And, of course, given the voice actors, it borrows a lot of elements from Japanese, but it's not quite.
4458000	4461000	It actually reminds me of La La Naya.
4461000	4464000	Here, watch this.
4464000	4466000	Gotta go that way.
4466000	4468000	Boo-rah, jerk.
4468000	4471000	I got that back, daddy.
4471000	4477000	Cute.
4477000	4478000	All right.
4478000	4481000	But I don't know if I've ever talked about La La Naya before,
4481000	4486000	but for anyone who was a little kid in the 80s who watched The Great Space Coaster,
4486000	4492000	it was this walking line that would walk along, and it was done by an Italian illustrator.
4492000	4495000	And the line drawing would talk to the illustrator and interact with him,
4495000	4499000	but he spoke sort of a pidgin Italian, and that's what this reminds me of.
4499000	4502000	So, obscure reference there.
4502000	4503000	All right.
4503000	4504000	Klonoa.
4504000	4507000	Klonoa, your classic game of the week.
4507000	4511000	We also did Dan and I used to walk around going, wa-roop, just because.
4511000	4512000	All right.
4512000	4514000	That's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio,
4514000	4517000	but we will be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4517000	4520000	We've got more stories to talk about in Part B, some Xbox 360,
4520000	4523000	some Penny Arcade Expo news we have as well, and plenty more.
4523000	4527000	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4527000	4536000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening,
4536000	4538000	April the 26th of 2009.
4538000	4543000	We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
4543000	4545000	and then we put out the podcast at some point.
4545000	4546000	All right.
4546000	4550000	My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining you for this lovely Part B here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4550000	4555000	Dark Soccer is here as well, Loki, special guests tonight, The Doctor and Rice Princess,
4555000	4556000	and we've been joined by somebody else.
4556000	4558000	I thought she was Fart Princess.
4558000	4559000	Is she Fart?
4559000	4560000	No, I think she went back to me.
4560000	4561000	Are you Ice Princess or Fart Princess?
4561000	4562000	Are you Fart Princess or Rice Princess?
4562000	4564000	Or are you Great Princess?
4564000	4565000	She's Rice Princess again.
4565000	4566000	She's Drunk Princess.
4566000	4569000	She took some gas acts, so she's now.
4569000	4571000	Yeah, right now she's Drunk Princess, actually.
4571000	4573000	We're taking wine tonight.
4573000	4576000	A lovely, lovely Zinfandel.
4576000	4577000	It's wine candy.
4577000	4578000	Yes.
4578000	4579000	It's wine and belly flop night.
4579000	4580000	All right.
4580000	4582000	So we have another guest who joined us part way.
4582000	4584000	A challenger has arrived.
4584000	4585000	A new challenger has arrived.
4585000	4588000	Who is our new person never been on the show before?
4588000	4590000	This is Mellie Wellie.
4590000	4591000	Mellie Wellie.
4591000	4592000	Hello.
4592000	4593000	Hi, Mellie Wellie.
4593000	4594000	How are you?
4594000	4595000	I am good.
4595000	4596000	I'm not loud enough.
4596000	4597000	That's all right.
4597000	4598000	It takes a little getting used to.
4598000	4600000	You have to practically scream in the microphone to be heard around here, but that's all right.
4600000	4603000	Quickly, Mellie Wellie, what kind of video games do you enjoy?
4603000	4606000	I actually enjoy Flash games.
4606000	4609000	The reason that it took me a while to get here is because I was playing the new Gemcraft
4609000	4610000	prequel.
4610000	4611000	Oh, what's Gemcraft?
4611000	4612000	I've not heard of this.
4612000	4616000	It's like a tower defense game, but you use gems in the towers, and it's actually really
4616000	4618000	nerdy, but it's a lot of fun.
4618000	4620000	Those tower defense games are pretty crazy awesome, though.
4620000	4622000	There's a big Final Fantasy one right now that's new.
4622000	4624000	So there you go.
4624000	4625000	Very cool.
4625000	4630000	Have you played, what is that, Don't Shit Your Pants?
4630000	4632000	That's my favorite Flash game as of late.
4632000	4633000	No.
4633000	4634000	That's the one I like.
4634000	4637000	I think I heard you guys talking about it a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had a chance
4637000	4639000	to play it.
4639000	4640000	That's the one I reckon it is.
4640000	4642000	Is that why you're not wearing any right now?
4642000	4646000	No, there's a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants.
4646000	4648000	What's this, Rice Princess?
4648000	4649000	You play this every day?
4649000	4655000	Yes, I play the Don't Shit My Pants game every day, because I successfully don't shit my
4655000	4657000	pants every day.
4657000	4659000	I'm talking about the Flash game, Rice Princess.
4659000	4661000	Not real life.
4661000	4663000	Oh.
4663000	4664000	There you go.
4664000	4666000	All right.
4666000	4667000	Anyhow, all right.
4667000	4668000	So yeah, that's a great Flash game.
4668000	4669000	I recommend that.
4669000	4671000	And then of course we talked about in part A, you probably missed it because you were
4671000	4675000	on your way over here, but we were actually talking about some of the old school Sierra
4675000	4680000	games, like the very first Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry are now Flash games available
4680000	4682000	on the internet that you can play somewhere.
4682000	4684000	I might have to find Leisure Suit Larry.
4684000	4685000	They have that.
4685000	4687000	Leisure Suit Larry 1 is playable, so check that out.
4687000	4688000	All right.
4688000	4692000	Anyhow, also the chat room is always joining us every week.
4692000	4694000	Chat.orangelaundry.com.
4694000	4695000	Dan Shadow in chat.
4695000	4698000	I just barely beat the first level of the FF Tower defense game.
4698000	4702000	Yeah, that game's kind of hard, actually.
4702000	4703000	Let's see.
4703000	4707000	I Like Old People asks, is Rob actually not wearing any pants?
4707000	4708000	That's the name.
4708000	4710000	Why are you laughing?
4710000	4711000	Yes, it's true.
4711000	4713000	Rob is not wearing any pants.
4713000	4714000	No, I am too, wearing pants.
4714000	4718000	Well, no, you see, because he just got some new Hello Kitty undies, and he's got to show
4718000	4719000	them off.
4719000	4720000	Shut up.
4720000	4724000	Rob is dancing in his panties.
4724000	4725000	Shut up, all of you.
4725000	4726000	That's a good chat name.
4726000	4727000	I like that name.
4727000	4728000	I like Old People.
4728000	4729000	Oh, then we still have to get Rob some panties.
4729000	4730000	I like Old People, too.
4730000	4731000	In fact, I was very saddened, by the way.
4731000	4735000	I do want to mention at some point that I'm very saddened to hear about Bea Arthur.
4735000	4738000	Though, I mean, really, like, really ruined my day yesterday.
4738000	4742000	I was having a great day, and then I heard, I did a charity walk yesterday morning.
4742000	4743000	It was great.
4743000	4747000	I was slightly amused that she was mentioned on the Deadpool bugle, because Deadpool is
4747000	4748000	obsessed with Bea Arthur.
4748000	4749000	Too soon.
4749000	4750000	Too soon.
4750000	4751000	She was 86.
4751000	4753000	I know, but she just died.
4753000	4755000	Show a little respect.
4755000	4756000	All right.
4756000	4757000	Anyhow.
4757000	4759000	I'll tell you what's funny, though.
4759000	4760000	What?
4760000	4762000	You missed, because you missed class.
4762000	4763000	Anyway.
4763000	4764000	I'm sorry.
4764000	4766000	She's in my typography class with me.
4766000	4771000	We were doing brainstorming about doing our play on words thing project that we have coming
4771000	4772000	up.
4772000	4776000	And one of the words that came up just by accident was mod, and we started talking about
4776000	4779000	the TV show just a little bit, and then the next day, dead.
4779000	4780000	OMG, dead.
4780000	4782000	That happened with Ricardo Montalban.
4782000	4789440	We were listening to Montalban, which is our cage match winning song, the night before
4789440	4794500	and watching the Rich Corinthian leather commercial, and then he died the next day.
4794500	4797000	Also, that looks like a penis.
4797000	4798000	Okay.
4798000	4802160	I think what you're listening to is that secretly Dark Sakura is the grim reaper.
4802160	4805360	I could very well be.
4805360	4807120	Are you the grim reaper?
4807120	4811320	Do you want to find out?
4811320	4814680	I will reap you with my grim reaping equipment.
4814680	4819320	I was trying to find the intro to mod on YouTube somewhere so I could actually play it, but
4819320	4822800	the best thing I could find was I found this here.
4822800	4824880	No, I found something different.
4824880	4831960	The family guy one is on there, but I found Rosie O'Donnell singing it.
4831960	4839960	All right, that's enough.
4839960	4843600	I'll tell you what, though, here's your B. Arthur trivia for the night.
4843600	4844600	Oh, God.
4844600	4847680	The show mod was a spinoff of all in the family.
4847680	4848680	Yes, it was.
4848680	4852280	The show Good Times was a spinoff of mod.
4852280	4853280	There's your trivia.
4853280	4854280	Really?
4854280	4855280	Yes.
4855280	4856280	Now you know.
4856280	4857280	And knowing is half the battle.
4857280	4858280	Now I know that...
4858280	4859540	What was the show with Urkel?
4859540	4861960	Family Matters was a spinoff of Perfect Strangers.
4861960	4862960	No.
4862960	4863960	Full House.
4863960	4864960	No.
4864960	4865960	Full House.
4865960	4866960	No, the mother and...
4866960	4867960	God damn it.
4867960	4868960	I will go throw down on this.
4868960	4871600	Family Matters was the elevator person on Perfect Strangers.
4871600	4877080	Yeah, and then the Full House baby was on the other show, so shut up.
4877080	4878080	You shut up.
4878080	4879080	Maybe they were all related.
4879080	4880080	All right, anyway.
4880080	4881080	Hi.
4881080	4882080	We actually talk about video games, not just ABC Friday Night Lineup.
4882080	4883080	Hey, we're not talking about food.
4883080	4884080	That's right, and...
4884080	4889360	But Rob, it's Friday night, and the mood is right.
4889360	4890360	Shut up.
4890360	4891360	I hate you.
4891360	4893680	Gonna have some fun, show you how it's done.
4893680	4894680	T-G-I-F.
4894680	4898480	Okay, what the fuck, Alpha Kinanagram.
4898480	4900200	Why do you...
4900200	4901920	Why don't I have a Jamaican accent?
4901920	4904160	Why do you ask this weird question?
4904160	4907160	All right, I want to point this out, though.
4907160	4909600	But this Cleo is not the Reaper.
4909600	4910600	It's...
4910600	4913120	But she's not Jamaican.
4913120	4915340	I have something very important I need to point out, though.
4915340	4932240	It is not actually T-G-I-F without...
4932240	4938400	Everybody sing along if you know it.
4938400	4939400	I only know the chorus.
4939400	4940400	We have a fast forward.
4940400	4941400	I don't know this part.
4941400	4944400	Yes, I want everyone at home to sing it.
4944400	4945400	Step by step was amazing.
4945400	4946400	Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers.
4946400	4951720	Dude, Suzanne Somers, the makers of the summer-sized diet.
4951720	4953640	They did tell the baby what lesbians were.
4953640	4955640	That was pretty cool.
4955640	4957960	Step by step, day by day.
4957960	4958960	God, these intros were epic.
4958960	4961960	This is a two-minute-long intro for the show.
4961960	4964400	This is the writers had to put in less...
4964400	4968240	Oddly enough, that's two minutes longer than my interest in the show.
4968240	4972080	So, Loki, how about you say...
4972080	4976320	Loki, video games, so we get sick of TV and we turn on a video game.
4976320	4978720	Loki, goddamn, save this show, please.
4978720	4982160	And what would be called the complete opposite of step by step?
4982160	4985080	There was a new Fallout game announced.
4985080	4992800	This one will be taking place in New Vegas, or I guess post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, which
4992800	4995260	we can only expect to be awesome.
4995260	4999440	And it's apparently not a sequel to Fallout 3, but it's just another game in the Fallout
4999440	5001680	universe.
5001680	5004920	In this one, do you start out as a fetus?
5004920	5006120	Maybe.
5006120	5011000	I think it's actually going to go through the whole chain of evolution.
5011000	5012280	You start off as an amoeba.
5012280	5015160	It's half spore, half Fallout.
5015160	5018160	Yeah, you have to make your way to the grand.
5018160	5019160	Well, I mean...
5019160	5020160	You start out as a baby.
5020160	5021160	What?
5021160	5022160	What?
5022160	5023160	Doctor, we can't hear you if you're not saying it in a mic.
5023160	5027040	No, it's just because Melanie was shaking her hand, and I was like, oh, but no, but I was
5027040	5030880	like, no, but you started out as a baby, which I thought was dumb.
5030880	5034760	A lot of people like the intro to Fallout, that you're a baby, because you can press
5034760	5037080	a button to make a baby noise over and over.
5037080	5039120	I wonder if you can press a button to shit.
5039120	5040120	Shut up.
5040120	5041120	All right.
5041120	5045200	For the record, this is the shit show, not the fuck show.
5045200	5046200	All right, look.
5046200	5048200	What was I saying?
5048200	5050480	I don't remember what I was saying, because I'm drinking wine.
5050480	5052680	Yeah, a new Fallout game.
5052680	5053680	Obvious.
5053680	5054680	Hello, hello, Obvious.
5054680	5055680	Of course this is going to make me fall again.
5055680	5057520	Sequel, the successive selling game?
5057520	5058520	Just old.
5058520	5059520	Yeah.
5059520	5061560	Is that Final Fantasy XIV coming out some day?
5061560	5063640	Oh, how about a new Mario game on the Wii?
5063640	5065400	Oh, maybe a new Zelda game in the works?
5065400	5067520	I think they're all happening.
5067520	5070480	Metroid Prime 4, you betcha.
5070480	5071480	So anyhow.
5071480	5077800	They need to do Metroid Primal, where Samus is a cat woman.
5077800	5081180	This is going to be an interesting show, because I haven't eaten much today, so only a little
5081180	5083960	bit of wine that I'm drinking so far is kind of having an effect.
5083960	5084960	I had cake.
5084960	5085960	I want cake.
5085960	5086960	The cake was not a lie.
5086960	5089560	It was made deliciously.
5089560	5091040	Doctor, you keep asking me to take my pants off.
5091040	5092040	I'm going to do it.
5092040	5093040	Just you wait.
5093040	5094040	No!
5094040	5097520	For the love of God and all that is holy, keep your pants on!
5097520	5103160	Which in Jamie speak means, please take your pants off right now!
5103160	5104160	Take off your pants and hide them on your head.
5104160	5108320	Everyone on the internet, on the entirety of the internet, should be thankful that A,
5108320	5113320	this is a radio show, and B, that Justin.tv only shows video of our games now.
5113320	5114320	Aren't you glad you came tonight?
5114320	5116960	We're in slideshow mode tonight anyway.
5116960	5118960	Yes it does.
5118960	5119960	Anyhow.
5119960	5120960	Oh, Microsoft.
5120960	5121960	Hi, Microsoft.
5121960	5127520	Microsoft, with their pants on, had a press conference in Japan this week, and they were
5127520	5131720	saying, hey, Japan, we didn't forget about you, in fact, we've got 31 games that are
5131720	5136800	on their way for the Xbox 360 out here, including some big games that you guys are excited about.
5136800	5143220	Magna Carta 2 in August, End of Eternity, which is a new RPG from Tri-Ace, also Mass
5143220	5147840	Effect is going to be making its way to Japan on May 21st, and I know that's a long time
5147840	5151200	since our release of it, but they've translated it apparently for Japan.
5151200	5158440	Also virtual on Mega Man 9 for Japan in June, Space Invaders Extreme, King of Fighters 2002,
5158440	5162120	just lots and lots of new games coming out in Japan.
5162120	5168240	They also added Pachinko to Mass Effect, which is pretty cool, because every game needs Pachinko.
5168240	5169240	That's a complete lie.
5169240	5170560	A little Pachinko mini-game.
5170560	5173360	I thought that was the Wii that had that, Pachinko mini-games.
5173360	5174360	Alright.
5174360	5180240	Anyway, so there you go, 31 new games coming to Japan, and with that, 31 more Xboxes sold
5180240	5181240	in Japan.
5181240	5182240	That's it.
5182240	5183240	31?
5183240	5184240	Mm-hmm.
5184240	5185240	In a row?
5185240	5187240	31 flavors, and then some.
5187240	5188240	Oooh.
5188240	5189240	Alright.
5189240	5190240	More news, please.
5190240	5191760	How about GTA IV?
5191760	5192760	How about it?
5192760	5197040	It's, I mean, it's getting...
5197040	5199880	It stinks!
5199880	5203000	The peasants are revolting, yeah, they stink on ice.
5203000	5204000	Anyway.
5204000	5208000	GTA IV is getting an Xbox 360 Elite bundle.
5208000	5209000	Get that off my foot.
5209000	5210000	Sorry.
5210000	5211000	It's where it landed.
5211000	5212000	Pass on down.
5212000	5213000	New cup!
5213000	5214000	Move down!
5214000	5215000	Anyway.
5215000	5216000	And no, we didn't go with the teacups, Rob.
5216000	5219200	Did I mention Jamie's been drinking, too, so if this show gets really, really random,
5219200	5220200	I apologize in advance.
5220200	5221200	And it'll be just me.
5221200	5223200	The alcohol's gonna be burned off in about five seconds.
5223200	5224200	True.
5224200	5226200	It is wine.
5226200	5238040	Anyway, there is going to be, later this year, a Grand Theft Auto IV bundle that is going
5238040	5245400	to be for $399, and we have no idea what it's gonna look like.
5245400	5250160	It's basically just like how there's a new bundle that's been announced this week that's
5250160	5251160	coming out.
5251160	5252160	It's got a picture of the games on it.
5252160	5255800	With, well, that's mocked up, but with Fallout, or not Fallout 3.
5255800	5259240	Fallout 2 and Halo 3 that's gonna be coming out, they're gonna be doing this kind of every
5259240	5260400	few weeks.
5260400	5264620	This one, they're speculating, is gonna come out maybe around the time of the new expansion
5264620	5268080	for Grand Theft Auto IV, sometime in the fall.
5268080	5269480	That's actually what I was going to be saying.
5269480	5272440	Well, you stopped talking, so I didn't know.
5272440	5273440	My turn.
5273440	5274440	Go.
5274440	5275440	I'm done.
5275440	5276440	All right.
5276440	5277440	Let me finish!
5277440	5278440	Let me finish!
5278440	5279440	Are you finished?
5279440	5280440	Yeah, I'm finished.
5280440	5287200	All right, well, something else that's coming out, and this can't be good in any way, because
5287200	5289240	it's Driver.
5289240	5297580	Ubisoft has trademarked a new Driver game, and, you know, I'm just, I guess it can't
5297580	5305880	get worse than, you know, it is already, but it's apparently Driver 5, they recruit, and
5305880	5310680	assuming that it's coming to the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we are recruiting you to play
5310680	5311680	our shit game.
5311680	5315800	I hope it's not as bad as all the other Driver games, except for the first one.
5315800	5320820	The first game was awesome, second one was okay, third just went down into the pooper,
5320820	5323680	and then the rest just sucked from there on out.
5323680	5327040	Oh well.
5327040	5332680	But then again, I kind of want to play it, because I liked how crappy they were.
5332680	5338360	All right, well, yeah, you liked how crappy the Driver games were, right?
5338360	5343240	Yes, I actually thought about picking up Driver 3 again, just to play, because it's just that
5343240	5344240	bad.
5344240	5345240	How crappy it is.
5345240	5348800	Yes, I have to remind myself.
5348800	5352800	All right, sounds good.
5352800	5356440	Lego Rock Band, we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago that it was rumored, but
5356440	5361040	fuck, we all knew it was true, and it was finally officially announced, Lego Rock Band
5361040	5362840	is happening.
5362840	5365960	It's happening holiday of this year, as it was announced.
5365960	5369440	Lego Rock Band is going to be coming out on the Playstation 3, the 360, the Wii and the
5369440	5373120	DS, and there's screenshots to prove it, and yes, it's Lego people in a rock band.
5373120	5375680	Mid-November.
5375680	5380960	By the way, some of the songs that will be included in the game, Song 2 by Blur, Carl
5380960	5384880	Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting, Europe with The Final Countdown, Good Charlotte with Boys
5384880	5387800	and Girls, and Pink with So What.
5387800	5391320	So these are kind of like, I guess they're saying more kid-friendly songs, although I
5391320	5392320	don't know.
5392320	5393320	Blur.
5393320	5396680	Pink isn't the most kid-friendly artist in the world, she has some pretty nasty songs,
5396680	5397680	you know what I mean?
5397680	5398680	Blur.
5398680	5399680	You and Your Hand, hello, have you ever heard that song?
5399680	5400680	Blur.
5400680	5403760	I know you like Blur, but we don't know yet if you're going to be able to import these
5403760	5407280	songs into the other games, probably not, if they're trying to keep a kid safe, they're
5407280	5410620	probably going to keep the game segregated, don't you think?
5410620	5417560	It's also being published by Warner Brothers, Warner Games, and not EA, so there's another
5417560	5419280	problem with that too.
5419280	5422480	I would hope that you'd be able to import them because I would like a little bit of
5422480	5427880	Kung Fu Fighting or Final Countdown in Rock Band 2, but I don't know.
5427880	5431960	It doesn't sound bad, if the song list is good, I'd pick it up.
5431960	5435140	By the way, in this game as well, apparently you're going to be able to collect pieces
5435140	5438840	in the regular mode where you build cooler vehicles and go to new venues by building
5438840	5440100	the pieces.
5440100	5444680	There's an extra easy setting for children, I'm assuming, and apparently there will now
5444680	5448640	be challenges in this game, you'll be able to destroy a giant robot, summon a storm,
5448640	5453760	and demolish a skyscraper, all with your drums and guitar and vocals.
5453760	5454760	Awesome.
5454760	5458120	It means you battle with the power of rocking out?
5458120	5463000	Still no word, however, on whether or not it's going to be able, you're going to be
5463000	5468120	able to do the whole exporting of the songs and all that.
5468120	5469120	So there you go.
5469120	5470120	That's it.
5470120	5472720	I could save the world for the power of my walking out.
5472720	5473720	Can you now?
5473720	5474720	Yes.
5474720	5475720	You want to see?
5475720	5476720	No, that's okay.
5476720	5482240	Actually, I can't show anyone because then they'll have to kill you all.
5482240	5483260	This makes me happy.
5483260	5488640	This makes my insides quiver with delight.
5488640	5489640	What am I?
5489640	5490640	Ew.
5490640	5494440	I was talking about my liver.
5494440	5495440	I was talking about my liver.
5495440	5496720	I think I just burped.
5496720	5497840	You made my liver quiver.
5497840	5500840	Hey, Justin TV's complaining it's boring because there's no games going on.
5500840	5501840	Play something.
5501840	5502840	Is anyone going to play a video game?
5502840	5503840	Damn it.
5503840	5504840	Stop complaining.
5504840	5505840	Jesus Christ.
5505840	5509560	Play a goddamn game, Rice Princess.
5509560	5510560	Play something easy.
5510560	5511560	It'll keep them entertained.
5511560	5512560	I can't.
5512560	5513560	It's all hard.
5513560	5514560	Irene.
5514560	5516880	I can try to play a game, but I'm doing the show.
5516880	5518360	I'm drunk too, so I don't know if...
5518360	5519360	No, I'm not drunk.
5519360	5520360	Dr. Mario.
5520360	5521360	Little buzz.
5521360	5522360	Just play.
5522360	5523360	Rob's Wiener.
5523360	5524480	Don't play Rob's Wiener.
5524480	5525480	Don't do that.
5525480	5526480	Hug what?
5526480	5527480	In lap?
5527480	5528480	Phone?
5528480	5529480	What?
5529480	5530480	Oh my word.
5530480	5531480	We're translating.
5531480	5532480	Okay.
5532480	5533960	Xbox Live Arcade.
5533960	5539760	Well, SNK people are doing drugs and they're doing happy drugs that make me happy and want
5539760	5540760	to do drugs...
5540760	5541760	Wait.
5541760	5542760	Wrong way.
5542760	5543760	Anyway.
5543760	5550400	A game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, which is called King of Fighters Sky Stage.
5550400	5551400	Aw.
5551400	5554200	What are you doing to me?
5554200	5555200	Stop it.
5555200	5556200	He's doing a shoulder.
5556200	5558060	I'm being raped during the show, I want to point out.
5558060	5559060	Shoulder rape.
5559060	5560720	I was just raped live on air.
5560720	5562920	Because you took your pants off.
5562920	5564120	I did not take my pants off.
5564120	5565120	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
5565120	5567600	How many of us are not wearing socks and shoes?
5567600	5569480	Myself, you and Loki.
5569480	5571160	Mississippi or G.
5571160	5574160	Shut up and read your story.
5574160	5576120	Anyway.
5576120	5580520	The game is coming out called King of Fighters Sky Stage, which is your King of Fighters
5580520	5587440	characters flying around and shooting stuff out of their hands.
5587440	5588680	They're bullets.
5588680	5591160	They're shooting people.
5591160	5594940	This article is actually really freaking wrong because this has been done before in a game
5594940	5600360	called Psychic Storm that I actually have on Turbo Duo.
5600360	5605960	But yeah, you're flying around and you're shooting shit with the power of your psychoticness.
5605960	5608040	Or if you're Kyo, then it's fire.
5608040	5610120	Are we going to see Mai's tits or not?
5610120	5611120	That's the big question we want to know about this game.
5611120	5617920	The only characters that I'm seeing in the screenshots here are Kyo and Athena.
5617920	5625720	And Athena's shooting, it looks like eggs out of her head, like pink and white eggs.
5625720	5627520	Wow.
5627520	5630440	She's shooting dots, Dippin' Dots at people.
5630440	5633800	Kyo is shooting fire.
5633800	5637280	And as we all know, fire makes everything better.
5637280	5639920	What are you playing, Rygar?
5639920	5642680	Out of all the games she could play, she's playing Rygar?
5642680	5643680	Really?
5643680	5644680	Really?
5644680	5647040	Dan was playing Rygar the other day on MAME.
5647040	5650520	Yeah, that was the cool Rygar was the arcade one.
5650520	5651520	This one's the...
5651520	5652520	The tickle monster...
5652520	5654880	Yeah, you need to be playing Karnov.
5654880	5655880	No, I'm just kidding.
5655880	5656880	I actually really like Rygar.
5656880	5657880	I'm just kidding.
5657880	5659400	Hey, just stop tickling me on air!
5659400	5661400	It's not funny!
5661400	5663400	Leave me alone.
5663400	5664400	Rob.
5664400	5665400	Alright, what?
5665400	5666400	Rob.
5666400	5667400	What?
5667400	5668400	Rob.
5668400	5669400	Rob.
5669400	5670400	What?
5670400	5671400	Rob.
5671400	5672400	Stop it.
5672400	5673400	Bob.
5673400	5674400	Bob.
5674400	5675400	What?
5675400	5679040	Do you know what a crappy show this is tonight?
5679040	5682040	Because you holler not to get on top of it.
5682040	5683040	This is an awesome show!
5683040	5684040	This is a poopy show.
5684040	5687280	It's only poopy if you take off your pants.
5687280	5689960	I swear to God, one more time and the pants are coming off.
5689960	5691520	Irene is not shitting her pants.
5691520	5692520	Rob.
5692520	5693520	Rob.
5693520	5694520	Rob.
5694520	5695520	Rob.
5695520	5696520	Rob.
5696520	5697520	Rob.
5697520	5698520	Rob.
5698520	5699520	Rob.
5699520	5700520	Rob.
5700520	5701520	Rob.
5701520	5702520	Rob.
5702520	5703520	Rob.
5703520	5704520	Rob.
5704520	5705520	Rob.
5705520	5706520	Rob.
5706520	5707520	Rob.
5707520	5708520	Well, that's my sort of stupid story.
5708520	5709520	Do you have one?
5709520	5710520	I know.
5710520	5711520	Loki, please save the show.
5711520	5712520	Yes.
5712520	5714960	Muramasa Demon Blade lost its publisher earlier this week.
5714960	5716440	Which is not good.
5716440	5718760	But at least it picked up a new one.
5718760	5721700	And that new publisher would be Ignition Entertainment.
5721700	5727840	However, because the publisher changed, the game will now be coming out in September instead
5727840	5728840	of June.
5728840	5731180	But hey, at least it's still coming out.
5731180	5733280	And it's actually kind of fun.
5733280	5737280	I wish I knew what was going on. So English might help with that.
5737280	5741280	English is useful. It is useful.
5741280	5745280	Is this the same game you had here a couple weeks ago?
5745280	5749280	Yes. And I thought it was like coming out like next week
5749280	5753280	or something. It already had to get pushed back because of that? No, it wasn't coming out like next week
5753280	5757280	it was coming out in June originally.
5757280	5761280	But yeah. So it came out in Japan already.
5761280	5765280	Alright. A game that has not come out yet is Street Fighter 4.
5765280	5769280	On the PC, not the consoles obviously, but
5769280	5773280	Street Fighter 4 has not made its way to the PC just yet. Apparently there is a PC version
5773280	5777280	in the works. You've probably heard about it before. Apparently the game is actually
5777280	5781280	going to be bundled with fighting sticks. Maybe. They haven't said one way or the other if it will
5781280	5785280	for sure or not yet. However, it has been announced on the official Japanese
5785280	5789280	Street Fighter 4 blog that they will be announcing the PC version's release
5789280	5793280	date on May 1st. So yes, I am reporting
5793280	5797280	an announcement of an announcement of a game that's already out.
5797280	5801280	I mean really. Really. I'm blinking audibly
5801280	5805280	but the mic can't be picked up.
5805280	5809280	Is it really worth this much hype for the PC version of the game?
5809280	5813280	Don't get me wrong. I understand there are some PC gamers. Street Fighter 4 is a great game.
5813280	5817280	There is an audience of people very happy about this. But really, we need a release date
5817280	5821280	for a release date. Come on. Get off your high horse
5821280	5825280	Capcom. Just tell us the date. Just tell us the date.
5825280	5829280	Stop making people wait.
5829280	5833280	Articles like this make me angry and when I get angry, naughty music plays
5833280	5837280	and it brings on a segment called The Effies of the Week.
5837280	5851280	Music plays
5851280	5855280	I do want to point out Leo Shannon in the chat makes a good point. If Street Fighter 4 is out
5855280	5859280	on the PC, nude mods. That might be worth it. Alright, DarkSakura
5859280	5863280	your Effies of the Week.
5863280	5867280	I'm attracted to being way too much from Disney. I have way too much shit to do.
5867280	5871280	Fair enough. Way too much shit to do. All before Friday.
5871280	5875280	Uh, Loki. I'm Fe2, the squirrel
5875280	5879280	that is bothering my cat because the squirrel has figured out
5879280	5883280	that we have bird seed on the porch and so I decided to try
5883280	5887280	to dig out all the sunflower seeds that are in there and my cat
5887280	5891280	can't get to it so it frustrates the hell out of her.
5891280	5895280	I put more bird seed on the porch. But it's still funny.
5895280	5899280	But yeah, since she can't give an F.U. because she's a cat
5899280	5903280	F.U. bird seed. Meow meow meow meow meow meow. Exactly. Meow meow
5903280	5907280	Meow. Uh, my F.U. of the week goes to
5907280	5911280	this program. Belly Belly, what's your
5911280	5915280	F.U. of the week? My F.U. of the week goes to going to a celebration
5915280	5919280	party, getting really stupid and doing something really stupid.
5919280	5923280	That's never fun when we wake up in the morning and go, that was
5923280	5927280	stupid. Uh, Rice Princess
5927280	5931280	the doctor, do you have any F.U.s? Come over here and say them on the mic.
5931280	5935280	F.U. Rob for not being pantless.
5935280	5939280	Uh, yes Rice Princess. F.U.
5939280	5943280	is shitting in your pants. That can be
5943280	5947280	a day ruiner right there. Alright. Good lord.
5947280	5951280	Let's try to change the tune of the show a little bit
5951280	5955280	by going on into a classier segment, I hope. Because it's the part
5955280	5959280	where we let the listeners take over for a little bit and direct the show with their emails.
5959280	5963280	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
5963280	5967280	Dark Soccer is going to open up the mailbag and jump on in and
5967280	5971280	hear from you guys, the listeners. Then I'll need a ton
5971280	5975280	of sanitizer. Oh my god. Anyway, first email.
5975280	5979280	This comes from Rini.
5979280	5983280	This is to chime in briefly on the recent feature they should have put
5983280	5987280	on the DSI that would have made Rob buy a DSI. Loki commented
5987280	5991280	that the music player sucks because it only supports AAC. In reality
5991280	5995280	AAC is superior to MP3. AAC's main strength is that it
5995280	5999280	can achieve the same quality of sound that MP3 would have at higher bit rates and
5999280	6003280	smaller file sizes. The whole albums in MP3 will decrease in megabytes when
6003280	6007280	they're converted to AAC. If there's something to bitch about
6007280	6011280	DSI sound, it's that it really
6011280	6015280	accepts M4A, MP4, and 3GP files
6015280	6019280	because they're the container for the AAC audio. For what it does
6019280	6023280	the DSI music player is actually competent feature-wise for a basic music player.
6023280	6027280	There's no real playlist function, but who uses those on a portable
6027280	6031280	device? I have an iPhone. Just to
6031280	6035280	put this out there and not really make a big deal out of it, for anyone undecided on purchasing
6035280	6039280	a DSI, take it from someone who owns one. You're buying into potential.
6039280	6043280	I'm sure there's tons of things that Nintendo can do and I'm hoping they'll
6043280	6047280	go through with some of the nearly 40 trademarks that were discovered
6047280	6051280	shortly after the Japanese unveiling. I'll link that later.
6051280	6055280	But if you need a GBA slot
6055280	6059280	and don't want the fancy crap, get a light. The camera is shit. The browser is a
6059280	6063280	last resort, but the DSI shop sounds great and
6063280	6067280	I want to see what developers can do with the upgraded processor, larger memory,
6067280	6071280	and the camera for gamers.
6071280	6075280	There's also more. There's a PS.
6075280	6079280	I apologize. I'm still not sold. I mean, we need to see more.
6079280	6083280	PS. Warriorware snapped is an insult both as a game and to the series.
6083280	6087280	Don't spend 500 points free or bought on a game. You'll only play once.
6087280	6091280	I didn't. PPS. Skye, when the next class
6091280	6095280	update for Team Fortress 2 comes out, you're getting my invite for a free weekend.
6095280	6099280	Team Fortress 2 has classes attuned to your play style, can't aim for shit,
6099280	6103280	or maybe you've bought the orange box for $10 from Steam's weekend sale. And it's today.
6103280	6107280	I wish I had. No, I already have Portal. That was the game I wanted most in there.
6107280	6111280	I suck at Team Fortress.
6111280	6115280	That's why you get the special classes. We'll see.
6115280	6119280	I'm just really horrible at first-person shooters. Words do not do my
6119280	6123280	suckage justice, if that makes sense.
6123280	6127280	Unless you don't want to throw up every time you play one. That would be me.
6127280	6131280	Or even watch someone play one shoot. More email.
6131280	6135280	Hi, LLR! Hi, happy listener.
6135280	6139280	I just thought I'd mention a few things. First off, there was a glaring error in the email
6139280	6143280	I sent you last week, specifically in regards to some of the Capcom games
6143280	6147280	with PSN. I had mistakenly said SNK vs. Capcom 2
6147280	6151280	instead of Marvel vs. Capcom. To my credit,
6151280	6155280	once I did catch the error, I left you a voice message, but I guess the message was overlooked accidentally.
6155280	6159280	I don't do the voicemail, so whatever.
6159280	6163280	I just want to correct that bit of news
6163280	6167280	for a fellow listener's sake more than anything else.
6167280	6171280	By the way, if you three haven't already, try picking up Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection.
6171280	6175280	Yes, I have it. I picked it up a few weeks ago, partially due to Bobby Blackwell's recommendation.
6175280	6179280	In a nutshell, it's 40 games for 30 bucks. You really can't get much better than that
6179280	6183280	unless Sega pays us to take their games. Sarcasm.
6183280	6187280	If I had to recommend one version
6187280	6191280	over another, I'd have to pick the PS3 version, although fundamentally the same.
6191280	6195280	The 360 already has many of the games within the collection on the Xbox Live Arcade.
6195280	6199280	Nods are most of us have at least some of them.
6199280	6203280	How about multiple copies of each?
6203280	6207280	Really, there's no sense in getting two copies of the game for the same system.
6207280	6211280	Yeah, there is. As with the PS3 version, this marks the first time
6211280	6215280	some of these games make an appearance, plus they have trophy support.
6215280	6219280	Let's face it, Sony really needs to ramp up trophy support.
6219280	6223280	I'm sorry, typos are...
6223280	6227280	Only downside to either version is that neither would have online co-op.
6227280	6231280	It's not a deal breaker by any means, but it would have been a nice feature nonetheless.
6231280	6235280	Sorry this email ran so long, I'll try to keep future ones a tad shorter.
6235280	6239280	This email was brought to you by your local 7-11, home of the Street Date Broken Games,
6239280	6243280	20 year old hot dogs, Slurpees, back galley crack dealers, and hookers.
6243280	6247280	Who is this from? It's from Spazinator. Hi, Spazinator.
6247280	6251280	Dude, I don't want a hooker. 7-11 is pretty awesome, actually.
6251280	6255280	Just so I can smack one. Slurpees are amazing. Just so I can smack a bitch.
6255280	6259280	Anyway, last email. This is from
6259280	6263280	Jacob.
6263280	6267280	Hey, OLR. I have not been in chat or called in before, but I have been
6267280	6271280	a regular podcast listener for a couple of years now. The show gives me some laughs
6271280	6275280	and a decent update on the gaming world. I wish I could game more like I used to,
6275280	6279280	but life demands a great deal of time. Oh fuck, yes it does. Preach. Truth.
6279280	6283280	But I do try to keep up with some games that interest me.
6283280	6287280	Mirror's Edge was a great concept, but way too short. I'm sick and tired of
6287280	6291280	shooters and have been playing Street Fighter IV. Dead Space was
6291280	6295280	made precisely for me, and
6295280	6299280	I fell in love with it instantly. Do you guys think EA will let the
6299280	6303280	team give it a sequel? I really like Gears and constantly wonder why the
6303280	6307280	OLR team bashes it. I don't think I've bashed it. I just don't care about it.
6307280	6311280	I would say I bashed it. I respect the game, but I am terrible
6311280	6315280	at first person shooters, so that's why you don't hear me talk about it much. I think
6315280	6319280	I might have said something on a previous show where I just didn't get that into it, and I think the reason
6319280	6323280	why is just, you know, I was not a big fan of the whole cover, because
6323280	6327280	I'm only decent at first person shooters like Quake Live or Quake 3, where
6327280	6331280	I can just run out there like a crazy motherfucker and just blow away everybody.
6331280	6335280	But Gears of War is all about the stealth and hiding and cover, and I get that
6335280	6339280	if you're a shooting game fan. I get why that's alluring. I get the strategy
6339280	6343280	involved in that. I get where the game is there. It's just not for me, because I suck
6343280	6371280	at first person shooters really bad.
6373280	6377280	Thank you, Jacob.
6377280	6381280	I'm gonna make the same recommendation I do to a lot of people at 360.
6381280	6385280	Rez. Rez. Rez, especially if you're like a, you know,
6385280	6389280	kind of like a motion game that's always moving. I think Rez is, like, you know, you want
6389280	6393280	an outside the box type of game, I think Rez is a good start. If you don't already have it.
6393280	6397280	There's also plenty to download. Like, I mean, if you want to go old school, you do have Castlevania
6397280	6401280	Symphony of the Night, and you've also got,
6401280	6405280	I haven't played it, but I know a lot of people recommend Braid.
6405280	6409280	I like Braid a lot. I definitely recommend Braid. But, you know, that's kind of, like, if he hasn't already got that,
6409280	6413280	if he's been listening to this show any amount of time or following the game blogs, as he probably does,
6413280	6417280	I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have that. Well, just to follow up, did you actually read the list
6417280	6421280	of, to the earlier email, did you read the list of
6421280	6425280	DSI
6425280	6429280	patents? Not the full list, no. Oh, lord.
6429280	6433280	There's quite a number of these. There's actually a trademark for 3D Picross.
6433280	6437280	You already have that.
6437280	6441280	That's already out. Is it? DS Navi, DS Phone, DS Plus,
6441280	6445280	DS Point, DS School, DS Speak, DS Shop, DS Shopping, DS Trainer,
6445280	6449280	DS Time, DS Walk. That doesn't mean they're making all these things. I know, but I just think it's funny.
6449280	6453280	Protecting their rights, you know what I mean? I think it's funny.
6453280	6457280	Just what they, it's gotta be that they have some ideas for it.
6457280	6461280	One of them is DSI Sushine, which is DSI communication.
6461280	6465280	So, I think it'd be cool.
6465280	6469280	Alright, well if you want to send us a mail, email, sorry, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send
6469280	6473280	us our mail. Mailbag, Orangelaunchradio.com. I hope we hear from you next week.
6473280	6477280	But please stop sending spam. Christ, we have to clean up so much
6477280	6481280	spam out of that box. In my personal box. I have so much spam.
6481280	6485280	Spam needs to die in a fire. I love Shadowgate, by the way, which is the game that's
6485280	6489280	I don't even know if Justin.TV's working anymore. I kind of suck at Shadowgate.
6489280	6493280	This is the game that Eddie's playing right now. Good times. Do you have to go in the door and everything's on fire?
6493280	6497280	Alright. Well,
6497280	6501280	there's some interesting, we knew this was coming, but
6501280	6505280	it's getting more official day by day. The court has approved the Square Enix
6505280	6509280	bio of Eidos. So, assume we'll have
6509280	6513280	Square, Square Enix, or
6513280	6517280	I don't know how to, too many companies to combine together.
6517280	6521280	Squito, Squinodos.
6521280	6525280	Squitodox, there we go.
6525280	6529280	But anyway, so that's actually supposed to be happening pretty soon here.
6529280	6533280	That's neat, I guess.
6533280	6537280	Maybe we'll see some better games come out from them.
6537280	6541280	Maybe Tomb Raider. What has Eidos done for us lately? I
6541280	6545280	say, fuck them. Tomb Raider.
6545280	6549280	What has Eidos done for us lately? I say, fuck them.
6549280	6553280	We need a new cute name for them, though. Squinixdos.
6553280	6557280	Squinodos. Squinodos.
6557280	6561280	Okay. Well, they also own Taito, so. Squinodos Taito.
6561280	6565280	I don't, this is getting too... Taito!
6565280	6569280	Squitox. Just call it Square. Square Idots. Square and Friends.
6569280	6573280	I like that. Square and Friends. I like that.
6573280	6577280	This Square is a lie. Well, alright, I don't know if, you might have to think of a name for this merger,
6577280	6581280	but apparently, Warner Brothers Interactive is contemplating
6581280	6585280	a purchase of Midway, which as you know, has just been hemorrhaging money
6585280	6589280	and they're in the news every week about how just, you know, in crappy shape the company is
6589280	6593280	in. We'll call that a clusterfuck. Those poor guys. Warner, by the way, lost
6593280	6597280	the Eidos bid to Squinix, so Warner apparently is
6597280	6601280	now looking at possibly picking up Midway. It's an anonymous source, it's tipping
6601280	6605280	that's leaked to all these blogs. Warner is pretty confident that they will get Midway.
6605280	6609280	They are ready to put the money on the table. Possibly the whole
6609280	6613280	30 million bucks to pick up Mortal Kombat and stuff,
6613280	6617280	I guess. I don't know what else Midway's got, besides
6617280	6621280	their pretty cool collections and things.
6621280	6625280	That's what they get. They could be making, you know,
6625280	6629280	instead of, well, not pinball tables because Williams abandoned us, the bastards,
6629280	6633280	but they could be making, you know, tons of slot machines, but no.
6633280	6637280	What if that means we'll have a
6637280	6641280	Mortal Kombat vs. DC 2? Ooh. Because doesn't Warner
6641280	6645280	and DC kind of have a thingy? Yeah, Warner Brothers. There you go.
6645280	6649280	We'll see. Moving on, a little more news, then we're going to get to the
6649280	6653280	Skype line in just a little bit. Well, how about
6653280	6657280	something that should make everyone happy?
6657280	6661280	PAX details! And everyone said yay!
6661280	6665280	Yay, I hope I can afford it this year. September 4th,
6665280	6669280	in Seattle, we will be having PAX, and they are going
6669280	6673280	to have over 60 exhibitors. That means, again, Microsoft,
6673280	6677280	Nintendo, Valve, Blizzard. Sony isn't on the list,
6677280	6681280	and who cares? They weren't there last year. Oh no, they were there last year.
6681280	6685280	That's right, that was the first time we played LittleBigPlanet. That's interesting, they're not on the list
6685280	6689280	yet. Also, they're going to
6689280	6693280	have Freezepop, Jonathan Colton, yay!
6693280	6697280	Would you have to do another MySpace photo? So we're all the same shit as last year?
6697280	6701280	Well, some different people. There's MC Frontalot, of course.
6701280	6705280	Anamanaguchi, who was there last year, Metroid Metal, and
6705280	6709280	Paul and Storm. So not everyone there is listed, but...
6709280	6713280	Like, four of those bands were all there last year, which is fine. They're all great.
6713280	6717280	Don't get me wrong, it's all great bands. This time, I'm going to go see Jonathan Colton, and none of you can
6717280	6721280	stop me. Alright, you go on with your bad self.
6721280	6725280	Because he's awesome!
6725280	6729280	He has cool hair. I hope we can afford to go to PAX, we'll see though. E3 is coming up
6729280	6733280	though. By the way, OLR will be at E3. At least myself
6733280	6737280	and Loki, DarkSakuras, and maybe at this point, but we're all confirmed. I'm broke, so if someone was to pay, then I'll go.
6737280	6741280	Well, good luck. We're all broke.
6741280	6745280	But E3... I already got my confirmation and my tickets
6745280	6749280	and my stuff, all booked. You got your ticket? Oh, like flight tickets?
6749280	6753280	I have my flight, I've got my Disneyland, shit, I'm ready to go.
6753280	6757280	You're good to go. Ready to rock.
6757280	6761280	So, let's see. There's some interesting stuff going down with
6761280	6765280	Gamefly. Apparently, they are filing suit
6765280	6769280	against the United States Postal Service over breakage rates
6769280	6773280	and preferential treatment. Their complaint is that
6773280	6777280	basically the USPS has adapted a new practice
6777280	6781280	of manually pulling out the DVD mailers of both
6781280	6785280	Netflix and Blockbuster online for special processing.
6785280	6789280	However, Gamefly has tried to get the same kind of treatment, but it has been denied.
6789280	6793280	And also, they've noticed that there's
6793280	6797280	quite a bit of in-transit breakage and also theft.
6797280	6801280	And they're not too happy about that. And they've actually tried to take some
6801280	6805280	measures to fix that. I wonder if the Postal Service is hiring.
6805280	6809280	Change the color of their mailers and stuff like that, but
6809280	6813280	it's still a problem. What color are their
6813280	6817280	mailers? Are they bright neon green and orange? They used to be orange, and now they're white.
6817280	6821280	No wonder they stick out, you know? Well, they're probably trying to save money
6821280	6825280	on the ink. I'm surprised Netflix doesn't have the same problems with those
6825280	6829280	very distinctive red envelopes. I'm sure they do, but games are more valuable than
6829280	6833280	movies. Would you steal games if you worked for the Postal Service?
6833280	6837280	If I wanted to be fired and arrested, yeah.
6837280	6841280	Just curious. I didn't know you should. No, I probably wouldn't, because
6841280	6845280	you know, it's too easy to find them online.
6845280	6849280	Alright, hey, we've talked a little bit about DJ Games coming out later this year.
6849280	6853280	Of course, with the whole dispute going on with Scratch and DJ Hero. There's a
6853280	6857280	DS game, actually, that's going to be incorporating DJing that's come out.
6857280	6861280	It's coming from a French developer called Game Life. They have just announced a game this week called
6861280	6865280	DJ Star, and it's coming out this year for the Nintendo DS.
6865280	6869280	It's going to be published by Deep Silver in Europe and Australia, and in this game you're going to start
6869280	6873280	as a DJ, and you gain experience, and you start as a lowly club DJ, and
6873280	6877280	finally you go stadiums with tons and tons of people. You are going to mix
6877280	6881280	over 40 famous tracks in different genres, and you can actually save
6881280	6885280	your creations on the DS card, and you can trade your creations with
6885280	6889280	your friends on wireless communications. It's also coming out over here also
6889280	6893280	by Deep Silver in July. It was supposed to be coming out in two weeks,
6893280	6897280	which sucks, but, you know, now, later on.
6897280	6901280	Interesting. I'd be curious to check this out. I want to hear more about it
6901280	6905280	and what the game is in it, because I didn't hear a lot about what the game is. It's just that you can
6905280	6909280	mix stuff. Well, what's the game? That's what I kind of want to know right now.
6909280	6913280	It's hard to tell. We'll see.
6913280	6917280	Anyway, a few more stories, then we're going to get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
6917280	6921280	our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. XLink would like to point out
6921280	6925280	that the penalty for stealing mail is up to five years in jail and a $250,000
6925280	6929280	fine. I didn't say you should steal mail. I was just curious if, you know,
6929280	6933280	people apparently are getting away with it. So, yep.
6933280	6937280	Let's move on. DarkSakura. Um, do you want a gun?
6937280	6941280	Not really, because I'm one of those people that I'm afraid if I had a gun in my house, I'd shoot myself with it
6941280	6945280	somehow. Like, I'm seriously deathly afraid that if a gun is in my house
6945280	6949280	I will be killed with it. That's why you need to take gun safety courses. No, but I don't,
6949280	6953280	that doesn't necessarily mean I will be the one killing myself with the gun. I would like to think I'm not
6953280	6957280	that stupid, where I'm like, oh, gee, I need to get out my gun and dust it.
6957280	6961280	La la la, dust the gun. Ooh, fuck, I just shot myself in the face. Dust it with live ammo in it.
6961280	6965280	That's kinda retarded. I just feel like I'm, I'm, I'm the stupid
6965280	6969280	person that would do that. Or that I'm also paranoid if I had a gun in my house and somebody would break into my house
6969280	6973280	know where my gun is and shoot me with it. Like, I'm just, I know it's my, probably an irrational fear
6973280	6977280	I have a fear of a gun in my house. I was actually just trying to say that as a lead into the story.
6977280	6981280	Sorry, I'm buzzed.
6981280	6985280	Anyway, um, a, uh, a middle school kid
6985280	6989280	brought in a gun and caused, um, the
6989280	6993280	school to be locked down, but you know what he brought it for? He brought it to trade
6993280	6997280	for PSP. Sure, trade for PSP, rob for
6997280	7001280	PSP, it's all the same. He swiped it out of his, um, dad's collection, the gun
7001280	7005280	was unloaded, but he did bring ammo with him, and he was gonna trade it.
7005280	7009280	Um, so, also his dad said a second gun was missing
7009280	7013280	and the kid's locked up in juvie right now, so, stupid child.
7013280	7017280	Um, how did he get the gun? Stupid father. I was gonna say,
7017280	7021280	is it just, I mean, the parent's slightly depraved in your shoes. You leave this shit locked up!
7021280	7025280	First, okay, first of all, if you're going to have
7025280	7029280	a gun in your house, if you're going to have multiple guns, that's why you have a gun locker.
7029280	7033280	That's why you make sure they are always unloaded,
7033280	7037280	clean, with the safety on, and locked up in your damn gun locker, and if you
7037280	7041280	keep a loaded gun by your desk, you make sure the safety's on. And I just wanna say,
7041280	7045280	even though I have my rant that I will not have a gun in my house, that doesn't mean
7045280	7049280	that somebody else can't have a gun in their house. There is a, like, this thing called the
7049280	7053280	Tonsitution that allows you to have a gun in your house if you want.
7053280	7057280	The Tonsitution? The Tonsitution, is that what I call it? Shut up!
7057280	7061280	Look, my point is, you can have a gun in your house if you want,
7061280	7065280	I choose to not have one in mine, and I'm allowed that choice.
7065280	7069280	By the Tonsitution. I, by the way, do still think
7069280	7073280	that Penn and Teller said it best, that you take every woman in America
7073280	7077280	and give them each a pink gun, and it's pink because they said so,
7077280	7081280	and then it doesn't matter if they keep it, give it away, whatever, no one's gonna know
7081280	7085280	who has the gun, and it'll make a safer society.
7085280	7089280	Make guns that match handbags, yeah,
7089280	7093280	perfect. Actually, I wanna have a gun. I really want a gun, but I would,
7093280	7097280	but because you can't have a concealed weapon, I would wear it on a holster.
7097280	7101280	Just everywhere you go, don't bring it here.
7101280	7105280	I'd leave it in my car. Oh yeah, you can leave it in the car, there's no money in my house.
7105280	7109280	Because I would be afraid, I would be shot with it. Like during a break or something, like you'd trip and fall and the gun would go off
7109280	7113280	and shoot me in the foot, like I just, I have these horrible, hey Rob,
7113280	7117280	look at me juggle these guns! Exactly!
7117280	7121280	Like, Loki would be like, can I touch your gun, Dark Sakura?
7121280	7125280	Bang! Shoot me in the face. Let me throw the gun at Rob, and hopefully it'll go off
7125280	7129280	and shoot him. First of all, if I had a gun, I would not
7129280	7133280	just... Ooh, look at my gun! Ooh!
7133280	7137280	Look at this, it's loaded and everything, I'm gonna look down the barrel, rah!
7137280	7141280	Why don't you put it in your mouth? My gun would be pink, my gun would be black and
7141280	7145280	hot rod red. Ho ho, I'm Kurt Cobain.
7145280	7149280	Like, I think I should, like, you know how some people are afraid of water, some people
7149280	7153280	are afraid of heights? People are seriously
7153280	7157280	afraid of water! People with green skin named Alfalo. We all have a friend that's
7157280	7161280	afraid of water, like, swimming type water, and that type of stuff.
7161280	7165280	No, but I mean, like, being surrounded by water, not drinking water,
7165280	7169280	bodies of water, oh god, you guys are jerks. Alright, no, I'm talking about, I think I
7169280	7173280	seriously have a fear of guns, being pointed at me.
7173280	7177280	That's probably a rational fear, but it's actually
7177280	7181280	a rational fear. No, I think it's irrational, I think
7181280	7185280	that it's paranoid. It is! First of all, I'll tell you this right now, Rob, if you've
7185280	7189280	got someone who has a gun, who is, who
7189280	7193280	knows how to use it, and knows how to take care of it, you are not in any
7193280	7197280	danger. I don't even want a chocolate gun, like that's...
7197280	7201280	God, you're a baby!
7201280	7205280	You're just now learning this? No, but I like saying it.
7205280	7209280	I'll bring a chocolate gun into your house and it'll shoot you.
7209280	7213280	It'll shoot you with yummy! You'll get shot with tastiness.
7213280	7217280	I don't even like water guns.
7217280	7221280	I'm not joking, I don't even like water guns. Rob, you would have, you would have hated
7221280	7225280	you would have hated my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil.
7225280	7229280	I had the Resident Evil one and I carried around two very
7229280	7233280	realistic looking uzis. SH2100Matt says, so wait,
7233280	7237280	was Rob freaked out when Loki brought his airsofts to the studio? Um...
7237280	7241280	Ah! Ah! Kinda, actually, like, when he
7241280	7245280	raises them up, I do get a little nervous. Yes, I don't want to get shot in the ass.
7245280	7249280	Why do you think I don't go out to play? It doesn't hurt that bad!
7249280	7253280	I don't like, why do you think I haven't gone out to play? I'm just gonna come in and shoot
7253280	7257280	him one of these days so he can see, he can see how not bad it is. Why would you do that?
7257280	7261280	That's it. Don't shoot Rob!
7261280	7265280	Remember kids, don't shoot Rob. Rob is food. Shoot me in a
7265280	7269280	video game all you want, because I know the difference. That's it, that's it. Next week, Nerf battle.
7269280	7273280	This is not Nerf battle. This is not Nerf battle. Get Rob
7273280	7277280	over the gun thing by shooting him with everything you can find.
7277280	7281280	That is just gonna make it worse. For the
7281280	7285280	record. Okay, no,
7285280	7289280	I say I'll bring a Nerf gatling gun and shoot Rob
7289280	7293280	in the ass. They have those. I know, I saw it, I wanted one.
7293280	7297280	I have a Nerf revolver.
7297280	7301280	Okay, I have to ask, I'm sorry, chat room, I haven't read from chat in a while and of course they're all
7301280	7305280	teasing me right now, but what I want to know, am I,
7305280	7309280	somebody in chat has to understand what I'm saying about guns.
7309280	7313280	Like is somebody in chat willing to admit that they have a gun fear as well?
7313280	7317280	Please, somebody. Just make it up so I don't feel so bad.
7317280	7321280	I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what my thing about the gun safety
7321280	7325280	hysteria is, is that I think that the gun safety
7325280	7329280	hysteria is bullshit, plain out bullshit.
7329280	7333280	I think that
7333280	7337280	people, if you were in an area where
7337280	7341280	it is listed in big labels that no one there is gonna be able
7341280	7345280	to protect themselves, we know what that says to a criminal mind,
7345280	7349280	fair fucking game. If you were in a place where you
7349280	7353280	know that anyone could be armed, are you gonna really try something
7353280	7357280	unless you're phenomenally stupid? That's what I have to,
7357280	7361280	people are phenomenally stupid, and if someone breaks into my house
7361280	7365280	they deserve to get their ass shot. End of story.
7365280	7369280	Maybe it's not guns I have a problem with, because like Cuzar is a lot of fun.
7369280	7373280	It's projectiles I have a problem with, I don't like projectiles.
7373280	7377280	I would not like that either, no. What if I had rocks?
7377280	7383280	Can I read some comments from chat?
7383280	7387280	Xlink says I have a gun fear, that is why I have a gun.
7387280	7391280	Digital says everyone fears guns, sir.
7391280	7395280	Brad says I don't owe one because I'm too damn hot headed.
7395280	7399280	I like old people says yes Rob you are a pussy, well meow meow meow.
7399280	7403280	Decipher says I hate guns.
7403280	7407280	Reisman says you gotta say this over here, because we can't hear you otherwise.
7407280	7411280	Someone's afraid of guns
7411280	7415280	so he has a gun? If you're afraid of being shot with one you shoot
7415280	7419280	before you get shot. That could be it, I could see that. I mean, but I'll tell you what
7419280	7423280	the whole rationale, and see honestly, if you don't feel comfortable
7423280	7427280	with a gun, don't have one. You live in America, that's your fucking right.
7427280	7431280	Shake your hand ma'am, I'm with you on that, yes.
7431280	7435280	At the same time, if you feel that you either want a gun
7435280	7439280	or feel like you need to protect yourself, say that you live in a dangerous neighborhood,
7439280	7443280	but say you've been living there for, like those older people who live in what was once a nice neighborhood
7443280	7447280	that's gone downhill, who want to have some means of protecting
7447280	7451280	themselves, then you can protect yourself.
7451280	7455280	For example, I know a lot of women who carry a gun
7455280	7459280	because, I mean let's face it, on a general level
7459280	7463280	physically, men for the most part are stronger
7463280	7467280	physically again than a woman, unless she's a
7467280	7471280	black belt and can kick him in the face. But still, you have to deal
7471280	7475280	with, it's the great equalizer.
7475280	7479280	I think that as long as
7479280	7483280	you, as long as you feel
7483280	7487280	that you want to
7487280	7491280	have a gun, you know, and of course live in America,
7491280	7495280	get a gun, but make damn sure you know how to use it, make damn
7495280	7499280	sure you know how to keep it safe, and make really sure that your kids can't
7499280	7503280	get to it. I'm going to get a phaser. Dude, phasers are awesome.
7503280	7507280	Always set on stun, and a light saber, but that
7507280	7511280	wait, that can kill people, no just a phaser. And by the way,
7511280	7515280	act deft, that's the second amendment, well first amendment is, yeah
7515280	7519280	you have a voice to use it, second amendment is, god damn it, we can have guns if we fucking want them.
7519280	7523280	S.S.A. I want to hear Matt ask, what about a marshmallow gun?
7523280	7527280	Act deft says the OLR constitution second amendment
7527280	7531280	don't shoot wrong. Yeah don't, I like that, that should actually be rule number
7531280	7535280	one. Here's the thing, even the marshmallow gun, like it depends on what
7535280	7539280	speed the marshmallows are traveling at, like if it's very slow speed, I'm okay with that because
7539280	7543280	they're going to open my mouth, but if they're flying really fast, it could actually like, you know,
7543280	7547280	kind of spank my butt a little bit if they hit me in the ass, I don't think I'd
7547280	7551280	like that. You can spank my butt all you want, just
7551280	7555280	don't do it with a fucking gun. Rob
7555280	7559280	does not want to get pistol whipped in the ass. Okay, okay,
7559280	7563280	we really are though. What happened to video games? I don't know, we were talking about
7563280	7567280	we were talking about why the, I think it was because it was talking
7567280	7571280	about why the butt head dad didn't have his guns locked up.
7571280	7575280	So let's get back to video games, but
7575280	7579280	speaking of the PSP,
7579280	7583280	which we were talking about a while ago, they've added a new
7583280	7587280	firmware to the PSP, 5.5, other than
7587280	7591280	breaking homebrew stuff if you, you know, want to upgrade or whatever,
7591280	7595280	it will also allow you to have a few other things, including the
7595280	7599280	information board, which is already available right now on the Playstation 3 cross-media bar,
7599280	7603280	and also they're going to add some internet security, if you happen to
7603280	7607280	be a little kid, you can use the Trend micro security
7607280	7611280	to block certain websites, and also filter out other
7611280	7615280	things as well, including all that nasty porno, because
7615280	7619280	the PSP is a gateway to porn. What if I want all that nasty porno? Well then
7619280	7623280	don't enable the optional security. Oh, okay.
7623280	7627280	So, and then also you'll be able to do an internet search for games directly
7627280	7631280	from the cross-media bar as well, and they've included some memory stick improvements, including
7631280	7635280	your ability to be able to create and access sub-folders
7635280	7639280	on your Memory Stick Pro Duo for music, videos, and photos, which is awesome.
7639280	7643280	Because, you know, folders
7643280	7647280	make things nice and neat for all that porn that's on there.
7647280	7651280	Is this what you're using your PSP for, is porn?
7651280	7655280	Porn and RiftTrax audio samples.
7655280	7659280	Nice. Oh, I'm so sad I missed the last little RiftTrax thing.
7659280	7663280	Oh, it was awesome. Are you doing it again this week? Maybe I'll come. Uh, probably not this week, but we'll
7663280	7667280	find a new one. Sad. Alright, well anyhow. Yes, Twilight is
7667280	7671280	made much better with people making fun of it. I have not yet seen Twilight.
7671280	7675280	Line. Anyhow, one more story for you guys,
7675280	7679280	and then we are going to open up the Skype line. I'm almost a little afraid to open it up tonight,
7679280	7683280	but we are going to open it up at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype,
7683280	7687280	Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with something else that's kind of related to the PlayStation Portable.
7687280	7691280	It's about Skype, because you guys are going to be calling us on Skype soon. But it actually is not about
7691280	7695280	the PSP. It's about the DS.
7695280	7699280	You see, a Skype representative was recently speaking to the blog
7699280	7703280	TechRadar. I almost said TechRadar, but it's TechRadar. Apparently,
7703280	7707280	the technical possibility to have Skype on the DS is there.
7707280	7711280	It's just not planned. The exact comment, quote, whilst we can't comment on
7711280	7715280	any future plans to bring Skype. Oh my.
7715280	7719280	Oh my god. We have had butts
7719280	7723280	black. Wow, we just had a huge accident in studio.
7723280	7727280	What the fuck? The doctor
7727280	7731280	just got shot. What the fuck? He fell on his tailbone, shoving
7731280	7735280	his spine through his trachea. Who brought the gun into my house?
7735280	7739280	All over Irene. Alright, no. Oddly enough,
7739280	7743280	his blood is rainbow colored. Doctor, could you please explain what just happened to cause
7743280	7747280	such chaos? No, I just thought... Did I forget where the chair
7747280	7751280	was? She moved the chair when he got up. Did she really do that old
7751280	7755280	prank where the doctor went to sit down and Rice Princess pulled the chair back?
7755280	7759280	Yes. Oh my god.
7759280	7763280	It's because you unplugged your
7763280	7767280	controller.
7767280	7771280	I just... Can we just...
7771280	7775280	Awesome.
7775280	7779280	I know. I'm so done with this show. Alright.
7779280	7783280	What was I gonna say about... Oh yeah.
7783280	7787280	Quote, whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype to
7787280	7791280	Nintendo's DSi, it would technically be possible. There it is.
7791280	7795280	It's not gonna happen. Yeah, it's not gonna happen because Nintendo wants to do
7795280	7799280	their own proprietary thing, I bet. They were already showing it... Shut up.
7799280	7803280	They were already showing it a couple years ago at E3.
7803280	7807280	Which means they'll never... Well, that was the whole... They have voice chat in other games.
7807280	7811280	You know, this is a tech demo, but I don't think they're gonna ever do Skype.
7811280	7815280	Well, if you feel so terrible, why did you
7815280	7819280	pull the chair away?
7819280	7823280	If I had a gun, I would shoot you in the foot right now.
7823280	7827280	That's what I would do. No, you're right. I was scared of the gun.
7827280	7831280	I'd be afraid that the gun would suddenly point at me while I'm trying to pull the chair. I'll shoot you in the face of the marshmallow
7831280	7835280	spade gray.
7835280	7839280	Alright. I'm... Fuck it.
7839280	7843280	We're opening the Skype line. 1877 game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is
7843280	7847280	OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
7847280	7851280	Hi, Legend of Zaku. Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind? Planet Chaos, may you help us?
7851280	7855280	Nothing much, just chilling tonight, just trying to bear the stifling
7855280	7859280	heat in New York City. We've had a weird weather week in California
7859280	7863280	as well. It was like super duper hot one day, and then it was rainy and cold the next, and now it's
7863280	7867280	hot again. Go figure. I don't get it. Yeah, apparently it was like 90 degrees.
7867280	7871280	But yeah, just trying to snag some
7871280	7875280	other deals, like the orange box for 10 bucks. Finally, I got that shit.
7875280	7879280	What an awesome deal that was. Hold on. I have to read this comment in chat real quick, because it's
7879280	7883280	funny. SSJ100Matt says, Irene is now Jerk Princess.
7883280	7887280	There we go. Yay, Jerk Princess. Alright, I'm sorry, Zaku. So, yes,
7887280	7891280	orange box is $10. It's the deal everyone's been talking about this weekend.
7891280	7895280	Did you pick it up? I just picked it up
7895280	7899280	like, what, 15, 20, like half an hour ago. I've
7899280	7903280	yet to download it yet, but hopefully I'll be doing that tonight or tomorrow.
7903280	7907280	Just waiting to see whether or not the SS's job of mine will actually extend.
7907280	7911280	Well, so you've been working recently. Good for you. Congrats.
7911280	7915280	Well, working temporarily, but you know, working for Uncle Sam for that time being.
7915280	7919280	But yeah, besides buying orange box, I just indulged in
7919280	7923280	DJ Max Technica location test today up in
7923280	7927280	New Rochelle, not far from the Bronx. Tell us a little bit about DJ Max
7927280	7931280	and the arcade for those that don't know much about it. Let's just put it this way.
7931280	7935280	It's really hard to pick up, especially if you've been playing a lot of rhythm
7935280	7939280	games. Unless you have a lead beat agents experience,
7939280	7943280	it's going to be really hard to match the touching and everything.
7943280	7947280	The whole aspect of the game is quickly forward.
7947280	7951280	It took me a while to just pick it up, but then most of the time it was just
7951280	7955280	failing the harder songs, because then when you touch certain things, you have to
7955280	7959280	make sure you either touch it on that
7959280	7963280	note right there on the screen, or you've just got to tap it
7963280	7967280	a few times to the beat, follow the curse around.
7967280	7971280	It's basically a bigger,
7971280	7975280	it's a larger version of a lead beat agents. Put it that way.
7975280	7979280	Interesting. I know you're a big fan of the Beatmania series
7979280	7983280	and Beatmania 2DS. How does it compare to Beatmania for you?
7983280	7987280	It's kind of different. I don't think it compares. It's just more like instead of using keys,
7987280	7991280	actually hard keys, it's more using a lot more fingers.
7991280	7995280	The fact that you have to touch
7995280	7999280	every part of the screen wherever you have to.
7999280	8003280	It's kind of like how Konami is doing with that game.
8003280	8007280	The fact that you have to touch the screen
8007280	8011280	to hit the notes, instead of having to hit a particular key on the screen.
8011280	8015280	I know it's completely foreign, as I said.
8015280	8019280	It takes a while for certain players to pick it up. I know I basically
8019280	8023280	pissed away six bucks on that game at $1.50 a game.
8023280	8027280	It was as much as I could today.
8027280	8031280	I got to do it again, seriously.
8031280	8035280	Anything else you want to share with our listeners before we move on to another call?
8035280	8039280	Dynasty Warriors, Gundam 2, get it. I don't care what they say, just get it now.
8039280	8043280	It's a lot better than the first one, multiplayer.
8043280	8047280	Thank you so much, Zaku, for the call. Take care, buddy.
8047280	8051280	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is
8051280	8055280	OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8055280	8059280	Hello, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is the guy that hopes Comcast is going to let him stay on the stream long enough.
8059280	8063280	Well, welcome. I'm glad to see your audio is working tonight, too, Jason.
8063280	8067280	I know you've been a long time listener to the show. Tonight's been a little crazy, hasn't it?
8067280	8071280	No worse than I've heard before.
8071280	8075280	Two quick things before the actual question.
8075280	8079280	The new Dragon Ball game and the releases. Do you know that Dragon Ball Z is being re-released
8079280	8083280	as a series in Japan? No, I did not know that.
8083280	8087280	Well, that makes a ton of sense. It's freaking classic.
8087280	8091280	Is it being re-related? Yeah, but everything is a classic, and they're not re-releasing everything.
8091280	8095280	At any rate, Fullmetal Alchemist is being re-released as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
8095280	8099280	Dragon Ball Z is being re-released as Dragon Ball Kai.
8099280	8103280	They both started at the start of April, and
8103280	8107280	both of them are a re-released series that are supposed to be more
8107280	8111280	closer in story to the manga.
8111280	8115280	Are they re-animated? To an extent, yeah.
8115280	8119280	It's done like the Evangelion movies that are coming out, right?
8119280	8123280	I have no idea. Well, with the Evangelion movies, they're pulled a lot of original
8123280	8127280	footage and then added a new animation. I don't know about Dragon Ball Kai,
8127280	8131280	but you can watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood at
8131280	8135280	Funimation is broadcasting that subbed.
8135280	8139280	Nice! Rama is saying re-released in HD with extra footage.
8139280	8143280	Do you want? I don't know about Kai, but Fullmetal Alchemist.com
8143280	8147280	has links. I've been meaning to watch it, I just haven't had the time.
8147280	8151280	Random ask question, does this have anything to do with the recent Dragon Ball Z movie
8151280	8155280	that came out to theaters? I don't think so, and I sure as hell hope not,
8155280	8159280	because the movie looks like an absolute travesty, but then again, I never liked Dragon Ball.
8159280	8163280	I have to say, I was one of the people that had
8163280	8167280	fifth generation fan subs of Cell Game and everything.
8167280	8171280	I will say, Dragon Ball Z on the Super Nintendo was the first import
8171280	8175280	game I ever played, because they actually had a little place around here,
8175280	8179280	an independent movie store before Blockbuster
8179280	8183280	and Hollywood kind of stomped everything out that used to rent import games.
8183280	8187280	It was kind of crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry Jason, what was your question?
8187280	8191280	One more quick thing. WarioWare myself, let me guess,
8191280	8195280	you play WarioWare games with yourself using the DSI camera? I think it is the exact
8195280	8199280	same DSI game that we've already got over here, I'm fairly certain.
8199280	8203280	I don't know for sure. The real question,
8203280	8207280	I know that the only classic Sierra games I've played have been Space Quest,
8207280	8211280	I've seen bits and pieces of King's Quest, but that's been about it.
8211280	8215280	Why does the name Sarian sound so familiar? I know it's in the title, like Space Quest
8215280	8219280	1 was the Sarian encounter, was that a race or something in that series?
8219280	8223280	I'm assuming it's a race in the game.
8223280	8227280	I'm sure they named the website after something that you see in one of those games.
8227280	8231280	Yeah, I should go look at it, because that name is so familiar, but I just don't remember it
8231280	8235280	from the series. But then again, it's also been upwards of five or six years since I've played it.
8235280	8239280	I remember seeing the news about Sarian.net
8239280	8243280	and I thought it was awesome, I still have yet to check it out. Again, the whole
8243280	8247280	not enough time thing. Just want to point out the subtitle of the original Space Quest
8247280	8251280	game is Space Quest the Sarian Encounter. Yeah, and I think I've heard it
8251280	8255280	in a few other places throughout the series. I beat Space Quest 1,
8255280	8259280	the VGA remake, but I don't know, I just don't remember it.
8259280	8263280	I've mentioned a lot how interfaces like Home on the PS3
8263280	8267280	don't work, because they're just an interface and there's nothing to do.
8267280	8271280	But whatever they did to put the applications in
8271280	8275280	Sarian.net sounds absolutely amazing. I mean, yeah
8275280	8279280	it's the next step up of what Xbox Live is right now
8279280	8283280	with the partying and all of that kind of stuff. Where even if you're not actually playing the game
8283280	8287280	you can be around and congregate and do whatever
8287280	8291280	in a game interface that's, I guess, familiar assuming you've actually
8291280	8295280	played the game before.
8295280	8299280	Space Quest, not so much. Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, yes, tons.
8299280	8303280	I've played every single King's Quest game.
8303280	8307280	And I've played every single Space Quest game. Oh, funny.
8307280	8311280	Alright, well Jason, we've got to wrap up to get some more
8311280	8315280	calls. Do you have any other quick thoughts? You talk too fast
8315280	8319280	sometimes. I'm sorry, do you have any other quick, do you have any
8319280	8323280	other quick thoughts for our listener? That's the second time I've been told that this week.
8323280	8327280	It's my nature. Yeah, it is. But you're clear in your
8327280	8331280	speaking so it's not a bad thing. I know, I'm like the Micro Machines dude.
8331280	8335280	Alright, see you later Jason, thanks for the call.
8335280	8339280	John Machido. Bye. Is that his name? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm like that guy. Maybe I should
8339280	8343280	addition to be the Micro Machines. See, I do trip up on my words sometimes though and I talk really fast.
8343280	8347280	I think it would be easier if I was actually reading from a script.
8347280	8351280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8351280	8355280	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Oh, hey
8355280	8359280	guys, what's up? This is Dan Shadow. Hey, Dan Shadow, what is on your mind? Greetings and
8359280	8363280	celebrations. Greetings, I don't think we've had you on the show before. What's on your mind?
8363280	8367280	Oh, shoot, nothing much. Hey, you guys were just talking about the guns and all the fun
8367280	8371280	stuff and you made me think of this Penny Arcade
8371280	8375280	comic that came out recently making fun of Rock Band Nirvana.
8375280	8379280	Ha, I saw this, yes. I did see that.
8379280	8383280	Did you take it down? I couldn't find it. It was posted on my friends list.
8383280	8387280	Let me see if I remember which friend of mine posted it
8387280	8391280	too. It wasn't that long ago. Why don't you describe the comic for our
8391280	8395280	listeners who haven't seen it. Okay, so the first panel, they
8395280	8399280	have the Rock Band box and it looks just like a Rock Band box that says Rock Band Nirvana.
8399280	8403280	Second panel, one guy pulls out the guitar controller.
8403280	8407280	Everything looks cool. Third panel, the guy has a weird little bass and he
8407280	8411280	pulls out this giant shotgun controller and that's it.
8411280	8415280	Yeah, because it's Rock Band Nirvana edition. I found the comic, by the way, on my friends page
8415280	8419280	of LiveJournal and I linked it in chat. I don't know if they pulled it from the original
8419280	8423280	Penny Arcade site, but it's still on their server. April 22nd was the day.
8423280	8427280	Okay, sweet. Yeah, I tried finding it again and that was
8427280	8431280	wrong, yet I couldn't help but laugh how bad it was.
8431280	8435280	You know, it was to me one of those things where it's like, you know, sometimes
8435280	8439280	we find solace in death through humor, like how people laugh at
8439280	8443280	funerals and stuff like that. I don't think anybody, you know, it's kind of one of those
8443280	8447280	oh wow, too soon, but I mean, you know, obviously it's been many, many years since
8447280	8451280	that happened, but I think it's one of those things where
8451280	8455280	if you can't laugh at it, what can you do, if that makes sense. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, totally.
8455280	8459280	And didn't it come out on the anniversary of his death or something like that? Did it
8459280	8463280	really? That would be kind of interesting. Well, I thought it was just topical because
8463280	8467280	you know, they have the Rock Band Beatles game coming out with the Beatles paraphernalia. I just kind of
8467280	8471280	talked it up to that. I didn't even realize there might be a correlation with the anniversary of Kurt Cobain's
8471280	8475280	death or anything like that. Either way, it seems like the timing is great on all
8475280	8479280	points. Yeah, so it was kind of one of those
8479280	8483280	that's so wrong kind of things where you're just kind of like laughing through it.
8483280	8487280	Yeah, totally. I told my friend about it and he just shook his head
8487280	8491280	and laughed and walked away. Exactly. That's exactly what that kind of comic should be.
8491280	8495280	Well hey, anything else going on in your gaming week? Stuff you've been up to?
8495280	8499280	Oh yeah, definitely. I am very much into Valkyria Chronicles
8499280	8503280	on the PS3. I'm loving that game. Is it really cool
8503280	8507280	because I played the demo and I had a lot of fun with the demo and I kept telling myself I was going to
8507280	8511280	go get the full game but I just never did. I think it's on sale now though so I might have to check it out.
8511280	8515280	Yeah, totally. It's the next step
8515280	8519280	in a tactics game that is much needed because when you think of
8519280	8523280	tactics game, you always think of the same, nearly the same style from what Final Fantasy
8523280	8527280	Tactics did. What is this next step that makes you so sold
8527280	8531280	on this game? Well, it starts off and shows the overview map
8531280	8535280	so you see all the pieces and then you get to move around in
8535280	8539280	nearly real time. You still have your spaces or whatever movements
8539280	8543280	people can make. The setting is fresh almost. It's very different. It doesn't have that
8543280	8547280	everyone's kind of walking in place look to it. The animation is pretty good
8547280	8551280	and just the way it works, I mean every unit likes other people
8551280	8555280	or dislikes other people. Everyone has specialties so if this guy works well in the desert
8555280	8559280	or if he likes to hang around chicks, you get the bonus.
8559280	8563280	It's almost like a weak third person shooter but it works great in a tactical environment.
8563280	8567280	You can take cover. You can have your snipers or you can have a tank.
8567280	8571280	Everything works well together and the graphic style
8571280	8575280	is very stylized, very fun. It is very stylized and to answer some questions
8575280	8579280	in chat, it is a PS3 exclusive as far as I know. There is a demo on the Sony
8579280	8583280	store that you can check out if it sounds interesting because yeah, I did like the whole
8583280	8587280	like you were actually moving the pieces around and jumping over obstacles
8587280	8591280	and things. It did feel kind of tactical in that way. It was awesome.
8591280	8595280	I should really just suck it up and buy the full game.
8595280	8599280	It's a very fun game and it's quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. I just can't put it down.
8599280	8603280	Valkyria Chronicles is the game.
8603280	8607280	Is it related to Valkyria profile? You're thinking Valkyria
8607280	8611280	from Square. No, this is from Sega.
8611280	8615280	It's a whole new thing. Yeah, Sega made it. A whole new thing.
8615280	8619280	And new DLC coming out as well. Oh, so they're keeping it going. Wow, that's pretty cool.
8619280	8623280	Well Dan, any other closing thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
8623280	8627280	No, just saying hi.
8627280	8631280	If you guys are around for E3, an offer is sold out but I can get you all into Disneyland.
8631280	8635280	Well, that's a very generous offer. I know Loki is going to Disneyland.
8635280	8639280	I don't know if he already bought the tickets. I already have the ticket vouchers. Sorry.
8639280	8643280	Well, you know what? Maybe I'll take him up on that.
8643280	8647280	If I could get down there, I'd be happy to, but I'm broke.
8647280	8651280	I will keep in touch, Dan. I know you're on the Twitter, so I'll be in touch.
8651280	8655280	Alright, cool. Nice talking to you guys. Alright, take care Dan. Thanks for the call.
8655280	8659280	Speaking of Twitter, we're keeping an eye on things tonight.
8659280	8663280	User Javier Altman says,
8663280	8667280	Yeah, it's just footy monster.
8667280	8671280	But I'm reading the usernames here.
8671280	8675280	Magical Nathan simply gave us a yeah.
8675280	8679280	Yeah. I don't know. Magical Nathan's username.
8679280	8683280	ActDeft says, I hope Sky updates the podcast soon.
8683280	8687280	Since this is a pretty hilarious episode. It will be caught up next week.
8687280	8691280	I promise. We will be all caught up next week. We have to be for the contest.
8691280	8695280	Or it's not going to work. I know. It's just, you know, when I'm drunk, nothing's funny.
8695280	8699280	Alright, hi. You're on Orange Andrea. Who's this? It's Deathwishing again.
8699280	8703280	Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind? Huh? What's on your mind?
8703280	8707280	Um, first of all, I would like to say I have a great first person shooter idea.
8707280	8711280	It involves you, and it would always be you running away from the battles.
8711280	8715280	Where's the guns everywhere? Worst game ever. I'm sorry to tell you.
8715280	8719280	It'd be a great game, because it'd be like little girly screams.
8719280	8723280	Why are you making fun of me?
8723280	8727280	Second, um, do you, um,
8727280	8731280	think of Konami as a first person shooter developer at all?
8731280	8735280	Konami as a first person shooter developer. Well, like, do you think of them?
8735280	8739280	Because they're making a first person shooter game called Six Days in Fallujah.
8739280	8743280	No, I've heard of the Fallujah game though. I have.
8743280	8747280	I guess it's supposed to be some ultra realistic game, like from my herd.
8747280	8751280	Yeah, yeah.
8751280	8755280	Weren't they, like, actually interviewing veterans or something to figure this game out?
8755280	8759280	And terrorists. Oh my gosh.
8759280	8763280	I'm thinking, like, what's going to happen? Am I going to be playing, like, getting ready to do a breach and entry on Adoro,
8763280	8767280	all of a sudden Contra, big alien thing flies out of nowhere?
8767280	8771280	That wouldn't be very realistic now, would it?
8771280	8775280	But I just can't understand it.
8775280	8779280	Like, they're really kick ass, PS3 one, and then they're like,
8779280	8783280	eh, forget it. No one wants to play a good game.
8783280	8787280	Well, good games never last. That's true. That's kind of true.
8787280	8791280	What kind of games have you been playing this week? Death Wishing?
8791280	8795280	Well, I was at a cyber cafe yesterday, and I played
8795280	8799280	a lot of, I played Street Fighter a lot, actually, with my
8799280	8803280	death Asian friend who could beat me with the controller behind his back,
8803280	8807280	and down the hallway, like a douche, showing off to everyone.
8807280	8811280	Everyone's clapping, and I'm just like, you bitch.
8811280	8815280	Isn't that crazy how people can do that? Like, I remember a story about
8815280	8819280	there was a Soulcalibur player that could do that, too. Like, they were blind or something, and they could just
8819280	8823280	whoop everybody at Soulcalibur. It was amazing.
8823280	8827280	It's because they're Asian. Asians are better at any game that comes from Asia. Like, Starcraft!
8827280	8831280	Did you say your Asian friend was deaf? Yeah.
8831280	8835280	Or, when you have loss of a sense like that, all your other senses are heightened.
8835280	8839280	Could it be because of that? No, I just really think the Asian race itself
8839280	8843280	is just better at video games than anyone else.
8843280	8847280	Rice Princess, as our token Asian in studio tonight, confirmed deny these said allegations.
8847280	8851280	I can very much confirm. Very good. Uh-huh.
8851280	8855280	You can send those cards and letters to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8855280	8859280	I will be sure to forward them appropriately. Wow.
8859280	8863280	Wow, wow, wow.
8863280	8867280	And you're getting yelled at by GS68 in chat, who is also... I can tell, and I can just tell
8867280	8871280	him, um, no, it's not a stereotype, because
8871280	8875280	it's more of a fact, because I can't beat anyone at Starcraft that's...
8875280	8879280	Anyways, Rob, I'll invite you to go
8879280	8883280	paintballing with me sometime. Oh, I'm sure that'll be a joy,
8883280	8887280	especially after what I said tonight. There'll be, like, a secret meeting while I run to the restroom
8887280	8891280	or something before the thing starts. Okay, everybody, target Rob. He's the
8891280	8895280	gun-a-phobe. And I'll just... I'll want to cry when the day's over.
8895280	8899280	Alright, well, Deathwishing, thank you very much for the
8899280	8903280	call. Have a good week, okay? Oh, God.
8903280	8907280	Take care, buddy. Alright.
8907280	8911280	That's going to do it for the calls tonight. Sorry if you guys didn't get through. Send us an email or a tweet
8911280	8915280	or try again next week, you guys. Alright, um, by the way, I wanted to say this
8915280	8919280	real quick before we get into the last-minute stories tonight, because I just thought of something I was reading.
8919280	8923280	One page I go to once in a while is yahoo.com, and they have, you know, news
8923280	8927280	stories that rotate on the front. There was a story on there the other day talking about how Grand Theft Auto
8927280	8931280	4's sales figures have... Sorry, not 4. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars
8931280	8935280	sales have been extremely disappointing. They went so far as to call it a flop,
8935280	8939280	because it sold only, what, 87,000 copies its first week?
8939280	8943280	Loki, I know you're a huge Grand Theft Auto fan. What do you think? Is this true? Are people judging
8943280	8947280	this too early? Is it a flop? Was it a bad idea to begin with? Well, it's only
8947280	8951280	been a... They're basing it off of the NPD numbers, which are only, you know,
8951280	8955280	it's only showing two weeks of the sales right now, so I'd have to
8955280	8959280	see what it looks like, you know, at the end of this month.
8959280	8963280	I don't think it's going to be a flop. You know, like most DS games that come out, they sell over
8963280	8967280	a longer period of time. You know, since it's more of a casual system, people
8967280	8971280	are more casually, you know, wanting to pick up stuff. So,
8971280	8975280	there's that, and then also the DS is really, really easy
8975280	8979280	to pirate stuff on. So, you know, you have a lot of people that were, you know,
8979280	8983280	pirating and that kind of thing. But, um, I think it's going to do well.
8983280	8987280	I mean, like, even like Super Mario 64, a game that
8987280	8991280	literally came out with, you know, the Nintendo DS is still
8991280	8995280	selling well today. So, I don't doubt that this will sell well.
8995280	8999280	Do you think it's maybe because the DS is more of a kiddie system in Grand Theft Auto?
8999280	9003280	You know, how many really adult gamers admit to playing the DS
9003280	9007280	regularly? Um, I don't know, but yeah, I can imagine that it is more
9007280	9011280	a kiddie system, but also people are dumb and they'll buy their kids this stuff. I guess that's true.
9011280	9015280	I guess that's true. Alright, last minute stories, anybody.
9015280	9019280	DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight? Um, although it was kind of mentioned in an email,
9019280	9023280	um, Marvel vs Capcom 2 is getting a re-release
9023280	9027280	with, um, arcade sticks.
9027280	9031280	Nice. Is it like an arcade thing? I remember hearing something about the
9031280	9035280	achievements. I think Xbox Live. It's so rumored right now.
9035280	9039280	Interesting. I know there was a, somebody posted to our show roll prep
9039280	9043280	thread and I just, we didn't post it because there wasn't a lot there besides a countdown timer
9043280	9047280	that they're saying is rumored to be the Marvel vs Capcom 2. So, anyway.
9047280	9051280	Anything else DarkSakura tonight? What? Anything else
9051280	9055280	for last minute stories? Flem. Alright, Loki. Um, there's
9055280	9059280	a couple things. One, there's some new info for, uh, Star Trek
9059280	9063280	DAC, which will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade in May
9063280	9067280	and kind of looks a little bit like, um, Star Control, which is pretty cool.
9067280	9071280	And then also, um,
9071280	9075280	there's a rumor that there's going to be a new Clone Wars game coming to the PS3
9075280	9079280	and Xbox 360. It's supposed to feature co-op as well
9079280	9083280	and will be entitled, uh, Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes.
9083280	9087280	I can see this coming out. I mean, they let the horror of this stuff out.
9087280	9091280	And then finally, um, this is awesome. Coming to
9091280	9095280	Virtual Console soon, Clay Fighters.
9095280	9099280	No way! Yes, Clay Fighters.
9099280	9103280	It has been raided by the ESRB.
9103280	9107280	I thought Clay Fighters was already out in Europe. And Helga.
9107280	9111280	Um, no, in the US. I don't know if it's out
9111280	9115280	in Europe already. Wait, so, but if it's already out here, why is it being
9115280	9119280	re-rated? No, it's not out here. It's coming out here.
9119280	9123280	Oh. I don't know if it's out in Europe already, but it's coming out here
9123280	9127280	because it just got raided by the ESRB. Yeah, Rob. Got it.
9127280	9131280	Does this have the theme song, maybe?
9131280	9135280	Hold on, I'm looking at YouTube to try and find...
9135280	9139280	Aw, it just has the intro.
9139280	9143280	Music
9143280	9147280	Music
9147280	9151280	Music
9151280	9155280	I think it's off an emulation. Yeah, it's off an emulator or something. I can't find it.
9155280	9159280	I'm not going to bother. Anyway, I got submitted a last minute story
9159280	9163280	here real quick, and I remember reading about this this week. The plug has been pulled on
9163280	9167280	Bioshock, apparently. Not the game, but the movie. It was to be
9167280	9171280	directed by Gore Verbinski, who's famous obviously for the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Apparently
9171280	9175280	the movie had been in pre-production, and the plug was pulled this week.
9175280	9179280	This happens sometimes in Hollywood. This is a very Hollywood thing to happen.
9179280	9183280	There it is. Apparently, they
9183280	9187280	wanted to move the film outside the US to take advantage of the tax credit. It's not necessarily
9187280	9191280	completely done with, by the way. It's just the game is in a quote-unquote
9191280	9195280	holding pattern. In other words, it's been delayed a little while.
9195280	9199280	There you go. Bioshock. You have to jump around. Oh, the game you're playing right now
9199280	9203280	is Mylon's Secret Castle. You go in the little doors, and there's a little, like,
9203280	9207280	go to the right, dummy. Can you keep going to the right?
9207280	9211280	There you go. And you go in those little, like, you can go in there.
9211280	9215280	Anyway, forget it. Alright,
9215280	9219280	any other last minute stories, Loki? That's all I have. And that's going to do it for
9219280	9223280	tonight's Orange Launch Radio. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9223280	9227280	Wellie Wellie, I know you didn't get to say a whole lot here, but hopefully you had fun.
9227280	9231280	And watching and participating when you did. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9231280	9235280	I just lost the game. Sorry to hear that. Alright.
9235280	9239280	The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9239280	9243280	Yeah, everyone should go to the UOP Film Festival in May.
9243280	9247280	Because, you know, our international audience can all make it to UOP. Yeah, because
9247280	9251280	my engagement to Movie Merge is coming out.
9251280	9255280	Princess Princess, do you have any final thoughts? In the mic, please.
9255280	9259280	Thanks, Rob. Want to go to Disneyland for free?
9259280	9263280	Come to LA in June with us.
9263280	9267280	If Loki already bought his ticket, you can have his ticket. Alright, Loki, do you have any final
9267280	9271280	thoughts for our listeners? Nope, I need a Cage Man song, but I'm finding
9271280	9275280	one right now. My final thought is, the wine buzz
9275280	9279280	is gone. That's kind of sad. It didn't last long. Dark Sakura, our final, final,
9279280	9283280	final thought tonight. Give me money. Alright, thank you guys so much for
9283280	9287280	downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio or listening to us live, however you do it.
9287280	9291280	We really appreciate all the support of you guys. Remember, if you like what you hear here, and
9291280	9295280	if you've stuck with the show until the very end tonight of all nights, I
9295280	9299280	really applaud you, and you must really like what we're doing here. So please tell a friend or two
9299280	9303280	about our show. That's how we get around is word of mouth. We don't have a big magazine or
9303280	9307280	a big website that backs us. Nope, it's just a couple of friends who all met playing DDR
9307280	9311280	doing this shit out of their garage for the past seven years. So, there you go.
9311280	9315280	Dark Sakura? I actually forgot to put up the contest about winning my
9315280	9319280	TurboGrafx. So now I'm just going to say that the 200th, actually, the
9319280	9323280	300th person to follow me on Twitter will get it.
9323280	9327280	Oh god, it's going to be one of those contests, huh? No, I'm just being silly. However,
9327280	9331280	the 300th person will get something. Well, maybe we can, you know, because we're going to have the contest for this
9331280	9335280	Miles Decay thing next week. Maybe we can do, like, contest week next week or something. We'll do it. Think about what
9335280	9339280	you want to do for your contest. Contest week. Because we're going to do, I'll tell you off air. I'm just being a whore.
9339280	9343280	Alright. Well, congratulations. Alright. Um.
9343280	9347280	Dylin, you are a whore. Alright. Anyway, that's it.
9347280	9369280	Goodnight everybody. We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9377280	9381280	Anyway, see you next week.
