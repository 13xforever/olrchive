14779	14959	April 26, 2009.
15480	19083	Could a popular MMO be coming to the iPhone?
19423	22005	Microsoft promises a barrage of games for Japan.
22425	24667	And the first details are announced for PAX 2009.
31960	35843	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35883	41487	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41547	43488	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
43969	49673	And leading it through the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49973	50273	Hi.
50453	50834	How are you?
51014	52235	I left my lungs at Disneyland.
52355	53335	Yeah, how was Disneyland?
53676	54836	Oh my god!
54877	55837	It was Disneyland, right?
56057	58039	Oh, it was fun and they have a new game.
58686	60468	Which I will touch on in my gaming week.
60748	63911	I think I might know what you're talking about, so I want to talk about it too.
63931	64751	It's the same one I remember.
65052	67113	Alright, and also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
68314	70616	Who's picking off pickles off of his double cheeseburger.
70756	71998	Why are you not a pickle fan?
72038	73419	Did you specifically ask no pickles?
73439	77002	Oh, I never do, because then that means they have to take longer.
77721	79882	I'm the Doctor It's been like a couple weeks
101917	102778	But yeah, I'm doing really good.
103058	103479	Woo!
104060	105222	A couple weeks is a long time.
105783	107045	And Rice Princess is here too.
107085	110029	I don't think I can get the mic all the way over there, but say hello to Rice Princess is here.
111459	112440	I don't know if you can hear that at all.
132321	133801	They're playing it on the Dreamcast.
133861	139403	Well, yeah, they're playing it so that they can switch to other games if they want to play something else really easy.
140163	143644	Loki was not able to bring Excitebots tonight, which we were hoping to look at.
143684	144345	What happened, Loki?
145565	145925	Well, I knew.
146485	148266	I wasn't going to take it away from my wife.
148426	152427	She's been playing it constantly, so, you know, she'd be pissed off.
152507	153787	So it's past the wife test?
154008	155128	Yes, it's past the wife test.
155148	157649	All right, well, we'll hear a little more about your gaming week in just a little bit.
158049	158949	But let's get into it.
159009	160089	How was your gaming week?
160229	161350	We'll start off with Dark Sakura.
161370	161950	How was your gaming week?
162383	163023	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
191361	219549	I was convinced well I had said the next time I go to Disneyland I was going to go on Tower of Terror and I sat between Tiara and Marissa and Marissa kept saying that I would like that I would be okay on the drops and that the part that would scare me would be the lead up well the lead up was the fun part and the drop freaked me the hell out to the point that the only thing I could say on the entire ride was I'm not doing this again
221890	223350	or I Hate This or something like that.
223430	227432	And then I didn't make any more noise until I was off of it and almost throwing up when I got outside.
227672	230773	Because I will tell everybody right now, my fear is falling.
231034	235035	Not high places, not motion, it's falling.
235095	237016	The Tower of Terror is really freaking scary.
237336	241658	I have been in an elevator when it fell two feet before, so no, Jamie doesn't do this.
243279	248821	So I was actually so freaked out that I was actually going to go in California Screamin' and I was actually relieved.
249403	249988	DarkSakura.com
253352	259394	And by the way, I want to give a shout out to Pete and Jasmine who hung out with us and were really awesome while we were there.
259714	261175	But okay, back now to the story.
261195	262675	So they're like, let's go on Toy Story.
262695	263636	They're like, okay, let's go on Toy Story.
264156	265236	So, Toy Story.
265696	269018	It's like you wear 3D glasses, like the same kinds you wear at the Muppet Show thing.
269658	277481	And then you stop in front of these screens and you have these guns that are the pop gun that you pull the big string on over and over again.
278081	280922	And you fire out 3D ammunition.
281602	283124	at targets on the screen.
283164	286569	You're basically having to flick your wrist back and forth as fast as possible to pull this string.
286589	287170	So men are better at it.
287250	288993	Yeah, men have a distinct advantage at this game.
289553	290194	I made a good score.
290234	292898	Actually, I've got my score because I took a picture of my score.
292918	294701	Are you really good at flicking your wrist back and forth real quick?
295341	296383	Well, you know, I am married.
299773	300574	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
320648	321468	It was just really cool.
321508	324389	There were all sorts of little mini-games to do on it.
324809	327910	But my score for the first time playing it was 114,400.
329150	332170	And on top of that, you know what my animal was?
332990	333711	It was a beaver.
335131	339572	And as GameGuru says in the chat, they're putting it out on the Wii as a Wii game.
340912	341932	And it will be in 3D.
342612	344792	That's kind of awesome, I have to say.
344832	347733	But I have to tell you, Rob, did you notice this when you came out of the ride?
349162	349387	What is...
349966	358252	When you walk out of the ride, if you look to the left where the little desk and everything is and the room setting, it shows the cutout box.
359032	360873	That's the ride that you're on.
362454	363615	It's like a paper box.
363755	365076	You set up an inside midway.
365516	374743	So if you look at the wallpaper that's inside the ride, it's got little tabs and stuff and instructions for where you stick everything, like old paper doll houses.
375763	378945	It's an old midway ride, like a child's midway ride.
378985	379526	It's pretty cool.
380506	381407	Yeah, it was a great ride.
381727	384089	So, real life gaming, basically, this week.
384949	386631	So, it was a lot of fun.
387071	389212	And then I came back and real life intruded itself.
391054	392715	Loki did mention the chat room.
392755	395697	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live for this chat.
395837	397838	And, of course, there was that comment from GameGuru earlier.
398199	401421	Also, DarkTetsuya, I still want that Mr. Toad's Wild Ride racing game.
402161	403122	That would be pretty awesome.
403682	404483	Only if you go to hell.
405544	407625	SSJ100Matt says... I mean in the game, not you go to hell.
407865	408186	Yeah.
409073	410073	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
438823	445648	Now, the game is really awesome itself, but I don't care for some of their changes that they made.
446588	451432	Like, they have these stunt bars, basically, that you have to grab and you can swing around.
452112	455955	They're gold ones that you swing around a few times and you just launch off and you get stars.
456255	460778	And then every track has a red bar that you have to swing around and spin ten times.
461658	466722	And I guess they're kind of neat, you know, to keep with the whole trick racing thing, but I think it should be optional because...
468032	468673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
479329	479910	Thanks for watching!
500335	528000	and also what was I going to say no support unfortunately for custom music which kind of sucks but the music that's in the game is not as annoying as the last game and I don't know it's pretty hard but most of the site truck games if you're going to try to actually rank the courses then yeah you're going to have to play it a few times to actually be able to do it perfectly but it's fun lots of air you know
528885	530673	Oh, I remember another gripe I had about that.
532452	533773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
562404	565787	But whatever, that's the way they did it and kind of get over it.
566288	567809	But yeah, the game's really weird.
567909	570912	I made a super sandwich, so it's awesome.
571672	580620	Other than that, I played Rhythm Heaven on the DS, which is definitely a fun music kind of micro-game collection.
580721	583523	Very similar to the WarioWare stuff because it's made by the same people.
584424	585164	The thing is, though...
586147	592688	is it's very strict on accuracy so if you're not accurate in that or if you're just a little bit off
593709	595010	It's going to penalize you big time.
595230	596091	So that kind of sucked.
596351	598513	But fun game overall.
599514	602216	The other thing that I played, more Grand Theft Auto.
603537	606680	I was actually messing around with the PC version again, editing some stuff.
606840	612624	And I got cars to bounce into the sky really far and come down and explode.
612665	613365	So that was kind of fun.
614626	617589	And I downloaded the new download content for Saints Row 2.
617629	619570	So hopefully I'm going to get to play that this week.
620851	621091	And...
622202	624043	Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think, for my gaming week.
626424	627545	Alright, sounds pretty good.
628385	628845	Nothing else?
629526	631187	Anything you're looking forward to in this next week, Loki?
632727	633748	Nope, not this week.
633828	639231	Nothing coming out really worthwhile, at least.
639551	642913	Basically, yeah, it's just X-Men Origins, which doesn't look bad.
642973	647175	It's just not something I'd plan on picking up unless I get it for free.
650414	653076	The other game I was waiting for, unfortunately, got delayed to the end next month.
653356	659781	It's like Fuel, which was originally supposed to be coming out in two weeks, but now it's not until four weeks.
659981	660902	All right.
661102	662603	Oh, well.
662803	663084	Let's see.
663104	666626	We'll get to the Doctor and the Rice Princess in their gaming weeks momentarily, except now they're playing what?
666646	667027	You switched?
667047	668248	God, you guys have been switching games.
668528	670009	I saw Contra flash by for a minute.
670069	670549	Now you're on what?
670589	671030	Double Dragon 2?
671070	671330	Yeah.
671690	673131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
699751	702575	and having to pick up the people that were getting launched from the cannons.
702695	710604	Yes, you can launch yourself from a cannon onto the back of the boss to fight it and then the boss throws you off and you have to get picked up in a motorcycle and get carried back to the cannon.
710885	711846	So it's really intricate.
711886	714389	It's kind of neat what they've done in Warcraft with this.
714769	717232	Although, I can say that but at the same time say...
717933	719134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
739213	747799	I played a little bit of Outrun, but not enough for me to say a whole lot about it besides, you know, thankfully there's a cartoon arcade style racing game on Xbox 360 I enjoy right now.
748120	751822	Because, you know, pretty much all we've had otherwise is more realistic type of racing games.
753464	754064	And that's really it.
754244	755365	There hasn't been a whole lot otherwise.
755865	756226	Rock Band 2.
756286	757887	I've been playing a lot of Rock Band still.
757967	759468	That game's getting a lot of value even today.
759868	761049	So that's really it for my Gaming Week.
762470	766994	The Doctor, Rice Princess, anything you guys have been playing in your Gaming Week besides what you're doing right now?
767014	767254	The Doctor?
767274	767594	The Doctor.
768659	769219	No, not really.
769399	770560	I've been making movies.
771460	772300	You've been making movies?
772340	772900	Dirty movies?
773581	774541	Of course, dirty movies.
775521	777382	So, nothing that you've been really playing lately.
777402	778682	I know you're a big Nintendo fanboy.
778702	781263	Is there anything you're looking forward to on the Wii?
781323	782404	Definitely the Wii Motion Plus.
783484	783724	Alright.
784084	785405	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
785425	786045	What have you been up to?
786485	787085	Playing WoW.
788266	789986	And how's your Warcraft week going?
790706	792547	Snowball Garden, so that's it.
793490	794531	That's right, there's a new holiday.
795112	796853	This is a new holiday in World of Warcraft, right?
796873	798575	What do you do in the Noble Garden event?
798675	799996	Explain it to our listeners, Rice Princess.
800456	801557	Put the damn game on pause.
802759	806382	It's the Easter stuff that they couldn't update in time or something.
806442	806882	I don't remember.
808984	810346	Alright, she's busy playing Double Dragon.
810406	811867	Alright.
811887	813288	You go around and you hunt for eggs.
813328	814469	I kind of thought it was stupid.
814529	815791	I played it for about five minutes.
815831	816551	I thought it was stupid.
816571	817572	You're full of crap.
818013	819174	Why are you saying I'm full of crap?
821658	821958	All right.
822379	823880	Rice Princess is screaming at me.
824240	825341	She has no microphone.
826021	826422	There you go.
826742	827022	All right.
827583	829624	We're going to get into some gaming news here in just a moment.
829684	833147	Again, if you want to join us live, chat.orangeentreter.com is the place to be.
833427	837911	You can also follow us on Twitter at OLR, and we're looking at your tweets during the show.
838431	842755	And thanks to you guys who have been saying stuff to kind of help plug the show.
842795	845236	I saw some retweets from ActDeft and GoldAnthro.
845577	847178	Thank you guys very much over on Twitter.
849071	850852	Also, housekeeping, housekeeping.
850872	851893	We have a lot of housekeeping tonight.
852673	853553	I'm very excited.
853754	855394	In a couple weeks I will be in Chicago.
855675	858556	I am going to Anime Central, ASEN for short.
859056	865760	I'm going to this convention and I will be doing a panel Friday at 4.30 in panel room 7?
866740	867441	Consult your program.
868201	870082	So You Think You Can Podcast is the name of the panel.
870102	875745	And I'll be talking about my seven years of experience that I have in internet broadcasting and talking about
876165	876726	Thanks for watching!
897586	908250	Also, next week on the program, you heard us tease this a little bit last week, but next week on the program, we're very excited because we're going to be giving away That's right, that's SmileDK
911667	917851	We have an autographed copy of one of the Dance Dance Revolution games on, I believe it's Supernova 2.
918572	922174	Dance Dance Revolution autographed by SmileDK that we're giving away on the show next week.
922714	923655	So that should be pretty awesome.
924696	926717	Live or podcast, either way.
927458	929179	So you can listen to that and win it live.
929219	934022	It was signed at SakuraCon, thanks to the awesome Brest Lowell for getting that for us.
934382	939786	So next week on the show, if you want to tune in live or in podcast form, and I'll give you more details next week.
940066	941047	You'll have two weeks to do it.
942167	945009	Question from chat, will you be recording the panel at ASEN?
945429	946250	If I can.
947190	956335	It's not really about Orange Lounge Radio though, so I don't know if we'll put it on the podcast feed if we can do it, but maybe like a bonus thing.
956555	957796	I would love to tape it if we can.
958416	960978	If nothing else, I'll have someone videotape it and I can dump the audio or something.
961198	961798	We'll figure something out.
963539	964300	Also, I want to say this.
964340	966581	This is very, very, very, very, very, very important.
966981	969362	I want to say a huge thank you to all the listeners.
970003	976627	I don't know if everybody in studio saw, but there is a bunch of boxes sitting in the house.
977087	979988	There's a new used computer.
980069	980949	What do I mean by new used?
980989	982150	It's a refurbed computer.
982470	984091	The listeners pooled together money.
984711	991156	I don't know if you remember our meltdown on air two weeks ago when everything broke, but the listeners pulled together and got us a new computer that we can use for the show.
991356	991616	Sweet.
991696	992917	That's very, very exciting.
992977	995119	We weren't able to put it all together for tonight.
995139	996320	Thank you, guys.
996560	999042	Yeah, I mean, obviously, huge, huge amounts of thanks.
999782	1010170	Obviously, with us having probably a little break in a couple weeks with me being off in the Midwest, we'll probably have a lot of time to put that together and get it up and running and hopefully have some fun new stuff for the show.
1010610	1012011	So thank you guys so much for that.
1012472	1013132	That's very exciting.
1013372	1013933	Very, very exciting.
1015660	1016481	Thank you for everyone.
1037121	1037341	All right.
1038141	1039582	Let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1039622	1041323	I don't think there's anything else, really.
1041503	1043324	You follow us on Facebook, MySpace.
1043344	1044465	Does anyone use MySpace anymore?
1044905	1045165	Anyone?
1045445	1045946	I don't think so.
1046026	1046426	Stalkers.
1046466	1049128	Well, if you're there, you can get us on Orange Lounge Radio there.
1050068	1052129	But we're not on Craigslist because that's where the murderers are.
1052189	1054811	That's the one social site that we're not on is Craigslist.
1054851	1055992	So I don't know.
1056552	1058273	Maybe we should have a Noel Army on Craigslist.
1058333	1059314	I'm not sure how that works.
1059494	1061915	I bought my first Xbox 360 on Craigslist.
1062455	1062936	Oh, okay.
1062956	1063076	Got it.
1064026	1065547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1089002	1089562	Get her a doula!
1111431	1115194	The show will continue, you guys, even if Loki's going to be out for a little while.
1115214	1115915	We'll figure something out.
1115935	1118197	No, I was thinking Skyping it or something.
1118257	1126144	Because, obviously, I'm not going to leave my wife home alone with two kids by herself for the first few weeks or so.
1126164	1127426	We will figure something out.
1127466	1128967	We've got plenty of time to figure it out.
1129027	1130869	I'm going to leave my husband alone with my kid.
1130969	1132510	It's not even a worry right now.
1132850	1135072	Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
1135092	1136654	I'm not planning on going anywhere.
1136694	1137695	Yeah.
1138355	1141338	And the other thing too is we're going to be getting a house actually.
1141438	1142078	Oh my gosh.
1142739	1144180	We've already had our offer accepted.
1144200	1149924	We did the walkthrough on yesterday and it looked good.
1150084	1156309	So we're assuming, I don't think anything's going to go wrong because we know what condition the roof is in basically.
1157350	1160952	So probably yeah, we'll be probably moving into a house by the end of next month.
1161013	1162614	Oh my gosh, I didn't know the house was that far along.
1162634	1164155	Well that's great, especially with twins on the way.
1164295	1165275	Yes, definitely.
1165295	1165556	Wow.
1165776	1168537	And I've never known anyone that had twins, so that's kind of fun.
1168677	1170338	That's fertility drugs for you.
1171198	1174579	Small word of advice, check your pipes in the house.
1175400	1175840	In the house.
1176540	1177941	Well, we have an inspector.
1177961	1180402	And then Nellie should check her lady pipes, too, for the twins.
1182116	1183297	The babies will come out when they come out.
1202652	1203052	I don't know.
1203512	1207514	Nellie doesn't want to do the one anymore.
1207634	1210215	Originally, she was really fond of the name Max.
1210475	1212136	And I was like, okay, that's cool.
1213576	1214977	How about naming the other one Sam?
1215017	1215997	And she's like, okay.
1216117	1217298	I was like, Sam X, sweet.
1218778	1222159	If you name your twins Sam and Max, I'm going to laugh for a week.
1223000	1225501	I might literally die of laughter if you name the twins Sam and Max.
1225661	1228282	She doesn't want to name the one Max because...
1228982	1230624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1244403	1250247	We don't know what the sex of the babies are for a few months.
1250427	1253149	She's only eight weeks along right now.
1253910	1258073	We know early because we didn't know it was going to be twins until last week.
1258654	1261476	She had cramping in her side or whatever.
1261816	1264698	She wanted to make sure everything was okay.
1264738	1266739	They did ultrasounds and stuff.
1267320	1269702	First, the woman didn't see any heartbeats at all.
1270302	1274125	And then they found one, and then we went to radiology, and then they found a second one.
1274145	1275806	They're like, okay, there's two.
1277587	1280469	So, yeah, I mean, it still weighs off.
1280509	1288154	We actually have our first real doctor's visit in two weeks, so we get to see them slightly more growing up, I guess.
1289575	1290516	But, yeah, not until...
1290956	1292137	Remember, there's still tadpoles.
1292197	1294739	Not until, like, you know, August or so.
1295159	1296120	We know the sex of them.
1296580	1297681	But we're going to find out for sure.
1298101	1302444	Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, Salmon Max would be better than Ratchet and Clank as names.
1302584	1303585	So there you go.
1303625	1304285	That is true.
1305026	1312191	And, chat, he is not really going to name them Salmon Max just to get a goddamn gift from, you know, from the makers of the game, okay?
1312351	1315373	I wonder, though, if I... These are children you're talking about.
1315393	1319516	When I have mine, if I name it Richter or Annette, if Konami would give me a present...
1322004	1323465	She really will name the damn kid Richter.
1323485	1324526	Konami will give you a present, alright?
1324586	1325526	They'll sue you.
1327087	1332191	Dan and I decided like ten years ago before I ever even thought of wanting children that if we had a boy, his name was Richter.
1332471	1336633	No, she, okay, she keeps, my wife keeps suggesting the name Mason.
1336653	1338595	And I'm like, Mason is a stupid name.
1338835	1339836	I have a friend named Mason.
1339856	1341336	Mason's my little brother-in-law's name.
1342217	1343558	Everybody names their kids Mason.
1343598	1345719	He might actually listen to this show, you ass.
1346400	1348201	I'm sorry, it's a horrible name.
1349292	1351235	And no, Mario doesn't work because we're not Italian.
1351455	1351755	Alright.
1352216	1353337	We'll figure out names later.
1353518	1358023	You know what's funny is that I have toyed around the idea of naming a boy Strider.
1358744	1360627	But it has nothing to do with the game, I swear to God.
1360647	1361508	It's just a name I like.
1362769	1363791	Not from... Oh, forget it.
1364171	1364431	Alright.
1365441	1367342	We need to stop naming children after video games.
1367402	1370504	Let's get on to the gaming news.
1370784	1371845	God, we're like 20 minutes into the show.
1371865	1373306	I haven't touched on a lick of gaming news.
1373966	1375467	Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.
1375727	1380310	Yes, there's more drama going on with the whole Scratch the Ultimate DJ game.
1381431	1383112	First, Scratch actually...
1384072	1399829	was awarded their restraining order against Seven Studios and Seven Studios was basically told to give back the controllers that they had been holding hostage, I guess, and also all the development materials and that kind of stuff.
1401107	1404171	So that's kind of a cool victory for Genius there.
1404772	1416326	And then a weird chain event also led to Seven Studios now countersuing, saying that it was actually Genius' fault that they were behind schedule and it was a...
1418448	1423878	I don't know, they put them back several months because they couldn't get, I guess, licensed music.
1424559	1430089	Or they couldn't provide licensed music for the game and not obtain publishing approval.
1430890	1431151	So...
1432563	1432883	I don't know.
1432923	1436425	And apparently the game is still not cleared for launch on the PS3 according to them.
1436986	1438767	So we'll find out what happens there.
1439107	1441348	I'm sure this is not going to be going away anytime soon.
1441649	1447832	Which is very disappointing because I have a feeling this is going to delay the release of this game if it even comes out anymore now.
1448413	1452355	And I'm sure DJ Hero will not be affected by this at all.
1453476	1453756	Oh well.
1454673	1459737	Yes, because DJ Hero is being put out by the bigger company, so regardless of quality, it will come out regardless.
1459757	1471626	And regardless of whether they find Activision accountable for any wrongdoing whatsoever, it's still they get what... They have oodles of money to pay off any lawsuits that could possibly happen.
1471646	1474969	They basically get what they're hinting at they're trying to get.
1476727	1477027	I don't know.
1477227	1483370	Because at least I figured, you know, hey, Scratch might not be the more popular game, but at least if it's out first, it has a fair chance.
1483950	1486151	But now it's like, I don't know.
1486271	1495874	I still think it'll do okay, but I'm wondering if we see anything called DJ Revolution or something coming out that's going to be crap.
1496514	1497795	Come on, Konami, don't disappoint me.
1499878	1503244	All right, well, I guess we'll see what further develops of this.
1503264	1504205	I'm sure 2B continued.
1504225	1506870	There's plenty more to have in countersuits, appeals, etc., etc.
1506910	1507791	I've seen the controller.
1507811	1508492	It looks awesome.
1508933	1511057	Of course, it's not done, but it looks awesome.
1512148	1515230	All right, well, kind of going on a completely different note.
1515270	1518372	Obviously, we were talking about Warcraft a little bit in the opening of the show tonight.
1518412	1519253	This is interesting.
1519273	1523756	There's rumors going around the Internet about a World of Warcraft app on the iPhone.
1524497	1535364	Apparently, you know, somebody had ported Second Life to iPhone a little while ago, and now apparently there's this little movie circulating around the Internet that actually shows a jailbroken iPhone that is running World of Warcraft.
1535864	1536705	Kind of interesting.
1536725	1537426	Yeah.
1538706	1548149	There's kind of this no comment going on when asked if it's officially or whatever, that the company is apparently negotiating with Activision, etc., etc., to try and get this going.
1548569	1549950	I think this is kind of a load of crap.
1550070	1553791	I don't think Warcraft... I mean, I think people are kind of jumping to conclusions.
1554111	1557032	They see this and they assume, oh, Warcraft must be on its way for the iPhone.
1557072	1559012	Come on, how stupid would Warcraft be on the iPhone?
1559312	1562773	You can't take a game like World of Warcraft and put it on the small scale of the iPhone.
1563014	1563554	You can't.
1563634	1564094	You could.
1564574	1565354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1584625	1586847	Whatever, Dark Elf or something, it's going to look different.
1586927	1588688	Here's what I think they should do.
1588788	1596412	If they're going to have to do anything with this, what they should do is they should go, you've got to go all the way back to, I don't know if you remember Final Fantasy VIII on the PlayStation.
1596833	1600335	If you had that little thing that was only out in Japan, I forget the name of it.
1600755	1602717	That's it, Pocket Station.
1603017	1604918	You could link with the PlayStation.
1604958	1610322	You could raise your Chocobo on the Pocket Station and then that would affect some Chocobos that you had in game.
1610763	1618328	Maybe something like that where you have a spin-off game where, I don't know, you do something in it and it affects your character.
1618408	1623972	You can get loot that you can actually use in the game or enchantments or something that you can actually use in the game.
1624333	1627995	Something to enhance the World of Warcraft game without throwing off the balance.
1628035	1629817	It wouldn't work because someone would hack it to...
1630297	1630838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1649096	1650757	I still have it somewhere, I don't even know where it is
1677594	1678114	So, I don't know.
1678174	1684936	I mean, they'd have to be very careful with the balance of the game, but it's not like, you know, it's not like Blizzard's never made major changes to their game.
1684956	1692338	But, you know, I mean, Second Life, I mean... I could see something with vehicular combat, like on the iPhone, like a little side game, but I don't know.
1692478	1692818	I don't know.
1692938	1701760	I mean, I believe it's not like a hoax or anything, I don't think, but, you know, because they're not showing that it's like, you know, awesome frame rate or anything like that, but...
1703502	1706603	I could see, you know, if they could port it to the iPhone, I think it'd be pretty big.
1706643	1711304	Because, you know, definitely portable World of Warcraft would be awesome for somebody, I'm sure.
1711344	1713544	I just, I think there's no point.
1713784	1714385	You know what I mean?
1714465	1716545	Like, you can't party, you can't group.
1717005	1720606	I don't, it's just, it would just be slow, it would be clunky.
1720986	1723287	I think it would devalue Warcraft.
1723387	1726587	I think it would devalue World of Warcraft to put out a subpar game on the iPhone.
1726607	1728508	But that's why you would have to, you know...
1729488	1730169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1746724	1747344	Thanks for watching!
1766391	1783973	or maybe they should just stick with the mobile authenticator and that's it that's a good use of the iPhone the mobile authenticator I heard they don't even sell the keychain authenticators anymore in favor of the mobile authenticator so what I have here on my keychain from BlizzCon that my friends brought me back is going to be a collector's item that I actually use
1785342	1785722	Pretty cool.
1786562	1788283	The question being asked, what is an authenticator?
1788603	1790123	It's like, what do they call those?
1790183	1790803	VPNs?
1791163	1792124	Like a lot of companies use them.
1792144	1793184	You have a little thing on your keychain.
1793204	1794084	You press this button.
1794444	1797965	It generates a number based on the seed that's on the sticker on the back of your card.
1798445	1800946	And that number changes every minute.
1801026	1803807	So it basically uses the seed and the time to generate a number.
1804407	1808048	And if you want to log into WoW, you have to have the keychain with the number.
1809008	1810048	Or somebody can't log in.
1810068	1812329	It helps protect your account from hackers, basically.
1812349	1812869	Yeah.
1813945	1815146	There you go.
1815246	1820072	Looking at comments from chat, Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, you could have an iPhone app for WoW.
1820412	1824316	Here you do your single player quests and gather loot and or items for your character.
1824877	1828420	I still think it would be a lesser game than what you have on the PC.
1828961	1829521	I mean, I don't know.
1829541	1834166	I mean, granted, okay, you have a lot of iPhone games that are lesser versions of... But, I mean...
1834947	1835507	and DarkSakura.
1855387	1860349	or like, I don't know, Phantasy Star online would be kind of cool.
1860389	1861609	I think there's other things you could do.
1861629	1865451	I just don't think the World of Warcraft game is going to fit on an iPhone.
1865871	1866511	Let's move on.
1866591	1868572	I think we have more Warcraft news, right, DarkSakura?
1868972	1869472	Oh, yes.
1870173	1871113	You addicts.
1872133	1874394	You've been thrown another bone by PopCap.
1875735	1880717	Now there's a new command in World of Warcraft that I'm sure Rob has used.
1881784	1882847	It's slash peggle.
1883208	1884953	Yes, yes, yes, more yes.
1885073	1887399	This is amazing what has happened this week.
1887419	1888242	It's freaking peggle.
1889877	1895461	Yeah, you type it in, you can play Peggle, challenge each other, and have Peggle duels.
1896422	1898923	You can have your friends do an enormous battle.
1899544	1901825	You can have a time limit, not a time limit.
1902346	1903627	Also, you can do Peggle loot.
1904467	1908050	So you can decide who takes the loot instead of doing the roll command.
1909971	1917536	But you also have World of Warcraft themed backgrounds and points for using a special Peggle talent tree.
1919518	1922319	and it's fucking Peggle and fucking World of Warcraft.
1923019	1927521	And honestly, just reading about it or hearing about it right now does not do this justice.
1927581	1929322	Like, just how awesome this marriage is.
1929622	1930722	My soul cries.
1931262	1932903	I mean, really, you have to see it.
1932963	1938445	I mean, it's like, they really have adapted the game Peggle for free, put it into Warcraft, and...
1939285	1942108	They have these all new stages that are based off the WoW levels.
1942468	1947913	They've made this talent tree, which is a WoW thing, but they made it about Peggle.
1948334	1950075	You can do duels through the game.
1950115	1953418	I mean, it's pretty... Rice Princess, I know you've been playing the hell out of this.
1953459	1954740	I kicked your ass at a duel the other day.
1955495	1956355	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1975066	1975406	What?
1976406	1979687	I love how the levels are based on actual places in WoW.
1979707	1984969	Like, they have the pictures in the background and all the pegels are arranged, like, kind of like in the regular Peggle.
1985149	1988590	And by the way, for those that have never played Peggle before, it's like Plinko as a game.
1988970	1989510	Kinda.
1989530	1990290	From The Price is Right.
1990410	1990550	Kinda.
1990570	1990950	Yeah.
1991410	1996632	You have to, like, shoot at these little pegs and make them go away and they bounce on each other and stuff like that.
1996652	2000353	And it sounds like the most mediocre, boring game ever, but it's so fun.
2000373	2001033	It's very addicting.
2001053	2002813	You'll spend, like, hours playing it.
2002853	2003434	Trust me.
2004454	2004594	So.
2005094	2007020	Yeah, it's really awesome.
2009324	2012386	So, good times, very good times with this.
2012486	2014568	I mean, just the marriage of two crackheads.
2014768	2027658	But what I like about it, like, I'm not going to sign into WoW just to play Peggle, but it's really great because sometimes, especially, like, I'm leveling an alt right now, so I don't have a mount, I don't have a flying mount or anything like that, so when I'm using the flying taxi system, it takes four minutes to go from one place to another.
2027958	2030080	Peggle's a great distraction to pass the time.
2030560	2031681	And it's integrated into the game.
2031701	2032641	Four whole minutes, Bob!
2032842	2033162	I know!
2033642	2036044	It takes a long time to fly in WoW when you're a low-level player.
2036344	2051654	4 whole minutes at least it's not Final Fantasy 11 you didn't even have you had to wait 10 minutes for the airship to show up then you get on the airship take a 10 minute ride and then it might be remotely near where you're trying to go
2052173	2055035	Yeah, that's why Final Fantasy XI is ridiculous.
2055255	2056216	I'm sure it's gotten a lot better.
2056236	2057457	It's more realistic, though.
2057577	2059158	Yeah, it is more realistic.
2059239	2062821	But I think they have more teleport spells and stuff now to help ease that up.
2062841	2063442	I don't give a crap.
2063482	2064563	It's still a crappy game.
2064683	2065163	All right, shut up.
2065183	2066504	All right, anyhow.
2067045	2070527	So yes, Peggle is in WoW, and the amazing part is it's free.
2071128	2073009	But what a great thing for PopCap's brand.
2073049	2074891	I mean, everybody's talking about it this week.
2074911	2076132	Everybody's talking about Peg Crack.
2076872	2078513	We got sucked right in just like everybody else.
2079134	2079874	So there you go.
2081256	2089002	Yes, so something not Peggle related, but actually, oddly enough, it's something related to what's going on just in TV.
2089502	2095647	The Dreamcast, yes, Sega isn't making Dreamcasts anymore, however, you can still purchase them.
2095727	2100651	In fact, ThinkGeek is now offering brand new Dreamcasts for $100, $99.99.
2104856	2120781	and, um, yes, and it includes, of course, uh, it's a version 2.0, um, with the web browser version 2.0, including Sega Swirl, and a demo disc, and, um, yeah, awesome, brand new Dreamcast.
2121621	2125602	I remember when I got my Dreamcast, I wanted it at an all-nighter at QZAR.
2125622	2127522	I was like, Dreamcast?
2127643	2128323	I don't want this.
2128763	2132744	But then I got, I got games for it, and I'm like, sweet, it has Power Stone, that's awesome.
2133837	2136299	I didn't even think new Dreamcasts existed anymore.
2136359	2137580	That's the crazy part to me.
2137660	2140203	Like, where did they find new Dreamcasts?
2141123	2142044	Where did they find these?
2142765	2143145	I don't know.
2143165	2144046	Maybe in a warehouse?
2144326	2145127	I guess so.
2145287	2146829	Like, just collecting dust somewhere.
2146849	2156217	I do have to say, though, the article on this is amazing for showing the last Sega Tatsunoshiro commercial when the Dreamcasts came out.
2157581	2165267	I would really recommend picking up a Dreamcast if you have some extra money and you want a great system with a lot of homebrew available out there.
2165887	2172053	I realize the legality of some of this stuff is questionable, but the Dreamcast is a great, great system.
2172093	2173274	I mean, it has good games anyway.
2173874	2176116	And make yourself a boot disk and you can play in the import.
2176957	2177537	No problem.
2177597	2178338	I mean, they're easy.
2178838	2180439	There's some real classics on Dreamcast.
2180459	2182981	I'm sure many classic games of the week that DarkSakura's picked have come from there.
2184042	2186583	Space Channel 5, Sonic Adventure.
2186824	2189185	There's just great games on Dreamcast.
2190866	2192948	Check it out if you don't already have one of these.
2194149	2195910	Speaking of old stuff... Oh, they're sold out.
2196710	2197391	Are they all gone?
2198071	2200093	Probably because the blogs all picked up the stories.
2200173	2200633	It's gone.
2202474	2203795	Console sold out.
2203975	2204956	Maybe they'll get more in the future.
2206786	2210090	Old Sierra Games Leisure Suit Larry 1, Police Quest 1, Space Quest 1
2223587	2230750	But it's kind of cool because the games run in Flash, but there's this weird multiplayer element where you can watch other people solve puzzles.
2231250	2233951	And there's a new right-click menu system in the game.
2234192	2239634	If you want to check this out, the website is called sarien.net, S-A-R-I-E-N dot net.
2239754	2244076	And so it's just kind of like a walkthrough of these classic old-school Sierra games.
2244316	2249178	So if you were a Sierra game fan like I was back in the day, then you definitely want to check that out.
2250319	2250579	DarkSakura
2267955	2278602	Well, I'm sure some of our regular listeners remember me talking about getting a FC Mobile, which is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.
2279863	2283245	Now there is a new one, which I am going to be getting and selling my old one.
2284186	2288149	It's the FC Mobile 2, and it comes with stuff and things.
2290090	2295334	As in, it comes with controllers.
2297110	2299532	They're wireless controllers and a light gun.
2299632	2300673	A wireless light gun.
2301134	2306238	That's pretty good in relation to the old NES Zapper.
2306838	2315745	So when you have it basically using the TV tuner mode and using it as your Nintendo, you have actual controllers.
2315785	2317066	You do not have to use the system.
2317807	2320068	So it's going to be out in May.
2320969	2325793	It will be $60 and it will have a black version and a white version.
2326770	2350704	and um I'm gonna have one mine will go up for sale my old one the end I this this is so interesting how the old school Nintendo stuff is making such a comeback what thanks to in part this whole FC mobile stuff so it's kind of cool kind of cool how much money you think you're gonna end up spending on all this crap not much it's only 60 bucks it should be cheaper um elsewhere
2352487	2359213	Hitstun in our chatroom right now says, yeah, this week I bought an FC Mobile, tried it, realized the fucking A and B buttons were backwards and returned it for a refund.
2359233	2360134	But yeah, they're fixing that.
2360474	2361535	All in about a half hour's time.
2361615	2362296	They're fixing that.
2363176	2366800	They've reversed the A and B buttons to where they should be on the new version.
2367660	2371164	Does that have anything to do with the fact that in Japan most games do have it flipped?
2371304	2373526	Or is that just, no, it really was messed up?
2374474	2378776	I think that they based the old FC mobile off of the Famicom mobile.
2380116	2390481	The US one was based off of the Japanese one, but I think that the US release one is going to actually... They were saying that the button should be corrected for American audiences.
2391681	2392001	Alrighty.
2394298	2395759	I like King's Quest better than Space Quest.
2395779	2396500	I like Space Quest 4.
2396620	2397120	Oh yeah.
2417489	2417909	Yeah, I do.
2417989	2421531	I like Leisure Suit Larry too, but I think King's Quest is more accessible for everybody.
2422451	2425932	You have to have a certain sense of humor to like Leisure Suit Larry.
2427873	2428393	So there you go.
2429554	2430674	Alright, well, more news.
2430934	2431955	We've got release dates coming up.
2432395	2432635	Yes.
2433695	2435596	Well, this ought to make Jamie happy.
2436176	2442959	It's been confirmed that next week on the Virtual Console, on Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual Lawn will be coming out.
2442979	2443039	Woo!
2444298	2449041	Yes, on April 29th, you can expect Virtualon out on Xbox Live Arcade.
2450922	2454545	Apparently, though, it is going to be priced at 1,200 Microsoft points or $15.
2454625	2454725	So?
2454825	2460069	That earns a so from me.
2460129	2461249	It's Virtualon.
2461349	2463371	That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live.
2463451	2466793	That's a lot of Sega love on Xbox Live Marketplace recently.
2466833	2468594	Because there's Virtualon.
2468614	2469295	Or an adapter.
2469595	2470055	An outrun.
2470776	2471436	Adapter.
2472377	2473998	So I can use my Dreamcast twin sticks.
2475464	2493824	random Xbox Live Arcade one thing I did play actually this week as well was Lode Runner I did check that out because I have fond memories of that game on the Commodore 64 personally I don't think that game has aged very well they've tried to make it look nicer but I think the core game itself has not aged very well I think it's a game that's better left in my memory on the Commodore 64
2496806	2505972	I don't want to base the review off the demo, but as I was checking it out, I was kind of going, this is one of those things that I remember a lot more fondly when I was younger.
2507233	2509515	They have a nice new graphics.
2510315	2516299	It's like they put the same old game in this nice new packaging, but it's still the same old game that I think is better left in the 80s.
2517200	2517700	So there you go.
2519141	2520462	Alright, let's go to some release dates.
2521977	2522637	X-Blades X-Blades
2547711	2557773	Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, you have Jikkyo Powerful Major League 2009 and Mahjong Kakuto Club Wii come out as well.
2557793	2559333	It's kind of a slow release week.
2559533	2560234	Battle Club.
2560314	2561034	If you can imagine.
2561314	2562254	That's cool.
2562334	2567915	PlayStation 2 has a game called NHL 2009 as well as Tiernanog is coming out as well.
2567935	2569216	Wasn't that a song in DDR?
2569696	2569936	No.
2571896	2572296	Oh, it is.
2572456	2573216	It is.
2573296	2574837	It's a game based off the Mystic Knights of Tiernanog.
2575157	2575637	That's what it is.
2576097	2576237	Huh?
2577105	2578627	I was going to say it's Celtic Mythology.
2579088	2579628	That's what it is.
2579949	2580910	It's a role-playing game.
2580930	2581891	This actually looks kind of cool.
2582973	2583393	Neato.
2583693	2585956	That's on PlayStation 2 of all systems.
2586477	2589080	So that's coming out from SystemSoft this week in Japan.
2589120	2590662	That looks to be the most exciting thing I've seen yet.
2591403	2592344	Going to the handhelds.
2592364	2594647	Let's see if there's any big handheld stuff coming out this week.
2595248	2597671	Dragon Ball Z, WarioWare, Shinobi Retsuden 3
2612475	2640509	and let's see, that's all on the DS and on the Sony PSP there you go, Persona comes out just this week on the PSP that must be the big game that's coming out this week as well as a version of Tier Nanook on Sony PSP you fail at Blaster Master that's kind of cool alright so they're playing Blaster Master on Justin.TV right now but having a hard time with the Dreamcast controller there you go alright
2641397	2642318	Marbles Balance Challenge Wii
2663663	2664644	This is a slow week.
2664784	2667406	I think the Marbles Balance Challenge is a WiiWare game.
2667987	2670809	They're too busy practicing fertility rights.
2671750	2672751	Dancing the maypole.
2673932	2677015	This week there's not a whole lot coming out as well in the U.S.
2677716	2683641	Starting off Backyard Baseball 2010 coming out on the PlayStation 2, but you might as well skip that game because it sucks.
2684702	2689146	Fantasy Aquarium World, which is apparently a port of the DS franchise,
2689474	2690275	Aquarium Game.
2690955	2691736	Also sucks.
2691796	2692857	Please avoid that one.
2693197	2693918	Horrible game.
2695219	2699823	Elite Forces Unit 77 coming out on the DS.
2700984	2703145	Still horrible, but okay.
2703245	2706148	Velvet Assassin coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
2706268	2707309	That one's supposed to be okay.
2708230	2711272	Dynasty Warriors Strike Force on PSP.
2711292	2714435	Let's see here.
2715691	2719232	I think this is the wrong date, but Klonoa on the Wii is supposed to be coming out.
2719332	2723754	I think it's the week after, but we'll go with that, I guess.
2724054	2727836	Super Robot Taisen OG Saga Endless Frontier, which actually looks pretty cool.
2727876	2728936	That's coming out on the DS.
2729756	2732998	Tournament Pool coming out from Destiny, which means that must suck.
2733738	2734418	That's on the Wii.
2735439	2742161	Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming out on the DS.
2742421	2743742	Is it like Imagine Fuego?
2744807	2746669	No, not quite Imagine Fuego.
2747509	2752953	And then finally, probably the bigger game of the week, and this is sad, but X-Men Origins Wolverine.
2753574	2763161	And if you happen to be buying it on the 360 and on the PlayStation 3, the Uncaged Edition, which means it's slightly more violent, will be coming out in pretty much every system out there.
2764022	2769546	And then also some more crap from Destiny or Party Pigs, Farmyard Games on the Wii.
2771127	2772228	And that is it.
2774448	2777050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2798464	2802426	The Wii Video Service is going to be launching in Japan on May 1st.
2802806	2803826	Here's the cool thing about it.
2803986	2806467	You will be able to connect with your DSi.
2806987	2809348	Notice how it doesn't say your DS, but your DSi.
2809788	2814150	It's called the Wii No Ma Channel, and it's coming out from May 1st.
2814670	2820332	It's being launched by Nintendo, and Densu is their publisher partner.
2820852	2824654	Well, it makes sense that you couldn't do the DS because you can't download anything to the DS.
2825851	2827232	Well, you can't download programs.
2828113	2829533	Oh, to the regular DS, yeah.
2830134	2834537	I mean, you could... I guess you could... Well, couldn't you download a movie to the regular DS, close it, and have it later?
2834597	2834937	I don't know.
2835017	2836398	As long as you don't turn it off.
2836798	2840721	Because I believe it uses flash memory for the... For the...
2841341	2842302	Demo's
2870834	2872015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2896130	2897833	that you get from this channel.
2898153	2902380	You'd get it to your DSI and then they scan it on your DSI at the restaurant to redeem it.
2902880	2903321	Kind of neat.
2905126	2908807	There's a trailer out there on the internet if you want to check that out, but it is in Japanese.
2909127	2910148	So, there you go.
2911188	2913049	Do you think they'll have something like this out here soon?
2913729	2914349	Probably not.
2914369	2915889	Too much trouble for us lazy Americans.
2916290	2922211	I don't think you'll have quite that cool functionality like the fast food restaurant thing I was describing, but why not the video service?
2922992	2928313	Because that would mean that they actually are going to embrace online for the US and that's never going to happen.
2929073	2931074	But wasn't Japan always kind of holding them back?
2932321	2936845	Well, no, because... Look at the one company that's braced online better than anybody else is an American company.
2937645	2938266	Microsoft.
2938826	2939167	Yes.
2940548	2942649	And Nintendo is a Japanese-run company.
2943690	2947754	I know, and Sony has been always having to run to catch up with the online stuff.
2948823	2950204	Belize are willing to give it a shot.
2950304	2957467	I mean, after all, their systems, you know, did have, you know, support for, you know, online network games.
2957707	2962069	I mean, granted, the GameCube did as well, but, I mean, honestly, how many games really used it?
2962889	2963529	Like, two.
2966391	2966791	I don't know.
2966971	2968051	I don't think we'll see this.
2969072	2973954	I mean, after all, they haven't even brought the normal video download service to, you know, the Wii yet, so...
2975467	2976928	Why the video streaming?
2977128	2980670	I just don't see this as something they're just going to do.
2981350	2985392	It adds functionality to the Wii, but really they don't need it.
2985512	2991075	Because people want to buy Wii Sports and hopefully Wii Sports 2 or Wii Sports Resort.
2991716	2994177	Alright, well we'll see if they give this a shot in the US or not.
2994277	2995478	Probably not.
2995898	2996658	Anyway, moving on.
2996859	2997219	More news.
2999449	3004812	Well, in other news, this is actually a statement made by American McGee.
3005313	3006934	And I fully endorse this, you know.
3006954	3010236	They're asked about...
3012393	3027136	The trend of using user-made content, and American McGee was saying that it's actually extortion of the users to make the content.
3027176	3031617	They're basically using the users to make the game, they just make the properties to go with it.
3032717	3040419	He thinks that there should be some kind of reward out there for gamers who make the content, which I agree with.
3040459	3041639	I think that would be a good idea.
3042640	3045302	or at least contests and things like that.
3046243	3053929	But it's really just partially laziness on part of the programs.
3053989	3062897	I think it actually, there's the immersive element of having people, the players provide content, but at the same time, yeah, they should be rewarded for it.
3063137	3063637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3080971	3082212	Alice is Good
3102489	3103790	What do you mean if I'm going to use a drawing app?
3103810	3107434	Or let other people... Is the pencil company going to sell your drawing, basically?
3107454	3110937	Are you going to be... Yeah, but they're not selling their online content.
3110957	3115341	Are you going to be drawing up for common use so that anybody else on the internet can use your piece?
3115381	3116822	Then don't make anything for it.
3116922	3117623	I mean, that's the thing.
3117703	3124289	It's like, if you're going to be all butthurt about people using your stuff that you made, then don't make anything.
3124389	3127312	The point is that the games rely on user consent.
3127432	3135261	No, they don't, because they actually have their own standby levels, and if you never touched online, it wouldn't matter anyways, because you still got full games worth of stuff.
3135321	3137223	To be fair, I'm using LittleBigPlanet as an example.
3137303	3140666	We don't know exactly what kind of game he had in mind, either.
3140686	3141808	Oh, he's full of crap.
3141848	3146433	I mean, his game Grimm is... I'm sorry, it's not that great, but...
3147914	3148654	Whatever.
3148694	3151595	He thinks he's an expert because he's developed two game series.
3152256	3154316	Ooh, let's bow down to you.
3154556	3155037	Oh, wait.
3155277	3156717	How was your Bad Day LA game?
3156777	3157357	Oh, that's right.
3157437	3158698	It wasn't very good.
3159218	3163900	I mean, maybe if you had some user-created content, it would have made that game worth buying, but...
3164952	3174943	I don't know, it's just, I'm kind of in the middle here, like I kind of understand what he, I do agree that if companies are going to use your stuff, you should get rewards for that, you know what I mean?
3174983	3179808	You should be able to, they could even go as far as compensation, you know what I mean?
3180228	3182590	I think that there should actually be contests.
3183651	3185132	You know, content contests.
3185192	3190156	And Sony does kind of reward, like they give the crowns in LittleBigPlanet if you're super popular.
3190216	3192678	The trophies are based off the popularity of your levels.
3193098	3193919	Little perks.
3193959	3194559	Nothing big.
3194599	3195460	Like real prizes.
3196340	3196861	Real stuff.
3197581	3198262	Yeah, that's what I think.
3198547	3199687	All right.
3199727	3203949	If you guys have a comment, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is a place you can leave us a comment on this.
3204949	3209091	Or you can always send us a tweet at OLR is a place you can go as well.
3209191	3211772	Some comments from chat right now over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
3212112	3214312	Leo Shen says, hopefully that new Alice game will be good.
3214452	3216553	I keep forgetting they are working on a new Alice game, aren't they?
3217113	3218634	They're working on an Alice movie too.
3218854	3220495	Well, Alice in Wonderland.
3220535	3222775	He was supposed to be working on an Alice movie as well.
3222815	3223936	But I don't know.
3224016	3224336	It's just...
3225731	3226311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3247122	3248323	I mean, it's just one person's opinion.
3248363	3250104	Just like his opinion.
3250404	3251725	He thinks that people should be compensated.
3251985	3252385	Well, great.
3252565	3258248	If he ever creates a game that has user-created content, then I want to see him compensating everybody, since he's made such a fuss over it.
3258349	3259229	So, whatever.
3260270	3261871	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3262271	3262531	Loki.
3263471	3270476	Advent Children Complete, the brand new Blu-ray box set that came out in Japan last week, has actually been doing very well.
3270836	3272797	In fact, it's sold over 274,000 copies, and
3277182	3280243	The demo itself has actually pushed the PS3 to the top of the charts.
3281343	3285505	Because yes, people do actually want to buy this box set for the game.
3286185	3287086	And yeah, that's fine.
3287446	3288246	The movie's awesome too.
3288626	3293568	But I think it's definitely... I mean, they must be pretty confident in it.
3293768	3298350	After all, they did release a special edition PS3 in Japan with this box set.
3298890	3302311	So, you know, people love their Final Fantasy VII.
3304167	3311851	Even though it's really probably the Final Fantasy XIII demo that's driving all of this Yes I mean, how many of those came to America?
3311951	3325679	I mean, I haven't heard of people importing a game as much as I've heard of this Like, I seriously know, I know you imported it One of my friends on LiveJournal imported it I know Bobby imported it And I don't, like, I haven't heard of that many people importing anything else You know what I mean?
3326397	3327418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3354144	3355266	Oh yeah, because it'll be region free.
3355746	3356508	It'll be region free.
3356688	3357649	It'll be a few months early.
3358751	3361455	And then they'll buy it again in the US because we're all consumer whores, right?
3361495	3361996	Yep.
3362376	3362797	That's right.
3362857	3363959	Already thinking about it.
3364259	3364660	There you go.
3365137	3369619	I'm kind of curious, chat room, what kind of games, because I see Actdeft Comments has imported three games.
3370179	3373680	What are some games, chat room, you've imported in the past year?
3373700	3379062	Because, you know, when you, and the reason why I ask this is because it costs a lot more money when you order import games from Japan.
3379442	3381983	So I'm kind of curious, those of you in chat, give me some ideas.
3382023	3387805	What kind of games have you imported in the past year or two, we'll say year or two, within this current console cycle?
3388145	3389906	You know, what kind of stuff have you imported?
3390186	3393187	Is that the only thing you've imported during this cycle?
3393627	3395173	Nope, I imported Smash Bros.
3395214	3395515	Brawl.
3396679	3397783	I also imported...
3400356	3401777	Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls
3428268	3430310	I haven't even played the PS3 games I have now.
3430410	3433912	Like, I have Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 that I still haven't played anything.
3434773	3443780	You know, I haven't even gotten past, like, the first level in, um... Well, I passed the first level, but not the second level in Resistance 2, so... I don't know.
3443820	3453287	I thought about getting a Japanese Xbox 360 because I haven't figured out a good way to region-free my, um... 360, since most of the games that come out in Japan aren't region-free on the 360, so...
3455462	3456349	But that's pretty much it.
3456430	3458063	Just those three games.
3460431	3464713	Let me read some comments from our chatroom about the imports, the games that have been imported.
3465113	3473137	Actdeft says he's imported Happy Sky, Gyakuten Saiban 2, and Street Fighter's Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.
3473157	3473938	Why can't I talk tonight?
3474658	3486204	Dark Knight says 2DX Red, Leo Shen says 2DX, Poppin' and Oz, GS68 says Kitsui Death Label, Poppin' Music 13 Carnival, DJ Max Portable, Black Square, DJ
3486744	3488827	Jason says, current console cycle, I haven't.
3488887	3491310	Goldanthro says, I've never really imported a game ever.
3491670	3492591	I don't have the extra money.
3493893	3494333	There you go.
3495194	3497978	Some of the comments from things that have been imported in the current cycle.
3499319	3501722	Funny enough, none of them said the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3503224	3504445	And the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
3505475	3505775	All right.
3506657	3510141	Hey, PlayStation Home, another popular destination on the PlayStation 3.
3510181	3513044	There is an update coming for PlayStation Home.
3513305	3515307	There's going to be a new Disgaea Lounge.
3515507	3519332	And apparently in this new Disgaea area, you'll be able to play like a Disgaea test.
3519612	3522576	There'll be a card game, some type of block game available as well.
3522616	3523597	And of course, prinnies.
3524198	3526599	LittlePrettyPenguin people that you can see in this area.
3527400	3529101	Also some other stuff coming to home this month.
3529141	3530741	Street Fighter IV Avatar items.
3531142	3533403	You can start Street Fighter IV within home.
3533963	3542207	And Uncharted Waters Online, Cruz del Sur is supposed to come out as well, which offers some new home items within home.
3542908	3543408	So there you go.
3545949	3547510	That's all coming to PlayStation Home.
3547850	3549271	I haven't been to home in a while.
3549679	3552960	Me neither, but well, I guess only a couple weeks when I say a while.
3553020	3555800	So, you know, there you go.
3556180	3557901	That's all coming to PlayStation Home this month.
3559641	3560701	Well, that's special.
3562261	3563202	Very, very special.
3564742	3567742	Well, how about some different PlayStation 3 news?
3567762	3574744	This is definitely a reason that is if you... Sorry, the mic's died for a minute.
3575604	3576264	It was my fault.
3577338	3578719	Live radio, boys and girls.
3578859	3579399	Did that work?
3579639	3580960	Did you hear that microphone?
3581000	3581440	Yes, sorry.
3581460	3581961	Roar!
3581981	3582061	Okay.
3582081	3584842	You're fine, go ahead.
3584862	3586883	If you have a problem, you can take it up with me.
3590479	3598704	Anyway, so for fans of the PlayStation 3, there's a very good reason to have Arkham Asylum on that system.
3599005	3600986	Because you get to play the Joker.
3601606	3602827	The Joker is cool.
3605609	3609712	Reviews so far of the game have been pretty positive, so I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
3609732	3616896	But there's really, though, no comment on if you're going to be able to use him at all on the Xbox 360 or PC.
3617817	3617897	Um...
3619423	3621865	I don't know, because Joker is Joker.
3621925	3622245	I want Harley.
3647219	3648119	Yeah, you don't know.
3648160	3653322	Maybe there's still going to be a special character on the 360 that's going to be, you know, everybody's going to want that, too.
3653682	3658445	I mean, obviously, the Joker's the big-ass deal with the movie and everything, but, you know, I don't know.
3659525	3661967	Me, personally, I love Batman for years and years.
3662007	3665508	This will probably come out on the 360 after a certain amount of time.
3665528	3671771	It's just, you know, sweeten the deal because you've got to sell some PS3 units since there's not as many systems.
3671992	3674533	Only if one of the Joker's attacks is the magic trick.
3676018	3677979	This is Mark Hamill Joker, so probably not.
3677999	3680601	That's right, X-Link is reminding us in chat that Mark Hamill is doing the voice.
3680981	3682842	Oh my god, hot.
3683742	3689446	I'm sorry, Mark Hamill is the best voice actor ever for Joker The End.
3689586	3698631	It's also got the same guy that's doing the voice from the animated series for Batman as well, and I think they have the writer doing the actual story of the game too, so...
3699028	3699608	That's nice.
3699869	3703591	Too bad they can't get Eartha Kitt for Catwoman because she's, you know, dead.
3704691	3705332	That would have been great.
3705392	3711295	From what I've seen in the video trailer for it, I think they have the same voice actor for Harley Quinn, too.
3711655	3712276	Yay!
3712936	3713797	God, I love Harley.
3714177	3722922	I just think that she's great because she was totally made for the animated series and fans loved her so much that she made it into the comic universe.
3723122	3724803	Well, I hope the game's as good as the hype.
3726210	3727511	Everybody's getting excited about it.
3727891	3729372	Nobody's played the game yet.
3731093	3733935	Actually, some people have had their hands on early copies to review it.
3734596	3737978	And it did get some pretty good reviews.
3738058	3739659	Eurogamer really, really liked it.
3739879	3741580	They were just excited because they had early copies.
3741721	3755630	Well, Sony was teasing an electrifying announcement that they were going to make on April 27th regarding Uncharted Drake's Fortune 2 and also Infamous.
3756070	3761412	However, like any other secret announcement that they have, it got ruined by Best Buy.
3761572	3783221	So, apparently, part of the announcement, at least we can assume it's part, if not all, of the announcement, if you buy your copy of Infamous, you will get a downloadable demo, as well as access to Uncharted 2, Among Thieves, the multiplayer beta, one that launches in June.
3784321	3811867	so much like Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta you'll get to do a similar type of thing with Uncharted 2 and of course everyone's thought was hey, not only will you probably be able to play the Uncharted 2 beta but maybe the infamous character is going to be in Unlockable and Uncharted 2 so that might be another theory as well but we'll hear the official announcement on the 27th and everybody act surprised
3813436	3816097	Sorry the surprise got ruined by Best Buy, Sony.
3816177	3817858	This sad trombone's for you.
3825562	3825842	I know.
3825983	3827863	We love sad trombone here on Orange Launch Radio.
3828404	3834787	We should make that an official thing, that when this type of stuff happens, we give them a sad trombone, and then that's whatever little competition.
3834807	3836188	The sad trombone of the week.
3836248	3837769	That's right, the sad trombone of the week.
3840410	3845133	All right, we got one more story for you that won't be a sad trombone for some people are going to be very excited to hear this.
3845173	3849816	But apparently, you know, Kojima is swearing there's not going to be another Metal Gear for a while.
3850316	3855479	But one of the other games he's looking at possibly revisiting, Zone of the Enders.
3856259	3856760	That's right.
3857080	3859541	Apparently they are interested in making a Zone of the Enders 3.
3860122	3863003	And this came up during one of the Metal Gear Solid 4 podcasts.
3864858	3870380	It's been six years since Zone of the Enders, the second runner, but apparently Kojima is interested.
3870941	3874842	He wants gamers to email them if they're interested in seeing it happen.
3875283	3884667	So if you want to add to the email barrage I'm sure they're getting right now, go check that out, the MGS4 podcast, and you can send them an email.
3885387	3886248	Zone of the Enders 3
3902358	3902618	Yes!
3904239	3904739	Sure, why not?
3904979	3906300	As long as Sana sings the song
3931812	3932893	DarkSakura is back DarkSakura is back
3948070	3949430	The Game of the Week is Klonoa.
3949470	3950051	Because Klonoa is great.
3950151	3950811	Let's have some music, Rob.
3974622	3978304	Yes, this is from the PlayStation 1 version of Klonoa.
3978624	3979164	Let's check it out.
3980785	3981626	Explosions!
3982987	3984047	I love these games, guys.
3984347	3986709	I'm gonna choke on the queue.
3986729	3988770	This is not the best music ever.
4003786	4007349	You can still just see how nauseously cute this game is from music.
4007549	4008150	There you go.
4008170	4014096	Well, it starts off nauseously cute, but how many people has, uh, actually, uh, played the damn game?
4014796	4018460	Um, basically, you start off, um, in a world called Phantom Isle.
4019340	4024905	Um, Klonoa lives in his little village called Breeze Gale, and he lives with his grandfather.
4026187	4026907	And, um...
4028108	4036553	He goes and visits dream worlds where he has to go and save different people.
4038354	4045278	So basically he meets up with his buddy named Hupal who lives in a ring that Klonoa found in the forest.
4046298	4049420	And that's where Klonoa gets his power from.
4053590	4069774	So, uh, he basically has to go and rescue this girl named Lolo, who is a, uh, um, well, actually, wrong one, because he has to, no, I think it's Lolo that he has to, to, to, what's he have rescued?
4073018	4073598	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4093667	4102296	He thinks that darker emotions should reign and that you should accept it as much as you do the light.
4103497	4109844	However, he's just doing this to do it, so...
4111866	4123757	As you go through the game, pretty much you're having to... I really don't want to spoil things too much, but as it goes through, you have to go through the different stages and fight the different bosses.
4123837	4127901	And the game plays sort of pseudo-3D.
4128041	4128181	It's...
4130083	4141951	It plays on a 2D platform, but you've got some three-dimensional elements thrown in, like hitting stuff that goes into the background, like to pop eggs to get more jewels to power your stuff up with.
4142531	4148375	Or you can also rescue these different people that live in different places.
4148435	4153559	Like you've got these people that look like Klonoa in the first level, and you have these people that look like moon things in the next level.
4154379	4165590	But you have to go through and actually rescue people as you go along and fight the enemies by picking up the smaller enemies and throwing them at the bigger ones or using the different properties.
4165910	4170294	Like there's ones that fly and you have to grab them and they'll fly you upwards a little bit.
4172596	4174338	It's a ton of fun.
4174358	4177000	We actually did get a sequel over here in the U.S.
4177441	4179242	which was Klonoa 2, Limity's Veil.
4180363	4190792	Um, and, uh, it, it really, it used, uh, cell shading for the game, and, um, this is, actually, uh, this is where, um, those other characters came in.
4191113	4203643	It, I don't, I'll be perfectly honest, I haven't played the first Klonoa in a long, long time, so I don't really remember all the people's names except for Joka and Godius, and I remember his grandfather, which was very sad, and I'm not gonna say what happens to him.
4204164	4205225	Joka, though, sucks.
4206135	4207756	Sucks a lot!
4208736	4221243	But Klonoa 2 had the sort of platformer levels and different types of boss battles and time attack challenges and water parks and things like that too.
4222143	4241834	Um, but the thing about this game, about actually both of the games I'd say, is that for as cute and light as they look, and you know, it'd be a game that a little kid could play and not really understand the darker elements to, it does have a ton of darker elements.
4241894	4244575	I mean, really, this game gets downright freaking depressing.
4245856	4246877	Just depressing.
4247697	4251900	I mean, the further you get on in the game, you're like, oh my god, can this get any more screwed up?
4252340	4253761	And then it gets more screwed up.
4254441	4254801	So yeah.
4254821	4256582	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4256783	4261105	Now, did you happen to pick this game this week because there's that Wii version coming out very soon, or just coincidence?
4261525	4269490	Well, I was thinking about it, and what I do now when I pick a classic game is I'll look through my own collection, which usually takes me quite a while.
4271171	4275174	But I happened to see Klonoa, and I was like, oh, Klonoa's coming out this week, so I may as well pick it.
4276074	4280457	Um, but there's also, um, other versions of the game, too.
4280497	4286181	There's, um, uh, Klonoa 2 Dream Champ Tournament that came out in Game Boy Advance in Japan.
4287582	4291325	Um, and it actually did come out over here quite a bit later.
4292285	4300731	Um, there's also Klonoa Moonlight Museum, which came out in Japan on WonderSwan, which I, I might have, um,
4302512	4308196	But there's also Klonoa Empire of Dreams that also came out for Game Boy Advance.
4309137	4317122	And there's actually in 2002, there was Klonoa Heroes Legend of the Star Metal, which is an action RPG.
4317982	4321165	So you can actually play through the game as an RPG.
4322465	4326788	For other things, Klonoa had a cameo in MotoGP and Alpine Racer 3.
4332732	4338654	were a playable pair in Namco vs. Capcom.
4339214	4342595	And they had their moves from Klonoa Heroes.
4342795	4347817	And you can also see Joka, Janga, and the moves as enemies.
4349057	4350718	And also Lolo and...
4352378	4378043	Lala Kusha who was another priestess as non-playable characters and in Tales of Symphonia you could put Persia in a Klonoa costume there's also Shippu Tengoku Kaze no Klonoa which was a really just comedic manga about Klonoa who was a kid who wanted to be a superhero and
4383087	4384869	Really, that's it.
4384889	4387872	I mean, it's just a fun, fun, fun game.
4388352	4394858	It's really, really... It can get difficult because you have to think ahead with the puzzles.
4395339	4403607	You have to always be keeping your eyes open, but it does build up in such a way that the learning curve really is a bit more kind.
4407535	4414083	It's... In fact, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the website I used to have a long time ago.
4414743	4416926	It was called the Anime and Video Game Alliance.
4417507	4419949	Yes, this was a long, long time ago.
4420490	4425656	But my... One of my banner characters was a picture of Klonoa.
4426657	4426777	So...
4428107	4430308	Alright, so... I've liked this game for a very long time.
4430568	4433528	Definitely a classic, one that I know some of our listeners love.
4433548	4434909	They love that you picked this tonight.
4434929	4437009	So there you have it, Klonoa.
4437729	4438970	Your classic video game of the week.
4439270	4441070	Oh, wait, did you play the conversation track?
4441210	4442330	Yeah, I played it in the background already.
4442490	4442931	Oh, sorry.
4442951	4444771	Well, if we can go back to the beginning of that one.
4445391	4445751	I will try, yes.
4445771	4456954	This is the other thing I wanted to bring up, is that they have sort of a made-up language, which I tried to see if they were speaking Japanese or something, and of course, given the voice actors, it borrows a lot of elements from Japanese, but it's not quite...
4457794	4459878	It actually reminds me of La La Nea.
4474327	4474667	Cute.
4475067	4475287	Alright.
4502545	4502925	Klonoa.
4503625	4506146	Klonoa, your classic game of the week.
4506706	4508967	We also did, Dan and I used to walk around going, what do?
4509807	4510567	Just because.
4510908	4511188	All right.
4511668	4517049	That's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4517069	4522891	We've got more stories to talk about in part B, some Xbox 360, some Penny Arcade Expo news we have as well, and plenty more.
4522951	4526572	So we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4532938	4538580	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 26th of 2009.
4538620	4545222	We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and then we put out the podcast at some point.
4545642	4549724	Alright, my name of course is Rob Roberts, joining you for this lovely Part B here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4550024	4556666	DarkSakura is here as well, Loki, special guest tonight, The Doctor, and Rice Princess, and we've been joined by somebody else.
4556686	4556866	I thought
4557286	4559848	Fart Princess, Rice Princess, Wine and Belly Flop Night
4582503	4583684	A new challenger has arrived.
4583764	4584885	A new challenger has arrived.
4584985	4586866	Who is our new person?
4586886	4587667	Never been on the show before.
4588687	4589408	This is Melly Welly.
4589848	4590328	Melly Welly.
4590589	4591109	Hello.
4591349	4591889	Hi, Melly Welly.
4591909	4592250	How are you?
4592910	4593731	I am good.
4594091	4594251	Yes.
4594291	4594911	I'm not loud enough.
4595192	4595572	That's all right.
4595852	4596793	It takes a little getting used to.
4596813	4599655	You have to practically scream into the microphone to be heard around here, but that's all right.
4600535	4602697	Quickly, Melly Welly, what kind of video games do you enjoy?
4604155	4609797	I actually enjoy Flash games, like the reason that it took me a while to get here is because I was playing the new GemCraft prequel.
4610758	4611638	Oh, what's GemCraft?
4611678	4612238	I've not heard of this.
4612418	4617360	It's like a tower defense game, but you use gems in the towers, and it's actually really nerdy, but it's a lot of fun.
4618154	4620316	Those Tower of Defense games are pretty crazy awesome, though.
4620496	4622257	There's a big Final Fantasy one right now that's new.
4622737	4623578	So, there you go.
4624218	4624679	Very cool.
4624759	4628602	Have you played... What is that?
4629182	4630083	Don't Shit Your Pants?
4630323	4633365	That's my favorite Flash game as of late.
4633425	4634546	That's the one I like.
4634566	4637708	I think I heard you guys talking about it a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had a chance to play it.
4638909	4640329	That's the one I reckon it is.
4640369	4642630	Is that why you're not wearing any right now?
4642750	4645531	No, there's a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants.
4647531	4648491	What's this, Rice Princess?
4648511	4649311	You play this every day?
4650012	4656693	Yes, I play the Don't Shit My Pants game every day because I successfully don't shit my pants every day.
4657633	4660314	I'm talking about the Flash game, Rice Princess, not real life.
4661754	4661874	Oh.
4663975	4664335	There you go.
4664395	4664655	All right.
4666576	4669119	Anyhow, alright, so yeah, that's a great Flash game, I recommend that.
4669139	4681654	And then of course we talked about Part A, you probably missed it because you were on your way over here, but we were actually talking about some of the old school Sierra games, like the very first Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry are now Flash games available on the internet that you can play somewhere.
4682235	4683536	I might have to find Leisure Suit Larry.
4684117	4686460	They have that, Leisure Suit Larry 1 is playable, so check that out.
4687714	4688294	All right, anyhow.
4689615	4691896	Also, the chat room is always joining us every week.
4691936	4693537	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4693897	4694678	Dan Shadow in chat.
4695038	4698100	I just barely beat the first level of the FF Tower defense game.
4698440	4700601	Yeah, that game's kind of hard, actually.
4701902	4702362	Let's see.
4702722	4706484	I Like Old People asks, is Rob actually not wearing any pants?
4706504	4707125	That's the name.
4708610	4709611	Why are you laughing?
4709671	4710971	Yes, it's true.
4711291	4712632	Rob is not wearing any pants.
4712672	4714013	No, I am too wearing pants.
4714213	4716694	No, you see, because he just got some new Hello Kitty undies.
4717155	4718295	And he's got to show them off.
4718835	4719296	Shut up.
4720356	4721637	Rob is dancing in his panties.
4723818	4724679	Shut up, all of you.
4725739	4726480	That's a good chat name.
4726500	4726940	I like that name.
4727000	4727500	I like old people.
4727520	4728981	We still have to get Rob some manties.
4729628	4730309	I like old people too.
4730349	4731530	In fact, I was very saddened by the way.
4731550	4732651	I do want to mention at some point today.
4733051	4734513	Very saddened to hear about Bea Arthur.
4734693	4738156	That's, I mean, really, like really ruined my day yesterday.
4738496	4741839	I was having a great day and then I heard, I did a charity walk yesterday morning.
4741879	4742160	It was great.
4742180	4744982	I was slightly amused that she was mentioned on the Deadpool Bugle.
4746123	4748486	Because Deadpool is obsessed with Bea Arthur.
4748546	4749166	Too soon.
4749587	4750087	Too soon.
4750287	4751448	She's 86.
4751929	4753390	I know, but she just died.
4753450	4754271	Show a little respect.
4754871	4755092	Alright.
4757054	4758575	Anyhow, I'll tell you what's funny though.
4758775	4758955	What?
4759956	4760976	You miss because you miss class.
4763238	4765299	Sorry, she's in my typography class with me.
4767300	4771202	We were doing brainstorming about doing our play on words thing project that we have coming up.
4771922	4774864	And one of the words that came up just by accident was mod.
4774904	4777265	And we started talking about the TV show just a little bit.
4777285	4778366	And then the next day, dead.
4779086	4779587	OMG, dead.
4779627	4781748	That happened with Ricardo Montalban.
4783291	4794013	We were listening to Montalban, which is our cage match winning song, the night before and watching the Rich Corinthian leather commercial, and then he died the next day.
4795114	4796154	Also, that looks like a penis.
4798294	4798434	Okay.
4798454	4801695	I think what they're listening to is that secretly DarkSakura is the Grim Reaper.
4803095	4803776	It could very well be.
4805356	4806276	Are you the Grim Reaper?
4807116	4807877	Do you want to find out?
4811400	4813661	I will reap you with my grim reaping equipment.
4814762	4822506	I was trying to find the intro to Mod on YouTube somewhere so I could actually play it, but the best thing I could find was I found this here.
4823286	4824287	No, I found something different.
4824887	4830290	The Family Guy one is on there, but I found Rosie O'Donnell singing it.
4840024	4840724	I'll tell you what, though.
4841625	4843347	Here's your Bea Arthur trivia for the night.
4843447	4843887	Oh, God.
4844267	4847190	The show Mod was a spinoff of All in the Family.
4847210	4848231	All in the Family, yes it was.
4848291	4850733	The show Good Times was a spinoff of Mod.
4852154	4852795	There's your trivia.
4852815	4852955	Really?
4853616	4853916	Yes.
4854476	4855097	Now you know.
4855798	4857059	And knowing is half the battle.
4857199	4859241	Now I know that, what was the show with Urkel?
4859361	4861603	Family Matters was a spinoff of Perfect Strangers.
4861623	4861823	No.
4864115	4890065	No, the mother God damn it, I will go throw down on this The mother of Family Matters was the elevator person on Perfect Strangers Yeah, and then the Full House baby was on the other show, so shut up You shut up, maybe they were all related Alright, anyway Hi, we actually talk about video games, not just ABC Friday Night Lineup Hey, we're not talking about food That's right, and But Rob, it's Friday night And the mood is right Shut up, I hate you
4891348	4901835	Gonna have some fun, show you how it's done, TGIF Okay, what the fuck, Alpha Cananogram Why don't I have a Jamaican accent?
4901875	4903476	Why do you ask this weird question?
4903496	4918045	Alright, I want to point this out, though But this Cleo is not the Reaper I have something very important I need to point out, though It is not actually TGIF without...
4932091	4936754	Everybody, sing along if you know it.
4936834	4939136	I only know the chorus.
4939176	4939776	We have to fast forward.
4939796	4941037	I don't know this part.
4941057	4942618	Yes, I want everyone at home to sing it.
4944239	4945359	Step by Step was amazing.
4946300	4947761	Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers.
4947921	4950483	Dude, Suzanne Somers, the makers of the Somersize Diet.
4951670	4953571	They did tell the baby what lesbians were.
4953611	4954112	That was pretty cool.
4962911	4967713	So the writers had to put in less... Oddly enough, that's two minutes longer than my interest in the show.
4968973	4973115	So, Loki, how about you save us... Loki, video games!
4973255	4976296	So we get sick of TV and we turn on a video game.
4976656	4978297	Loki, goddamn, save the show, please.
4978777	4984139	What would be called the complete opposite of Step by Step, there was a new Fallout game announced.
4984979	4994623	This one will be taking place in New Vegas, or I guess post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, which we can only expect to be awesome.
4995103	4999785	And it's apparently not a sequel to Fallout 3, but it's just another game in the Fallout universe.
5001645	5003066	In this one, do you start out as a fetus?
5004666	5005127	Maybe.
5006227	5009748	I think it's actually going to go through the whole chain of evolution.
5010969	5012129	You start off as an amoeba.
5012249	5013990	It's half Spore, half Fallout.
5016676	5018517	Yeah, you have to make your way to the grandstand.
5020257	5022618	Well, I mean... Doctor, we can't hear you if you're not saying it in a mic.
5022859	5024859	No, just because Melanie was shaking her head.
5024899	5029821	I was like, no, but you started as a baby, which I thought was dumb.
5029941	5033483	A lot of people like the intro to Fallout, that you're a baby.
5034223	5036224	Because you can press a button to make a baby noise over and over.
5037184	5038845	I wonder if you can press a button to shit.
5039805	5040105	Shut up.
5040125	5045027	For the record, this is the shit show, not the fuck show.
5045328	5045848	Alright, look...
5047830	5048250	What was I saying?
5048270	5050071	I don't remember what I was saying because I'm drinking wine.
5051072	5052072	Yeah, a new Fallout game.
5052453	5053013	Obvious.
5053473	5054734	Hello, hello, obvious.
5054814	5055894	Of course this is going to make me fall in love.
5055914	5057395	Sequel to successive selling game?
5057435	5057896	Yeah.
5057916	5061417	There may be a Final Fantasy XIV coming out someday.
5061698	5063699	Oh, how about a new Mario game on the Wii?
5063719	5065400	Oh, maybe a new Zelda game in the works?
5065500	5066840	I think they're all happening.
5067541	5069242	Metroid Prime 4, you betcha.
5070883	5074705	They need to do Metroid Primal where Samus is a catwoman.
5077762	5083587	This is going to be an interesting show because I haven't eaten much today, so only like a little bit of wine that I'm drinking so far is kind of having an effect.
5084067	5084748	I want cake.
5085128	5086650	The cake was not a lie.
5087270	5091034	It was made... Doctor, you keep asking me to take my pants off.
5091074	5091634	I'm going to do it.
5091794	5092335	Just you wait.
5092395	5096318	No, for the love of God and all that is holy, keep your pants on.
5097159	5100522	Which in Jamie speak means, please take your pants off right now.
5103015	5104497	Take off your pants and have them on your head.
5104998	5113268	Everyone on the entirety of the internet should be thankful that A, this is a radio show, and B, that Justin TV only shows video of our games now.
5113288	5114089	Aren't you glad you came tonight?
5114129	5115591	It's on slideshow mode tonight anyway.
5117133	5117553	Yes, it does.
5117893	5118114	Anyhow.
5119576	5120236	Oh, Microsoft.
5120256	5120957	Hi, Microsoft.
5121826	5126350	Microsoft, with their pants on, had a press conference in Japan this week.
5126870	5129572	And they were saying, hey Japan, we didn't forget about you.
5129592	5133876	In fact, we've got 31 games that are on their way for the Xbox 360 out here.
5134276	5136678	Including some big games that you guys are excited about.
5136738	5138259	Magna Carta 2 in August.
5138740	5141462	End of Eternity, which is a new RPG from Tri-Ace.
5142282	5146446	Also, Mass Effect is going to be making its way to Japan on May 21st.
5146626	5150409	I know that's a long time since our release of it, but they've translated it apparently for Japan.
5151029	5161413	Also, Virtual On, Mega Man 9 for Japan in June, Space Invaders Extreme, King of Fighters 2002, just lots and lots of new games coming out in Japan.
5162053	5166915	They also added Pachinko to Mass Effect, which is pretty cool, because every game needs Pachinko.
5168055	5169496	That's a complete lie, but that's alright.
5169516	5170516	A little Pachinko minigame.
5170596	5171976	I thought that was the Wii that had that.
5172437	5173117	Pachinko minigames.
5173820	5174040	Alright.
5174841	5175482	Anyway, so there you go.
5175502	5177144	31 new games coming to Japan.
5177724	5180767	And with that, 31 more Xboxes sold in Japan.
5180867	5182950	That's it.
5183530	5182950	31?
5184311	5185012	In a row?
5185312	5186193	31 flavors and then some.
5188335	5188615	Alright.
5188936	5189677	More news, please.
5190339	5191679	How about GTA 4?
5191759	5192340	How about it?
5193100	5197861	It's... I mean, it's getting... It stinks!
5199902	5201082	The peasants are revolting.
5201142	5202202	Yeah, they stink on ice.
5202702	5203963	Anyway.
5204283	5207924	GTA 4 is getting an Xbox 360 Elite bundle.
5207944	5208864	Get that off my foot.
5209164	5209564	Sorry.
5210004	5210785	It's where it landed.
5211405	5211905	New cup!
5212005	5212485	Move down!
5213125	5213365	Anyway.
5214006	5215266	And no, we didn't go with the teacups, Rob.
5215745	5217185	Did I mention Jamie's been drinking too?
5217245	5220266	So if this show gets really, really random, I apologize in advance.
5220686	5222987	The alcohol's going to be burned off in about five seconds.
5223667	5224387	True, this is wine.
5225968	5240571	Anyway, there is going to be later this year a Grand Theft Auto 4 bundle that is going to be for $399.
5240611	5244112	And we have no idea what it's going to look like.
5245399	5251402	It's basically just like how there's a new bundle that's been announced this week that's coming out.
5251962	5257985	Well, that's mocked up, but with Fallout 3, Fable 2, and Halo 3 that's going to be coming out.
5258005	5259946	They're going to be doing this kind of every few weeks.
5260366	5267829	This one, they're speculating, is going to come out maybe around the time of the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 sometime in the fall.
5267849	5269430	That's actually what I was going to be saying.
5270310	5271751	Well, you stopped talking, so I didn't know.
5272451	5273051	My turn.
5273972	5274092	Go.
5275310	5275610	I'm done.
5276131	5276411	Alright.
5278092	5278613	Let me finish!
5278633	5279033	Let me finish!
5279453	5279834	Are you finished?
5280194	5280654	Yeah, I'm finished.
5282676	5283096	Alright.
5283537	5288301	Well, something else that's coming out, and this can't be good in any way because it's Driver.
5289421	5291963	Ubisoft has trademarked a new Driver game.
5293024	5293164	And...
5295256	5303278	You know, I'm just... I guess it can't get worse than it is already, but apparently Driver 5, they recruit.
5304358	5311459	And, um... Assuming that it's coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, we are recruiting you to play our shit game.
5311699	5314880	I hope it's not as bad as all the other Driver games.
5315140	5315860	Except for the first one.
5315880	5317040	The first game was awesome.
5317360	5318321	Second one was okay.
5318421	5322842	Third just went down into the pooper, and then the rest just sucked from there on out.
5324542	5324862	Oh well.
5327042	5330603	But then again, I kind of want to play it because I liked how crappy they were.
5335625	5338426	Well, yeah, you liked how crappy the Driver games were, right?
5338466	5343087	Yes, I actually thought about picking up Driver 3 again just to play because it's that bad.
5343107	5344628	Just to relive how crappy it is?
5345848	5346048	Yes.
5346769	5347529	I have to remind myself.
5348909	5349289	Alright.
5350210	5350710	Sounds good.
5352789	5358011	Lego Rock Band, we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago that it was rumored, but fuck, we all knew it was true.
5358872	5361693	And it was finally officially announced, Lego Rock Band is happening.
5362834	5364834	It's happening holiday of this year, as it was announced.
5365855	5372858	Lego Rock Band is going to be coming on the PlayStation 3, the 360, the Wii, and the DS, and there's screenshots to prove it, and yes, it's Lego people in a rock band.
5372998	5373758	Mid-November.
5375719	5379341	By the way, some of the songs that will be included in the game, Song 2 by Blur,
5380834	5386836	Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting, Europe with The Final Countdown, Good Charlotte with Boys and Girls, and Pink with So What.
5387816	5391837	So these are kind of like, I guess they're saying more kid-friendly songs, although I don't know.
5393177	5395498	Pink isn't the most kid-friendly artist in the world.
5395518	5397279	She has some pretty nasty songs, you know what I mean?
5397499	5399099	You and Your Hand, hello, have you ever heard that song?
5400359	5405221	I know you like Blur, but we don't know yet if you're going to be able to import these songs into the other games.
5405301	5405881	Probably not.
5405901	5409262	If they're trying to keep a kid safe, they're probably going to keep the game segregated, don't you think?
5410640	5416243	It's also being published by Warner Brothers, Warner Games, and not EA.
5416383	5418625	So there's another problem with that, too.
5418665	5425349	I mean, I would hope that you'd be able to import them because, you know, I would like a little bit of Kung Fu Fighting or Final Countdown in Rock Band 2.
5425629	5427290	But I don't know.
5427530	5428731	I mean, it doesn't sound bad.
5429091	5430592	If the song list is good, I'd pick it up.
5431670	5439412	Alright, by the way, in this game as well, apparently you're going to be able to collect pieces in the regular mode where you build cooler vehicles and go to new venues by building the pieces.
5440012	5443352	There's an extra easy setting for children, I'm assuming.
5443772	5445973	And apparently there will now be challenges in this game.
5445993	5453274	You'll be able to destroy a giant robot, summon a storm, and demolish a skyscraper all with your drums and guitar and vocals.
5454355	5454675	Awesome.
5455255	5457515	It means you battle with the power of rocking out?
5457995	5460956	Still no word, however, on whether or not
5462723	5466705	You're going to be able to do the whole exporting of the songs and all that.
5468086	5468546	So there you go.
5470066	5470327	That's it.
5470507	5472447	I could save the world through the power of my walking out.
5472628	5473068	Can you now?
5474168	5474568	Yes.
5475329	5475889	You want to see?
5477239	5477799	No, that's okay.
5477879	5480281	Actually, I can't show anyone because then I'd have to kill you all.
5481962	5483142	Well, this makes me happy.
5483182	5486284	This makes my insides quiver with delight.
5488546	5489446	What am I... Ew.
5491347	5492988	I was talking about my liver.
5494569	5495590	I was talking about my liver.
5495610	5496410	I think I just verped.
5496670	5497651	You made my liver quiver.
5497991	5500753	Hey, Justin TV's complaining it's boring because there's no games going on.
5500773	5501933	Play something.
5501953	5502934	Is anyone going to play a video game?
5506311	5507812	Play a goddamn game, Rice Princess.
5509533	5511294	Play something easy that'll keep them entertained.
5514657	5516978	I can try to play a game, but I'm doing the show.
5516998	5518959	I'm drunk, too, so I don't know if... No, I'm not drunk.
5518999	5520140	Just a little buzzed.
5521521	5524283	Just play... Don't play Rob's Wiener.
5524383	5524923	Don't do that.
5525263	5525864	Hug what?
5526004	5526764	In lap?
5526865	5527445	Phone what?
5529110	5529870	We're translating.
5530531	5531531	Okay, game.
5532492	5533852	Xbox Live Arcade.
5534853	5540396	Well, SNK people are doing drugs and they're doing happy drugs that make me happy and want to do drugs.
5540756	5541456	Wait, wrong way.
5541896	5549980	Anyway, a game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade which is called King of Fighters Sky Stage.
5550000	5550200	Aww.
5555427	5557569	I'm being raped during the show, I want to point out.
5557810	5558431	Shoulder rape.
5558611	5559973	I was just raped live on air.
5561695	5562917	Because you took your pants off.
5562997	5564139	I did not take my pants off.
5564359	5564900	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
5564920	5566342	How many of us are not wearing socks and shoes?
5567623	5568585	Myself, you, and Loki.
5569392	5572534	Mississippi or G Shut up and read your story.
5574195	5585081	Anyway, the game is coming out called King of Fighters Sky Stage which is your King of Fighters characters flying around and shooting stuff out of their hands.
5586181	5588763	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5607984	5609444	Are we going to see Mai's tits or not?
5609504	5611665	That's the big question we want to know about this game.
5611685	5616726	The only characters that I'm seeing in the screenshots here are Kyo and Athena.
5617827	5622208	And Athena's shooting, it looks like eggs out of her head.
5623108	5625029	Like pink and white eggs.
5626169	5626569	Wow.
5627409	5629310	She's shooting dip and dots at people.
5630470	5631491	Kyo is shooting fire.
5633711	5636632	And as we all know, fire makes everything better.
5639825	5642387	Out of all the games she could play, she's playing Rygar?
5642887	5643248	Really?
5643988	5644329	Really?
5644929	5650433	Yeah, that was the cool Rygar was the arcade one.
5650493	5655277	This one's the... Yeah, you need to be playing Karnav.
5655377	5655938	No, I'm just kidding.
5655958	5657379	I actually really like Rygar.
5657679	5659340	Stop tickling me on air!
5659400	5660041	It's not funny!
5661482	5662062	Leave me alone!
5665160	5675391	Rob, Peter, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
5687409	5691430	I swear to God, one more time and the pants are coming off.
5691591	5694932	Irene is not shitting her pants.
5695572	5697153	Oh my God, I can't hear anything.
5698113	5699153	You have to do it right.
5700414	5701734	Stop tickling me.
5702354	5702815	Loki.
5704875	5705256	Story.
5705276	5706276	Do you have one?
5706673	5708674	I know, Loki, please save this show.
5709315	5721563	Muramasa Demon Blade lost its publisher earlier this week, which is not good, but at least it picked up a new one, and that new publisher would be Ignition Entertainment.
5721963	5728428	However, because the publisher changed, the game will now be coming out in September instead of June.
5729721	5730982	But hey, at least it's still coming out.
5731162	5732582	And it's actually kind of fun.
5733102	5734703	Just I wish I knew what was going on.
5735283	5736544	So English might help with that.
5738625	5739425	English is useful.
5740125	5740685	It is useful.
5743367	5745247	Is this the same game you had here a couple weeks ago?
5745487	5745707	Yes.
5747568	5750449	And I thought it was coming out next week or something.
5750469	5751690	It had to get pushed back because of that?
5752190	5753411	No, it wasn't coming out next week.
5753451	5755591	It was coming out in June, originally.
5755852	5756032	Hmm.
5758420	5761883	but yeah, so it came out in Japan already alright
5763443	5765844	A game that has not come out yet is Street Fighter 4.
5766224	5771648	On the PC, not at the consoles obviously, but Street Fighter 4 has not made its way to the PC just yet.
5772169	5775010	Apparently there is a PC version in the works, you've probably heard about it before.
5776191	5779453	Apparently the game is actually going to be bundled with fighting sticks, maybe.
5779493	5782235	They haven't said one way or the other if it will for sure or not yet.
5782676	5791041	However, it has been announced on the official Japanese Street Fighter 4 blog that they will be announcing the PC version's release date on May 1st.
5792162	5796586	So yes, I am reporting an announcement of an announcement of a game that's already out.
5798267	5798908	I mean, really.
5799748	5800069	Really.
5800349	5803612	I'm blinking audibly, but the mic can't pick it up, so.
5804192	5809116	I mean, but is it really worth this much hype for the PC version of a game that's already out?
5809136	5809877	I mean, don't get me wrong.
5810257	5811598	I understand there's some PC gamers.
5811738	5813120	Street Fighter IV is a great game.
5813360	5815281	There's an audience of people very happy about this.
5815582	5818244	But really, we need a release date for a release date.
5819701	5820202	Come on.
5820783	5822085	Get off your high horse, Capcom.
5822105	5822906	Just tell us the date.
5823487	5824228	Just tell us the date.
5825229	5826030	Stop making people wait.
5829876	5835665	Articles like this make me angry, and when I get angry, naughty music plays, and it brings on a segment called The F'ers of the Week.
5851496	5856698	I do want to point out, Leo Shen in the chat makes a good point, if Street Fighter 4 is out on the PC, nude mods.
5857598	5858318	That might be worth it.
5858358	5860139	Alright, DarkSakura, your FUs of the week.
5861399	5865440	Um, FU to being way too busy.
5865540	5867481	I have way too much shit to do.
5868521	5868962	Fair enough.
5868982	5870062	Way too much shit to do.
5870462	5871102	All before Friday.
5872423	5873023	Uh, Loki.
5874368	5903124	F you to the squirrel that is bothering my cat because the squirrel has figured out that we have bird seed on the porch and so it decided to try to dig out all the sunflower seeds that are in there and my cat can't get to it so it frustrates the hell out of her of which I put more bird seed on the porch but it's still funny but yeah since she can't give enough you because she's a cat meow meow meow meow meow meow exactly meow meow
5905879	5908480	My FU of the week goes to this program.
5910341	5912241	Melly Melly, what's your FU of the week?
5912742	5919124	My FU of the week goes to going to a celebration party, getting really stupid, and doing something really stupid.
5920305	5923666	That's never fun when we wake up in the morning and go, that was stupid.
5926187	5928909	Rice Princess, The Doctor, do you have any FUs?
5928929	5929809	Come over here and say them on the mic.
5932265	5934226	F you, Rob, for not being pantless.
5936408	5937388	Uh, yes, Rice Princess.
5938970	5940370	F you to shitting in your pants.
5942812	5944533	That can be a day ruiner right there.
5945514	5945894	Alright.
5946555	5947095	Good lord.
5949093	5949754	DarkSakura.com
5969881	5972624	Then I'll need a ton of sanitizer.
5973564	5974085	Oh my god.
5974285	5975506	Anyway, first email.
5976087	5979550	This comes from Rini.
5980511	5986096	This is to chime in briefly on the recent feature they should have put on the DSi that would have made Rob buy a DSi.
5986756	5990518	Loki commented that the music player sucks because it only supports AAC.
5991178	5993460	In reality, AAC is superior to MP3.
5993580	6000543	AAC's main strength is that it can achieve the same quality of sound that MP3 would have at higher bit rates and smaller file sizes.
6000563	6004345	The whole albums in MP3 will decrease in megabytes when they're converted to AAC.
6005626	6018229	If there's something to bitch about DSI Sound, it's that it really accepts M4A, MP4, and 3GP files because they're the container for the AAC audio.
6018689	6023411	For what it does, DSI Music Player is actually competent feature-wise for a basic music player.
6023871	6027592	There's no real playlist function, but who uses those on a portable device?
6028012	6028692	I have an iPhone.
6029332	6031794	Thank you for watching!
6050584	6051365	Link that later.
6052545	6057227	But if you need a GBA slot and don't want the fancy crap, get a Lite.
6057807	6058647	The camera is shit.
6058667	6060148	The browser is a last resort.
6061028	6069352	But the DSi shop sounds great and I want to see what developers can do with the upgraded processor, larger memory, and the camera for gamers.
6071873	6072933	There's also more.
6072993	6073653	There's a PS.
6073833	6074374	I apologize.
6074434	6075674	I'm still not sold.
6076895	6077635	We need to see more.
6078886	6079186	P.S.
6079246	6083029	WarioWare snapped is an insult both as a game and to the series.
6083429	6085791	Don't spend 500 points free or bought on a game.
6086051	6087111	You'll only play once.
6087292	6087652	I didn't.
6088432	6088913	P.P.S.
6089093	6094516	Sky, when the next class update for Team Fortress 2 comes out, you're getting my invite for a free weekend.
6095097	6097518	Team Fortress 2 has classes attuned to your play style.
6097618	6098499	Can't aim for shit.
6099159	6101961	Or maybe you've bought the orange box for $10 from Steam's weekend sale.
6102762	6103262	And today...
6103542	6104282	I wish I had.
6104403	6105383	No, I already have Portal.
6105503	6107124	That was the game I wanted most in there.
6108085	6109786	I suck at Team Fortress.
6110326	6113147	That's why you get the special classes.
6114088	6114508	We'll see.
6115969	6117910	I'm just really horrible at first-person shooters.
6117950	6121592	Words do not do my suckage justice, if that makes sense.
6121612	6123913	Unless you don't want to throw up every time you play one.
6124634	6125414	That would be me!
6126935	6128356	Or even watch someone play one shoot.
6129416	6129857	More email.
6131177	6132098	Hi, OLR!
6133339	6134260	Hi, happy listener!
6134980	6136602	I just thought I'd mention a few things.
6137142	6143968	First off, there was a glaring error in the email I sent you last week, specifically in regards to some of the Capcom games coming to PSN.
6144669	6148592	I had mistakenly said SNK vs. Capcom 2 instead of Marvel vs. Capcom.
6149213	6155398	To my credit, once I did catch the error, I left you a voice message, but I guess the message was overlooked accidentally.
6156119	6157760	I don't do the voicemails, so whatever.
6159361	6160562	I just want to correct that bit of news...
6164008	6166551	for our fellow listeners' sake more than anything else.
6167412	6170895	By the way, if you three haven't already, try picking up Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
6171056	6171816	Yes, I have it.
6172417	6175500	I picked it up a few weeks ago, partially due to Bobby Blackwolf's recommendation.
6175961	6177703	In a nutshell, it's 40 games for 30 bucks.
6177743	6182408	You really can't get much better than that unless Sega pays us to take their games.
6182648	6183048	Sarcasm.
6184049	6189391	If I had to recommend one version over another, I'd have to pick the PS3 version.
6189491	6197193	Although fundamentally the same, the 360 already has many of the games within the collection on the Xbox Live Arcade, nods are most of us have at least some of them.
6198013	6200114	Really, at least some of them?
6200154	6201514	How about multiple copies of each?
6203015	6203676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6219454	6221936	I'm sorry, typos are... I have it on PlayStation 3.
6222196	6222576	It's cool.
6223196	6227419	Only downside to either version is that neither would have online co-op.
6228080	6231842	It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it would have been a nice feature nonetheless.
6232262	6233383	Sorry this email ran so long.
6233403	6235505	I'll try to keep future ones a tad shorter.
6235805	6242869	This email was brought to you by your local 7-Eleven, home of the Street Date Broken Games, 20-year-old hot dogs, Slurpees, back-galley crack dealers, and hookers.
6243370	6243910	Who is this from?
6244190	6245051	That's from Spazinator.
6245151	6245711	Hi, Spazinator.
6247152	6248193	Dude, I want a hooker.
6250009	6251470	7-Eleven is pretty awesome, actually.
6251990	6253551	Slurpees are amazing.
6254291	6255912	Just so I can smack a bitch.
6256012	6257433	Anyway, last email.
6258453	6261615	This is from Jacob.
6263649	6264489	Hey, OLR.
6264990	6269552	I've not been in chat or called in before, but I have been a regular podcast listener for a couple of years now.
6269992	6272893	The show gives me some laughs and a decent update on the gaming world.
6273334	6276655	I wish I could game more like I used to, but life demands a great deal of time.
6276795	6277856	Oh, fuck yes it does.
6278056	6278536	Preach.
6279416	6279777	Truth.
6279797	6282838	But I do try to keep up with some games that interest me.
6283238	6285960	Mirror's Edge was a great concept, but way too short.
6286380	6289721	I'm sick and tired of shooters and have been playing Street Fighter IV.
6290442	6292983	Dead Space was made precisely for me.
6295154	6296816	and I fell in love with it instantly.
6296876	6300901	Do you guys think EA will let the Niche team give it a sequel?
6301362	6304587	I really like Gears and constantly wonder why the OLR team bashes it.
6304867	6306049	I don't think I've bashed it.
6306189	6306950	I just don't care about it.
6308027	6310948	Gears of War is all about the stealth and hiding in cover and I get that
6335738	6338720	If you're a shooting game fan, I get why that's alluring.
6338780	6340221	I get the strategy involved in that.
6340281	6341361	I get where the game is there.
6341701	6344923	It's just not for me because I suck at first-person shooters really bad.
6345604	6353528	Multiplayer on Gears 2 will be quite strategic and is beautifully gory.
6354168	6354929	Beautifully gory?
6355709	6359171	I am thinking about picking up Resident Evil 5, but I've only played the originals.
6359812	6360312	Originals?
6362156	6364339	I am really looking for an innovative game to pick up.
6364639	6366622	Just sick and tired of playing the same old stuff.
6366742	6367583	Any recommendations?
6367684	6367904	I have a 360.
6368244	6372090	It seems like the game variety gets squeezed tighter and tighter.
6372710	6376576	Anyway, I greatly enjoy the show and must applaud your endurance with full respect.
6376736	6377537	Thank you, Jacob.
6378833	6380935	I'm going to make the same recommendation I do to a lot of people with 360.
6381395	6381716	Rez.
6382176	6382436	Rez.
6382796	6383117	Rez.
6383757	6387280	Especially if you're like a, you know, kind of like a motion, a game that's always moving.
6387780	6391983	I think Rez is, like, you know, you want an outside-the-box type of game, I think Rez is a good start.
6392804	6393484	If you don't already have it.
6393504	6394465	There's also plenty to download.
6394505	6397768	Like, I mean, if you want to go old school, you do have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
6398508	6403592	And you've also got, I haven't played it, but I know a lot of people recommend Braid.
6404605	6405285	I like Braid a lot.
6405465	6407526	I definitely recommend Braid.
6408147	6414410	If he hasn't already got that, if he's been listening to the show any amount of time or following the game blogs, as he probably does, I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have that.
6414950	6426115	Well, just to follow up, did you actually read the list of, to the earlier email, did you read the list of DSI patents?
6427196	6428096	Not the full list, no.
6428677	6430398	Oh, Lord, there's quite a number of these.
6431338	6432799	There's actually a trademark for 3D Picross patents.
6437040	6437681	That's already out.
6438461	6446125	DS Navi, DS Phone, DS Plus, DS Point, DS School, DS Speak, DS Shop, DS Shopping, DS Trainer, DS Time, DS Walk.
6446405	6447866	That doesn't mean they're making all these things.
6447926	6449107	I know, but I just think it's funny.
6449167	6450968	Protecting their rights, you know what I mean?
6451328	6452068	I think it's funny.
6455050	6457131	It's got to be that they have some ideas for it.
6457231	6461053	One of them is DSI Tsushin, which is DSI Communication.
6462454	6462994	I think it'd be cool.
6464619	6469822	All right, well, if you want to send us a mail, email, sorry, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us our mail.
6469882	6471343	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6471984	6473244	I hope we hear from you next week.
6474125	6475506	But please stop sending spam.
6475626	6479108	Christ, we have to clean up so much spam out of that box, in my personal box.
6479548	6480509	I have so much spam.
6480529	6481790	Who's Shadowgate?
6481810	6482850	Spam needs to die in a fire.
6482931	6487033	I love Shadowgate, by the way, which is the game that's, I don't even know if Chess TV's working anymore.
6487053	6488534	I kind of suck at Shadowgate.
6488554	6488974	It's working.
6489074	6490635	This is the game that Eddie's playing right now.
6491296	6491536	Good time.
6491556	6493077	Do you have to go in the door and everything's on fire?
6494898	6496299	All right.
6497039	6503024	Well, there's some interesting... I mean, we knew this was coming, but it's getting more official day by day.
6503284	6506566	The court has approved the Square Enix buyout of Eidos.
6507507	6511229	So, soon we'll have Square... I don't know.
6511589	6512370	Square Enix?
6512690	6516973	I don't know how to... Too many companies to combine together.
6517013	6519175	We'll have... Squito... We'll have SquinoDocs.
6519275	6519915	SquitoDocs.
6521436	6522697	SquinoDocs.
6524482	6527283	What has Eidos done for us lately?
6527303	6527964	I say, fuck them.
6549929	6550950	Square and Friends Square is a lie
6574693	6589020	Well, all right, I don't know if you might have to think of a name for this merger, but apparently Warner Brothers Interactive is contemplating a purchase of Midway, which, as you know, has just been hemorrhaging money, and they're in the news every week about how just, you know, in crappy shape the company is.
6589040	6590361	We'll call that a clusterfuck.
6590381	6591001	Those poor guys.
6591581	6599485	Warner, by the way, lost the Eidos bid to Squeenix, so Warner apparently is now looking at possibly picking up Midway.
6599905	6603107	It's an anonymous source that's tipping that's leaked to all these blogs.
6603467	6605388	Warner is pretty confident that they will get Midway.
6605928	6607868	They are ready to put the money on the table.
6608628	6613910	Possibly the whole 30 million bucks to pick up Mortal Kombat and stuff, I guess.
6615350	6619831	I don't know what else Midway's got besides their pretty cool collections and things.
6620071	6621131	Didn't they split with Williams?
6622212	6622892	That's what they get.
6623452	6628753	They could be making instead of, well, not pinball tables because Williams abandoned us, the bastards.
6629294	6631114	They could be making tons of slot machines.
6632711	6633612	But no.
6635693	6638776	What if that means we'll have a Mortal Kombat vs. DC 2?
6638876	6639036	Ooh.
6640637	6642599	Because doesn't Warner and DC kind of have a thingy?
6642699	6643840	Yeah, Warner Brothers.
6644160	6644561	There you go.
6645401	6645782	We'll see.
6647323	6647723	Moving on.
6648104	6650626	A little more news and we're going to get to the Skype line in just a little bit.
6652507	6656530	Well, how about something that should make everyone happy?
6657451	6658952	Pax Details!
6660033	6661935	And everyone said yay!
6662529	6662949	Yay!
6662989	6664270	I hope I can afford it this year.
6664290	6671315	September 4th, in Seattle, we will be having PAX, and they are going to have over 60 exhibitors.
6672035	6674697	That means, again, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve, Blizzard.
6675878	6678499	Sony isn't on the list, and who cares?
6679620	6680341	They weren't there last year.
6680361	6681141	Oh, no, they were there last year.
6681161	6681821	They were there last year.
6682062	6682442	That's right.
6682462	6683963	That was the first time we played LittleBigPlanet.
6684123	6685824	That's interesting they're not on the list yet.
6687865	6690007	Also, they're going to have FreezePop.
6691178	6695001	Jonathan Colton, which I have to do another MySpace photo.
6695061	6696402	So all the same shit as last year?
6697243	6698304	Well, some different people.
6698324	6706110	There's MC Frontalot, of course, Anamanaguchi, who was there last year, Metroid Metal, and Paul and Storm.
6707731	6709172	So not everyone there is listed.
6710473	6712835	Like four of those bands were all there last year, which is fine.
6712935	6713395	They're all great.
6713416	6713856	Don't get me wrong.
6713896	6714456	It's all great bands.
6714476	6717759	This time I'm going to go see Jonathan Colton and none of you can stop me.
6718419	6718720	All right.
6719060	6720081	You go on with your bad self.
6721257	6726080	I'm broke, so if someone wants to pay, then I'll go.
6726100	6726300	Good luck.
6726340	6726860	We're all broke.
6740922	6741702	by E3.
6742943	6747105	I already got my confirmation and my tickets and my stuff all booked.
6747125	6747765	You got your ticket?
6747825	6748726	Oh, like flight tickets?
6748986	6749846	I've already got my flight.
6749887	6752488	I've got my Disneyland shit.
6752728	6753588	I'm ready to go.
6753889	6754609	Ready to rock.
6756719	6758179	So, let's see.
6758339	6762341	There's some interesting stuff going down with Gamefly.
6762942	6771126	Apparently, they are filing suit against the United States Postal Service over breakage rates and preferential treatment.
6771866	6782574	Gamefly has tried to get the same kind of treatment but it has been denied and also they've noticed that there's quite a bit of in-transit breakage and also theft
6797506	6799607	and they're not too happy about that.
6799788	6802309	And they've actually tried to take some measures to fix that.
6802329	6804250	I wonder if the Postal Service is hiring.
6804931	6810755	Change the color of their mailers and stuff like that, but it's still a problem.
6812536	6813577	What color are their mailers?
6813617	6815318	Are they like bright neon green and orange?
6815378	6817319	They used to be orange and now they're white.
6817619	6819100	No wonder they stick out, you know?
6820181	6821862	Well, probably trying to save money on the ink.
6822694	6826457	I'm surprised Netflix doesn't have the same problems with those very distinctive red envelopes.
6826497	6829820	I'm sure they do, but games are more valuable than movies.
6832062	6833903	Would you steal games if you worked for the Postal Service?
6834323	6836305	If I wanted to be fired and arrested, yeah.
6836325	6838066	Just curious.
6838106	6839768	I didn't say you should.
6840088	6843591	No, I probably wouldn't because it's too easy to find them online.
6846004	6846184	DJ Star
6862403	6863003	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6888082	6891244	It's also coming out over here, also by Deep Silver in July.
6891264	6896346	It was supposed to be coming out in two weeks, which sucks, but now, later on.
6897626	6898027	Interesting.
6898507	6899607	I'd be curious to check this out.
6900628	6904669	I want to hear more about it and what the game is in it, because I didn't hear a lot about what the game is.
6904689	6905710	It's just that you can mix stuff.
6905750	6907191	Well, what's the game?
6908251	6909352	That's what I kind of want to know right now.
6910232	6910852	It's hard to tell.
6912273	6912553	We'll see.
6914005	6914345	DarkSakura
6937252	6941714	Not really, because I'm one of those people that I'm afraid if I had a gun in my house, I'd shoot myself with it somehow.
6942335	6946237	Like, I'm seriously deathly afraid that if a gun is in my house, I will be killed with it.
6946317	6948318	That's why you need to take gun safety courses.
6948478	6952160	No, but that doesn't necessarily mean I will be the one killing myself with the gun.
6952180	6957002	I would like to think I'm not that stupid, where I'm like, oh, gee, I need to get out my gun and dust it.
6957082	6958023	La la la, dust the gun.
6958223	6959884	Oh, fuck, I just shot myself in the face.
6959904	6961284	Well, you know, dust it with live ammo in it.
6961324	6962305	That's kind of retarded.
6963177	6965921	I just feel like I'm the stupid person that would do that.
6966221	6970767	Or I'm also paranoid if I had a gun in my house and somebody would break into my house, know where my gun is, and shoot me with it.
6971207	6973270	I know it's probably an irrational fear.
6973751	6974952	I have a fear of a gun in my house.
6975373	6977536	I was actually just trying to say that as a lead into the story.
6978877	6979859	Sorry, I'm buzzed.
6982157	6990424	Anyway, a middle school kid brought in a gun and caused the school to be locked down.
6990864	6991885	But you know what he brought it for?
6992445	6993726	He brought it to trade for PSP.
6995043	6998505	Sure, trade for a PSP, rob for a PSP, it's all the same.
6998685	7005208	He swiped it out of his dad's collection, the gun was unloaded, but he did bring ammo with him, and he was going to trade it.
7005729	7011172	Also, his dad said a second gun was missing, and the kid's locked up in GV right now, so.
7012152	7012953	Stupid child.
7013973	7014914	How did he get the gun?
7015874	7016575	Stupid father.
7016775	7019776	I was going to say, I need the parents slightly to brave me.
7019796	7021157	You leave this shit locked up!
7022258	7022818	Okay, first of all.
7024673	7025093	DarkSakura.com
7040902	7046567	And I just want to say, even though I have my rant that I will not have a gun in my house, that doesn't mean somebody else can't have a gun in their house.
7046747	7051331	There is this thing called the Tonstitution that allows you to have a gun in your house if you want.
7051351	7052471	The Tonstitution?
7053212	7054733	The Tonstitution, is that what I called it?
7055594	7056114	Shut up.
7056315	7057035	Tonstitution?
7057075	7061359	Look, my point is, you can have a gun in your house if you want.
7061519	7063761	I choose to not have one in mine, and I'm allowed that choice.
7065102	7065402	You know what?
7065902	7067464	I still think... By the Tonstitution.
7068174	7074516	I, by the way, do still think that Penn & Teller said it best, that you take every woman in America, give them each a pink gun.
7075296	7076556	And it's pink because they said so.
7077336	7079857	And then it doesn't matter if they keep it, give it away, whatever.
7080517	7082257	No one's going to know who has the gun.
7083638	7084978	And it'll make a safer society.
7087679	7089119	Make guns that match handbags.
7089159	7089799	Yeah, perfect.
7090059	7091280	Actually, I want to have a gun.
7091680	7092420	I really want a gun.
7093660	7096301	But because you can't have a concealed weapon, I would wear it on a holster.
7097349	7098089	Just everywhere you go.
7098149	7098769	Don't bring it here.
7101590	7102451	I leave it in my car.
7102471	7103571	Oh yeah, you can leave it in the car.
7103591	7104431	There's no room in my house.
7104471	7105612	Because I would be afraid.
7105632	7106392	I would be shot with it.
7106712	7109893	Like during a break or something, like you'd trip and fall and the gun would go off and shoot me in the foot.
7109913	7114715	Like I just, I have these horrible... Hey Rob, look at me juggle these guns.
7115895	7116695	Exactly.
7117396	7120837	Like Loki would be like, can I touch your gun, Dark Sakura?
7121177	7121557	Bang!
7122117	7122898	Shoot me in the face.
7123098	7126220	Let me throw the gun at Rob and hopefully it will go off and shoot him.
7126521	7131764	First of all, if I had a gun, I would not just... Ooh, look at my gun!
7131784	7134466	Look at this, it's loaded and everything.
7134507	7135587	I want to look down the barrel.
7136048	7138730	Why don't you put it in your mouth?
7138770	7139670	My gun would be pink.
7139750	7141972	My gun would be black and hot rod red.
7143313	7144274	I'm Kurt Cobain.
7145526	7145866	DarkSakura.com
7162080	7164623	No, but I mean like being surrounded by water, not drinking water.
7165404	7167066	God, you guys are jerks.
7168608	7171911	I think I seriously have a fear of guns being pointed at me.
7171931	7174214	That's probably an irrational fear.
7174234	7177578	That is actually a rational fear.
7178458	7180859	I think it's irrational.
7180939	7182099	I think that it's paranoid.
7184000	7185020	I'll tell you this right now, Rob.
7185080	7193782	If you've got someone who has a gun who knows how to use it and knows how to take care of it, you are not in any danger.
7194922	7197083	I don't even want a chocolate gun.
7199123	7200123	God, you're a baby.
7202204	7203904	You're just now learning this?
7204024	7205185	No, but I like saying it.
7205205	7206325	I'll bring a chocolate
7209039	7210500	It'll shoot you with yummy.
7211922	7213483	You'll get shot with tastiness.
7214724	7215985	I don't even like water guns.
7217927	7218768	I'm not joking.
7218828	7221250	I don't even like water guns.
7221851	7225534	You would have hated my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil.
7226615	7230479	I had the Resident Evil one and I carried around two very realistic looking Uzis.
7232091	7236017	SSJ100 Matt says, so wait, was Rob freaked out when Loki brought his airsofts to the studio?
7236658	7243449	Rob, kinda, actually, like, when he raises them up, I do get a little nervous.
7243529	7245532	Yes, I don't want to get shot in the ass.
7245612	7246594	Why do you think I don't go out to...
7247655	7249338	It doesn't hurt that bad.
7249358	7252422	Why do you think I haven't gone out to play a game with him?
7252442	7257048	I'm just going to come in and shoot him one of these days so he can see how not bad it is.
7257068	7258810	Why would you do that?
7258950	7260512	Don't shoot Rob!
7261554	7263396	Remember kids, don't shoot Rob.
7263857	7264518	Rob is food.
7264798	7267360	Shoot me in a video game all you want because I know the difference.
7267540	7267900	That's it.
7267920	7268140	That's it.
7268160	7269601	Next week, Nerf Battle.
7269621	7271042	No, this is not Nerf Battle.
7271062	7272963	No, this is not Nerf Battle.
7272983	7277165	Get Rob over the gun thing by shooting him with everything you can find.
7277846	7279447	That is just going to make it worse.
7281028	7281728	For the record.
7284630	7285070	Okay, no.
7285290	7289793	I say I'll bring a Nerf Gatling gun and shoot Rob in the ass.
7290373	7291053	They have those.
7291434	7291874	I know.
7291994	7292474	I saw it.
7292514	7293095	I wanted one.
7295277	7296958	I have a Nerf revolver.
7297159	7297899	Okay, I have to ask.
7297919	7298179	I'm sorry.
7298440	7298880	Chat room.
7299360	7300802	I haven't read from chat in a while.
7300822	7302083	Of course, they're all teasing me right now.
7302123	7309409	But what I want to know, somebody in chat has to understand what I'm saying about guns.
7310129	7313292	Is somebody in chat willing to admit that they have a gun fear as well?
7314363	7315284	Please, somebody.
7315705	7317747	Just make it up so I don't feel so bad.
7317808	7318448	I'll tell you what.
7318488	7323135	I'll tell you what my thing about the gun safety hysteria is.
7323655	7326239	I think that the gun safety hysteria is bullshit.
7326599	7328642	Plain out bullshit.
7330004	7331025	I think that...
7334039	7346503	People, if you were in an area where it is listed in big labels that no one there is going to be able to protect themselves, we know what that says to a criminal mind, fair fucking game.
7348023	7354545	If you were in a place where you know that anyone could be armed, are you going to really try something unless you're phenomenally stupid?
7355806	7356826	That's what I have to say.
7357446	7358927	People are phenomenally stupid.
7359967	7362808	And if someone breaks into my house, they deserve to get their ass shot.
7363837	7368440	X-Link says I have a gun fear, that is why I have a gun Digital says everyone fears guns sir
7391604	7394345	Brad says, I don't owe one because I'm too damn hot-headed.
7394986	7397627	I Like Old People says, yes, Rob, you are a pussy.
7397687	7399008	Well, meow, meow, meow.
7399948	7401369	Decipher says, I hate guns.
7402129	7404451	Wait, one of them hates guns.
7404491	7407172	Rice Princess, you've got to say this over here because we can't hear you otherwise.
7410354	7412635	Someone's afraid of guns so he has a gun?
7413891	7414472	Thank you for watching!
7431247	7431868	DarkSakura.com
7449740	7450561	You can protect yourself.
7452102	7465111	For example, I know a lot of women who carry a gun because, I mean, let's face it, on a general level, physically, men, for the most part, are stronger physically, again, than a woman.
7465412	7469014	Unless she's a black belt and can kick him in the face.
7469995	7473738	But still, you have to deal, it's the great equalizer.
7475599	7477700	I think that as long as
7482031	7492820	As long as you feel that you want to have a gun, and of course live in America, get a gun.
7493001	7500006	But make damn sure you know how to use it, make damn sure you know how to keep it safe, and make really sure that your kids can't get to it.
7500106	7500687	I'm going to get a phaser.
7502796	7504217	Dude, phasers are awesome.
7504437	7505457	Always set on stun.
7505938	7508639	And a lightsaber, but that can kill people.
7508699	7509260	No, just a phaser.
7509280	7513422	And by the way, Actdeft, that's the Second Amendment.
7514162	7516443	Well, First Amendment is, yeah, you have a voice to use it.
7516483	7519325	Second Amendment is, goddammit, we can have guns if we fucking want them.
7520863	7523144	SSJ100Matt asked, what about a marshmallow gun?
7524205	7527466	Actdeft says the OLR Constitution, Second Amendment.
7527906	7528767	Don't shoot Rob.
7528807	7529287	Yeah, don't.
7529847	7530287	I like that.
7530307	7531708	That should actually be rule number one.
7533049	7533529	Here's the thing.
7533609	7537190	Even the marshmallow gun, it depends on what speed the marshmallows are traveling at.
7537210	7539091	If it's very slow speed, I'm okay with that.
7539111	7539852	Mach 10.
7540772	7547715	But if they're flying really fast and could actually spank my butt a little bit if they hit me in the ass, I don't think I'd like that.
7549181	7550482	You can spank my butt.
7550502	7552964	All you want is don't do it with a fucking gun.
7554946	7557287	Rob does not want to get pistol whipped in the ass.
7558408	7559049	Okay, okay.
7559469	7560430	We really are, though.
7560450	7561190	What happened to video games?
7561891	7562371	I don't know.
7562491	7570458	We were talking about why the... I think it was because it was talking about why the butthead dad didn't have his guns locked up.
7572719	7574061	So let's get back to video games.
7576082	7576963	Speaking of the PSP...
7579505	7580286	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7599823	7622505	and also they're going to add some internet security if you happen to be a little kid you can use the trend micro security to block certain websites and also filter out other things as well including all that nasty porno because you know the PSP is a gateway to porn what if I want all that nasty porno well then don't enable the optional security oh okay
7624526	7647565	and then also you'll be able to do an internet search for games directly from the cross media bar as well and they've included some memory stick improvements including your ability to be able to create and access subfolders on your memory stick pro duo for music, videos, and photos which is awesome because folders make things nice and neat for all that porn that's on there.
7648739	7650941	Is this what you're using your PSP for as porn?
7652503	7655646	Porn and Riff Trax audio samples.
7655926	7656246	Nice.
7656346	7659089	Oh, I'm so sad I missed the last little Riff Trax thing.
7659109	7659930	Oh, it was awesome.
7659970	7660931	Are you doing it again this week?
7660951	7662092	Maybe I'll come.
7662172	7663853	Probably not this week, but we'll find a new one.
7664214	7664494	Sad.
7665715	7665935	All right.
7665955	7666416	Well, anyhow.
7666636	7670379	Yes, Twilight is made much better with people making fun of it.
7670479	7671580	I have not yet seen Twilight.
7671640	7672041	Lying.
7672601	7672782	Right.
7673692	7677313	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we are going to open up the Skype line.
7677353	7684096	I'm almost a little afraid to open it up tonight, but we are going to open it up at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7684176	7687397	And this has to do with something else that's kind of related to the PlayStation Portable.
7687417	7689958	It's about Skype, because you guys are going to be calling us on Skype soon.
7690258	7691879	But actually, it's not about the PSP.
7692339	7694020	It's about the DS.
7696045	7700007	You see, a Skype representative was recently speaking to the blog TechRadar.
7700627	7702608	I almost said TechRadar, but it's TechRadar.
7702969	7707111	Apparently, the technical possibility to have Skype on the DS is there.
7707551	7708632	It's just not planned.
7708652	7717096	The exact comment, quote, Whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype... Oh my... Oh my god.
7718096	7719757	We have had butt splat.
7719897	7723419	Wow, we just had a huge accident in studio.
7723479	7724680	What the fuck?
7726959	7728640	The doctor just got shot!
7728660	7729440	What the fuck?
7729480	7733322	He fell on his tailbone, shoving his spine through his trachea.
7733983	7735564	Who brought the gun into my house?
7735924	7737105	All over Irene.
7738145	7740607	Oddly enough, his blood is rainbow colored.
7740787	7743809	Doctor, could you please explain what just happened to cause such chaos?
7743829	7747491	Did I forget where the chair was?
7748031	7749552	She moved the chair when he got up.
7749992	7755056	Did she really do that old prank where the doctor went to sit down and Rice Princess pulled the chair back?
7755276	7755516	Yes.
7757897	7759578	Oh my god.
7759598	7763779	It's because you unplugged the controller.
7768441	7775664	I just... Can we just... Awesome.
7776144	7776464	I know.
7776984	7778024	I'm so done with this show.
7778044	7778365	Alright.
7781058	7783339	What was I going to say about... Oh yeah!
7783839	7789562	Quote, whilst we can't comment on any future plans to bring Skype to Nintendo's DSi, it would technically be possible.
7789622	7790062	There it is.
7791563	7792223	It's not going to happen.
7793604	7796685	Yeah, it's not going to happen because Nintendo wants to do their own proprietary thing, I bet.
7797126	7798646	They were already showing it... Shut up!
7798886	7801548	They were already showing it a couple years ago at E3.
7803308	7807190	Which means they'll never... Well, that was the whole... They have voice chat in other games.
7808010	7811031	You know, this is a tech demo, but I don't think they're going to ever do Skype.
7813972	7816353	Well, if you feel so terrible, why did you pull the chair away?
7820935	7822976	If I had a gun, I would shoot you in the foot right now.
7823036	7823716	That's what I would do.
7823896	7824376	No, you're right.
7824396	7825137	I was scared of the gun.
7826309	7829852	I'd be afraid that the gun would suddenly point at me while I'm trying to pull the trigger.
7829873	7831774	I'll shoot you in the face with a marshmallow spank ray.
7836839	7837219	Alright.
7838180	7838541	Fuck it.
7838601	7841003	We're opening the Skype line.
7841023	7843686	1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7844066	7845227	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7845247	7845708	Who's this?
7847970	7848931	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
7848971	7849551	What's on your mind?
7849671	7851053	Planet Chaos, can you help us?
7851809	7856475	Nothing much, just chilling tonight, just trying to bear the stifling heat in New York City.
7857603	7859905	We've had a weird weather week in California as well.
7859925	7863948	It was like super duper hot one day and then it was rainy and cold the next and now it's hot again.
7864008	7864509	Go figure.
7864849	7865249	I don't get it.
7865309	7867471	Yeah, apparently it was like 90 degrees.
7867551	7873375	But yeah, just trying to snag some other deals like the orange box for $10.
7874036	7875197	Finally, I got that shit.
7875337	7876738	What an awesome deal that was.
7876758	7877018	Hold on.
7877298	7879580	I have to read this comment in chat real quick because it's funny.
7879900	7882803	SSJ100Matt says, Irene is now jerk princess.
7882823	7883063	Oh my god.
7883303	7884984	There we go, yay, jerk princess.
7885284	7886424	Alright, I'm sorry, Zaku.
7886444	7888766	So yes, Orange Box is $10.
7888846	7891747	It's the deal everyone's been talking about this weekend.
7892347	7893708	Did you pick it up?
7894488	7898670	I just picked it up like, what, 15, 20, like half an hour ago.
7898730	7902792	I have yet to download it yet, but hopefully I'll be doing that tonight or tomorrow.
7902852	7907374	Just waiting to see whether or not that sense of job of mine will actually extend.
7908723	7909884	We'll see you working recently.
7909984	7910404	Good for you.
7910464	7910885	Congrats.
7911085	7915228	Well, working temporarily, but, you know, working for Uncle Sam for that time being.
7915268	7925437	But yeah, besides buying Orange Box, I just indulged in DJ Max Technica location test today up in New Rochelle, not far from the Bronx.
7925957	7929280	Tell us a little bit about DJ Max and the arcade for those that don't know much about it.
7930296	7931037	on that, on that,
7959833	7967635	on the note right there on the screen, or you just gotta tap it a few times to the beat, follow the curse around.
7968395	7974056	It's basically a bigger, it's a larger version of Elite Beat Agents, put it that way.
7974756	7975296	Interesting.
7977217	7980257	I know you're a big fan of the Beatmania series, Beatmania 2DX.
7980297	7981658	How does it compare to Beatmania for you?
7982558	7983458	It's kind of different.
7983478	7988599	I don't think it compares, just more like instead of using keys, actually hard keys, you have to
7989175	7991156	It's more using a lot more fingers.
7991576	7997740	The fact that you have to touch every part of the screen wherever you have to.
7998320	8003663	So it's kind of like Chewbacca, how Konami's doing it with that game.
8004384	8010928	The fact that you have to touch the screen to hit the notes instead of having to hit a particular key on the screen.
8012637	8017862	I know it's completely foreign, and as I said, it takes a while for certain players to pick it up.
8018443	8021066	I know I basically pissed away like six bucks on that game.
8021206	8026952	I had $1.50 a game, so it was as much as I could today.
8026972	8030036	I gotta do it again, seriously.
8030760	8033901	Alright, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners before we move on to another call?
8035002	8037423	Um, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2, get it.
8037683	8039364	I don't care what they say, just get it now.
8039424	8041184	It's a lot better than the first one, multiplayer.
8041725	8043465	Alright, a reigning endorsement from our listeners.
8043505	8044626	Thank you so much, Saku, for the call.
8045572	8045812	All right.
8045852	8046532	Take care, buddy.
8047232	8047493	All right.
8047513	8049813	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8049833	8051954	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8051994	8052974	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8052994	8053354	Who's this?
8054154	8055715	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
8055895	8059376	This is the guy that hopes Comcast is going to let him stay on the stream long enough.
8059496	8060016	Well, welcome.
8060036	8062197	I'm glad to see your audio is working tonight, too, Jason.
8063177	8064997	I know you've been a longtime listener of the show.
8065317	8067098	Tonight's been a little crazy, hasn't it?
8068179	8069500	Uh, no worse than I've heard before.
8069680	8070420	Alright, well, fair enough.
8070700	8071480	Alright, what's on your mind?
8072461	8074241	Two quick things before the actual question.
8074541	8076882	You guys mentioned a new Dragon Ball game in the releases.
8076942	8081924	Did you know that Dragon Ball Z is being re-released as a series in Japan?
8082444	8083124	No, I did not know that.
8083265	8084905	Oh, well that makes a ton of sense.
8084985	8085845	It's freaking classic.
8086586	8086946	Well...
8088120	8088941	Is it being reanimated?
8114094	8114855	To an extent, yeah.
8115775	8118876	It's done like the Evangelion movies that are coming out, right?
8119877	8120357	I have no idea.
8120597	8125419	Well, with the Evangelion movies, they pulled a lot of original footage and then added a new animation.
8126579	8135123	I don't know about Dragon Ball Kai, but you can watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood at Funimation is broadcasting that subbed.
8135483	8135783	Nice.
8136003	8138704	Ranma is saying re-released in HD with extra footage.
8139185	8139765	Do you want...
8141312	8143853	I don't know about Kai, but FullmetalAlchemist.com has links.
8143933	8146754	I've been meaning to watch it, I just haven't had the time.
8147034	8152115	Random-ass question, does this have anything to do with the recent Dragon Ball Z movie that came out to theaters?
8152895	8157036	I don't think so, and I sure as hell hope not, because the movie looks like an absolute travesty.
8157056	8158597	But then again, I never liked Dragon Ball, so...
8160451	8166373	I have to say I was one of the people that had fifth generation fan subs of Cell Game and everything.
8168013	8183458	I will say Dragon Ball Z on the Super Nintendo was the first import game I ever played because they actually had a little place around here, an independent movie store before Blockbuster and Hollywood kind of stomped everything out that used to rent import games.
8183478	8184118	It was kind of crazy.
8184638	8186459	Anyway, I'm sorry Jason, what was your question?
8188280	8188900	One more quick thing.
8188960	8189160	Sure.
8189200	8190421	WarioWare myself.
8190681	8191141	Let me guess.
8191381	8194383	You play WarioWare games with yourself using the DSi camera.
8194443	8197044	I think it is the exact same DSi game that we've already got over here.
8197304	8198425	I'm fairly certain.
8199225	8200005	I don't know for sure.
8200926	8201546	The real question.
8201706	8202787	Yes.
8203007	8207089	I know that the only classic Sierra games I've played have been Space Quest.
8207109	8210450	I've seen bits and pieces of King's Quest, but that's been about it.
8211011	8213072	Why does the name Sarian sound so familiar?
8213872	8216778	I know it's in the title, like Space Quest 1 was the Sarian encounter.
8216838	8218541	Was that a race or something in that series?
8218621	8220264	I'm assuming it's a race.
8220365	8221807	Yeah, it's a race in the game.
8222589	8226216	I'm sure they named the website after something that you see in one of those games.
8226803	8227583	Space Quest The Sarian Encounter
8250177	8253002	Yeah, and I think I've heard it in a few other places throughout the series.
8253423	8256448	And I beat Space Quest I, the VGA remake, but...
8257455	8258916	I don't know, I just don't remember it.
8260177	8266602	I've mentioned a lot how interfaces like Home on the PS3 don't work because they're just an interface and there's nothing to do.
8267543	8273908	But whatever they did to put the applications in Sarian.net sounds absolutely amazing.
8273988	8285678	I mean, yeah, it's the next step up of what Xbox Live is right now with the partying and all of that kind of stuff, where even if you're not actually playing the game, you can be around and congregate and do whatever.
8286855	8292139	in a game interface that's, I guess, familiar, assuming you've actually played the game before.
8293620	8296762	Oh, well, Space Quest, not so much.
8296883	8298784	Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, yes, tons.
8301026	8302587	I've played every single King's Quest game.
8304468	8305789	and I've played every single Space Quest game.
8306350	8306550	Funny.
8308391	8310633	Alright, well, Jason, we've got to wrap up the game.
8310993	8311494	Get some more calls.
8311514	8312414	Do you have any other quick thoughts?
8314796	8316037	You talk too fast sometimes.
8316258	8316758	I'm sorry.
8316778	8321402	Do you have any other quick... Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners?
8321782	8323583	That's the second time I've been told that this week.
8323984	8324925	It's my nature.
8325525	8326226	Yeah, it is.
8326286	8329068	But you're clear and you're speaking, so it's not a bad thing.
8329368	8329809	I know.
8329889	8331110	I'm like the Micro Machines dude.
8332658	8332919	All right.
8333399	8334119	See you later, Jason.
8334139	8335160	Thanks for the call.
8336020	8336280	Bye.
8336680	8337161	Is that his name?
8337421	8337621	Yeah.
8337781	8337981	Yeah.
8338201	8339002	I guess I'm like that guy.
8339022	8341023	Maybe I should addition to be the Microchip.
8341283	8343104	See, I do trip up on my words sometimes when I talk really fast.
8343124	8344944	I think it would be easier if I was actually reading from a script.
8347626	8348866	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8348886	8349247	Who's this?
8352213	8354154	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8354775	8356916	Oh, hey guys, what's up, this is Dan Shadow.
8357056	8358717	Hey, Dan Shadow, what is on your mind?
8358737	8359878	Greetings and salivations.
8359978	8362519	Greetings, I don't think we've had you on the show before, what's on your mind?
8363179	8364200	Oh, shoot, nothing much.
8364220	8374806	Hey, you guys were just talking about the guns and all the fun stuff, and you made me think of this Penny Arcade comic that came out recently, making fun of rock band Nirvana.
8376852	8377772	I saw this, yes.
8378253	8379013	I did see that, too.
8379053	8379793	Did it take it down?
8380094	8380734	I couldn't find it.
8381654	8383395	It was posted on my friend's list.
8383455	8387797	Let me see if I remember which friend of mine posted it, too.
8388417	8389178	And it wasn't that long ago.
8389198	8392159	Why don't you describe the comic for our listeners who haven't seen it?
8393160	8398842	Okay, so the first panel, they have the rock band box, and it looks just like a rock band box that says Rock Band Havana.
8399543	8402844	Second panel, one guy pulls out the guitar controller.
8403565	8404385	Everything looks cool.
8404981	8409583	3rd panel, but there's a weird little face and he pulls out this giant shotgun controller.
8410203	8410984	And that's it.
8411004	8411764	Okay, sweet.
8411784	8414045	Yeah, I tried finding it again and that was wrong, yet I couldn't help but laugh how bad it was.
8431164	8432165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8451178	8452039	Kurt Cobain's Death
8476673	8479114	I am very much into Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3.
8479214	8480654	I'm loving that game.
8502654	8503235	Is it really cool?
8503255	8508917	Because I played the demo, and I had a lot of fun with the demo, and I kept telling myself I was going to go get the full game, but I just never did.
8508977	8511498	I think it's on sale now, though, so I might have to check it out.
8512979	8513519	Yeah, totally.
8513599	8523904	It's the next step in a tactics game that is much needed, because when you think of tactics games, you always think of nearly the same style from what Final Fantasy Tactics did.
8524925	8527886	What is this next step that makes you so sold on this game?
8528717	8532178	Well, it starts off, it shows the overview map so you see all the pieces.
8532659	8536380	And then you get to move around in nearly real time.
8536840	8539982	You know, you still have your spaces or whatever movements people can make.
8540542	8541782	The setting is fresh almost.
8541822	8542603	It's very different.
8542643	8546004	It doesn't have that everyone's kind of walking in place look to it.
8546124	8547325	The animation is pretty good.
8547465	8552467	And just the way it works, I mean, every unit likes other people or dislikes other people.
8552587	8553547	Everyone has specialties.
8553587	8557369	So if this guy works well in desert or if he likes to hang around chicks, you get the bonuses.
8558402	8563393	and it's almost like a weak third person shooter but it works great in a tactical environment.
8563413	8564516	You could take cover, you could...
8565031	8566492	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8594930	8597872	It's a very fun game and it's quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites.
8597952	8599053	I just can't put it down.
8599453	8601055	Valkyria Chronicles is the game.
8601655	8601835	Yes.
8602075	8602516	Here you go.
8604557	8605478	Is it related to Valkyria?
8605498	8606098	Is it related to Valkyria?
8606118	8608260	You're thinking Valkyrie profile from Square.
8608440	8609421	No, this is from Sega.
8609441	8610862	No, it's a whole new thing.
8611182	8611863	Sega made it.
8612123	8613244	A whole new thing.
8613364	8615805	And new DLC are coming out as well.
8616126	8617146	Oh, so they're keeping it going.
8617667	8618427	Wow, that's pretty cool.
8618708	8619048	Very cool.
8619508	8621910	Well, Dan, any other closing thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
8623171	8624931	No, just saying hi.
8625091	8628632	And, you know, if you guys are around for E3, that offer's still up.
8628672	8630192	I can get you all into Disneyland.
8631352	8632973	Well, that's a very generous offer.
8633053	8635673	We might have to... I know Loki's going to Disneyland.
8635693	8636873	I don't know if he already bought the tickets.
8636893	8638474	I already have the ticket vouchers.
8638554	8639614	Oh, well, you know what?
8639654	8640634	Maybe I'll take him up on that.
8641234	8644455	Maybe if I could get down there, I'd be happy to, but I'm broke.
8644835	8645815	I will keep in touch, Dan.
8645855	8647835	I know you're on the Twitter, so I'll be in touch.
8649296	8649636	All right, cool.
8649696	8650456	Nice talking to you guys.
8650536	8651336	All right, take care, Dan.
8651356	8651876	Thanks for the call.
8653431	8656832	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio if you want to call in.
8656872	8658853	Speaking of Twitter, we're keeping an eye on things tonight.
8660013	8664675	User Javier Altman says, I adore it when Rob is drunk and or tipsy.
8664755	8666215	Makes my heart warm and fuzzy.
8667575	8668976	Yeah, it's just footy monster.
8669256	8670716	But I'm reading the usernames here.
8671777	8673977	Magical Nathan simply gave us a yeah!
8673997	8674077	Yeah!
8677549	8679171	I don't know, Magical Nathan is the username.
8680452	8685677	Actdeft says, I hope Sky updates the podcast soon since this is a pretty hilarious episode.
8685998	8688060	It will be caught up next week, I promise.
8688100	8689121	We will be all caught up next week.
8689141	8690282	We have to be for the contest.
8691663	8692344	Or it's not going to work.
8692504	8692924	I know.
8693004	8695487	It's just, you know, when I'm drunk, nothing's funny.
8695507	8695947	All right, hi.
8696348	8697169	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8697189	8697509	Who's this?
8698130	8699030	It's Deathwishing again.
8699050	8699731	Hi, Deathwishing.
8699771	8700312	What's on your mind?
8702144	8702805	What's on your mind?
8704485	8707266	First of all, I would like to say I have a great first person shooter idea.
8707326	8712729	It involves you and it would always be you running away from the battles.
8712929	8714790	Worst game ever, I'm sorry to tell you.
8715170	8717691	It'd be a great game because it'd be like little girly screams.
8719391	8721032	Why are you making fun of me?
8722893	8724734	It'll be called Don't Get Shot.
8724854	8730036	Do you think of Konami as a first person shooter developer at all?
8730953	8733194	Konami is a first-person shooter developer.
8733314	8733994	Do you think of them?
8734134	8737114	Because they're making a first-person shooter game called Six Days in Fallujah.
8737655	8740075	No, I... Oh, I've heard of the Fallujah game, though.
8740135	8740495	I have.
8741035	8744756	No, but I... I guess it's supposed to be some, like, ultra-realistic game, like, from what I heard.
8745116	8746077	Yeah.
8746257	8748197	I think we reported on it on a previous episode.
8748337	8751598	Weren't they, like, actually interviewing veterans or something to figure this game out?
8751618	8752278	And terrorists.
8752378	8753038	Oh, my gosh.
8753078	8755799	All I know is I'm, like, thinking, it's like, what's going to happen?
8755839	8759080	Am I going to be playing, like, getting ready to do a breach and entry on Adoro?
8759120	8760120	Also in Contra...
8760760	8763101	Big alien thing flies out of nowhere.
8764342	8766023	That wouldn't be very realistic now, would it?
8767164	8769065	But I just can't understand it.
8769505	8773188	What they were doing was coded arms for a while.
8773808	8780472	They were going to do the really kick-ass PS3 one, and then they're like, eh, forget it.
8781012	8782093	No one wants to play a good game.
8783919	8785580	Well, good games never last.
8785820	8786980	That's kind of true.
8787501	8789602	What kind of games have you been playing this week, Deathwishing?
8790602	8807170	Well, I was at a cyber cafe yesterday, and I played Street Fighter a lot, actually, with my deaf Asian friend who could beat me with the controller behind his back, sitting down the hallway like a douche, showing off to everyone.
8807190	8808691	Everyone's clapping, and I'm just like, you...
8809758	8811278	Thank you for watching!
8829428	8835231	Is it because they say when you have loss of a sense like that, all your other senses are heightened?
8835552	8836272	Could it be because of that?
8836292	8841175	No, I just really think the Asian race itself is just better at video games than anyone else.
8842055	8847118	Rice Princess, as our token Asian in studio tonight, confirm, deny these said allegations.
8847678	8849199	I can very much confirm.
8849699	8850200	Very good.
8850300	8850620	Uh-huh.
8852221	8855423	You can send those cards and letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8855463	8857084	I will be sure to forward them appropriately.
8857104	8857364	Wow.
8859531	8860111	Wow, wow, wow.
8863012	8874596	And you're getting yelled at by GS68 in chat, who is also... I can tell, and I can just tell him... No, it's not a stereotype, because it's more of a fact, because I can't beat anyone at StarCraft that's...
8877541	8880704	Anyways, Rob, I'll invite you to go paintballing with me sometime.
8880944	8884567	Oh, I'm sure that'll be a joy, especially after what I said tonight.
8884827	8888831	There'll be, like, a secret meeting while, like, I run to the restroom or something before the thing starts.
8889111	8890872	Okay, everybody, target Rob.
8890912	8891813	He's the gun-a-phobe.
8892214	8894435	And I'll just, I'll want to cry when the day's over.
8896097	8899880	Alright, well, Deathwishing, thank you very much for the call.
8899920	8900761	Have a good week, okay?
8900781	8902742	Oh, God.
8904063	8904944	Take care, buddy.
8906837	8907798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8924857	8933664	There was a story on there the other day talking about how Grand Theft Auto 4's sales figures have been extremely disappointing.
8934144	8938207	They went so far as to call it a flop because it sold only 87,000 copies its first week.
8939228	8941029	Loki, I know you're a huge Grand Theft Auto fan.
8941109	8941649	What do you think?
8941710	8942310	Is this true?
8942370	8944211	Are people judging this too early?
8944371	8944992	Is it a flop?
8945032	8946233	Was it a bad idea to begin with?
8947008	8957956	Well, it's only been a... They're basing it off of the MPD numbers, which are only... It's only showing two weeks of the sales right now, so I'd have to see what it looks like at the end of this month.
8959357	8960378	I don't think it's going to be a flop.
8960758	8965281	Like most DS games that come out, they sell over a longer period of time.
8965461	8968463	Since it's more of a casual system, people are more casually...
8969324	8970045	Thanks for watching!
8984794	8992239	Even like Super Mario 64, a game that literally came out with the Nintendo DS is still selling well today.
8992760	8995261	So I don't doubt that this will sell well.
8995541	8998744	Do you think it's maybe because the DS is more of a kiddie system?
8999704	9003847	How many really adult gamers admit to playing the DS regularly?
9005148	9010051	I don't know, but yeah, I can imagine it is more a kiddie system, but also people are dumb and they'll buy their kids this stuff.
9010592	9011212	I guess that's true.
9011232	9012573	I guess that's true.
9013110	9015633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9028086	9029167	X-Box Live Marvel vs. Capcom
9048343	9049744	Anything else, DarkSakura, tonight?
9050445	9050705	What?
9050925	9052127	Anything else for last-minute stories?
9052927	9053788	All right, Loki.
9055049	9056050	There's a couple things.
9056410	9063316	One, there's some new info for Star Trek DAC, which will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade in May.
9063817	9067400	It kind of looks a little bit like Star Control, which is pretty cool.
9068881	9070202	And then also...
9071988	9073408	Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes Clay Fighters
9095805	9096425	No way!
9096926	9099147	Yes, Clay Fighters.
9099167	9101428	It has been raided by the ESRP.
9102869	9106091	So, soon enough we will... I thought Clay Fighters was already out in Europe.
9106171	9106471	No, in the US.
9110489	9111909	I don't know if it's out in Europe already.
9112470	9115951	Wait, so, but if it's already out here, why is it being re-rated?
9116151	9117511	No, it's not out here.
9117911	9118971	It's coming out here.
9119372	9119472	Oh.
9119592	9124853	I don't know if it's out in Europe already, but it's coming out here because it just got rated by the ESRB.
9124873	9125413	Yeah, Rob.
9125433	9125693	Got it.
9128754	9130295	Does this have the theme song, maybe?
9131455	9133516	Hold on, I'm looking at YouTube to try and find it.
9137277	9138597	Oh, it just has the intro.
9150126	9151027	I know, I had the funny intro.
9151087	9152408	I think it's off an emulation.
9152488	9154229	Yeah, it's off an emulator or something.
9154349	9155030	I can't find it.
9155070	9155711	I'm not going to bother.
9156671	9161615	Anyway, I got submitted a last-minute story here real quick, and I remember reading about this this week.
9161695	9164298	The plug has been pulled on Bioshock, apparently.
9164698	9166459	Not the game, but the movie.
9166960	9170723	It was to be directed by Gore Verbinski, who's famous, obviously, for the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
9171083	9175406	Apparently, the movie had been in pre-production, and the plug was pulled this week.
9175827	9177108	This happens sometimes in Hollywood.
9177288	9179210	This is a very Hollywood thing to happen, so...
9179830	9180230	There it is.
9182751	9185913	Apparently they wanted to move the film outside the US to take advantage of the tax credit.
9186273	9189554	It's not necessarily completely done with, by the way.
9189594	9191935	It's just the game is in a quote-unquote holding pattern.
9192456	9193916	In other words, it's been delayed a little while.
9195277	9195757	There you go.
9196197	9196677	Bioshock.
9198218	9200499	Oh, the game you're playing right now is Mylon's Secret Castle.
9200539	9203741	You go in the little doors and there's a little jumper.
9203821	9204941	Go to the right, dummy.
9206022	9206902	Can you keep going to the right?
9207705	9208045	There you go.
9208125	9209865	And you go in those little, like you can go in there.
9209885	9213786	Anyway, forget it.
9214506	9214806	All right.
9215727	9217007	Any other last minute stories, Loki?
9217787	9218307	That's all I have.
9218487	9220187	And that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
9220207	9222368	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9223048	9226469	Melly Welly, I know you didn't get to say a whole lot here, but hopefully you had fun.
9226949	9227229	I did.
9227449	9229309	And watching and participating when you did.
9229349	9231050	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9231810	9232590	I just lost the game.
9233628	9234429	Sorry to hear that.
9234789	9235109	All right.
9236970	9239552	The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9240412	9242633	Yeah, everyone should go to the UOP Film Festival in May.
9243374	9245995	Because, you know, our international audience can all make it to UOP.
9246416	9249637	Yeah, because my engagement to movie murder is coming out.
9251118	9252479	Rice Princess, do you have any final thoughts?
9253860	9254460	In the mic, please.
9256301	9257102	Thanks, Rob.
9257402	9258783	I want to go to Disneyland for free.
9260399	9262300	Come to LA in June with us.
9262980	9265201	If Loki already bought his ticket, you can have his ticket.
9266081	9266361	All right.
9266461	9267802	Loki, do you have any final thoughts for listeners?
9268922	9269282	Nope.
9269302	9272783	I need a Cage Match song, but I'm finding one right now.
9272923	9275784	My final thought is the wine buzz is gone.
9275844	9276504	That's kind of sad.
9276865	9277485	It didn't last long.
9277805	9280166	DarkSakura, our final, final, final thought tonight.
9280346	9280886	Give me money.
9282237	9286898	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio or listening to us live, however you do it.
9287158	9288918	We really appreciate all the support of you guys.
9289258	9297560	Remember, if you like what you hear here, and if you've stuck with the show until the very end tonight of all nights, I really applaud you, and you must really like what we're doing here.
9297880	9299881	So please tell a friend or two about our show.
9300181	9301901	That's how we get around is word of mouth.
9301941	9304602	We don't have a big magazine or a big website that backs us.
9304682	9304842	Nope.
9305242	9309623	It's just a couple of friends who all met playing DDR doing this shit out of their garage for the past seven years.
9310023	9311123	So there you go.
9311983	9312404	DarkSakura?
9313124	9315827	I actually forgot to put up the contest about winning my TurboGrafx.
9316508	9319451	So now I'm just going to say that the 300th person to follow me on Twitter will get it.
9323499	9325039	Oh God, it's going to be one of those contests.
9325059	9326640	No, I'm just being silly.
9326700	9328620	However, the 300th person will get something.
9328780	9332041	Well, maybe we can, you know, because we're going to have the contest for the SmileDK thing next week.
9332101	9334142	Maybe we can do like contest week next week or something.
9334162	9334542	We'll do it.
9334842	9336462	Think about what you want to do for your contest.
9336482	9336963	Contest week.
9337003	9338543	Because we're going to do, I'll tell you off air.
9338783	9339583	I'm just being a whore.
9339783	9340023	All right.
9340524	9341544	Well, congratulations.
9342004	9342264	All right.
9342984	9344405	Darling, you are a whore.
9344685	9345065	All right.
9346325	9346965	Anyway, that's it.
9347205	9347845	Good night, everybody.
9348046	9349486	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9350199	9350759	See you next week!
