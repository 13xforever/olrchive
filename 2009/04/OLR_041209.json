{"text": " Hi everybody out there on the internet welcome to a special podcast for this Sunday April the 12th of 2009. Let me try to explain quickly if possible what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything like that tonight. The show started, we began taping as usual about six o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time and about 30 minutes into the show during part A tonight the video card on the system we used to tape the show started freaking out and dying so basically the video card overheated mid taping of the show and it caused a lot of stuff to happen basically we we lost all of part A unfortunately we weren't able to recover what we had taped so far so it's gone and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it and then basically the computer we use to tape OLR is fucked. Now don't worry you guys we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week so I don't want people like freaking out like oh my god is OLR dead no we're not gonna let a stupid video card keep things down but it did screw us over for tonight however what I've done I have two computers in the house it's just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing or any of that sort so we're actually not broadcasting on all games right now because it's not configured for that we're actually live on all games radio or not not all games radio sadly however we are live on Justin TV and we're gonna tape a mini show tonight Doc Sakura is here with us as always me and my lungs and Dan was joining us tonight and I'm really sorry to Dan cuz it's very rare he gets here but you're here to get for not listening live we're so much more of me and I'm awesome and Loki's here as well yeah yeah you guys really missed a lot life tonight I had a diva I had a diva breakdown what what's the other special guest jelly beans the jelly beans are here delicious all right but you guys sadly missed a lot I but they don't want they don't want to hear about what they missed on the podcast they just want at least to hear a little bit about what's going on in the news this week so quickly let's talk about our gaming weeks let's recap what's been going on in our gaming weeks this week dark soccer I played shit Dan maim Loki I've been playing that Grand Theft Auto for the lost and damned and recently during the show Arroyo Muramasa which is Muramasa Dean blade on the week and I have been playing we fit surprisingly enough I've been playing a lot of we fit I'm on a new little diet where I'm gonna use we fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before e3 so okay so that was our gaming weeks let's move into what's going on in the gaming world tonight housekeeping our show was completely borked to this week and we apologize but that's live radio good bad and ugly all on live radio so Loki start us off quickly with some news tonight okay so I'm gonna kind of let's see here is interesting enough Sony is actually patented a PSP controlled car which I don't really you know that's interesting I guess it looks like of course you're not real car obviously it's more of a you know RC car type of thing but that's kind of neat and apparently the patent looks like based off the instructions on there it's like it's gonna have some sort of camera or something like that on it and you can kind of control it using the PSP maybe an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees will be interesting they're actually because if you remember the Sony I will actually had you know a camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter Egg features about is you could actually control the eyeball with your PSP so this is something like that I don't know it's kind neat maybe we'll see this at e3 I wonder if it's just like I don't know this is what this is what this is I look at and go what huh really like Loki do you think this is going to be something cool or do you think this is like I have judgment this is probably not anything cool yeah well we'll see the car judgment dark dark Sakura what what kind of story did you want to cover tonight well there were a couple I was thought would be cool go for it well just to do it in inch just to do it in short order there is gonna be a Silent Hill shattered memories on ps2 and PSP and we we version you can use a flashlight we talked about this last week though it's basically gonna be a revamping I don't think we had confirmed that the we thing was gonna be a flashlight but then they kind of confirmed it this week it's confirmed that's awesome also silent scope is coming out iPhone which is pretty cool the Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the Beatles rock band version and each of the records is going to have a little documentary with it and also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc collection to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in that record quality also Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours and also there's gonna be a grudge game and I'm totally gonna get it yeah but isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that you love I don't care I'll still play it all right well some things I wanted to cover really quickly Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates we heard rumors about July last week on the show it looks like they've been somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves they did a quick press conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and then an overseas release will follow the next month overseas meaning of course the US in that circumstance Squeenix has created games for myspace they're actually gonna they've created this new game called what's it called dive hunt to dive to hunt sorbet's great adventure that's right it's a very strange kind of not Final Fantasy it's Oh sorbet I said sorbet I don't know whatever this looks very strange and not like any other type of game but what's kind of cool about it is that it does use one of the moogles but the design from Final Fantasy 12 where they look more like rabbits so I thought it was kind of interesting but yeah very interesting they're launching a game on myspace don't they know that everybody went to Facebook by now no apparently not apparently not metal gear is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed that that is a trademark that happened the Konami is filed metal gear and tactical online action apparently they are arcade games you know there was that shooter game the Silent Hill shooter game this doesn't seem something that's completely unbelievable to me I don't know there's also a game I saw e3 a few years ago that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades yeah no problem with that though that was and a mirror it was in the mirror Metal Gear look did you have anything else like do I talk to chat really quick yeah there's some other stuff they put Honda put out a press release saying that they're gonna be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live primetime which what's kind of funny though is they're actually gonna have a plane away a plane win campaign and while you're waiting in queue to play you know the big primetime games you'll have to watch ads for the car and then it kind of slipped out that primetime will be launching May 15th with that which I think is kind of the bigger point of the story but somehow that slipped in there I don't know some other interesting stuff that's kind of just slipped out there apparently perfect dark is going to be coming back to watch you coming to the Xbox Live Arcade this was actually revealed in a teaser that they the people at rare were showing off some of their premium themes for banjo-touille and lo and behold in one the latest games there is an icon for perfect dark in there for one of the I guess rare members that jug go so he had a lace game he played as being one of those haha slipped out there that's kind of funny and I'll see here Final Fantasy 7 has come out on the PlayStation 3 at least the original game on the PlayStation Store however only in Japan don't but if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account you can actually purchase the game I guess if you have your way to you know pay in Japan and it is the international version which does have the English language available as well for it so that's kind of cool and finally Konami is putting out a new military action game called six days in fluja and this is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon but either way it is coming out and you know I was kind of surprised this week with Konami's kind of gamers night going on we didn't really hear anything about the stuff that was there I bet you the embargoed stuff did we get him by one year we went yeah but it was usually embargoed until the next day you know this was on a Thursday last week I mean unless they're just doing everything next week but I don't know I surprised just nothing really coming out other than this and you know the iPhone games that kind of stuff but oh well and that's pretty much all I've got oh oh one last thing is gonna comment on there's a rumor going around that there was going to be elite systems coming out for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it yeah that's true so those will be coming by the end of this month and they're gonna be around for about two months and that's it rock band unplugged is coming out June 9th I know what I'm getting that's that's the week right after e3 did you see the video for it it looks just like well not exactly like amplitude but they've got a four different you know tracks you switch between and of course they're the four you know the same bass drum and guitar I'm very excited in a naughty spot it's proof that harmonix loves us it really is harmonic and we love harmonix for giving us this game honestly really they just need to just do frequency and amplitude for the PSP it's got to happen mm-hmm well doesn't really need to happen anymore now I mean think about it well sure but I mean they should just do it anyway because those games are both great and I can't find a copy of amplitude it is very hard to find now yes even for me and I can find anything I want to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this was interesting about the whole you know digital stuff and downloads and things like that Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games and I'm not talking about like the tangible kind I'm talking about they actually have an Xbox live store now you actually can purchase the games through Amazon calm and I guess the way you do it you go on there you buy with your Amazon account and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360 so this is kind of a way you can get around using Microsoft points if you don't want to rumor is this coming out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well and this means you would be able to bypass Nintendo points and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in Sony's wallet which is kind of interesting if true rumor I was actually wondering though if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon sure that's what I told you earlier Amazon right now is the stripping the the sales ranks off of the gay lesbian authors so that when you try to look up a product you won't find anything from them it's really just to keep they say it's to keep children from finding adult content yet run Jeremy's our biography is still easily accessible his strip his ranks haven't been stripped so there is a movement going to Google bomb them so just go to Google and type in Amazon rank that's all interesting everyone should do it at least five times huh what'd you read about this I'm curious several friends huh all right well sometimes we get on side rants on the show I'm passing on the word if if you support you know I'll check it out I don't want to go off until I know a little more I've already gone off once tonight when we live so let me let me do a little more research on it before I miss my shit if you want to the information is out there no I'll check it out I'm curious I'm curious um I guess that's it for the news we were going to cover tonight again I really apologize for the board to podcast tonight we wanted to do something though instead of nothing there was extreme frustration in studio tonight just with the whole port card and everything like that but these things happen it's live radio you know we try to do it every week but sometimes it's just not going to happen thank you guys as always for your support for listening to our program and supporting independent podcasting even when it's not so great and you know really as you guys the chatters the live listeners that send us emails and all that that really keep us going so really appreciate it and we will be back next week with a proper episode 320 all we have to do is replace a video card we can't just do it you know it would take us longer than you know an hour to do it tonight but we will be replaced sadly dark soccer will not be here next week she's happy in Disneyland but your happy birthday happy early birthday and I'm sorry your pre-birthday show um was was fucked Danny what Dan please because tonight was so fucked up why don't you come back next week and fill in for Jamie maybe I don't know if you guys are lucky

thing is I can wear her underwear so I'll grab some put a pair on each leg oh my lord it'll be awesome the chat room is I heard it too it's gonna happen the chat room is asking what your classic game of the week was however let's just roll it over right to the next week or and if Dan comes next week if Dan what was the class of the week this week okay play me my music I can't the game was Tetris and if you don't know anything about Tetris then get your head out of your ass the end now day I'll make damn this offer he's not gonna be able to refuse this Dan if you come to the show next week you can pick the classic game of the week he's gonna pick life force I don't my force is in fact great life force is amazing but I think you've picked it before dark soccer I don't know I don't know a couple weeks ago we'll have to see no I'm talking I'm taking over I I put in Parodius before okay I think I put in gradients or so show Dan the list and see if there's something he believes needs to be on the list and he can come put it on the list of classic games Dan if you pick something that sucks annulment annulment I don't even know what that is but I want one no no no because we our vows will till death do his part so that'll be an ice pick to the face oh my god my face or your face you know what this is your ice pick for a while are this Dan and Jay this is a great radio right here ice pick let's get Nelly to come in here and nag on you for a little while Loki will be awesome radio you know what then we'll call my ex and see what he's everybody everybody I love my boy yeah Loki I feel bad I know you're always rah rah rah about the show and everything and probably disappointed with the way things turned out but please tell us a little more about this game that you're playing I don't really know what it's about I just know yeah because it's in Japanese it's pretty but is this again although Muramasa mm-hmm which is kind of this Muramasa this game looks friggin awesome what are you doing this you just go game I'm always sure what I'm supposed to be doing in this but like when that whole thing comes up and I attack ninjas and then my sword broke so I got switch swords and I attack shit like crazy and go all or does not crazy sword and basically a button mash because there's one attack button and I do all sorts of cool stuff yeah that's basically it I mean hmm you get like huge combos like this is like frickin dynasty warriors or something like that we have a 90 for the Odin sphere guys yeah buddy I was only serious very similar and if you didn't play Odin sphere and you like those kind of fruitiest Japanese action-adventure games it's pretty cool all right well I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap up for tonight again we'll be back like normal next week all we have to do is get a new video card and we'll be better again hopefully if worse comes to us we do have a second computer here in the studio we're just gonna move the sound card over there will be new ORR next week sadly sans Jamie but hopefully plus Dan if Dan if Dan decides he doesn't want to come we'll figure something out for next week after all this time I finally got you to use a font other than Times New Roman for show all I know I know that's why it that's why it all fell apart you know no no no you cannot blame the show's lack of success on the lack of serifs all right that's gonna do it for another week of Warren's launch radio again thank you guys so much for some boy as a moment independent radio you guys ice pick to dance face especially the live chatters that have had to suffer for two through tonight's show maze-a-lack to me with ice pick and I apologize to the podcast listeners this is just the downside of live radios that sometimes your computer will decide to eat your show and that's what happened tonight nom nom I hope it was delicious computer I hope nom nom I hope it gives you diarrhea like eating an entire bag of marshmallow peeps I hope computer
