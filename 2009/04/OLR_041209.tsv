1288	3029	Hi everybody out there on the internet.
3069	5930	Welcome to a special podcast for this Sunday, April the 12th of 2009.
6610	14693	Let me try to explain quickly, if possible, what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything like that tonight.
15713	20915	The show started, we began taping as usual about 6 o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time.
21465	29512	and about 30 minutes into the show, during part A tonight, the video card on the system we used to tape the show started freaking out and dying.
29552	32234	So basically the video card overheated mid-taping of the show.
32774	34956	And it caused a lot of stuff to happen, basically.
35417	37679	We lost all of part A, unfortunately.
38019	43724	We weren't able to recover what we had taped so far, so it's gone, and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it.
44044	47707	And then basically the computer we used to tape OLR is fucked.
48027	52532	Now don't worry, guys, we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week.
52612	55095	So I don't want people freaking out like, oh my god, is OLR dead?
55155	57437	No, we're not going to let a stupid video card keep things down.
58038	59640	But it did screw us over for tonight.
59980	62443	However, what I've done, I have two computers in the house.
62803	67008	It's just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing or any of that sort.
67408	70770	We're actually not broadcasting on All Games right now because it's not configured for that.
71030	73312	We're actually live on All Games Radio.
73732	74812	Not All Games Radio, sadly.
75653	80035	However, we are live on Justin.TV.
80536	82177	And we're going to tape a mini show tonight.
82217	84098	DarkSakura is here with us as always.
84298	85058	Me and my lungs.
85378	87059	And Dan was joining us tonight.
87119	90601	And I'm really sorry to Dan because it's very rare he gets here, but you're here.
90621	92162	What did you get for not listening live?
92422	93783	You heard so much more of me.
94003	94664	And I'm awesome.
95564	96725	And Loki's here as well.
97523	98043	DarkSakura
123220	124021	I ain't played shit.
125162	125463	Dan.
127185	127826	Mame.
128767	129067	Loki.
129808	139539	I've been playing Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost and Damned, and recently during the show, Arroyo Momomasa, which is Momomasa Demon Blade.
140200	140500	on the Wii.
141021	144243	And I have been playing Wii Fit, surprisingly enough.
144263	145384	I've been playing a lot of Wii Fit.
145444	151729	I'm on a new little diet where I'm going to use Wii Fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before E3.
153331	154552	Okay, so that was our gaming weeks.
154612	157574	Let's move into what's going on in the gaming world tonight.
158177	158857	Housekeeping.
159717	163799	Our show was completely borked this week, and we apologize, but that's live radio.
165099	167199	Good, bad, and ugly, all on live radio.
168860	170860	So, Loki, start us off quickly with some news tonight.
171441	174241	Okay, so I'm going to kind of, let's see here.
176702	183944	Interesting enough, Sony has actually patented a PSP-controlled car, which I don't really...
185635	187057	That's interesting, I guess.
188098	190581	It looks like, of course, not a real car, obviously.
190681	194245	It's more of a RC car type of thing, but that's kind of neat.
194386	201214	Apparently, the patent looks like, based off the instructions on there, it's going to have some sort of camera or something like that on it.
201707	207732	and you can kind of control it using the PSP, maybe an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees.
207752	220241	What would be interesting though actually, because if you remember, the Sony AIBO actually had a camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter egg features about it is you could actually control the AIBO with your PSP.
220982	223003	So maybe this is something like that.
223023	225365	I don't know, it's kind of neat.
225665	226406	Maybe we'll see this at E3.
229315	233698	I wonder if it's just... I don't know, this is one of those things I look at and go, what?
234078	234338	Huh?
234738	235039	Really?
235959	240062	Like, Loki, do you think this is going to be something cool, or do you think this is like Eye of Judgment?
241022	242443	This is probably not anything cool.
243884	244104	No.
244204	244804	Well, we'll see.
245125	247246	The Car of Judgment.
247346	250708	DarkSakura, what kind of story did you want to cover tonight?
252098	254479	Well, there were a couple I thought would be cool.
254799	256160	Go for it.
256420	268644	Well, just to do it in short order, there is going to be Silent Hill Shattered Memories on PS2 and PSP and Wii.
269004	271045	The Wii version you can use a flashlight.
271065	272145	We talked about this last week, though.
272545	273986	It's basically going to be a revamping.
274474	278517	I don't think we had confirmed that the Wii thing was going to be a flashlight, but then they kind of confirmed it this week.
278557	279057	It's confirmed.
279077	279598	That's awesome.
279978	282700	Also, Silent Scope is coming out on iPhone, which is pretty cool.
283220	290625	The Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the Beatles rock band version.
291906	295289	And each of the records is going to have a little documentary with it.
296049	323566	and um also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc collection um to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in that record quality also um Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours um and also there's going to be a grudge game I'm totally gonna get it
324853	327860	Yeah, but isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that you love?
328581	329704	I don't care, I'll still play it.
331548	331868	All right.
332588	335169	Well, some things I wanted to cover really quickly.
336029	339709	Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates.
339769	342290	We heard rumors about July last week on the show.
342950	345390	And it looks like they've been somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves.
345410	351171	They did a quick press conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and that an overseas release will follow the next month.
351251	352812	Overseas meaning, of course, the U.S.
352892	353732	in that circumstance.
354632	357192	Squeenix has created games for MySpace.
357272	358193	They've created this new...
360573	361835	Dive2Hunt Sorbet's Great Adventure
374810	375571	Final Fantasy XII
395317	399020	Metal Gear is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed.
399060	402302	That is a trademark that happened that Konami has filed.
402562	404723	Metal Gear and Tactical Online Action.
405104	406425	Apparently they are arcade games.
406465	409447	You know, there was that shooter game, the Silent Hill shooter game.
409747	412489	This doesn't seem something that's completely unbelievable to me.
412769	413149	I don't know.
413229	422635	There was also a game I saw at E3 a few years ago that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades.
422896	424837	Yeah, the only problem with that though, that was Andamiro.
425978	427039	Yeah, it was Andamiro.
429160	429901	Metal Gear.
431662	432803	Loki, did you have anything else?
432823	434324	Do I talk to chat really quick?
434344	435645	Yeah, there's some other stuff.
436866	444732	Honda put out a press release saying that they're going to be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live Primetime.
445213	449156	What's kind of funny, though, is they're actually going to have a play-and-win campaign.
451037	451297	and so on.
471249	471809	XBOX Live Arcade
501552	503495	Final Fantasy VII has come out on the PlayStation 3.
521190	531040	But if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account, you can actually purchase the game, I guess if you have a way to pay in Japan.
531500	539609	And it is the international version, which does have the English language available as well for it, so that's kind of cool.
542047	549097	And finally, Konami is putting out a new military action game called Six Days in Fallujah.
549898	556106	And this is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon, too soon.
558257	559698	But either way, it is coming out.
560258	565141	And, you know, I was kind of surprised this week with Konami's kind of gamers night going on.
565701	568983	We didn't really hear anything about the stuff that was there.
569103	570304	I bet you they embargoed stuff.
570344	571665	Didn't we get embargoed one year we went?
572025	574707	Well, yeah, but it was usually embargoed until the next day.
574767	576688	You know, this was on a Thursday last week.
576748	578909	I mean, unless they were just doing everything next week.
579529	580710	But, I don't know.
580750	581250	I was surprised.
581290	585393	Just nothing really coming out other than this and, you know, the iPhone games and that kind of stuff.
585413	585573	But...
587324	590607	Oh well, and that's pretty much all I've got.
592648	594410	Oh, one last thing I was going to comment on.
595330	603597	There was a rumor going around that there was going to be Elite Systems coming out for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it.
603697	604278	Yeah, that's true.
604618	610963	So those will be coming by the end of this month and they're going to be around for about two months and that's it.
612284	614045	Rock Band Unplugged is coming out June 9th.
614085	614765	I know what I'm getting.
614925	616425	That's the week right after E3.
616465	617466	Did you see the video for it?
617726	628029	It looks just like, well, not exactly like Amplitude, but they've got four different tracks you switch between, and of course they're the same bass, drum, and guitar.
628109	629649	I'm very excited in a naughty spot.
629909	631410	It's proof that Harmonix loves us.
631752	632372	Thank you for watching!
652805	653885	It is very hard to find now.
654025	654325	Yes.
655186	655706	Even for me.
655806	656886	And I can find anything.
657286	664028	I wanted to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this was interesting about the whole digital stuff and downloads and things like that.
664168	667989	Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games.
668809	670349	And I'm not talking about the tangible kind.
670389	673210	I'm talking about they actually have an Xbox Live store now.
673510	675651	You actually can purchase the games through Amazon.com.
676851	681454	And I guess the way you do it, you go on there, you buy with your Amazon account, and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360.
682095	686017	So this is kind of a way you can get around using Microsoft Points if you don't want to.
686477	689459	Rumor is this is coming out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well.
689819	697084	And this means you would be able to bypass Nintendo Points, and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in Sony's wallet, which is kind of interesting, if true.
697804	698044	Okay?
698405	698625	Rumor.
699065	702607	I was actually wondering, though, if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon.
703107	703307	Sure.
703327	704908	This is what I told you earlier.
706008	720214	Amazon right now is stripping the sales ranks off of the gay, lesbian authors so that when you try to look up a product, you won't find anything from them.
720894	727417	It's really just to keep... They say it's to keep children from finding adult content, yet Ron Jeremy's autobiography is still easily accessible.
727777	729478	His ranks haven't been stripped.
730118	732078	So there is a movement going to Google bomb them.
733019	735239	So just go to Google and type in Amazon rank.
735579	735939	That's all.
736460	737060	Interesting.
737440	739140	Everyone should do it at least five times.
739940	740241	Huh.
740801	741621	Where'd you read about this?
742021	742841	I'm kind of curious.
742881	745142	Several friends on LiveJournal.
745424	746045	All right, well.
747366	748907	Sometimes we get on side rants on this show.
748947	751869	I'm passing on the word if you support, you know.
753150	753811	I'll check it out.
753831	756913	I don't want to go off until I know a little more.
757054	759355	I've already gone off once tonight when we were live.
760476	763619	So let me do a little more research on it before I lose my shit.
763639	764219	I'm making a statement.
764280	766161	If you want to, the information's out there.
766802	767242	I'll check it out.
767362	767802	I'm curious.
768163	768503	I'm curious.
769684	772867	I guess that's it for the news we were going to cover tonight.
772967	773267	Again,
773812	776355	I really apologize for the Bort podcast tonight.
776395	778997	We wanted to do something though instead of nothing.
779678	783962	There was extreme frustration in studio tonight just with the whole Bort card and everything like that.
784002	785364	But these things happen.
785544	786385	It's live radio.
787005	789328	We try to do it every week, but sometimes it's just not going to happen.
790229	795714	Thank you guys as always for your support for listening to our program and supporting independent podcasting even when it's not so great.
796895	801579	It really is you guys, the chatters, the live listeners that send us emails and all that that really keep us going.
802560	803721	Really appreciate it.
803781	805803	We will be back next week with a proper
806343	807384	Episode 320.
807764	809225	All we have to do is replace a video card.
809245	809866	We can't just do it.
810786	813268	It would take us longer than an hour to do it tonight.
813768	814789	But we will be replaced.
814909	816751	Sadly, DarkSakura will not be here next week.
817111	818091	She's going to be in Disneyland.
818372	819412	But happy birthday.
819593	820373	Happy early birthday.
820613	824156	And I'm sorry your pre-birthday show was fucked.
825197	826537	Dan, please.
826998	829840	Because tonight was so fucked up, why don't you come back next week and fill in for Jamie?
831351	831691	Maybe.
831852	833193	I don't know if you guys are lucky enough.
833373	840461	Alright, well, maybe if we get enough love mail to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com He's got to read the mailbag.
840501	842063	Dan has to read the mailbag.
842103	843945	Dan can come in and BJ me next week.
844045	844226	No.
844806	845167	No, no, no.
845207	847029	See, he can't be me.
848190	849592	He can't even contain me.
851144	852605	The great thing is I can wear her underwear.
853326	855428	So I'll grab some, put a pair on each leg.
855628	856248	Oh my lord.
856268	858610	It'll be awesome.
858830	860512	The chat room is asking... Y'all heard it too.
860592	861212	It's gonna happen.
861412	863854	The chat room is asking what your classic game of the week was.
863935	865316	However, let's just roll it over.
865676	865876	Right?
866156	869839	To the next week or... And if Dan comes next week...
871572	873374	Dan just blew it.
873654	875456	Alright, where was the classic game of the week this week?
876296	877577	Okay, play me my music.
878138	878578	I can't.
880059	882101	The classic game was Tetris.
882721	886404	And if you don't know anything about Tetris, then get your head out of your ass.
887405	887766	The end.
888306	889707	Now, I'll make Dan this offer.
889787	890908	He's not going to be able to refuse this.
891248	895052	Dan, if you come to the show next week, you can pick the classic game of the week.
897205	898666	He's going to pick Lifeforce.
898986	902828	I don't think Lifeforce is, in fact, great.
903128	905749	Lifeforce is amazing, but I think you've picked it before, DarkSakura.
905849	906610	I don't know.
906650	907410	A couple weeks ago.
908891	909431	We'll have to see.
911812	912693	No, I'm talking.
913333	914154	I'm taking over.
915714	918256	I put in Parodius before.
920617	926700	Show Dan the list and see if there's something he believes needs to be on the list and he can come put it on the list of classic games.
927933	929874	Dan, if you pick something that sucks.
931214	931614	An omen.
931894	932255	An omen.
933895	935836	I don't even know what that is, but I want one.
937976	942658	No, no, no, because our vows will till death do us part, so that'll be an ice pick to the face.
943558	944119	Oh my god.
944299	945299	My face or your face?
945359	945919	Your face.
947039	950821	You know what, let's just do an ice pick from OLR this week for Dan and Jamie fighting.
951301	952341	This is a great radio right here.
952581	953202	Ice pick, yeah.
953222	955822	Let's get Nelly to come in here and nag on you for a little while, Loki.
955862	956243	It'll be awesome.
956363	957083	It'll be a great radio.
958267	959988	Then we'll call my ex and see what he's up to.
960008	962769	Everybody, everybody, I love my boy.
964890	965651	Yeah.
965731	967411	Loki, I feel bad.
967471	974775	I know you're always rah, rah, rah about the show and everything and probably disappointed with the way things turned out, but please tell us a little more about this game that you're playing.
974815	975995	I don't really know what it's about.
976196	979477	I just know I'm not getting bored with it yet because it's in Japanese.
979857	981478	It's pretty, but it's... What is the name of this again?
981818	985040	Oboe Muramasa, which is coming out over here.
985060	985940	It's Muramasa.
986000	986760	Hold on, back it up.
986801	987361	This game looks...
989022	989782	What are you doing this?
989842	991683	It's basically a side-scrolling game.
991703	1003669	I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing in this, but like when that little thing comes up and I attack ninjas and then my sword breaks, I got switch swords and I attack shit like crazy and go all crazy.
1005649	1008551	Basically a button mash because there's one attack button.
1009549	1011250	and I do all sorts of cool stuff.
1012391	1013211	Yeah, that's basically it.
1014172	1015533	You get huge combos.
1015553	1019395	This is like freaking Dynasty Warriors or something.
1019415	1021257	Is it by the Odin Sphere guys?
1021697	1023498	Yeah, it's by the Odin Sphere guys.
1023578	1024519	It's very similar.
1024919	1031143	If you didn't play Odin Sphere and you like those kind of fruitish Japanese action-adventure games, it's
1032076	1032516	Pretty cool.
1034498	1036740	Alright, well I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.
1036800	1039122	Again, we'll be back like normal next week.
1039202	1042144	All we have to do is get a new video card and we'll be better again, hopefully.
1042645	1045047	If worse comes to worse, we do have a second computer here in the studio.
1045067	1046488	We're just going to move the sound card over.
1046808	1048409	There will be new OLR next week.
1048469	1051031	Sadly, sans Jamie, but hopefully plus Dan.
1052493	1055155	If Dan decides he doesn't want to come, we'll figure something out for next week.
1055695	1060040	After all this time, I finally got you to use a font other than Times New Roman for show role.
1060180	1060460	I know.
1062222	1063784	That's why it all fell apart, Casino.
1064965	1065666	No, no, no.
1066807	1071372	You cannot blame the show's lack of success on the lack of serifs.
1072973	1073374	Shush.
1074574	1074914	Alright.
1075374	1077375	That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
1077415	1079396	Again, thank you guys so much for supporting us.
1079616	1080597	Independent Radio.
1081477	1083838	You guys are great.
1084199	1087380	Especially the live chatters that have had to suffer through tonight's show.
1088301	1091522	And I apologize to the podcast listeners.
1091862	1095524	This is just the downside of live radio is that sometimes your computer will decide to eat your show.
1096024	1096925	And that's what happened tonight.
1096945	1097265	Nom nom.
1097325	1098365	I hope it was delicious.
1099046	1099466	Computer.
1102015	1106217	I hope it gives you diarrhea like eating an entire bag of marshmallow peeps.
1106437	1107238	I hope, computer.
1110119	1112360	That's disgusting!
1113721	1115042	You're a terrible human being.
1115302	1115902	You're welcome.
1118284	1118744	That's it.
1118884	1119885	No fancy intro.
1119925	1120465	No nothing.
1120665	1121145	We're out.
1121586	1122086	Bye, guys.
