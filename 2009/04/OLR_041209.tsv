0	4700	Hi everybody out there on the internet welcome to a special podcast for this
4700	10140	Sunday April the 12th of 2009. Let me try to explain quickly if possible
10140	13820	what's been going on and why we have the podcast with no fancy intro or anything
13820	19300	like that tonight. The show started, we began taping as usual about six
19300	23260	o'clock tonight Pacific Standard Time and about 30 minutes into the show
23260	27200	during part A tonight the video card on the system we used to tape the show
27200	31280	started freaking out and dying so basically the video card overheated mid
31280	35920	taping of the show and it caused a lot of stuff to happen basically we we lost
35920	40440	all of part A unfortunately we weren't able to recover what we had taped so far
40440	44360	so it's gone and sadly only the live listeners got to hear it and then
44360	49200	basically the computer we use to tape OLR is fucked. Now don't worry you guys
49200	52440	we'll just get a new video card and everything will be okay come next week
52440	55400	so I don't want people like freaking out like oh my god is OLR dead no we're not
55400	59040	gonna let a stupid video card keep things down but it did screw us over
59040	62800	for tonight however what I've done I have two computers in the house it's
62800	66200	just that the second computer is not really hooked up to do audio or mixing
66200	69480	or any of that sort so we're actually not broadcasting on all games right now
69480	73000	because it's not configured for that we're actually live on all games radio
73000	80840	or not not all games radio sadly however we are live on Justin TV and we're gonna
80840	84860	tape a mini show tonight Doc Sakura is here with us as always me and my lungs
84860	89360	and Dan was joining us tonight and I'm really sorry to Dan cuz it's very rare
89360	93320	he gets here but you're here to get for not listening live we're so much more
93320	99020	of me and I'm awesome and Loki's here as well yeah yeah you guys really missed a
99020	104480	lot life tonight I had a diva I had a diva breakdown what what's the other
104480	107780	special guest jelly beans the jelly beans are here delicious all right but
107780	111440	you guys sadly missed a lot I but they don't want they don't want to hear about
111440	114640	what they missed on the podcast they just want at least to hear a little bit
114640	119160	about what's going on in the news this week so quickly let's talk about our
119160	121720	gaming weeks let's recap what's been going on in our gaming weeks this week
121720	131440	dark soccer I played shit Dan maim Loki I've been playing that Grand Theft Auto
131440	138480	for the lost and damned and recently during the show Arroyo Muramasa which is
138480	144000	Muramasa Dean blade on the week and I have been playing we fit surprisingly
144000	146840	enough I've been playing a lot of we fit I'm on a new little diet where I'm gonna
146840	151680	use we fit and DDR to hopefully lose a significant amount of weight before e3
151680	156640	so okay so that was our gaming weeks let's move into what's going on in the
156640	161420	gaming world tonight housekeeping our show was completely borked to this week
161420	168960	and we apologize but that's live radio good bad and ugly all on live radio so
168960	173720	Loki start us off quickly with some news tonight okay so I'm gonna kind of let's
173720	182040	see here is interesting enough Sony is actually patented a PSP controlled car
182040	188560	which I don't really you know that's interesting I guess it looks like of
188560	193100	course you're not real car obviously it's more of a you know RC car type of
193100	196560	thing but that's kind of neat and apparently the patent looks like based
196560	200280	off the instructions on there it's like it's gonna have some sort of camera or
200280	203840	something like that on it and you can kind of control it using the PSP maybe
203840	210040	an augmented reality game based off of what the camera sees will be interesting
210040	214000	they're actually because if you remember the Sony I will actually had you know a
214000	217600	camera built into it as well and one of the little Easter Egg features about is
217600	222520	you could actually control the eyeball with your PSP so this is something like
222520	230160	that I don't know it's kind neat maybe we'll see this at e3 I wonder if it's
230160	233640	just like I don't know this is what this is what this is I look at and go what
233640	238720	huh really like Loki do you think this is going to be something cool or do you
238720	244400	think this is like I have judgment this is probably not anything cool yeah well
244400	250120	we'll see the car judgment dark dark Sakura what what kind of story did you
250120	254920	want to cover tonight well there were a couple I was thought would be cool go
254920	264000	for it well just to do it in inch just to do it in short order there is gonna
264000	269760	be a Silent Hill shattered memories on ps2 and PSP and we we version you can
269760	273320	use a flashlight we talked about this last week though it's basically gonna be
273320	276520	a revamping I don't think we had confirmed that the we thing was gonna be
276520	279080	a flashlight but then they kind of confirmed it this week it's confirmed
279080	282640	that's awesome also silent scope is coming out iPhone which is pretty cool
282640	288360	the Beatles are re-releasing their entire music catalog to go out with the
288360	294360	Beatles rock band version and each of the records is going to have a little
294360	300680	documentary with it and also there's going to be a 10 collection a 10 disc
300680	307280	collection to go out but it's going to be in mono I guess you can hear it in
307280	311960	that record quality also Sega is considering putting out twin sticks for
311960	317240	virtual on for Xbox 360 which is gonna be sweet and we don't have to hack ours
317240	325200	and also there's gonna be a grudge game and I'm totally gonna get it yeah but
325200	327560	isn't it gonna be just like a bastardized version of the movies that
327560	334160	you love I don't care I'll still play it all right well some things I wanted to
334160	339560	cover really quickly Wii Sports Resort has gotten apparently some actual dates
339560	343720	we heard rumors about July last week on the show it looks like they've been
343720	346040	somewhat confirmed by Nintendo themselves they did a quick press
346040	349160	conference this week and confirmed that the game is coming out in June and then
349160	352720	an overseas release will follow the next month overseas meaning of course the US
352720	357400	in that circumstance Squeenix has created games for myspace they're
357400	363040	actually gonna they've created this new game called what's it called dive hunt
363040	369240	to dive to hunt sorbet's great adventure that's right it's a very strange kind of
369240	376320	not Final Fantasy it's Oh sorbet I said sorbet I don't know whatever this looks
376320	379880	very strange and not like any other type of game but what's kind of cool about it
379880	383360	is that it does use one of the moogles but the design from Final Fantasy 12
383360	387720	where they look more like rabbits so I thought it was kind of interesting but
387720	390600	yeah very interesting they're launching a game on myspace don't they know that
390600	395680	everybody went to Facebook by now no apparently not apparently not metal gear
395680	399240	is going to be getting an arcade release if a rumor is to be believed that that
399240	403840	is a trademark that happened the Konami is filed metal gear and tactical online
403840	408400	action apparently they are arcade games you know there was that shooter game the
408400	411360	Silent Hill shooter game this doesn't seem something that's completely
411360	415480	unbelievable to me I don't know there's also a game I saw e3 a few years ago
415480	422400	that was like an online play game where you could network through other arcades
422400	428440	yeah no problem with that though that was and a mirror it was in the mirror
428440	434280	Metal Gear look did you have anything else like do I talk to chat really quick
434280	440880	yeah there's some other stuff they put Honda put out a press release saying
440880	445320	that they're gonna be sponsoring the launch of Xbox Live primetime which
445320	448720	what's kind of funny though is they're actually gonna have a plane away a
448720	455280	plane win campaign and while you're waiting in queue to play you know the
455280	460280	big primetime games you'll have to watch ads for the car and then it kind of
460280	463800	slipped out that primetime will be launching May 15th with that which I
463800	468640	think is kind of the bigger point of the story but somehow that slipped in there
468640	473440	I don't know some other interesting stuff that's kind of just slipped out
473440	479520	there apparently perfect dark is going to be coming back to watch you coming to
479520	486100	the Xbox Live Arcade this was actually revealed in a teaser that they the
486100	489840	people at rare were showing off some of their premium themes for banjo-touille
489840	497320	and lo and behold in one the latest games there is an icon for perfect dark
497320	502680	in there for one of the I guess rare members that jug go so he had a lace
502680	507240	game he played as being one of those haha slipped out there that's kind of
507240	515680	funny and I'll see here Final Fantasy 7 has come out on the PlayStation 3 at
515680	519640	least the original game on the PlayStation Store however only in Japan
519640	524960	don't but if you do happen to have a Japanese PlayStation Network account you
524960	530360	can actually purchase the game I guess if you have your way to you know pay in
530360	536440	Japan and it is the international version which does have the English
536440	544120	language available as well for it so that's kind of cool and finally Konami
544120	550160	is putting out a new military action game called six days in fluja and this
550160	555520	is kind of getting a little bit of flack because people are saying it's too soon
555520	562560	but either way it is coming out and you know I was kind of surprised this week
562560	567280	with Konami's kind of gamers night going on we didn't really hear anything about
567280	571240	the stuff that was there I bet you the embargoed stuff did we get him by one
571240	574960	year we went yeah but it was usually embargoed until the next day you know
574960	578000	this was on a Thursday last week I mean unless they're just doing everything
578000	582560	next week but I don't know I surprised just nothing really coming out other
582560	588280	than this and you know the iPhone games that kind of stuff but oh well and
588280	594360	that's pretty much all I've got oh oh one last thing is gonna comment on
594360	598640	there's a rumor going around that there was going to be elite systems coming out
598640	605520	for $400 with Fable 2 and Halo 3 bundled in it yeah that's true so those
605520	609920	will be coming by the end of this month and they're gonna be around for about
609920	614200	two months and that's it rock band unplugged is coming out June 9th I know
614200	617360	what I'm getting that's that's the week right after e3 did you see the video for
617360	621280	it it looks just like well not exactly like amplitude but they've got a four
621280	624360	different you know tracks you switch between and of course they're the four
624360	630000	you know the same bass drum and guitar I'm very excited in a naughty spot it's
630000	634200	proof that harmonix loves us it really is harmonic and we love harmonix for
634200	638680	giving us this game honestly really they just need to just do frequency and
638680	642440	amplitude for the PSP it's got to happen mm-hmm well doesn't really need to
642440	646880	happen anymore now I mean think about it well sure but I mean they should just do
646880	650880	it anyway because those games are both great and I can't find a copy of
650880	656640	amplitude it is very hard to find now yes even for me and I can find anything
656640	659880	I want to mention this story really quickly as well because I thought this
659880	663160	was interesting about the whole you know digital stuff and downloads and things
663160	669120	like that Amazon right now will actually sell Xbox 360 video games and I'm not
669120	671760	talking about like the tangible kind I'm talking about they actually have an
671760	676000	Xbox live store now you actually can purchase the games through Amazon calm
676000	679600	and I guess the way you do it you go on there you buy with your Amazon account
679600	682920	and then you get a code to put in your Xbox 360 so this is kind of a way you
682920	687320	can get around using Microsoft points if you don't want to rumor is this coming
687320	691000	out soon for Sony and Nintendo as well and this means you would be able to
691000	694480	bypass Nintendo points and you'd be able to bypass the extra money left over in
694480	699360	Sony's wallet which is kind of interesting if true rumor I was actually
699360	702520	wondering though if it would be possible for me to make a statement about Amazon
702520	708440	sure that's what I told you earlier Amazon right now is the stripping the
708440	716760	the sales ranks off of the gay lesbian authors so that when you try to look up
716760	722440	a product you won't find anything from them it's really just to keep they say
722440	726200	it's to keep children from finding adult content yet run Jeremy's our biography
726200	730600	is still easily accessible his strip his ranks haven't been stripped so there is
730600	734920	a movement going to Google bomb them so just go to Google and type in Amazon
734920	740040	rank that's all interesting everyone should do it at least five times huh
740040	747240	what'd you read about this I'm curious several friends huh all right well
747240	750720	sometimes we get on side rants on the show I'm passing on the word if if you
750720	756240	support you know I'll check it out I don't want to go off until I know a
756240	761420	little more I've already gone off once tonight when we live so let me let me do
761420	765160	a little more research on it before I miss my shit if you want to the
765160	770000	information is out there no I'll check it out I'm curious I'm curious um I guess
770000	774920	that's it for the news we were going to cover tonight again I really apologize
774920	778440	for the board to podcast tonight we wanted to do something though instead of
778440	782760	nothing there was extreme frustration in studio tonight just with the whole port

1062760	1070400	fell apart you know no no no you cannot blame the show's lack of success on the
