00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, April 5th, 2009, Konami prepares to juggle two scary franchises,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
most Oblivion DLC gets a price cut,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and have the release dates been leaked for highly anticipated Wii games?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that video game show dedicated to video games,

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
as well as the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo, what up?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Good, how are you?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I survive.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You survive?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I survive.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And the souls of innocent children?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Okay.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm doing fine.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Excellent.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
And are you trying to Techmaster Justin.tv right now?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, because Justin.tv is getting that wonderful network error at server error,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
which usually means, I just don't want to work today.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
So I'm trying to load Flash Media Encoder 3 to see if that works.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Now even though we're not a video show, so we don't usually show video,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
but we've kind of found a good niche for Justin.tv is that when we tape live,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
because for some reason, some people can't get to all games radio

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
because it would be behind a firewall or what have you.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So I don't know.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
But we do this video of a particular game that we'll be playing,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
and tonight's game is what, Loki?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Ninja Blade.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
And we do that video and then we do audio of the show.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Now soon, we're going to upgrade and have a little switch box,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and then we can switch back and forth between the camera and the game,

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
and that would be super.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It would be even cooler.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
What would that be?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Picture in picture.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Picture in picture?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I don't know about that.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Now you're talking money.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Switch box, like $19.99.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You'd be surprised.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It's not as hard as you think.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
We'll see.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Maybe for the future.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Joining us tonight, we do have a special guest.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm actually very excited because I didn't think we were going to have a special guest,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
but he just kind of showed up last minute.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Boy, I'm happy he's here.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Say hello to Casper the Gay.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Who is now the doctor.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, the doctor.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
That's right.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I forgot.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
How long ago did you change your name?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
About six months ago.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
A long time ago.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
All right.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, Casper the Gay doctor is here.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Basically, yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
All right.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It still works.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
How are you doing, Casper?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Awesome.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm really good.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm helping everyone with their medical problems.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Ghost.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Excellent.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
You're wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt today.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yes, and a hat.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
See, I got the Hyrule symbol and a hat.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, look at you go.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm nerded out today for the show.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
You are all.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I'll ask you real quick.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yay or nay?

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Keep in mind, this is a Zelda fanboy right here.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Absolutely nay.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Absolutely nay.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.120
What are they doing?

02:56.120 --> 02:59.680
It's just a sequel to the freaking game that came out in the DS.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.680
That's all it is in.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.120
Just a gimmick and people think, oh my God, the whole game is going to be like that.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.960
No, they're just showing you what new stuff is going to be there.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
Which is a disaster.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
All right.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.960
Well, we'll see.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.360
I still like the whole Lynx on a train.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.360
That's what it should have been called.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
Listen to Zelda.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.120
Lynx on a train.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.400
What they should have done is every time that he, in the original game, every time that

03:21.400 --> 03:26.400
he got on the boat, they would play the Lonely Island I'm on a Boat song because that would

03:26.400 --> 03:28.840
be awesome.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.440
Because believe me when I say, Lynx effed a mermaid.

03:31.440 --> 03:37.920
I'm on a boat, you guys, in Hyrule, you guys.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
I don't know.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.280
Do you think they're going to sell a lot of copies of that?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
Probably.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.160
I mean, it's a Zelda title, so I'm sure, but it'll probably be boring.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.520
And if it sells a lot, then, you know, they're going to do a sequel, Spirit Tracks 2, Lynx

03:48.520 --> 03:57.240
on a Boat.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.500
That one I would actually buy.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.500
If it had...

03:59.500 --> 04:01.640
Bustin' Octorocks with Bob Boomerang.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.800
If it had T-Pain as a character only, though.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.320
Oh, hell.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.920
All right.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.080
Let's get to how we always like to start the show off with a little bit of how is your

04:11.080 --> 04:12.080
gaming week?

04:12.080 --> 04:14.320
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.800
I played stuff.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.240
Actually, I played Pet Society on Facebook, which I've become oddly addicted to.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.920
At least it's not Neopets.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.100
Fuck no.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.800
I played some more Cookie Wama on my phone, and then I didn't actually finish what I was

04:31.800 --> 04:34.680
cooking, so whatever.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.680
Mama fixed it.

04:36.680 --> 04:41.960
And we ordered, we got something from Alpha eBay that arrived in perfect condition for

04:41.960 --> 04:42.960
seven bucks.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.960
The item was fine.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
The box was nasty.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.060
It had mildew and shit, but it was brand new.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.320
We have a Capcom fighting stick for the Genesis.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
Wow.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.640
Why did you order that?

04:53.640 --> 04:56.440
Because we have several Genes-i.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.440
Geneses.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.720
It was seven bucks, dude.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
Why not?

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
Just impulse buy.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.480
You didn't break it out to try anything with?

05:04.480 --> 05:06.640
You didn't get old school championship edition or anything?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.360
Well, we already have all that.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
Alright, just checking.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
Alright.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.360
Oh, oh, oh.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.360
And we got the FC Mobile.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.640
Yeah, what is this all about?

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
The FC Mobile?

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
It's a handheld NES.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
Uh huh.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.640
That's really all it is.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.320
I don't know how long the battery life is.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.120
Dan played it more than me, but we played City and Legend.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.260
The thing's gotta be somewhat big if you actually put an entire cartridge into it.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.240
Is it about the size of an NES cartridge, the system?

05:29.240 --> 05:34.100
About the width plus another two inches, yeah.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.320
So it's not the Atari, like, where it has all the games inside it in the memory.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.320
It's like...

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
You plug in your cartridge.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
It's like a Game Boy, but it plays NES games.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
That's amazing.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
That's amazing.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
It's called the FC Mobile.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.320
They're like 40 bucks.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.320
Wow, that's not bad.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.320
And they're really light.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.260
Is that because of the whole thing, like, the same reason they were selling the third

05:49.260 --> 05:53.760
party NESs at E3 a few years ago, where it's something like the patent on the Nintendo

05:53.760 --> 05:57.160
property expired, because it's been like 20 years?

05:57.160 --> 05:58.640
Something like that, I want to say?

05:58.640 --> 06:02.000
So would that mean that in a couple years we're going to start seeing like Super Nintendos

06:02.000 --> 06:04.080
and Genesis start coming out and all these things?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.640
You don't need to do a Genesis one, Rob.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.800
I'm just saying.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.240
Because of the Nomad.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.840
Oh my god, Dan was hilarious, though.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.720
Well, also the fact Sega repackages their games like 50 times over, but...

06:16.720 --> 06:20.640
Dan was very hilarious about this, and if he hears it, he's going to be a little embarrassed,

06:20.640 --> 06:22.640
but I don't care.

06:22.640 --> 06:27.280
He was like, uh, I wonder if, um, if, you know, they're going to do a Super...

06:27.280 --> 06:30.000
Because it was like you were just saying, if, you know, talked about doing a handheld

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Genesis.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.440
I was like, wait, wait, we have that, it's called the Nomad.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.600
So I was like, yes, sweetie, pat, pat, pat.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.400
Question from our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, because we are the show where every gamer

06:43.400 --> 06:46.560
has a voice, so be heard, join our chat live on Sunday night.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.280
Hitstun asks, how is the hardware, is the screen good?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.280
Pretty good.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.280
Pretty good.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.280
I like it.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
You don't have dead pixels?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.280
No.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.280
Well, that's good.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
All right.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.280
Well, let's move on then, if that's all that Dark Sakura has for her gaming week, we will

07:00.280 --> 07:01.280
talk to Loki.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
How was your gaming week?

07:02.280 --> 07:07.360
Uh, first off, I'd like to mention, um, for our live listeners, Justin TV is up, I think.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.800
Um, I don't know if it's working correctly, because I got a lot of errors that popped

07:11.800 --> 07:17.200
up, so I didn't know if, uh, we were good or not, but it looks like we're good.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.200
Okay.

07:18.200 --> 07:24.880
Um, anyways, uh, I played a little bit this week, um, more Grand Theft Auto IV, Lost

07:24.880 --> 07:29.560
in Dam, because we're still doing, you know, multiplayer and that, and, you know, my boss

07:29.560 --> 07:35.640
playing the modded copy is still hilarious, uh, even though he can't win still with it,

07:35.640 --> 07:40.600
but, you know, watching a bus rocket by and making a whoosh sound has got me cracking

07:40.600 --> 07:42.080
up all the time.

07:42.080 --> 07:50.080
Um, and then I played, uh, some WiiWare stuff, I actually played, um, Bit.Trip Beat, which,

07:50.080 --> 07:54.640
it's okay until they thought, hey, it's a great idea, let's have, um, you know, little

07:54.640 --> 07:59.760
blocks that are dark blue against a black background where you can't see them.

07:59.760 --> 08:05.000
That's when I stopped playing the game, and, um, that was it.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.480
Just FYI, Chad is giving us feedback that they can't hear us on Justin.TV right now.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.680
They're not getting audio on there.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.720
They're getting video, but no audio.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
Eh, whatever.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.480
You're just gonna have to run them both side by side, I don't know.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
We'll figure it out.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.480
We'll figure it out.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.680
Eh, we're gonna, they don't have to do it for now.

08:21.680 --> 08:31.800
Um, anyways, so, what else, let's see here, um, I also played another homebrew game that's

08:31.800 --> 08:35.600
a demo for another game that I'd like not to mention on this show.

08:35.600 --> 08:41.200
Let me just say it sucks as much as you would think it sucks, and the guy who made it is

08:41.200 --> 08:44.800
a douchebag, and I think we know who we're talking about here, but we are not mentioning

08:44.800 --> 08:50.520
his name, because that would be, um, wrong.

08:50.520 --> 08:57.400
And then, um, my wife started playing Excite Truck again, to, in preparation for, uh, Excite

08:57.400 --> 09:03.600
Bots Trick Racing, so, uh, very excited by that, um, she is.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.080
And then, what else did I play?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.560
I think that's pretty much it.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.560
I got a lot of stuff that I was going to play, but I didn't get to play a lot of it.

09:10.560 --> 09:14.680
Oh, I checked out that stupid, I think we talked about it last week, the Kamasutra DS

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
thing.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
It's funny.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
That's about it.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.960
And then, um, yeah, that's it.

09:20.960 --> 09:27.200
I have a Rhythm Tengoku, or, Rhythm Heaven, I guess, to try out, and then, uh, more, uh,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
Pagel DS, because that's fun.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.760
Uh, it looks like I may have fixed the audio on Justin.tv, because I'm a superstar.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
You did?

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
Yes.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
Because it got unplugged?

09:35.760 --> 09:38.320
Uh, yeah, I guess somehow the little grey connectors weren't the ones in the converter

09:38.320 --> 09:40.240
box, the regular ones were.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.240
Oh.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
Yeah.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.240
I think we fixed it.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.240
I don't know, nobody in Justin.tv is confirming, so, I don't know, we'll find out in a minute.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.440
Wait, which one did you put in there?

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
Go look!

09:47.440 --> 09:48.440
Alright.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
This is terrible radio.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.680
But we'll have you, uh, if the audio is working, we'll have you walk us through Ninja Blade

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
in just a minute here.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.800
Uh, let me talk about my gaming week, though, which, um, you know, not too exciting.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.120
Not a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.780
Just kind of revisited a lot of old stuff.

10:01.780 --> 10:06.600
Like, I actually went back to the Wii myself, and went back to Wii Fat, and played that

10:06.600 --> 10:09.720
for a little bit, because, you know, I wanted to see, I know I've been gaining weight since

10:09.720 --> 10:11.960
I was, like, sick last year, and I wanted to see how much.

10:11.960 --> 10:12.960
So now you weigh 20 pounds.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
Oh, shut up.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.640
Uh, so I went back and played that for a little bit, and, uh, EO was playing some of the old

10:17.640 --> 10:21.800
school classics on there, like, uh, Legend of the Mystical Ninja and all that stuff.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.800
Cool, cool.

10:22.800 --> 10:28.720
And, um, let's see, went over to PlayStation 3, was playing a little bit more Flower, because

10:28.720 --> 10:31.900
I remember there was that trophy that you get if you revisit it after not playing it

10:31.900 --> 10:33.400
for a week, and it's been, like, a month.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.680
So I wanted to go get that, and, uh, played some of the levels, and was showing it to

10:35.680 --> 10:38.720
some friends, like, you know, look how pretty this game is, because it is a very pretty

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
game.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.440
And went back to, uh, Home, because if there's one thing that'll always crack people up,

10:43.440 --> 10:46.200
it's looking at the dancing in Home, because you can do the Cabbage Patch, and the Running

10:46.200 --> 10:49.120
Man, and the Robot, and that's always good for a laugh for, like, five minutes.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.080
But I decided while I was there to check out some of these new areas that we'd heard about

10:52.080 --> 10:55.800
at Game Developers Conference, like, they have the new, uh, Guitar Hero Backstage area,

10:55.800 --> 10:59.760
and the Resident Evil 5 backlot, which, you know, they're cute ideas.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.120
Again, I'm having a hard time seeing the big picture of Home, like, all these things they

11:05.120 --> 11:09.640
really wanted to accomplish, like, I just don't see myself logging into Home as, like,

11:09.640 --> 11:13.320
a back-end system, as, like, the thing I'm gonna do when I get home, I'm gonna boot up

11:13.320 --> 11:17.400
my PlayStation and go right into Home, and, you know, launch everything from there, because

11:17.400 --> 11:19.760
it still feels a little clunky to me.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.040
And when I say clunky, I mean the download speeds of the areas as you load them.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.940
You know, yes, I realize you can download in the background and all this, but I kind

11:27.940 --> 11:29.920
of wish the thing was a little more intuitive.

11:29.920 --> 11:34.480
Like, if I was gonna start walking towards a particular map, it would be cool if that

11:34.480 --> 11:39.840
map would start, you know, kind of loading, and it's kind of, a little, it's profiling.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.860
There's a lot of, shut up, there's a lot of polish, I think, that still needs to be done

11:42.860 --> 11:46.760
in Home, but it is getting slightly better and better at the same time.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.540
You know, and just slightly, but I do see improvement in Home, and I think that has

11:50.540 --> 11:53.260
to be acknowledged, because it is a pretty ambitious thing.

11:53.260 --> 11:57.200
So is there a download yet that, you know, gives Home a point?

11:57.200 --> 12:01.480
There are still more minigames popping up, like, the Guitar Hero area has a Simon Says

12:01.480 --> 12:02.480
style minigame.

12:02.480 --> 12:08.280
It's nothing that awesome, it's, you know, free, but it's free, you know, it's, again,

12:08.280 --> 12:10.900
might I remind everybody, you don't pay for Home.

12:10.900 --> 12:16.000
So considering it's a free thing, it's, you know, granted, they microtransactional a lot

12:16.000 --> 12:17.960
of these clubs and things, but I have yet to pay a dollar.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.560
And if you're not in Home, you're homeless.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.760
And nobody wants to be homeless.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.800
ActDeft in chat says, Home is second life without the crazy antics.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.000
GameGuru says, the big picture of Home is make money.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.200
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see where the more nickel and diming comes in a little later,

12:32.200 --> 12:34.200
so, I don't know.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.280
All right, let's see, what else?

12:38.280 --> 12:44.360
In my gaming week, really not a whole lot else that I can think of.

12:44.360 --> 12:50.200
Xbox 360, just playing some of the old arcade titles, Pagle, and so forth, but not a lot

12:50.200 --> 12:51.200
of new stuff.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.400
I did forget one game I played.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
What's that?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.960
Which is the game that we're playing right now.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.920
But Ninja Blade, I played during the week, actually, because I haven't really gotten

12:57.920 --> 13:01.480
a chance to play it since I got it.

13:01.480 --> 13:06.080
It's fun, it's actually not too, sorry, if you heard an echo there, it's because I was

13:06.080 --> 13:08.920
checking Justin.tv, where we do have audio, thank God.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.760
Yes, because you unplugged something from your splitter coming out of your computer.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.760
Whatever.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.440
The way you had it hooked up there would have been fine, but they wouldn't have been able

13:15.440 --> 13:18.440
to hear the music that we played during the little break.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
All right.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
Whatever.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
Anyways, give us a quick walkthrough.

13:21.440 --> 13:26.200
I know this is radio, and we'll try to keep the references to the video minimum, but kind

13:26.200 --> 13:27.560
of walk us through this game a little bit.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.840
You were talking about, I know, earlier, before we started, this big epic cut scene at the

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
beginning of Ninja Blade.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.800
It's so over the top that it's hilarious.

13:33.800 --> 13:41.560
The main character looks like he's the spirit, you know, Sans' crappy movie.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.760
But it's actually very God of War-esque.

13:44.760 --> 13:51.560
You basically kind of go through the game, you have multiple different weapons you can

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560
choose from.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.480
One that's a heavy weapon that's slow, one that's two blades that's fast, and then a

13:56.480 --> 13:59.520
weapon that's just a normal katana that's kind of in between.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.040
And you've got really fast moves and stuff.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.720
There's a lot of these cut scenes that are interactive that they have quick time events

14:06.720 --> 14:12.680
that you do, which I tend to screw up a lot, but that's all right.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.680
The game itself is pretty fun.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.680
So what's the flippin' point?

14:14.680 --> 14:15.680
You say it's kind of God of War-esque?

14:15.680 --> 14:22.680
Yeah, the point is you're this team of ninjas that are descending upon Japan because it's

14:22.680 --> 14:27.760
being overrun by these mutant things that are basically turning people into monsters,

14:27.760 --> 14:31.620
and so you're fighting off these monsters that are attacking Tokyo.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.240
And it's just really over the top.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.340
There's these dragon-looking creatures, like you're skydiving out of a helicopter to begin

14:36.340 --> 14:41.280
with in the very beginning of the game, and you're actually cutting these dragons in half

14:41.280 --> 14:45.920
and just kind of running down the side of buildings as they're collapsing.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.560
Just really crazy shit.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.260
So that's pretty much the game.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.800
But you like these over the top, don't you?

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
Oh yeah, it's awesome.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
It's defense force.

14:55.800 --> 15:01.060
I do, but it's actually, you know, a lot of the games that are put out from software and

15:01.060 --> 15:04.400
stuff like that, they're not that great.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.960
But this is actually pretty good, and it's been pretty entertaining so far.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.440
Even like, it actually looks like it's going to start me from the beginning because apparently

15:11.440 --> 15:14.120
I didn't get far enough to save.

15:14.120 --> 15:18.920
But all the more, you know, exciting, because I'm going to show you that whole skydiving

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
part.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.840
Okay, this is a little cutscene that shows what happens, and some old man sees like some

15:22.840 --> 15:24.480
chick that's been infected.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.120
We don't need to see that.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.120
Skip that.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.120
Alright.

15:28.120 --> 15:33.640
Alright, let me go to Caspar, sorry, the doctor, and we'll ask the doctor about his gaming

15:33.640 --> 15:34.640
week and we'll come back to you.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.040
Hopefully you're a little bit into Ninja Blade at that point, you can tell us a little bit

15:37.040 --> 15:38.300
about the gameplay.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.720
So, alright, the doctor, how was your gaming week?

15:41.720 --> 15:43.160
It was pretty good.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.640
Kind of like, there's not a lot of new stuff that I'm into at all.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.720
So I just, you know, one of my friends came over and we played a party game, which, on

15:49.720 --> 15:51.600
the Wii, imagine a party game.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.000
Which was actually hilarious because, you know, this was one of my straight friends

15:54.000 --> 15:56.440
and it was Raymond Raving Rabbit's TV edition.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.440
I don't know if you guys have ever played that, but there's lots of crazy minigames.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.120
Yes, we have played that, or at least I watched Loki play it.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.680
The best minigame has to be the dancing.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.960
It's kind of like DDR, where you have to move your whole body.

16:07.960 --> 16:12.640
And watching my friend get into this, like, was hilarious.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.120
It was, we were like cracking up, so.

16:15.120 --> 16:19.080
But I'm with you, I mean, there's not a lot of new stuff on any system that I'm like,

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
woo!

16:20.080 --> 16:21.840
So just kind of bored with a lot of the games coming out.

16:21.840 --> 16:25.280
Well, I think too, we're in that period where summer's right around the corner and I think

16:25.280 --> 16:28.120
we're going to start seeing a lot more releases in the summer, especially with, you know,

16:28.120 --> 16:29.120
E3 around the corner.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.400
A lot of companies have stuff in their pockets that they're going to be showing at E3.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.080
So there's not a lot to get excited about just yet, except for the fact, you know, if

16:36.080 --> 16:39.440
you're a DS fan, there's the DSi that just came out this week.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.080
That's really a big, big thing.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.520
And you're a total Nintendo fanboy and you're very eh on the DSi.

16:43.520 --> 16:48.840
It's, I mean, it's, to use a fancy word, it's, I mean, it's got the superfluous camera.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.200
I mean, what does that even do?

16:51.200 --> 16:54.200
That's just, that's no point to me.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.000
Well, it takes pictures doctor.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.600
Ah, I have a camera and I don't need another one.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.800
Um, fair enough.

17:01.800 --> 17:08.400
All right, well, so, uh, yeah, but we're watching, uh, we're also watching, uh, Loki here.

17:08.400 --> 17:14.040
There are monsters and blood and swords and ridiculousness.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.400
This looks a little like with that combo meter in the corner.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.800
I'm reminded of one of those like dynasty warrior kind of games.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.600
Apparently it's also twilight and you sparkle when you go into the darkness.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.320
You sparkle!

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
Gold glitter flies everywhere.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.800
I actually have not seen the sparkly vampires.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.800
Oh, good.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.800
You're not missing a mention.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.800
Yeah.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.800
So are we ready for the commentary?

17:34.800 --> 17:35.800
Uh, Loki?

17:35.800 --> 17:40.320
Well, I'm just, you know, basically right now they're just kind of teaching you the

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
basics of the game.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.320
Oh, you can do jump attacks.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.120
Oh, you can do like heavy attacks and yada, yada, yada.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
Kill these guys.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.760
So, um, but it gets ridiculous cause like you're like sensei or whatever is kind of

17:50.760 --> 17:54.240
helping you out through the game and he gives you like these different weapons to use.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.520
Meanwhile, like he's like flipping around and you know, throwing people like there's

17:57.520 --> 18:02.840
a quick time event where I got to jump and I dodged that thing.

18:02.840 --> 18:07.000
Well, so now it's all dragon's lair where you just press like a button and hit a button.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Interesting.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.920
There's a lot of interactive cut time or cut scenes and quick time events and lots of stuff

18:12.920 --> 18:16.640
that I miss because it's hard to read them on this TV, but that's okay.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
Interesting.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.640
All right.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.400
Well, um, and I'm looking at a comment in chat.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.720
For some reason, the Justin TV chat is borked tonight.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.120
Like I'm not seeing anything in the Justin TV chat, so if you guys are trying to yell

18:25.120 --> 18:26.280
at us there, don't even bother.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.640
You've got to go to our main room.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.640
Uh, but I do see Misty saying woop blood.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.240
So very, very bloody game.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.420
Can I get a woop blood?

18:35.420 --> 18:39.240
That game you were playing the other week on the GameCube mad world, that was way worse

18:39.240 --> 18:40.240
on the blood.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.240
Yeah.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.240
I was, I almost brought that again, but that's all right.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
I like that.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.240
I like this.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.960
I like this setup for the show where we have the, uh, game that will be running during

18:48.960 --> 18:51.000
the show and then someday we'll have the switcher.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.280
So we'll go back to having the camera in studio when something exciting actually happens here

18:54.280 --> 18:59.080
in studio, which is not that often, but slowly but surely we're starting to become orange

18:59.080 --> 19:00.080
launch television.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
This is kind of scary.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.480
And the, and the interactive cut scenes, you know, that's in other games too.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.840
I mean, you got that in a force unleashed.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.800
I mean, which kind of makes it more epic because then you're like, you know, if they're really

19:08.800 --> 19:11.740
complex battles, you can just press, you know, you have to do the certain combos.

19:11.740 --> 19:14.920
So that looks cool.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.160
Tiger client chat says basically OLR wants to copy FNG, which is a Friday night gaming

19:19.160 --> 19:21.400
Bobby show here on all games radio.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.200
No, we don't want to copy Friday night gaming.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.200
He did.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
They did their own thing.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.760
They fixed stuff and on air and we don't really get into that kind of stuff.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.240
And plus they have that whole gaming center thing where people like that, um, all games

19:32.240 --> 19:35.320
interactive used to have back in the day where people could like walk in and out as they

19:35.320 --> 19:36.320
want to.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.480
And as soon as we taped the show at my house, that's not exactly going to be happening.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.120
Although we have had perfect strangers show up here before.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.800
I remember Mo, remember we, we didn't even know her before.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.680
We sent her an email on YouTube and she came here and sung the show or sung the song on

19:48.680 --> 19:49.680
the show.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.000
So no, I, we, I mean, we do, you know, we've, we've done the same shit for what, seven years

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
now.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.240
We're just slightly evolving a little bit as time goes on.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.380
All right, let's get in the entire class as OLR could turn into a gaming center of more

20:02.380 --> 20:03.380
guests show up.

20:03.380 --> 20:04.380
I hope not again.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.380
This is my house.

20:05.380 --> 20:09.360
It's like, you know, at 10, 10, 10 30, I want everyone to get out.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.360
So I'm another guest.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
What about me?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.360
Yeah.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.360
But you're different.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
Cause I know you.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.360
I'm the doctor.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.360
I'm different.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.360
All right.

20:17.360 --> 20:22.000
Uh, housekeeping tonight before we get into the gaming news, we're like 20 minutes into

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
the show.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
We need to get into gaming news.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.720
Uh, just a quick warning, kind of a disclaimer tonight.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.440
It was April fool's week this week.

20:27.440 --> 20:31.240
And while we think we've done a pretty good job of weeding the actual news stories from

20:31.240 --> 20:34.920
the bullshit, there might have been some bullshit that snuck through, but I don't think tonight,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.000
I think we got pretty much everything cleared.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.160
Um, also, uh, don't forget to follow us on Twitter at username, OLR, or follow us on

20:42.160 --> 20:48.720
a Facebook, OL army, or follow us on a live journal, a username, orange lounge.

20:48.720 --> 20:53.560
Uh, also want to make a mention of orange lounge radio, March madness.

20:53.560 --> 20:58.840
That's the thing that Breslull really heads up, kind of Spears it up for, um, the Saturday

20:58.840 --> 21:00.680
night program here under station live.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.100
And you know, we kind of give our commentary running on it.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.000
It finally ended this last week.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.780
Seems like it went on for a while, but considering you had like 64 games that had to get narrowed

21:08.780 --> 21:09.780
down to one.

21:09.780 --> 21:12.280
Um, there were no ties this year.

21:12.280 --> 21:17.120
There was one clear winner in the final, no ties that we have to break.

21:17.120 --> 21:22.600
Super Mario brothers three is your, uh, ultimate video game of all time per OLR March madness

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
this year.

21:23.600 --> 21:30.160
Um, which once again beat chrono trigger chrono trigger was the runner up for the second year

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
in a row.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.160
So there you go.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.160
And no, I agree.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.640
I mean, when I got that a virtual console was like just as fun as when I played it when

21:36.640 --> 21:37.640
I was 10.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.640
Um, you know, and I'm sure there's a lot of, especially the chrono trigger fanboys and

21:40.640 --> 21:43.080
girls that are like, Oh my God, fuck my life.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.920
I can't believe the super Mario brothers three would win.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
But come on.

21:46.920 --> 21:51.640
Super Mario brothers three is Epic in so many ways and really reached a much more broad

21:51.640 --> 21:53.720
audience I think than chrono trigger did.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.920
Don't get me wrong.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
I'm not knocking on chrono trigger.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.480
It's a fabulous game.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.280
Definitely worthy of the runner up prize.

22:00.280 --> 22:05.320
However, you can't get mad that a game like super Mario brothers three beat it.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.920
If if rock band had ultimately won, I could see you cause that was in the final four.

22:09.920 --> 22:14.240
I could see you getting mad if rock band, I would join you video games forever.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.040
I would have joined you and I love me rock band, but it's like a, like a fine wine.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.040
It needs to age a little bit.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.800
It needs to age a little bit before it can truly be the ultimate video game of all time.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.200
So all right.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.200
Yeah.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.660
Necessitic vampire in chat says it's just a poll.

22:29.660 --> 22:30.720
It's just a damn poll.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
Don't cry.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.720
Don't cry.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
All right.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
Let's get into some gaming news.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
Here's your game.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.040
So you can start us off with some gaming news tonight about Sony.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
Big press conference, right?

22:40.040 --> 22:43.760
Well, it wasn't even a press conference is just announcement basically.

22:43.760 --> 22:50.120
And the announcement was, Hey, we're going to drop the price of the PlayStation two.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.120
And they did.

22:51.120 --> 22:58.240
They dropped it by 30 bucks and now it's 99 99 the magic 99 99 and that is supposed to

22:58.240 --> 23:05.320
spike sales and allow the PlayStation brand to grow even more, or it's just another way

23:05.320 --> 23:10.200
for them to say, Hey, look, you know, this is look how many people we have on the PlayStation

23:10.200 --> 23:11.400
platform.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.840
You know, not the PlayStation three because the PlayStation three is in third place as

23:14.840 --> 23:16.280
far as the new consoles go.

23:16.280 --> 23:24.040
But the PlayStation platform is number one because the PlayStation two is so popular.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
I don't know.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.240
I think it's about time that they dropped the price of it.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.480
I mean, it's old.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.020
It's over 10 years old now.

23:30.020 --> 23:34.600
So not a big surprise.

23:34.600 --> 23:39.440
And then also, you know, other than the US getting the price job, of course, we're going

23:39.440 --> 23:43.400
to see a price drop in Europe as well to 99 euros.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.560
And unfortunately, no price drop for the UK.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.200
Sorry.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.360
But you know, 99 99.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.960
We'll see if this spike sales.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.480
Let me just say as far as I'm concerned.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.320
I haven't had any other people buy PlayStation two systems.

23:58.320 --> 24:02.360
In fact, I haven't had anyone buy a PlayStation two system in a very long time and the price

24:02.360 --> 24:03.360
drop.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.280
No one cared, at least on my end.

24:05.280 --> 24:10.520
But Hey, you know, if your console died, maybe you can save a few bucks and the use prices

24:10.520 --> 24:15.280
drop so you can buy use console even cheaper.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.320
But I don't think this is going to make any difference night and day.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.960
It doesn't make the poor college kids happy.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.280
There's a market for this.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.040
This is huge news for a lot of people.

24:23.040 --> 24:27.240
That's not the core gamers like you and I, you know what I mean?

24:27.240 --> 24:31.800
This is the let's get a really cheap video game system to put in the kid's bedroom type

24:31.800 --> 24:32.800
of thing.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.760
This is not going to be exciting news for the core gamer like you and I, because this

24:35.760 --> 24:37.160
we've moved on.

24:37.160 --> 24:40.440
We've graduated to 360 PS three, et cetera.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.800
Well then they're like, Oh, it can impact sales of the weed.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.160
No, I don't think it will because well, because that's the market they're going for.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.540
Instead of trying to either trying to make the price of the PlayStation two so lucrative

24:50.540 --> 24:55.120
that people will want to buy it instead of the we, because I think, I do think the PS

24:55.120 --> 24:59.520
two is competing with the we for that sort of a kid's bedroom toy, you know, and the

24:59.520 --> 25:02.080
we is not having the mass shortages that he used to have.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.120
That was kind of what was keeping the PlayStation two in some ways of flow was that there was

25:06.120 --> 25:07.640
sometimes the we was gone.

25:07.640 --> 25:14.080
So people would opt for a PlayStation two, but I, you know, it's, you can't say PlayStation

25:14.080 --> 25:15.140
two is a bad system.

25:15.140 --> 25:19.160
You can't say there's no games available for the PlayStation two and then it's going to

25:19.160 --> 25:21.400
drop the new price and the use price.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.000
So, you know, you know, it's interesting that you had to come eventually.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.800
I'm kind of curious to see what the sales are going to be on the week in the next few

25:26.800 --> 25:29.360
months because no, they have met the demand.

25:29.360 --> 25:33.740
And because of that, I've had a lot less people buying them.

25:33.740 --> 25:42.800
And you know, this is when it meets as a man is usually a time when the colors come and

25:42.800 --> 25:47.860
I wouldn't be surprised if the colors come during E3 because that's when they're going

25:47.860 --> 25:51.640
to announce stupid, you know, superfluous shit like this, uh, comments from chat, comments

25:51.640 --> 25:55.200
from chat, uh, tiger class says it's amazing that Sony still supports the PS two given

25:55.200 --> 25:56.740
its enormous library.

25:56.740 --> 25:57.740
You got to give it to them.

25:57.740 --> 26:01.040
Unlike Microsoft and Nintendo that screw their fans by discontinuing their consoles.

26:01.040 --> 26:05.560
Uh, the fact that Sony still supports the PS two shows that there are a large or still

26:05.560 --> 26:10.320
a large contingent of people that still own their PS two is all that from tiger claw because

26:10.320 --> 26:13.760
there's no backwards compatibility for the PlayStation two anymore on the PlayStation

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
three.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.160
That's exactly what Brad from pod culture says.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.680
Yeah, folks will pick one up, especially if your PS three is not backwards compatible

26:19.680 --> 26:22.880
and your old chunky PS two is acting odd.

26:22.880 --> 26:27.480
Um, also I want to say for Misty, kind of a dissenting voice here, it annoys me because

26:27.480 --> 26:33.400
I just replaced my PS two since the beginning of the year and now it dropped to $99 slanted

26:33.400 --> 26:37.320
and then face and Nintendo still will repair the old systems.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.620
So really all of them, um, the last time I checked on their website, there was still

26:41.620 --> 26:45.000
a repair for the NES, but there was no price listed.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.040
It was, uh, I bet you basically had to call them and then they would probably drop the

26:48.040 --> 26:49.040
bomb.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.440
Yeah, that's not going to be pretty.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
All right.

26:52.440 --> 26:56.800
Well, Hey, I'm going over to the PSP because obviously the DSI has been much in the limelight

26:56.800 --> 26:58.600
this week with his launch and everything.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.720
But one of the highly anticipated games for the PSP, Elise for me, and probably most of

27:02.720 --> 27:06.700
us here at music game loving orange launch radio, rock band unplugged.

27:06.700 --> 27:09.920
And the reason why of course that we're all salivating over this game is that it's supposed

27:09.920 --> 27:13.840
to be a lot like amplitude and frequency, uh, rock band unplugged.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.080
The box art has leaked out to the internet and apparently it reveals a partial track

27:18.080 --> 27:19.080
list.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.560
However, do take this with a tiny grain of salt.

27:20.560 --> 27:24.160
This news came out not March 31st, which, you know, in a certain time zone might've

27:24.160 --> 27:28.640
been April 1st, but I could see this happening because this, this is legit.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.640
It's very legit.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.320
Cause a lot of these songs crossover into the actual rock band games.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.320
I could see this.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.680
Um, for example, the way for me to check, well, for example, uh, let's see, we have

27:37.680 --> 27:38.680
blink one 82.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.680
What's my age again?

27:39.680 --> 27:44.320
Really idle white wedding Boston, more than a feeling through fighters ever long.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.320
That game is definitely wrong.

27:45.320 --> 27:49.760
That's not as in rock band, modest mouse float on also Jackson five ABC.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.400
Now that I don't recall being in rock band.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.400
So there are some new tracks, uh, the police message in a bottle, the who pinball wizard,

27:56.400 --> 27:58.840
et cetera, et cetera.

27:58.840 --> 28:03.280
Now also the box apparently also confirms that there will be download content.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.000
There's going to be a music store.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.840
Uh, unfortunately there will be no multiplayer at all in the game.

28:09.840 --> 28:14.080
They had, um, also some screenshots from it in, on the back of the box as well.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.880
Uh, yeah, I remember seeing the screenshots elsewhere on the internet and it, uh, definitely

28:17.880 --> 28:22.840
looks like it's going to be an amplitude, you know, frequency type of game, which, Hey,

28:22.840 --> 28:25.800
fine by me, you know, and I was just saying on Bobby show earlier, you know, Bobby black

28:25.800 --> 28:29.920
Wolf, the guy who does the show, um, before us here on all games radio on Sunday nights,

28:29.920 --> 28:34.960
um, was talking about the whole, he was, he was talking about the DS and DSI.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.040
And the, how guitar hero on tour, one of the biggest selling third party DS games is kind

28:40.040 --> 28:43.440
of screwed by the DSI because the game boy advanced slots now really.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.600
And I was kinda, you know, we joked when we called on the show like, well, who, who the

28:46.600 --> 28:48.760
fuck should be playing guitar here on the DS anyway?

28:48.760 --> 28:52.440
You know, if they're trying to like emulate the whole, it doesn't matter the actual guitar

28:52.440 --> 28:54.280
hero, it doesn't matter anyways.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.760
It's a new system on top of the DS are still selling four colors of the DS and there's

28:58.760 --> 29:02.240
still that many, you know, millions of, you know, DS is out there.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.000
They're not going to suffer one bit.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.480
But see, I give that a hard time yet.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.960
I allow rock band because this whole rock band on tour, because they're making a different

29:08.960 --> 29:13.160
game out of it that, you know, is really a throwback to something a lot of people have

29:13.160 --> 29:14.160
been selling.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.160
It doesn't have any peripherals.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.360
That too.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.360
They could easily too.

29:17.360 --> 29:22.680
I wouldn't be surprised if they port this to the PlayStation two without, without the

29:22.680 --> 29:24.760
salt, you know, song store and stuff like that.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
Who knows?

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
We'll see.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
All right.

29:27.760 --> 29:32.520
Well, anyhow, um, we will, uh, continue to watch rock band unplugged and let you know

29:32.520 --> 29:33.520
more on it.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.840
And as soon as we know, which I'm sure will be E3, I'm sure that game is going to be playable

29:36.840 --> 29:37.840
on the show floor.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.160
And I know that will be one of the first things I check out.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.160
What about you?

29:41.160 --> 29:42.160
Dark soccer.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.160
You interested in rock band unplugged?

29:43.160 --> 29:48.000
Um, well, not particularly, I thought you were being amplitude frequency type fan.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.320
I, I like it, but I'm, there's other things you're more interested in motion sick.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.320
Oh yeah.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.320
I can see that.

29:55.320 --> 30:02.280
Well, um, there is going to be a new Jack and Dexter game for the PSP and the PS two.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.280
Why?

30:03.280 --> 30:09.160
I don't know, but there is, and it's going to basically pick up from where the, the last

30:09.160 --> 30:11.440
uh, game left off.

30:11.440 --> 30:17.760
And so you are in the last frontier and you're going to help someone become a sage Kira,

30:17.760 --> 30:19.560
I think is the name.

30:19.560 --> 30:28.400
And uh, so it's a adventure up in the mountains or in the air or with pirates of the sky.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.240
Well, you know, this series obviously still has its fans.

30:32.240 --> 30:36.000
And I think this goes right in line with the whole PlayStation two price drop.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.560
It's interesting to see, wow, they are still making freaking games for the PlayStation

30:40.560 --> 30:45.040
two, but you know, and this isn't like a D list title.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.000
This is at least the B list.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.760
Well, um, it actually is, uh, done by, uh, being developed by a high impact games.

30:54.760 --> 30:58.040
So they're the ones that did size matters.

30:58.040 --> 31:05.720
And uh, it's looks like it's going to be fairly less depressing than, you know, the second

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
one was.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
All right.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.960
I had any interest in Jack and Dexter for you.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.920
No, I haven't been interested in that ever.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.360
It's more of a kid's franchise, right?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.360
Yeah.

31:16.360 --> 31:20.120
But I know we have listeners that are fans and they're probably screaming at us right

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
now.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
It's not necessarily a kid's franchise.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.520
And I'm not really saying that it's just like ratchet and clank.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.440
I tried to get in the ratchet and clank cause I had never really been a fan of it on the

31:28.440 --> 31:32.040
PlayStation two with the PlayStation three version tools of destruction.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.160
I played it for a little bit and then I ended up selling it to my friend cause I just couldn't

31:37.160 --> 31:38.160
do it.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.600
It just, it not my thing, just not very entertaining.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.880
I was like into like Spyro and stuff for a little bit and my sister really went gung

31:44.880 --> 31:45.880
ho with that.

31:45.880 --> 31:52.080
But, um, yeah, grand theft auto that steals away all my time, unfortunately.

31:52.080 --> 31:59.040
Anyways, some other games though that are going to be coming out that are kind of neat.

31:59.040 --> 32:04.280
Tales of Vesperia, coming in the PS3.

32:04.280 --> 32:08.640
And this is not really a big surprise since, you know, Tales of Vesperia came out on the

32:08.640 --> 32:09.640
360.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.040
This is kind of a similar thing with Eternal Sonata.

32:12.040 --> 32:18.800
Now of course after the wait, not only do you get a game that is on par with the 360

32:18.800 --> 32:22.440
version but they've also added in new stuff.

32:22.440 --> 32:27.280
Including some new characters you'll get to play as that were kind of hinted in the Xbox

32:27.280 --> 32:32.680
360 version but now they are playable, which is kind of cool.

32:32.680 --> 32:38.420
And another game they also announced Tales of Versus, which is going to be a PSP title

32:38.420 --> 32:43.000
and it's kind of like the Tales version of Dissidia.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Which is neat.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.080
So you got all the Tales characters fighting each other.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.160
It's still part of the Tales series, yeah.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.040
But um, you know, a little bit different.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.200
But uh, they're putting out a lot of Tales games, that's for sure.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.640
Which is definitely crazy in Japan, right?

32:58.640 --> 33:01.480
Didn't the Xbox 360 get a huge boost from Vesperia?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.480
Yeah, yeah.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.360
That and Internal Sonata I think did pretty good.

33:05.360 --> 33:11.280
But I don't know, I never really noticed the Tales franchise that much.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.140
I haven't really played any of them, so I kind of feel bad in that sense.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.960
But I don't want to play any of them right now.

33:16.960 --> 33:21.680
Well, Tales for Fantasia on Game Boy Advance is actually pretty good.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.200
Like if you're into old school, like 16-bit.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.840
Oh yeah, Tales definitely has a very cult following to it.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.920
You know, there's lots of fans of this series.

33:29.920 --> 33:34.200
But you know, I'm not surprised this game is showing up on Playstation 3.

33:34.200 --> 33:39.480
It is a little bit late to the party, but I think over in Japan it's going to mean more

33:39.480 --> 33:40.640
than it will here.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.580
Because in Japan, the Playstation 3 has penetrated a bigger slice of the market.

33:44.580 --> 33:47.120
So I think, you know, it's going to be a bigger deal over there.

33:47.120 --> 33:53.100
I would say put it out this year if you can, because come the end of this year and possibly

33:53.100 --> 33:56.680
next spring Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out and no one's going to care about

33:56.680 --> 34:00.280
anything else as far as RPGs go.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.040
And whether it's good or bad, I mean, just no one's going to care.

34:03.040 --> 34:08.840
Speaking of which, remember, we're only like a couple weeks away, and I'll be getting my

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
copy of the demo.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.840
Ooh, that's right.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.040
And we'll definitely be doing that on the JT.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.040
Definitely we'll be doing that.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.040
We won't be the first, though.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.040
There's going to be tons of people.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.040
Oh, yeah.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.040
Absolutely.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.840
But we will definitely check it out on Sunday in case you forget to check earlier in the

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
week.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
Okay.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.960
So I want to talk about Playstation as well, which got a firmware update this week.

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
You know, they're on Playstation.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.880
They do pretty regular firmware updates over there.

34:28.880 --> 34:34.040
One of the big features now, in-game text chat, 16 people at a time, is one of the big

34:34.040 --> 34:36.680
features of the new firmware, which was released this week.

34:36.680 --> 34:42.040
Also, you can send, apparently, files to your friends as big as 3 megabytes now.

34:42.040 --> 34:46.760
And you can sort friends in your friends list now alphabetically or by online status and

34:46.760 --> 34:50.440
last login time, so you can kind of have some, which is good, because it seemed like there

34:50.440 --> 34:53.120
was no rhyme or reason to the friends list sorting before, so that was a feature that

34:53.120 --> 34:54.120
was needed.

34:54.120 --> 34:59.680
Also, there's some other features, a dynamic normalizer that will prevent sudden increases

34:59.680 --> 35:01.480
in volume between music tracks.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.360
For those games that don't know how to normalize their volume, that's pretty good.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.560
If you don't have a sound system, it'll do that as well.

35:07.560 --> 35:13.400
Also, the ability to cut and paste text, which I guess if you're a huge chatterer in home

35:13.400 --> 35:15.520
might be useful or something.

35:15.520 --> 35:19.760
I can't think of a lot of chatty things I do on the Playstation 3, but I guess cut and

35:19.760 --> 35:20.760
paste is needed.

35:20.760 --> 35:25.080
And now the dawn of the age of text spamming in home.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.080
That's true.

35:26.080 --> 35:30.440
I hope they figured out a way to curb that in home, but, you know, cut and paste is also

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
a big, big...

35:31.440 --> 35:34.680
You know, you might be laughing going, well, cut and paste shouldn't be a big fucking deal.

35:34.680 --> 35:39.040
Look at all the iPhone users that are, like, rejoicing that cut and paste is finally coming

35:39.040 --> 35:40.040
to iPhone.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.720
Oh, hell yes.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.840
That's a big deal over there, so I can see that.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.920
So there you go, Playstation 3 firmware out now.

35:47.920 --> 35:51.920
I actually upgraded earlier today before I went into home, but unfortunately those really

35:51.920 --> 35:54.260
aren't a lot of features I use very often, except the friends list.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.360
That will probably be the biggest thing for me.

35:56.360 --> 36:01.800
Well, there's a particular series that I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.040
I won't see any of it.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.440
I hate this whole series of movies.

36:06.440 --> 36:11.600
The concept of it is disgusting and just repugnant to me.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.560
What movie series is that, Rob?

36:14.560 --> 36:17.320
Um, I would have to say...

36:17.320 --> 36:18.320
Too slow, Saw.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
Pokemon.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
Oh.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.800
I really, really hate Saw.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
Pokemon in Saw?

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
No.

36:23.800 --> 36:28.560
Would you watch that if the Pokemon starred in the next Saw movie?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
Fuck no.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
Pikachu!

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
Pikachu!

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Pikachu!

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
Pikachu!

36:33.560 --> 36:34.560
Pikachu!

36:34.560 --> 36:35.560
Pikachu!

36:35.560 --> 36:39.160
What do we do with Pikachu's armor?

36:39.160 --> 36:43.620
As I was saying, Konami has the Saw license.

36:43.620 --> 36:49.000
They pried it out of the dead fingers of Brasher Entertainment.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.480
Thank God.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.120
Because then it might actually be a decent game.

36:53.120 --> 37:00.720
But now they were actually drawing comparisons between that and Silent Hill, which I thought

37:00.720 --> 37:09.240
was more funny um more funny funnier there's my grammar today um the marketer David Daniels

37:09.240 --> 37:15.200
was telling what sorry I'm laughing at the chat room hold on we got we got DJ Tyrant

37:15.200 --> 37:21.840
hello Ash I'd like to play a battle with you and gold anthro says gotta saw them all

37:21.840 --> 37:34.280
dear chat room they make Ritalin for a reason sorry dark soccer okay um but the marketer

37:34.280 --> 37:44.040
David Daniels is quoted saying that Silent Hill is more about psychological terror but

37:44.040 --> 37:48.120
soft for us is more about graphic intense horror that overwhelms you we want players

37:48.120 --> 37:53.160
to turn away from the screen for just a moment because of the visual intensity or because

37:53.160 --> 37:57.640
the graphics really really suck in other words it's going to be blood pornography these games

37:57.640 --> 38:01.200
are going to be just that they're already preparing us for the fact that these games

38:01.200 --> 38:08.000
are going to be blood pornography wait well it's supposed to be out in the fall it actually

38:08.000 --> 38:13.240
has Tobin Bell doing the voice of jigsaw he does have a sexy voice I'll put it that way

38:13.240 --> 38:18.600
it's a very sexy scary voice and considering you know Vincent Price is like long dead and

38:18.600 --> 38:24.480
gone and there will never be anyone as wonderful as Vincent Price um you know Tobin Bell's

38:24.480 --> 38:30.680
got a pretty scary voice for this generation well it's going to be out on PC, Xbox 360

38:30.680 --> 38:37.400
and PS3 and guess who's not going to buy it me I'm not even going to let it come into

38:37.400 --> 38:42.160
my house aren't you worried this might have an impact on the Silent Hill series I hope

38:42.160 --> 38:46.460
not, better fucking not I do like that he has the distinction it's going to get worse

38:46.460 --> 38:51.760
Silent well I like that they've made the clear distinction Silent Hill psychological thriller

38:51.760 --> 38:56.200
because when I think psychological thriller I think of great scary movies like The Silence

38:56.200 --> 39:01.640
of the Lambs these types of like classic psychological thrillers that's more in the suspense sense

39:01.640 --> 39:05.380
right and but that's kind of what Silent Hill is right more of like a suspense mind fuck

39:05.380 --> 39:11.640
kind of movie but it has the gross it has the gore attached to it it has but it's not

39:11.640 --> 39:17.640
The gore is not the focus. The gore is part of driving in the psychological part.

39:17.640 --> 39:21.640
You are walking through a personal nightmare for your character.

39:21.640 --> 39:26.640
In essence, that is Silent Hill. You are walking through their nightmare.

39:26.640 --> 39:31.640
You know, everything in the game has some aspect of their personality or their guilt

39:31.640 --> 39:34.640
or something having to do with them that's going back to that person.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.640
It requires more thought than just splattering blood everywhere.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.640
But you know there are going to be people that are all about the blood orgy of Saw.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
It will sell. It will sell.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
It'll sell, but...

39:44.640 --> 39:49.640
Which, Loki, you're a big blood fan. Are you going to be purchasing the blood orgy that is Saw?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
No, because it's not going to be any good.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
I'm sorry, even if...

39:53.640 --> 39:57.640
Now, what they should have called it is blood orgy of the game, but you know...

39:57.640 --> 40:00.640
I'd buy a game called blood orgy.

40:00.640 --> 40:06.640
No, but seriously though, I'm sorry, but not to knock Konami or anything.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.640
It's not going to be any good because it's made by Konami.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.640
I don't want to knock them or anything, but it's...

40:11.640 --> 40:13.640
God damn, your game is going to suck.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.640
I'm sorry.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.640
Hold on, Loki. To be fair, none of you have touched the game.

40:17.640 --> 40:21.640
And you're basing your review of the game off the movie, which isn't completely fair.

40:21.640 --> 40:25.640
No, I'm basing my review off of the screenshot that I saw, okay?

40:25.640 --> 40:30.640
And also the fact that Saw cannot be made into a game very well.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.640
Because how are you going to do that?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.640
No, I'm sorry. Konami's not clever enough to figure that out.

40:36.640 --> 40:37.640
Point and click.

40:37.640 --> 40:45.640
How about I have read enough about Saw to know that I have zero interest in playing the game or seeing the movies or anything remotely related to it.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.640
And I don't even watch the damn trailers.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
Then again, I don't watch TV.

40:49.640 --> 40:54.640
But still, I have zero interest in nothing but loathing for the franchise.

40:54.640 --> 40:59.640
Now, I noticed the consensus amongst chat, and I'm not going to read a lot of the individual quotes from chat here.

40:59.640 --> 41:03.640
Because it seems like there's a consensus that Saw 1, decent.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.640
The rest, blood orgy.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.640
Stupid porn movies.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.640
Blood porn.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.640
The Leo Shannon chat, I will read this comment.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.640
Blood orgy and titties would be the best selling game ever.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.640
It just might. It just might.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.640
You know, it could be decent, but it's not going to be good.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.640
And they've got a lot of things going against them.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.640
Just because, one, it's a movie tie-in.

41:27.640 --> 41:37.640
And two, really, when is the last standout awesome game other than Metal Gear Solid 4 that's come out from Konami in the recent years?

41:37.640 --> 41:43.640
Oh, I can't think of one! That's why!

41:43.640 --> 41:48.640
And I'm sorry, I don't all of a sudden see them turning themselves around any time soon.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.640
And, I don't know.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.640
Low expectations, let's put it that way.

41:54.640 --> 42:00.640
If it comes out and it's awesome, good, then I'll eat my words, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
And no, I'm not making a bet on this game.

42:02.640 --> 42:08.640
Agdef is telling me to give the first movie a try, but I'm going to go ahead and explain this right now.

42:08.640 --> 42:15.640
The concept of that kind of thing, about putting people in that position, disgusts me.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.640
Like you have no idea how much it disgusts me.

42:18.640 --> 42:25.640
It's so reprehensible of an idea that thinking about it makes me want to vomit.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.640
So no, I won't see it.

42:27.640 --> 42:31.640
I did see the first Saw movie and it's one of those things where it's like, it's not that great.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.640
You can live your life and not see it.

42:33.640 --> 42:38.640
Like, there's a hundred other movies I would say a person has to see before they see Saw.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
See Saw.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.640
Saw!

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
Oh god, you're all done.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.640
And that's the thing, I'm a pretty big fan of the Saw movies.

42:45.640 --> 42:49.640
Granted, they've kind of gone downhill because once you kill off the main bad guy...

42:49.640 --> 42:52.640
Oops, spoiler.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.640
It's been like movies since then.

42:54.640 --> 43:01.640
But once you kill off the main bad guy, it's kind of hard to, I don't know, continue the series without a new bad person.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
And they've kind of done...

43:03.640 --> 43:06.640
They've made it as confusing as possible unless you've watched the other movies.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.640
And you're just like, oh, that's that dude from that other movie.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
And, wait, what?

43:11.640 --> 43:14.640
But next Silent Hill game, I am so there.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.640
I bought Homecoming. It was fun. Good game.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.640
I need to actually go back and beat it.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.640
There's a lot of games that came out around the same time.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.640
We were watching Annie and Jim play Homecoming this week.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
It's okay. Also watched Siren.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.640
And that was... I don't know.

43:27.640 --> 43:31.640
But I just saw the movie...

43:31.640 --> 43:34.640
I just don't see how you can make this into a game.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.640
I'm sorry.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.640
What's it gonna be?

43:38.640 --> 43:41.640
I mean, it's just like an adventure game that doesn't make any sense.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.640
It's gonna sell.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.640
I would bet money this Saw game's gonna sell even though we all hate it.

43:45.640 --> 43:47.640
Because there's an audience out there for it. There really is.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
Well, I don't think there will.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
There will be a Saw 2 video game.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.640
It'll probably come out in October.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.640
And it's gonna be coming out at the same time as a bunch of other bigger games.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.640
And I'm sorry.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.640
When this comes out, there will be people that pick it up because it's Saw.

44:01.640 --> 44:07.640
But think of the last really good movie title that's come out on consoles.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.640
That's right. Because most of them aren't that good.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.640
And even Wanted, which I thought was gonna be awesome, wasn't that good.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.640
And it's just not gonna happen.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.640
It's not gonna be all of a sudden amazing.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.640
They're not gonna break the mold.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.640
It's just not gonna work.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.640
Okay, I want to get over this Saw topic.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.640
But I do want to say one other comment here.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.640
It's in support, basically, of what DarkSakura is saying.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.640
TigerKlon's chat says,

44:30.640 --> 44:32.640
I feel the same way about movies that glamorize the gore.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.640
I don't get why people are so turned on by it.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.640
That I find deeply disturbing.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.640
One final thought I want to put out there is

44:38.640 --> 44:46.640
this is just gonna give ammunition to those people that say that video games are, you know, poisoning the minds of people everywhere.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.640
And those people that say, you know, Manhunt 2 is corrupting America,

44:49.640 --> 44:52.640
and Grand Theft Auto is poisoning our children, et cetera, et cetera.

44:52.640 --> 44:59.640
These Saw games, especially if people's predictions that you are going to be the puppet in these games is correct.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.640
If you're the little puppet creature, that'd be awesome.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.640
I don't know.

45:03.640 --> 45:11.640
I have a bad feeling that this game is going to be one of those things that certain lawyers who I wish would stay out of the goddamn news

45:11.640 --> 45:14.640
are going to use to propel their case into the next decade.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.640
They should be more offended by the movies because the movies are actually graphic and stuff.

45:17.640 --> 45:22.640
Whereas this game, I don't think enough people are going to buy it to even, you know, care that it's violent.

45:22.640 --> 45:27.640
I will go ahead and say, by the way, it is not the gore that bothers me.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.640
It is the concept of what the people in the movie...

45:30.640 --> 45:32.640
Torture porn. Torture porn bothers you.

45:32.640 --> 45:38.640
That's it. I do not, I can't stand torture of people who really haven't done anything wrong.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.640
Alright. Let's move on.

45:40.640 --> 45:42.640
I'm so done with Saw.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.640
But the people have done stuff that's wrong.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.640
That's the whole point of why they're being tortured.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.640
Well, you know what I mean.

45:47.640 --> 45:48.640
Whatever.

45:48.640 --> 45:53.640
Anyways, something that's not wrong in any way whatsoever would be Saints Row 2.

45:53.640 --> 45:59.640
And there's brand new download content coming out for it on April 16th, which makes me pretty excited.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.640
Because now I have a new reason to play that game again.

46:02.640 --> 46:09.640
The new download content will be called Ultor Exposed, which makes sense because there's areas of the map that you can't conquer yet.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.640
And they're all owned by Ultor.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.640
And it will give you a few new things, including a co-op meta game.

46:16.640 --> 46:21.640
You'll be able to use porn star Tara Patrick as one of your homies.

46:21.640 --> 46:30.640
Okay. And new vehicles, new weapons, and some new multiplayer maps are also coming out along with that.

46:30.640 --> 46:37.640
It's going to be available for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

46:37.640 --> 46:41.640
And I look forward to checking that out.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.640
Alrighty. Let's move on to some release dates.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.640
And let's travel the world and check out what's coming out in some other countries this week.

46:47.640 --> 46:52.640
And I'm looking over at Japan and in the next gen systems, there's really not a whole lot.

46:52.640 --> 46:58.640
You get a price reduction on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 on Playstation 3.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.640
But not a lot of new stuff.

47:00.640 --> 47:04.640
And I'm wondering if that's because you got the whole Advent Children coming out next week over in Japan.

47:04.640 --> 47:05.640
I don't know.

47:05.640 --> 47:10.640
On the Nintendo Wii, you do have Oboro Muramasa comes out this week.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.640
And I'm not sure what this game really is, but it does look kind of stylized.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.640
It is awesome.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.640
This game is by the developers of Odin Sphere.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.640
It's all hand drawn.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.640
It's very stylized.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.640
This looks kind of neat actually.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.640
Like a side scroll action game.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
It's coming out in June here in the US.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.640
It's going to be called Muramasa Demon Blade.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.640
Yeah, this game looks cool.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.640
So if you're in Japan, you get an extra sneak peek at this this week.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.640
Maybe we'll have a sneak peek of it next week. Who knows?

47:38.640 --> 47:39.640
That would be awesome actually.

47:39.640 --> 47:42.640
This game, I love the art in this. This looks really cool.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.640
And this is a Wii game.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.640
What's that, doctor?

47:46.640 --> 47:49.640
I was going to say, there's videos of it on YouTube and whatnot.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.640
And the animation is pretty high quality.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.640
It looks really good.

47:52.640 --> 47:53.640
Well, there you go.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
At least there's that big title coming out.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.640
Maybe people are afraid of that.

47:57.640 --> 47:58.640
I don't know.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.640
On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart 2.

48:01.640 --> 48:05.640
Full title is Sugoi Arcana Heart 2.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.640
Arcana Heart, that is the female chick fighter game, is it not?

48:08.640 --> 48:10.640
Where it's all women, I guess.

48:10.640 --> 48:11.640
They got a sequel.

48:11.640 --> 48:14.640
So I'm assuming it's a matter of time before that comes out over here.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.640
It actually looks pretty good on, is that just on PlayStation 2?

48:17.640 --> 48:18.640
That is a PlayStation 2 game.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.640
They have some really good captures.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.640
Those are not bad graphics for PlayStation 2.

48:23.640 --> 48:26.640
Again, showing that they're still cranking it out on the PlayStation 2.

48:26.640 --> 48:29.640
Looking on the Nintendo DS, not a whole lot of stuff.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.640
Rhythm to Run Run Run is a game coming out,

48:32.640 --> 48:35.640
as well as another cooking game called Happy Cooking.

48:35.640 --> 48:39.640
A party stylized concept game on the DS? What?

48:39.640 --> 48:44.640
And then lastly in Japan, looking at the Sony PlayStation Portable.

48:44.640 --> 48:49.640
I don't believe I see a whole lot on the PSP.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.640
Where is my list here?

48:51.640 --> 48:53.640
We do have another Evangelion game.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.640
It's a Neon Genesis Evangelion,

48:56.640 --> 49:00.640
Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Tokubetsu Hen Portable.

49:00.640 --> 49:01.640
So you know what that means.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.640
Dating Evangelion Sim on the PSP again.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.640
Enjoy that.

49:06.640 --> 49:10.640
Oh, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes is a big title coming out on the PSP.

49:10.640 --> 49:15.640
I think that one is something you get a little more excited about.

49:15.640 --> 49:18.640
Again, looks like this game's got some pretty sweet graphics too.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.640
That's another Dynasty Warriors game?

49:20.640 --> 49:22.640
It looks kind of, a little bit.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.640
I mean, there's like zero English in this game whatsoever,

49:24.640 --> 49:26.640
so looking at the screenshots I can't tell.

49:26.640 --> 49:30.640
It's probably Sengoku Basara, that's, oh, I can't...

49:30.640 --> 49:32.640
Battle Heroes is the subtitle.

49:32.640 --> 49:35.640
I'm thinking what it's called over here.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.640
They've only released one game.

49:36.640 --> 49:40.640
I actually have that for the Wii and I haven't actually played it yet.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.640
It's only in Japan.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.640
I have this special edition, it's like a two disc game,

49:44.640 --> 49:46.640
but it has the first and second one.

49:46.640 --> 49:50.640
It was localized over here by Capcom and I can't remember,

49:50.640 --> 49:53.640
it's like, it's going to bug me now.

49:53.640 --> 49:54.640
It's comments from Chatroom.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.640
Goldanthro says,

49:55.640 --> 49:59.640
Sky wants a guy version game that's Arcana Heart style.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.640
To be fair, that's most other fighting games.

50:02.640 --> 50:03.640
To be fair.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.640
Leo Shen says, Arcana Heart 2.

50:05.640 --> 50:06.640
Get it.

50:06.640 --> 50:11.640
They have a freaking loli fighter modeled after Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.

50:11.640 --> 50:12.640
There's no place like home.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.640
There's no place like home.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.640
Punch.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.640
Does she like, does she roundhouse kick people with her ruby slippers?

50:17.640 --> 50:18.640
I guess so.

50:18.640 --> 50:19.640
Let's see.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.640
It's called Devil Kings over here.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.640
That's what it was.

50:21.640 --> 50:22.640
There you go.

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
Devil something.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.640
Alright, let's move on to Europe.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
Dark Sakura.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.640
Europe release dates.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.640
There's stuff.

50:29.640 --> 50:35.640
Well, as far as our European release dates, just give me just a second.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.640
It was thinking about it.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.640
My apologies.

50:37.640 --> 50:38.640
Modern technology.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.640
On the seventh, we have Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.640
Logs Lost Challenges.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.640
We have Flock on PC.

50:46.640 --> 50:51.640
The ninth, we have Elven Legacy and Helldorado.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.640
Helldorado?

50:52.640 --> 50:53.640
Okay.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.640
I'm not even going to ask.

50:55.640 --> 50:58.640
On the tenth, we have The Godfather 2.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.640
And that's it.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.640
Cool.

51:02.640 --> 51:05.640
Over here, we've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.640
Of course, this is all coming out today.

51:07.640 --> 51:08.640
Of course, the DSi systems.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.640
I mean, a lot of people knew that was coming out, both in blue and black.

51:12.640 --> 51:17.640
Rhythm Heaven to kind of coincide with the DSi, but not necessarily a DSi game.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.640
Coming out on the DS.

51:19.640 --> 51:23.640
We've got Gravity coming out on the DS and on the Wii.

51:23.640 --> 51:27.640
Kind of a fun little incredible machine type of game.

51:27.640 --> 51:31.640
We've got Air Conflicts Aces of World War II coming to the PSP.

51:31.640 --> 51:35.640
Because I don't think the PSP's had a World War II flight sim game yet.

51:35.640 --> 51:36.640
So that's kind of cool.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.640
The Chronicles of Riddick Dark Athena.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.640
And it was about time they got one.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.640
It was about time.

51:41.640 --> 51:44.640
Every system needs their World War II flight sim fighting game.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
Yes.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
Yes.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
Definitely.

51:47.640 --> 51:53.640
And The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 this week.

51:53.640 --> 52:03.640
Hannah Montana the movie, the game everyone's been waiting for coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
Yay!

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
Yes, awesome.

52:05.640 --> 52:12.640
And then if you're not interested in Hannah Montana, you might be interested in Godfather 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

52:12.640 --> 52:15.640
Those two, you'd be surprised how the fans...

52:15.640 --> 52:21.640
If you're interested in both of those games, I think something might be wrong.

52:21.640 --> 52:24.640
I think most people would be interested in one or the other.

52:24.640 --> 52:31.640
I don't really see somebody saying, yeah GameStop employee, I'm here to pick up my copy of Godfather 2 and Miley Cyrus.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.640
It's for my daughter.

52:33.640 --> 52:39.640
Miley Cyrus is going to get an offer that she can't refuse.

52:39.640 --> 52:42.640
Because Miley Cyrus stars in The Godfather 4.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.640
Nobody knows this.

52:44.640 --> 52:45.640
Her and Sophia Copeland.

52:45.640 --> 52:50.640
Where the Godfather becomes hip and sassy.

52:50.640 --> 52:54.640
Alright.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.640
Some actual serious...

52:56.640 --> 52:59.640
Where RuPaul is the Godfather.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.640
I'm going to make you offer You Camera Feels, okay?

53:02.640 --> 53:04.640
Girl, you better work.

53:04.640 --> 53:13.640
And then on Playstation 2 and PSP this week, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus coming out if you're looking for a good 2D fighting game.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.640
On PC, DCS Black Shark.

53:16.640 --> 53:19.640
Looks like some flight sim game.

53:19.640 --> 53:24.640
Deer Drive is getting a re-release from Zoo Games.

53:24.640 --> 53:27.640
It's a game where you drive your jeep and kill deer.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.640
Just like, you know, that brings me back to, was it Cruisin' USA?

53:31.640 --> 53:34.640
Hit the deer and they explode.

53:34.640 --> 53:40.640
The game that we're featuring tonight actually on Justin TV, Ninja Blade will be making its way out this week if you want to own your own copy.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.640
I actually recommend it, it's pretty fun.

53:43.640 --> 53:47.640
And then, let's see here, Guilty Gear, I mentioned that.

53:47.640 --> 53:52.640
Oh, and this is awesome on PC, apparently if you like crappy games or you're a girl.

53:52.640 --> 54:02.640
OMG High School Triple Play Pack featuring, I believe it's like the Cheetah Girls, Mean Girls, and...

54:02.640 --> 54:06.640
Oh, I'm sorry, Mean Girls Clueless and Pretty in Pink.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.640
I didn't know they had games for those.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.640
I like all of those movies.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.640
I think something's wrong with me.

54:12.640 --> 54:15.640
There is something wrong with you.

54:15.640 --> 54:21.640
And then, let's see, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor coming out on PC.

54:21.640 --> 54:24.640
Elven Legacy on PC as well.

54:24.640 --> 54:30.640
And this is kind of cool, an Atlus PSP game, Hammerin' Hero coming out.

54:30.640 --> 54:35.640
And another crappy Wii game, Escape the Museum.

54:35.640 --> 54:38.640
And finally, you get a twofer here.

54:38.640 --> 54:45.640
Not only do you get a crappy movie this week, but a crappy game based on said crappy movie that's based off of an anime series.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.640
It's not so crappy, but Dragon Ball Evolution.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.640
The game, the movie, the myth, the failure.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.640
That's it.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.640
Other Gay Guy on the show tonight, I have a question.

54:57.640 --> 55:02.640
What is that show on VH1 with RuPaul, is it Drag Races?

55:02.640 --> 55:03.640
Yeah, RuPaul's Drag Race.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.640
How do you know that, Loki?

55:05.640 --> 55:06.640
I watch The Soup.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.640
Oh, Loki watches The Soup.

55:08.640 --> 55:13.640
Don't you think they need to make a video game out of that?

55:13.640 --> 55:15.640
Again, point and click.

55:15.640 --> 55:19.640
Yeah, you dress the guys, you get them into their tucking panties.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.640
It would be a Wii game, because it would be a party game.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.640
Like, you know, it could be heel clubbing.

55:26.640 --> 55:30.640
And you gotta do the dance, but it would be like Spice Girls the Game 2.

55:30.640 --> 55:31.640
I am all over this game.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.640
Let's put another girl through her paces.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.640
RuPaul's Drag Races.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.640
I like SSJ-100 Matt RuPaul GPS.

55:39.640 --> 55:43.640
Work, turn to the left, work, turn to the right.

55:43.640 --> 55:47.640
Any game where you replace the main character with RuPaul would be hilarious.

55:47.640 --> 55:48.640
I love RuPaul.

55:48.640 --> 55:49.640
God damn, RuPaul.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.640
I love RuPaul, but I think that'd be great.

55:52.640 --> 55:55.640
I think RuPaul would think that'd be funny.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.640
Oh my god, is there a game developer out there listening?

55:57.640 --> 56:00.640
Please, call them and make this happen.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.640
There is an audience for that game.

56:02.640 --> 56:08.640
Like Super Mario Bros. 3 RuPaul Edition, but instead of like the raccoon suit, it's like the sparkly suit.

56:08.640 --> 56:15.640
Look, if you want to put in a little bit of money into this game, you will sell like, you're not going to sell a million.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.640
You're probably not even going to sell 100,000, but you'll sell like 25,000.

56:18.640 --> 56:22.640
No, I still think there should have been a gay X-Men where RuPaul was stormed.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.640
I'm sorry.

56:24.640 --> 56:31.640
That would be a great game.

56:31.640 --> 56:33.640
Oh, here's something RuPaul should be in.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
Oni Chambara.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.640
No, seriously, I'm trying to tie this into the next story.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.640
Did you know there was actually a movie based off of Oni Chambara?

56:40.640 --> 56:42.640
Yes, I did, and I have...

56:42.640 --> 56:43.640
It's out here as well.

56:43.640 --> 56:46.640
It's localized here in the U.S. called Chambara Beauty, apparently.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.640
I know, I got it.

56:47.640 --> 56:49.640
I haven't got a chance to watch it yet, but...

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
Well, you better hurry because...

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
I will.

56:51.640 --> 56:52.640
Guess what?

56:52.640 --> 56:57.640
Apparently, even though this movie got negative reviews across the board, who would have thought?

56:57.640 --> 57:04.640
For some reason, bikini-clad women slaying zombies with swords apparently had an audience for it.

57:04.640 --> 57:08.640
Believe it or not, I played this game, and it was very fun.

57:08.640 --> 57:10.640
And yet they won't make the RuPaul game.

57:10.640 --> 57:11.640
Right.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.640
They think there's no audience for that.

57:12.640 --> 57:14.640
They'll make this shit, but they won't make it.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.640
What's also awesome about...

57:16.640 --> 57:19.640
You know, all the zombies are apparently farmers because they all wear flannel.

57:19.640 --> 57:20.640
Here's the thing.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.640
Chambara Beauty is now getting a sequel.

57:23.640 --> 57:24.640
The movie is getting a sequel.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.640
Oni Chambara the Game getting a sequel, that's probably a given as well.

57:27.640 --> 57:32.640
But there will be another movie, Chambara Beauty Vortex.

57:32.640 --> 57:36.640
And I guess there is a game called Vortex as well that's going to be coming out as well.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.640
Amazingly enough, though, the Oni Chambara...

57:38.640 --> 57:41.640
Like, for a Wii game, like, blood splattering on the screen.

57:41.640 --> 57:44.640
Like, you get too much blood on your sword, and it sticks into the zombies.

57:44.640 --> 57:48.640
I mean, it's not like a terrible blood fest, but it was a blood fest.

57:48.640 --> 57:49.640
Now, something you should know.

57:49.640 --> 57:56.640
The star of the first film, Starlit Eri Otogoro, is not coming back for the second movie.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.640
So you know it's going to be a winner.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.640
So this is a live action Japanese movie.

58:02.640 --> 58:05.640
Is that what you're saying?

58:05.640 --> 58:08.640
Yeah, this is a live action Japanese movie that's now getting a sequel to It.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.640
Wow.

58:09.640 --> 58:13.640
So we are seeing the beginnings of, like, Oni Chambara Mania.

58:13.640 --> 58:14.640
That's amazing.

58:14.640 --> 58:17.640
I love live action Japanese movies because they're so terrible.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.640
But yet, no RuPaul game.

58:21.640 --> 58:22.640
I'm just saying.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.640
Such injustice in this world.

58:24.640 --> 58:25.640
Such injustice.

58:25.640 --> 58:27.640
You would like Skye...

58:27.640 --> 58:29.640
I think I need to start one of those petition online things.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.640
You know those things that don't mean anything?

58:31.640 --> 58:34.640
But we need to start collecting signatures for a RuPaul video game.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.640
No, Rob, but...

58:35.640 --> 58:38.640
And I'll email fucking RuPaul somehow.

58:38.640 --> 58:40.640
Back to live action really quick.

58:40.640 --> 58:43.640
Akouge is a live action Japanese film about fag hags.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.640
Check it out.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.640
Akouge.

58:46.640 --> 58:47.640
Really?

58:47.640 --> 58:51.640
Yes, because I dated a Japanese guy for a little bit and he showed it to me.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
Really?

58:52.640 --> 58:53.640
It was awesome.

58:53.640 --> 58:56.640
Because basically this chick likes to watch guys make out in the park.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.640
Gee, you know...

58:58.640 --> 59:00.640
I have a problem with that.

59:00.640 --> 59:03.640
A lot of straight guys like to watch girls make out in the park.

59:03.640 --> 59:06.640
Like, hello, cruel intentions.

59:06.640 --> 59:07.640
Why not?

59:07.640 --> 59:11.640
Some girls like to watch girls make out in the park.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.640
La la la la.

59:13.640 --> 59:15.640
Innocent, innocent.

59:15.640 --> 59:17.640
Anyway.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.640
How about different stuff?

59:19.640 --> 59:21.640
Yes, how about different stuff?

59:21.640 --> 59:25.640
Well, there is a game that's called Beyond Good and Evil.

59:25.640 --> 59:26.640
Ooh.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.640
And it's getting a sequel.

59:28.640 --> 59:29.640
Ooh.

59:29.640 --> 59:36.640
And it's inspired by the Trade Center airplane bombing thing.

59:36.640 --> 59:43.640
And I refuse to refer to the event by the date because I think that's fucking retarded.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.640
You can just refer to it as Loki's 21st birthday.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.640
Okay, it happened on Loki's 21st birthday.

59:48.640 --> 59:51.640
So when Loki was getting, what, liquor or something?

59:51.640 --> 59:53.640
Eating steak at a steakhouse.

59:53.640 --> 59:54.640
That was empty.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
Okay.

59:55.640 --> 01:00:02.640
But at any rate, the game is supposed to be based off of that.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:13.640
They're saying that that day's event actually gave across the same type of element of fear

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.640
that he was looking for in the game.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:26.640
And so he's going to incorporate that same sense, that same emotional sense into the sequel.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.640
But he also, though, tried to compare it to Zelda.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.640
Saying that...

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640
Oh, come on.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:42.640
Saying that they're good games but out of time.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640
And I'm like...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640
Is that like Majora's Mask?

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:55.640
No, it just means that there's people who like happy and some people who like to play fucking depressing stuff.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.640
I had...

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.640
Braid, in a way, was depressing to me.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.640
Like, I don't know. There's definitely depressing games out there.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.640
All the Silent Hill games are pretty depressing, too.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640
God, they're fantastic.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.640
I actually think that the UFO endings on Silent Hill are more depressing.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.640
I have really yet to play that game that makes me want to eat an entire canister of ice cream, though.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.640
Like, you know, getting that depressed.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.640
Like watching a Lifetime movie or one of Steel Magnolias or something.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.640
I have yet to really see the video game equivalent of that.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.640
Well, the only problem I have with games like that that'll be about an actual horrifying event like that.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.640
Or even the World War II games is the people who, when they play those games, are like,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.640
"'Cause I'm showing respect to the event and I'm remembering it. Nah."

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.640
And I'm like, "'Cause you're sitting on your ass in your living room on a couch pressing buttons."

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.640
So I'm like, that's the only...

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.640
But, you know, it could be a good game. I don't know.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.640
I... You know what? I have to say, and I'm just gonna leave it here, and yes, it was incredibly awful,

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.640
but making a big to-do about that is actually just perpetuating fear.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.640
We just need to go back to business as usual.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.640
It kinda seems like this person's reaching for buzzwords that are gonna catch people's attention.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640
I'm thinking...

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640
That's the impression I get.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:20.640
I can understand trying to evoke an emotion, and I understand that was a very particularly...

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.640
Well, for lack of a better description, that was definitely a unique sort of feeling, you know?

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.640
The combination of gutted and really numb, I would think.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.640
And I can understand someone trying to evoke an emotion that is that unique,

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.640
but at the same time, don't drag that into it. Just fucking drop it.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:48.640
I gotta say, going to the depressing games topic, which is kinda open to thing in chat here,

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.640
I gotta say this. Kitsune says, Lost Odyssey made me sad.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.640
It's very depressing, but it's a good game. That's a good point.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.640
Lost Odyssey was really, really sad. That was a really good story, too.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.640
That was a horrifically-underlooked game by a lot of people.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.640
You know what? Another game had a really depressing ending?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640
Hmm.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640
Klonoa.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640
Really? I never played that to completion.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.640
The game is, you start it off, it's all cutesy happy, cutesy happy.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.640
Get towards the end of the game. Oh my god!

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.640
Wind Waker also said.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.640
Really? I didn't really play enough of it.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.640
No, I thought it was. I was like, I've been playing this game for 15 years,

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640
and then this is what happens to the kingdom?

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.640
Okay. I don't want to get a depressing show, so let's go back to LoL RuPaul for a minute here, okay?

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640
Apparently we have a friend at Sony that listens to the show,

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.640
and they're gonna email some people about the RuPaul game and making it happen.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.640
So, god bless you. You are a public servant of the people.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.640
You are a brave man, so best of luck with that.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.640
It better have the word fierce in the title.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.640
That's right.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.640
And it better not be soccer practice.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.640
God bless you, sir. God bless you. I hope it happens.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.640
If they need input of any sort, please give them my email.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640
Also, I want to point this out.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640
SSJ100Matt made a good point.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.640
Rob, seriously, keep wishing, because last time you did that, they made SingStar Abba.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640
This is true.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.640
What if they did SingStar RuPaul?

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.640
I don't think that would work as much.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.640
You could sing Back to My Roots, which is actually...

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.640
Okay, that song is a guilty pleasure for me.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.640
No, I don't think I'd want an entire SingStar game out of RuPaul,

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.640
but I think they could make a party game out of drag races.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.640
That would be totally great.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.640
I think they could. RuPaul's Fierce Drag Race.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.640
ZakuPilot256, there's the name right there.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.640
It's got to have fierce in the title.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640
That's right.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.640
Most Fiercest.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.640
It just has to be...

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.640
This game is fierce, just buy it.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640
The end.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.640
The title should just be This Game is Fierce.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.640
Alright, Lord Almighty, let's get past the RuPaul thing.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.640
I'm so sorry to our listeners.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640
I know it's my fault, but I neglected the chat.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640
Candy!

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640
I was laughing so hard, I couldn't see the chat,

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.640
so I just went back and caught up on it and wanted to mention that.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640
Sorry.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.640
Anyways, so there's a rumor going around that Mortal Kombat,

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640
the team that's working at least on Mortal Kombat,

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.640
is trying to leave Midway.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.640
I guess that's kind of like rats escaping a sinking ship.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.640
So they're looking for new developers.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.640
Yay.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.640
Probably going to buy them up.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.640
I can totally see that happening.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.640
It'd be hilarious if Capcom bought them up.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.640
That would be cool.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.640
Actually, that would be all kinds of strange,

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.640
because you know there would be that inevitable

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.640
Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat game,

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640
and that's just going to really weird a lot of people out.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.640
That's going to be creepy.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.640
That's going to be like when Sonic and Mario started showing up in the same place.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.640
I have a feeling if they were ever going to leave Midway,

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.640
which I doubt that they will,

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640
but if they were, EA would probably buy them up,

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.640
because EA likes to snatch up properties like that,

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.640
and they've got enough money to throw around.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.640
So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.640
Because, you know, EA needs a good fighting game franchise,

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:03.640
because that Marvel game that they put out sucked.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.640
Did they do DC and Marvel?

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.640
Midway did.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.640
No, it was Marvel vs. DC. Never mind, I'm stupid.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.640
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, yeah.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.640
EA did Marvel Ultimate Alliance, right?

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.640
No, that was Activision.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.640
EA did Rise of the Imperfects or something like that.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.640
Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer? No, it wasn't Silver Surfer.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.640
No, Silver Surfer was also Activision.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.640
Yeah, they did the Rise of the Imperfects game,

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.640
which is so ironic that they had Imperfect in the title,

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:40.640
but yes, it was not very good.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.640
But, yeah, so we'll see if this actually happens.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.640
I don't know.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.640
I just have a feeling that Midway wouldn't part with the Mortal Kombat team that quick.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.640
I mean, because if they do that, what does Midway have left?

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.640
I mean, nothing.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Not a lot of good stuff, at least.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.640
Unreal Tournament, I guess? I don't know.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640
Eh, I don't know.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.640
They're just in financial struggle right now, but I just, I don't know.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640
We'll see.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.640
Well, I'm going to pull up a video here in studio,

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.640
and I apologize you guys can't see this on the radio,

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.640
but what's interesting about this, this is an Unreal...

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640
Whoa, hello.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.640
This is Unreal Tournament, but it's a Sonic the Hedgehog level

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.640
using the Unreal engine.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.640
This is gorgeous.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.640
I apologize for the volume. Good lord.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640
Let's see if we can turn that down.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
There we go.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640
Oh, my God.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.640
This is kind of interesting.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640
It looks a little bit like Smash Brothers.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640
It does kind of look like Smash Brothers.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.640
There's giant lasers and lots of blood.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640
Very interesting level.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.640
Somebody spent a lot of time on that, that's for sure.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.640
They did something similar with, like, Legos and stuff before.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.640
They had Lego maps and stuff, mods.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640
What's cool about stuff like this is, you know,

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.640
a member of the PC mods do work on the PlayStation 3 version,

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.640
so you can actually get this for the PlayStation 3 as well.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.640
All right.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.640
Enough of that background noise there from the game.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640
Question for you, though.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.640
Which types of mods have you really been into for that?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.640
I'm not an Unreal Tournament player, so I can tell you.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640
No, I'm not.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.640
Well, what about, like, you know how they did with Quake?

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.640
Because, you know, there's a lot of Quake.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640
Oh, I love the Quake mods.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640
I love Kujo and the grappling hook,

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.640
because I'd be used to the grapples with the ceiling.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.640
Yeah, the grappling hook was awesome in Quake.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.640
That was a completely, like, user-done mod.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.640
That changed the game significantly.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.640
Yeah, I'd grappling hook to the ceiling and drop Kujo down

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.640
and have Kujo attack people, because it was awesome.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.640
Oh, there's one that I like.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.640
Hmm.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640
The cube mod.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.640
Like the movie?

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640
Yeah, like the movie.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.640
For Quake?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.640
Yeah.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.640
Wow.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640
Because Quake's kind of old.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640
Well, not for Quake, but for one of the later...

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640
Oh, okay.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.640
Yeah.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.640
They did a cube mod, and someone tried to do a hypercube one,

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.640
where it would randomly regenerate the room.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.640
By the way, I don't mean to bring the Saw topic back up,

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.640
but Cube is a very good example of what's more of, like,

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.640
Cube's a very gory movie.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.640
The first one especially is extremely gory.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640
I haven't seen the later ones, so I can't really speak for them.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640
The second one's kind of.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.640
But more psychological.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
Yes.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.640
Very psychological, very intellectual type of movie.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.640
Kind of just a good thing to kind of compare.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.640
We're talking about this whole psychological thrill versus blood orgy.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.640
My whole point between that is that I don't really want to see people put into situations

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.640
where they are forced to kill slash maim themselves or each other

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.640
to get out of the situation because of something someone else perceives they did,

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640
or they might have done.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.640
The cube, I think, is that you're putting the people together,

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.640
and they can either work together or they can kill each other.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.640
And hypercube, they can just go crazy because time is freaking out.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.640
I totally, I just want to say, I support you.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.640
I cannot stand the Saw movies.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.640
I'm like, because I saw part of one of them,

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640
and the guy basically thinks he's helping them out by doing this.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.640
Yeah.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.640
And I'm like, dude, no.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.640
I actually just went on Wikipedia to read the premise again.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.640
And for me, I'm always the type of person that tries to get my brain into the character.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.640
And that's something that just gives me a headache thinking about.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640
All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to open a can of worms.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640
I just wanted to mention that real quick.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640
Well, I will also say another defense.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640
How about those dolphins?

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.640
I will say another defense about that versus cube,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.640
is that cube, you don't technically have an antagonist.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640
Technically.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.640
You have the situation as your antagonist.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.640
All right, let's move on. More gaming news. I'm sorry.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.640
Dude, gotta.

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.640
We want to get to the break and then get to part B.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.640
It looks like we might do a list list after all tonight.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.640
And I know we had talked about a topic before the show about doing the, what was it,

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.640
trick we would most want to see in Excitebots.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640
But I think I might have a better idea.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.640
Let's do two.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.640
What about this?

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640
How about this for an idea for tonight's list list?

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640
And maybe chat can give their input.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.640
And if they have topic ideas, they can do that too.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.640
What the DSI most needed in it to get me to buy one.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.640
Feature that the DSI needed the most to get me to buy one.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640
Hmm.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640
That might be a good one.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640
Very topical. Think about it.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640
Hmm.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
All right, we'll see.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
Is it topical like an ointment?

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.640
All right, we'll see. Maybe the chat room has some better ideas.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.640
If you have an idea for tonight's list list, let's send it over.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.640
Well, we have some.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640
I got your joke. I got it.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.640
I just didn't laugh.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.640
Love ya.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.640
Well, guess who I think is awesome?

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.640
Me.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640
Er.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.640
Um.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.640
Steve Weeby.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.640
Oh, he's pretty cool.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.640
For anyone who hasn't seen King of Kong,

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.640
the movie is pretty much about him.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640
Steve Weeby.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.640
He's the guy who's trying to beat the big bastard Billy Mitchell,

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.640
who was the guy who had the Twin Galaxies highest score at Donkey Kong.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.640
And Steve Weeby, he was just a really nice guy who thought he could do a better job,

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640
and he beat the score.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.640
And it turns out Billy Mitchell's a cock,

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.640
and sent in a videotape instead of coming in and doing it himself,

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.640
of him topping a million, over a million points on Donkey Kong.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640
Um.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.640
So, Steve Weeby's going to be at E3.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640
And that is reason enough for me to go.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640
I want to witness this.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640
Here's what's interesting, though.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640
They did the same thing at E for All.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.640
And to be fair to our, I guess you could say, you know, I don't know what to call it.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.640
It's not really parent company, because we own ourselves.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.640
But, you know, the company that enables us to do this live for you all every Sunday night,

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.640
All Games had a ginormous booth at E for All.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.640
They had Steve Weeby there trying to break the score for Donkey Kong,

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.640
so it's kind of been there, done that.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.640
So it's just interesting that now people seem to care because it's E3 and not E for All.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.640
Which, you know, I get.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.640
This is going to have far more people.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.640
Yeah, but I also, nothing would have gotten me to go to E for All, I think.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640
Nothing.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.640
E for All, to me, was just a ginormous waste of time,

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.640
and I could have slept, or done my laundry,

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.640
or, you know, washed dirty dishes with my tongue.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.640
It just looked better on paper, I think.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.640
It was one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.640
At any rate, this is funny because even the guys at Twin Galaxies

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.640
were just saying that it was completely awful of Billy Mitchell,

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640
and he's just such a dick.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640
Oh my God, he's such a dick.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640
I don't like him.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.640
Anyway, the other cool thing, though, is that with the two of them,

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.640
I think, I don't exactly agree with how my source says it,

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.640
because there have been other people who have hit the Donkey Kong kill screen,

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.640
but I think that those two are the only ones who have done it in a live event.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.640
But the kill screen is basically after you pay so many levels of Donkey Kong,

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640
it'll just stop.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640
It won't work anymore.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640
It'll just be game over.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.640
It doesn't care how many extra lives you have or what your score is or anything.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.640
It's just like, ugh, I'm dead.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640
Seriously.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.640
Mario will be running around, freeze, dead.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640
Don't they show it in the movie?

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640
Don't they show it in the movie?

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640
Yeah, they show it.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.640
But I've seen someone do it.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.640
When?

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640
A long time ago.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640
Huh.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.640
I had to have been like 11.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640
Interesting.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640
And apparently, it was at Godfather's Pizza.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.640
It seems to be one of those people who just didn't care.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.640
Because we also had, I don't think I was that young.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.640
I think I was a little older than that because we had one of the Mario machines,

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.640
the Nintendo arcade.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640
I bet there are a lot of people out there that could do it and just don't,

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.640
they don't want to get in the scene.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640
You know what I mean?

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640
They do it for themselves.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640
I ask him if it broke.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640
If he broke the machine, he's like, yeah, I broke the machine.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.640
And that's all I remember until I saw the movie.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:43.640
But anyway, I really, I really, really would like to see him do it.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.640
And I would love to be there when it happens.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.640
I think it would be fantastic.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.640
And that, and I would like to see what Billy Mitchell does about it,

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.640
just because he's a dick and I'm enjoying,

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.640
I'm kind of enjoying the drama a little bit, even though it's kind of stupid.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.640
If he does, I will self-fornicate into my trousers.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640
Can we put it on the internet?

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.640
Can we broadcast that live on G4?

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640
Yes, yes.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.640
Immediately following, immediately following,

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.640
Steve, we'll be breaking the record live on G4.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.640
We'll be live on G4, the doctor self-fornicating into his pants.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.640
Trousers, all right, into his trousers.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.640
He might not be wearing pants.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.640
He might just be wearing the trousers.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.640
AcidicVampire in chat says, I'd go to see Billy's flowing hair.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.640
I don't think he's going to be there at E3.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.640
All right, look, let's move on.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
Maybe he will.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640
I don't know.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640
I'm a little low for the drama.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640
It was just a movie, people.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640
It was just a movie.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.640
GS68 makes the best point, and immediately thereafter,

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.640
Billy Mitchell posts his new record on YouTube.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.640
All right, look, a couple more news stories,

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640
and we've got to take a break.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640
Yes.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.640
So this is kind of funny.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.640
For April Fool's Day, Bethesda decided

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.640
that they're going to go ahead and kind of do

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640
a half-price sale on all the download content for Oblivion,

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.640
which is pretty cool, except there's a catch.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.640
Horse Armor, they decided, you know what?

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.640
Horse Armor's awesome.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.640
We're going to double the price of that, just to be funny.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.640
To which I say nay.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.640
I say nay.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.640
And after that, he goes, hey.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.640
OK, I had to throw that in.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.640
I think this is their form of an April Fool's joke.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.640
Like, not that it's a joke.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.640
Like, it actually happened.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640
Yeah, it actually happened.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.640
But I think it's like an April Fool's joke still.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.640
You know what I mean?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.640
Like, it was what they did in celebration of April Fool's

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.640
Day.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.640
Because everyone realizes that, you know,

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.640
and including them that Horse Armor is ridiculous.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.640
Yeah, I think even Bethesda realized, OK, you got us.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640
Horse Armor was pretty dumb.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.640
But people still buy it.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.640
Yeah, people still buy it.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.640
I bet there's people that bought it with the double price.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.640
And it doesn't make Oblivion a bad game by any means,

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640
because Oblivion is one of the best games they've

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.640
made in many, many years.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.640
And I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.640
Like, Elder Scrolls V will make me

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.640
self-fornicate in my trousers, I hope.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.640
Because if it doesn't, I'm going to be very disappointed.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:18.640
Feature net guaranteed.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640
All right.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.640
Look, last week we brought you a story

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.640
about a man who was suing Microsoft and Lionhead

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.640
over reports that he was being harassed because he was gay.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640
You might remember about this.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.640
Apparently, we're not going to get

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.640
to see the drama unfold in the courtroom,

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.640
because there has been a settlement.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
Likely didn't think that would happen.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.640
The case has been settled out of court.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.640
Microsoft has released a very brief statement.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640
And guess what?

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
This is all you're going to hear on it,

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.640
because usually with these settlements come gag orders.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.640
Microsoft says, we are pleased to have

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.640
reached a makeable resolution to this matter with Mr. Durant.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.640
The terms of the settlement are confidential,

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.640
but we can confirm that Mr. Durant will not

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.640
continue his employment at Lionhead

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.640
as part of the agreement.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.640
That's probably what he got for taking his case to the media.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.640
But hey, it sounds like everybody got what they wanted.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.640
Isn't Bill Gates gay?

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.640
No, he's a wife, dummy.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640
He's still gay.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.640
Like, oh, get my stuff.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.640
Oh, shut.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640
All right.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640
So there you go.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.640
Follow up to last week, to be fair.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.640
We wanted to follow up on that.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.640
It's kind of, we'll never know the real answer

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.640
because of the settlement, but that's life.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.640
All right, let's get into a segment

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.640
we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.640
It's called the classic video game of the week.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.640
And as part of this segment,

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.640
Dark Sakura will dig into her archive of classic gaming

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.640
and find a title that she believes you all should be checking out.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.640
She's been doing this quite a while now.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.640
We have, like, over a year's worth of games

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.640
that they're tracking on the OLR Wikipedia,

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.640
which you can get to at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.640
and go to that little thing that says,

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.640
the little box in the corner with all the pictures

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.640
that has the big W in it,

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.640
and that's how you get to the Wiki on Wikia.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.640
I can't remember the name of the box.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640
Extended play.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640
That's it.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640
Had a brain fart.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640
All right, anyhow, what is the classic game of the week this week, Dark Sakura?

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.640
The classic game of the week is Incredible Crisis.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.640
That game is crack.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640
And by crack, I mean crack.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.640
Welcome to Incredible Crisis.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.640
This is a game that came out on the PlayStation.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.640
And...

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.640
Incredible Crisis with puppies.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:34.640
The game is about playing in a day in the family member's lives,

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.640
the main character being Taneo.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.640
And they're trying to get everyone home early today

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.640
for Grandmother Haruko's birthday.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.640
And this game very much is a parody of daily Japanese life.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.640
This game is incredibly what the fuck.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.640
For real. For real.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.640
I can't think of many more WTF games that have ever been made.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.640
I'll let Jamie explain.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.640
Then I'll give my comment.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.640
I'll say the music in the game if you'll listen to a little bit of it.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.640
They're dancing, by the way, in the office.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640
I think that's not a good point.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.640
It's done by the Tokyo Scott Paradise Orchestra.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.640
So it's good music.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.640
I love them.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.640
So basically the way that this goes is you have a bunch of minigames

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.640
where you're playing through people's lives and it's sort of sequential.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.640
Taneo, for example, this scene is him at work.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640
And they are dancing to relieve stress.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.640
However, you've got this head meter

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.640
and just the redder and more full that it gets.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.640
Finally his brain just explodes and he stresses out completely and freaks out.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:57.640
So the way that it goes is that the main character is getting out of work

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:06.640
and he's attacked and has to get away from a boulder that's chasing after him.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.640
And then the emergency crew straps him to a stretcher and send him into traffic.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.640
So it's one of the minigames that's having to dodge traffic on a stretcher like a luge.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:25.640
And then he meets this pretty lady and makes out with her in a Ferris wheel.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:30.640
And so it's totally like, Rob, if you'll skip up to just a little bit further.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640
Any bit.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640
There it is.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640
This is it.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640
There.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:49.640
Wow.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:55.640
She tells you how to position yourself for the major boink action.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:02.640
Well, technically the translation says he's giving an erotic back massage.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640
No.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:09.640
Dude, they're doing it on a Ferris wheel.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640
Exactly.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640
And there's fireworks.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.640
I don't think that's a back massage because that's not how we roll.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:20.640
DJ Tyrant says, I jizzed in my pantsu.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:27.640
I'll see you play as Etsuko who is the mother and she's out trying to buy stuff for Haruko's birthday

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.640
and she has to go to the bank and it's being robbed.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.640
And just all this crap is happening to this family.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:42.640
So the last one is about the little boy Tsuyoshi and more weird stuff.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.640
He's like turned into an ant or something or shrunk to ant size.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.640
It's like the game's just freaking bizarre.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:55.640
It's so much weird crap this family has to go through all for the sake of getting home early.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:01.640
You know, have a birthday party.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.640
There are 24 mini games.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.640
Some of them do repeat and it only is a one player game, but it doesn't.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.640
It can still count as a party because really it's better to pass it around.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640
It's a lot of fun.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640
This game looks amazing.

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.640
What the fuck was I thinking?

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.640
I remember renting this game years ago and not liking it.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.640
But granted, it was during a period of my life where I didn't play a lot of video games.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.640
Admittedly, it was when I was in college and pretty much all I played was Final Fantasy 7 and Puzzle Fighter.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.640
And I remember renting this game and going, what the fuck?

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.640
But now I would have an appreciation for the WTF factor.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.640
And I'm a little disappointed.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.640
I don't think it's available on the PlayStation 3 download library.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.640
But seeing that Ferris wheel level, I'm kind of not surprised.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640
You can borrow mine if you want to.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640
Cool.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.640
Because I have a goal this month to pick all games that I own.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640
Which isn't hard.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.640
But also there were two mini games that actually were left out of the game.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.640
Because they were very kanji intensive so they couldn't translate them.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.640
It would have been for him...

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.640
It was very difficult to translate.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.640
To actually translate the play of the game into it because of the way it involved the kanji.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.640
But one of them was...

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.640
Involved the daughter and the family singing karaoke.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.640
Which I think would have been fun.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.640
But it's a pretty cool little game.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.640
Deathwishing in chat says, seriously man, I wanted to break a brick over my head after I played this.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640
It freaked me the fuck out.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.640
It was like taking acid smoking crackpot and then spinning around in a wash cycle.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.640
And actually if you want to know...

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.640
I'll link this in the chat room.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.640
But if you want to know a little bit about part of the problem that went into translating the game.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:49.640
Or just stuff that goes into translating and localizing games.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.640
There's an article and it's from last April actually.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.640
It's called The Art of Translating Video Games.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:03.640
And I will link that in the chat room for people to see if they're interested in it.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.640
It's a pretty cool little article.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.640
Alright, well that's going to do it.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.640
Your classic video game of the week, Incredible Crisis.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640
Good pick DarkSakura.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.640
This is one I kind of forgot about but what a WTF kind of game.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.640
Oh, it really is, isn't it?

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.640
I love the game.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.640
I mean, I think it's crazy, crazy crack.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.640
This is exactly what the classic game of the week should be.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.640
One of those games that you kind of forget about but you need to go back and say, wow, that game was like fucking nuts.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.640
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Launch Radio.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.640
But stay tuned guys, we have plenty more to come here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.640
Tonight's part B. We're going to do a listless game.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640
I didn't see a lot of topics submitted in chat.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.640
Although, to be honest, I kind of missed a bunch of stuff when they were doing Incredible Crisis.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.640
So what do you want to do? Do you want to do the Excitebots thing or do you want to do the DSi thing? What do you think?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.640
I have zero preference.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.640
Zero preference? I don't know.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.640
I'd like to do what kind of flavor does Jamie want for pie.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.640
I don't think that's going to work.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.640
Let's see how creative we can get making up a trick.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.640
Alright, you want to do the Excitebots one?

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.640
No, I want to do the DSi one.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.640
Okay, I think the DSi one is a little more open and topical. So we'll do the DSi.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640
We'll do the Excitebots one when the Excitebot comes out.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.640
Okay, so DSi, feature we most want or wish...

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.640
No, how do we phrase this?

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.640
Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it yesterday or today.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Okay.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.640
Feature the DSi should have had that would have made me buy it today.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.640
Because none of us bought it, right?

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.640
Okay, but if it had this feature, I would have.

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640
So there you go.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Alright, we're going to answer that question and do plenty more here on Orange Lounge Radio, such as talking about Blizzard Entertainment and a possible interesting franchise they could be doing.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.640
As well as a Silent Hill game on the Wii.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640
Wii!

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.640
We're going to talk all about that when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:27:01.640
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, April the 5th of 2009.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.640
We're taping live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.640
It's about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.640
Join us for live taping, why don't you?

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.640
I'm sure you don't have anything better to do on a Sunday night.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.640
There's nothing on TV, right?

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.640
Anyhow, Loki's here in studio, of course. He's playing through Ninja Blade.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.640
So if you are joining us on this Sunday evening, check it out on Justin TV.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.640
Dark Sakura's with us as well.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.640
You guys are with us in our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, and on the Skype line a little later in the show.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.640
We'll be taking your calls and also playing listless a little later as well.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.640
But we still have some news to get to, and Loki's going to start us off in this Part B with some news.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.640
Yes, there's some interesting rumors coming out.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.640
Well, actually, I'm getting ahead of myself here.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.640
The rumor is that apparently the Lips mic is going to be good for things other than Lips.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.640
And starting things off, Guitar Hero Metallica actually has support for the Lips mics.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:06.640
And apparently, Rock Band 2 will be getting a patch sometime this summer that will also add support for the shiny mics.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.640
Because, you know, nothing screams Metallica likes sparkles on the mics.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.640
I don't know. I don't understand why you need it to be supported.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.640
I mean, I would think if people, you know, have Guitar Hero Metallica, most people probably already have World Tour.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:27.640
So, you know, I don't know.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.640
But hey, support for stuff is always good.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.640
Well, plus the Lips mark is sparkly, you know, and all that.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.640
So, you know, who doesn't like sparkles?

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.640
Me.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.640
Oh, good point. The Lips mics are also wireless, says ZachDeft in chat.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640
That's true. That's pretty good.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.640
Isn't there a third-party wireless mic too, though?

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.640
Um, I don't know.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.640
You know, I've never played the Lips games.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.640
I'm just kind of burned out on the karaoke games.

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.640
Between the Rock Band, between SingStar, ABBA, and the other SingStar stuff that's available on PS3,

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.640
I kind of didn't want to get Lips because I don't need another one.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.640
You know, SingStars, as far as karaoke games go, SingStar is rock solid enough, you know?

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.640
Lips kind of was late to the party, if that makes sense.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:14.640
Also, possibly late to the party, a revival of Redneck Rampage?

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.640
Now, here's one of those things I look at and I go,

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.640
surely this is an April Fool's joke, but I...

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.640
I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at the...

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640
Redneck Rampage is pretty freaking funny.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.640
So it's a game about my hometown?

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.640
I think it's stupid. I think it's one of the stupidest video games I've ever seen.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.640
Like, I realize it's supposed to be a parody, but WTF.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.640
But, okay, wait, I'm not done yet.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.640
But apparently this story broke on, like, the 4th of April or whatever, but here we go.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.640
Blizzard, apparently there's a rumor that Blizzard Entertainment

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.640
actually has the Redneck Rampage brand right now.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.640
And apparently this is some research done by a website called INC Gamers.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.640
They were doing some trademark following or what have you.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.640
And apparently Redneck Rampage was originally trademarked in 97,

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.640
then Redneck Rampage rides again.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Redneck Rampage sucking grits on Route 66.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.640
Yes, that was really the name of apparently the 3rd game that was made.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.640
They are apparently all now under Blizzard's control.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.640
So Blizzard apparently owns the rights to, you know, these games.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.640
And I don't know, is that through, like, acquisitions and things like that? Who knows.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.640
But, yeah, and apparently, you know, Activision actually acquired the Redneck Rampage thing.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.640
But why would it then be given to Blizzard and not Activision?

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.640
Don't know.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.640
But apparently there are some Blizzard folks on staff who actually worked on the original Redneck Rampage.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.640
I hope to hell this doesn't mean they're making a new one.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.640
I mean, talk about unnecessary, unnecessarys.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.640
X-Link in chat suggests Redneck for the iPhone.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.640
You know what? I would rather it be something like that.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.640
And DJ Tyrant said Blizzard isn't this stupid, are they?

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640
And hopefully not.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.640
DJ Tyrant, maybe it's something that's a nod to those employees who were there that worked on the game.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.640
I don't know.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.640
But let's just hope it's just an interesting observation and nothing more.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.640
I don't know, DarkSakura, would you buy a new Redneck Rampage?

01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:00.640
Would I buy it? No.

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.640
Would I buy it? Yes. Definitely.

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:07.640
I'll tell you what I'd buy. A new Hexic. Or Hexen.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.640
Hexen!

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.640
Those games were pretty awesome.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.640
Heck yeah, I love Hexen.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.640
Anyhow.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.640
That game was awesome, though.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.640
What, Redneck Rampage?

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:21.640
It was using the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D, but it had more features for it.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.640
How about they just bring us Duke Nukem Forever?

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.640
Yeah, Hexen uses the same engine as Quake, right?

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.640
Yeah.

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.640
And it was awesome.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.640
I just like turning people into chickens.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:49.640
Well, as we covered on our last show, we're actually supposed to be getting those arcade games coming out for the Wii service.

01:31:49.640 --> 01:32:00.640
Well, Sega is also taking a step to put actual arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade a lot more than what we've been seeing lately.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:08.640
We're getting, and this makes my heart soar, Virtualon or Tariotangrim.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.640
I don't have to figure out my Dreamcast to play it, except I have twin sticks.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.640
So it's better to play it on the Dreamcast, but I digress.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:23.640
There's release ratings for Shinobi and Altered Beast.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:27.640
So that means System 16 will be getting some of those.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.640
That's cool.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.640
Also, there is one that's rumored as a Sega Vintage Collection Volume 2.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:44.640
And there's also other Genesis titles listed as Comic Zone, Sonic 3, Gunstar Heroes, and Phantasy Star 2.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.640
Gunstar Heroes, of course, being one of the best Sega games ever.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.640
Now, Comic Zone was already on the Virtual Console, though.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.640
This is a Virtual Console. This is Live Arcade.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640
I thought you said for the Wii.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:02.640
I started off with the Wii because we had talked about Sega arcade games coming out on Wii.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:09.640
To recap, last week on Orange Challenge Radio, Rob ate a live frog.

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:16.640
And Loki's head exploded, leaving Jamie as the victor in Battle Royale Orange Challenge Edition.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:24.640
Anyway, of course, you know, really you can play a lot of those on the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640
Not Outrun, though.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640
Shinobi Arcade.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.640
Not Outrun. Surprisingly absent from the collection.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.640
Did you know that Yuji Naka officially retired?

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.640
I did hear that this week, actually.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.640
I don't think it made our show roll for whatever reason, but I did hear that news.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.640
Dan got to meet him.

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.640
Cool.

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.640
At E3! One year.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.640
Isn't it random how you'll just run into people that you just totally adore for their video game creations at E3?

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.640
I got my hug on with not Koji Kondo, the other, Igarashi.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640
I got a picture with a Kiriyamaoka. That was the thing.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640
I would hump him.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.640
Which E3 is not supposed to be about fanboy moments, but look.

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.640
Yes, it is.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.640
Here's the thing.

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:06.640
In defense, look, I realize E3 is supposed to be a trade event only open to journalists and people in the media.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.640
Here's the thing. A good game journalist is a little bit fanboy.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640
Little bit.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.640
They need to be fair, but I think a good game, you have to have a passion for video games.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.640
And you have to have your obvious favors and things like that.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.640
So I completely justify my, you know, screaming like a little 12 year old girl when I saw a Kiriyamaoka, okay?

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.640
So there you go.

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.640
That, he's also, it doesn't hurt that he's really good looking.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.640
Aww, Black Wolf and DJ Tyrant both in chat said, I met Rob Roberts at E3.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.640
Aww.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.640
Yeah.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.640
No, we said celebrities.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.640
We're internet celebrities.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.640
Black Wolf said, I totally squeed with fanboy delight when I met Rob Roberts.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.640
He did actually.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.640
I have yet to meet Rob Roberts, just so you guys know.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.640
We did the whole, oh my god, oh my god.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.640
I totally blush with embarrassment after running into Hideo Kojima.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.640
Like three E3s in a row.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.640
I don't know how this happens.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:06.640
If it happens again this year, I'm gonna just go off and cry, or tell him to give me a job.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.640
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.640
Let's stop talking about E3 and who we may or may not see at E3 this year.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.640
So, this is kind of weird, I guess.

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:24.640
Last week we talked about how File Front was going away, and, you know, oh darn.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.640
But, apparently, it's back.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:35.640
And, it says File Front has been acquired by the original founders of the site, and will not be suspended as previously announced.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.640
This is not an April Fools joke.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.640
And, that's funny.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.640
So, what once was dead is now back.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.640
Well, congratulations to the folks at File Front for inserting a coin to continue.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.640
Congratulations.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.640
That's all it took, right?

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.640
And, in other news, EGM is coming back.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.640
Oh wait, no, that's not true.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.640
April Fools.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.640
Alright.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.640
That would have been a great, like, EGM yearly joke, right?

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.640
Because they used to do these epic April Fools jokes every year.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.640
Like, you know, remember Ermac in Mortal Kombat was born of an EGM April Fools joke?

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.640
That could have been their epic joke this year, that they're coming back.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.640
And then, aw, April Fools, it's a joke.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.640
That would have been insulting for their fan base, yes.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.640
Alright.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.640
Not an April Fools joke.

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:29.640
When this news broke on April Fools Day, a lot of us were like, is this an April Fools joke?

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.640
Apparently, it's not.

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.640
It was announced that there is a Silent Hill game coming out for the Wii.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:37.640
It's called Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640
Here's the thing.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.640
It's a remake, sort of, of the first game, but they don't want you to call it a remake of the first game.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.640
It's a reimagining of the first game.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.640
Which, you know, means Boohoo, no Pyramid Head, but at the same time...

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.640
The first game didn't have Pyramid Head.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.640
Right, Boohoo, no Pyramid Head.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.640
But the first game was pretty fucking phenomenal.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:58.640
And a lot of people still say it was probably the best game in the series.

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:03.640
So, you know, definitely going to be a must-have for Silent Hill fans.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.640
And a quote from the magazine where this originally appeared, Nintendo Power.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.640
The characters play different roles.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.640
Things don't necessarily happen in the same order.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.640
And the story is taken in lots of new directions.

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.640
You still play as Harry Mason.

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.640
You're still looking for your daughter.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.640
You don't see familiar elements, but they're all twisted to betray your expectations.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.640
So this is kind of cool because it sounds like maybe it's going to be fucking with what people are expecting in the game.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.640
Because they think it's going to be a remake.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.640
That's going to be kind of cool.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.640
So, apparently though, yes, they are going to exploit the Wii thing a little bit.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.640
They are going to use some of the Wii remote action.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.640
Some of the in-game puzzles will use Waggle in it.

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.640
You know, I heard...

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.640
Maybe I'm not supposed to repeat this, but I heard a long time ago...

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:54.640
Rumors that there were some tests being done in Konami of a Silent Hill type game where you would use the Wii mode as the flashlight as you were moving around.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.640
And doesn't that sound scary?

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.640
I hope that concept made it into this game somehow.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.640
I think that could be super creepy.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.640
Fantastic.

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:02.640
And pretty cool.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.640
If executed correctly. I mean, it could also be kind of dumb.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.640
And thank god, because they should have been doing this kind of stuff on the Wii since the beginning.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.640
So if they start doing that, great.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.640
Yeah.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:20.640
By the way, also, fans, you should know, part of the thing that bugged about the first Silent Hill game, that locked doors were everywhere.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.640
Now there will be a way through every locked door.

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.640
You will no longer have to find that most of the doors in the game are permanently shut.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.640
Sounds like it's going to be pretty awesome.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.640
So, I'm definitely looking forward to this.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.640
More information, at least.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.640
I bet this is going to be one of the big things we're going to see at E3.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.640
Or, Konami's having an event, if I remember right, this next week.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.640
I mean, we weren't invited, but they're doing the Saw thing, and I know they're showing that.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:50.640
I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up as well, along with your mandatory DDR and Yu-Gi-Oh for the year.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640
So, we'll see.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.640
And, oh yeah, don't forget Winning Eleven.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.640
All those games, you've got to get your mandatory entries for the year in there.

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.640
So, we'll see.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.640
Are you excited about the Silent Hill Wii make?

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.640
Yes.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.640
You're a clever one.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640
Alright.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:12.640
Rob made me go hee for a game on the Wii.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.640
Well, good. Let's hope there's more Wii-going Wii games later on.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.640
Do you think you might have one in this next story, Dark Sakura?

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.640
I might.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.640
Mm-hmm.

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.640
We can see.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.640
Mm-hmm.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.640
Because it's about Puyo Puyo.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.640
Oh, never mind then.

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:30.640
Oh, hush.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:37.640
There was, I don't know if you remember hearing about Project Ringo.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.640
There had been talk going around about it.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:49.640
It turns out that Project Ringo is a new Puyo Puyo game that's going to be on DS, Wii, and PSP.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:53.640
And, of course, we get it as Puyo Pop.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:40:01.640
And it will be technically it's just Puyo Puyo 7, which is more Puyo Puyo.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:08.640
But you also will have a transformation mode, which will let you actually deflect attacks,

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.640
instead of, I guess, just preventing them from happening, and have larger chain combos.

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.640
So, that would be pretty cool.

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:26.640
But there should be some, I would say, information on the Project Ringo site when it actually goes active.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640
Actually, I think it is active.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640
Yeah.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640
It is active as of the third.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.640
So, I'll link that into the chat room.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.640
But it's the same damn puzzle game you've played for the last, like, 20 years, right?

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640
Yeah.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640
It's more Puyo Puyo.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640
All right.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640
But, hey, if it's got online and you say something-

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.640
It's not Puyo Puyo!

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.640
Game guru being a butt.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640
All right.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.640
But you are a big fan of the Puyo Puyo series, so you'll probably buy this if no one-

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.640
I'm a big enough fan to pronounce it correctly.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.640
All right.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.640
Yes.

01:40:53.640 --> 01:41:02.640
And, I don't know, we kind of talked a little bit in Part A about the new, well, not really a new game,

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.640
but, you know, Tales of Vesperia coming to the PS3.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.640
Well, there is a new Tales game coming to the Wii as well, Tales of Graces.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.640
And it's been announced for the Wii thanks to Fumito Magazine.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.640
And it looks actually neat.

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:28.640
It's supposed to be, I don't know, similar to, I guess, the other Tales games as far as appearance goes.

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:37.640
They haven't really said, you know, what the game is about other than, you know, as an adventure protecting people.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.640
Or is it just waggle, waggle, waggle?

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.640
So the last Tales game that they put out was okay on the Wii.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.640
And then this is supposed to be coming out in Japan in the winter.

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.640
So I guess we'll see more about this later on.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.640
Well, some rumors are going around about upcoming Wii titles.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:03.640
There's apparently a list that was leaked to the internet this week showing an upcoming release date list of some various games coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.640
But here's the interesting thing. It dates Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort on July 10th.

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.640
It also dates, here's the other interesting thing, Wii Fit Plus on November 19th.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.640
Nintendo repackaging something and slapping Plus in front of it? No. You don't say.

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.640
Well, now here's something you should take though from this.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.640
And, you know, yes chatters, I am aware.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640
Apparently this list came out of the Netherlands.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.640
It wasn't actually from the US.

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.640
And, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.640
But I think most of us are looking at this going, Wii Fit Plus? Yeah, I can see that.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.640
And I can see that happening.

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.640
That's innovation for you.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.640
Well, but why, you know, why Nintendo should be leaking their release dates?

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.640
I don't know what the secrecy is. It's like, my god, we're not going to tell you.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:51.640
It's like, good god.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.640
Somebody might steal the idea to repackage something and add Plus to it.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.640
Oh, wait a second. Guilty Gear did it first.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.640
Well, doesn't, I mean, Loki, you kind of have an insider perspective on this.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.640
Don't sometimes the retailers and the folks on the inside have to know this a little sooner before the consumer?

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:11.640
Yes, because Nintendo's a bitch and they, other than providing horrible pricing on stuff,

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:16.640
they also require two months prior notice for as far as orders and stuff go.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.640
And then they tell you, oh, by the way, you're only getting 10% of that.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:27.640
So, yeah, something like this, I could see them, you know, positioning it as, you know, a big holiday title.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:33.640
You know, they're trying to basically, because Wii Fit, you know, it's still doing very well, it's still very hard to find,

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.640
and now we're going to have Wii Fit Plus.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.640
No, no, no, no. I saw a stack of Wiis at two different Best Buys this weekend.

01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.640
Wii Fit.

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640
Oh, sorry, Wii Fit. I've still seen that around, too.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.640
It's still, you'd be surprised, it's still hard to get from Nintendo.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.640
Same with Mario Kart. What the hell is up with Mario Kart? I don't get that either.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:59.640
But, for whatever reason, I could totally see this happening, you know, and it's going to be something stupid.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:05.640
I don't know if it's going to now support Wii Motion Plus for something, but I'm not buying it, that's for sure.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.640
Probably more crappy minigames. I mean, well, I shouldn't say that.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:13.640
You know, Wii Fit isn't bad, per se, it's just not for the hardcore gamer.

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.640
But there's definitely an audience for it. It's not a bad piece of software, let's put it that way.

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:30.640
But really, okay, let me put it this way. Is this what they're going to come, you know, is this what they're going to basically load their guns with for their E3 press conference?

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:38.640
Because if they're like, and you thought we forgot you, core gamer, Wii Fit Plus.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.640
Yeah, because right now it's looking like more of the same, and that's scary.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.640
Well, no, I actually think that the Motion Plus is going to be the big thing.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.640
But my concern is, because Nintendo is such a bitch about revealing things to people or telling them stuff,

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.640
I'm just afraid that they're going to alienate the developers and nobody's going to develop anything.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:45:00.640
You know, I think number one, they should have developed Wii, I mean the Wiimote should have had this extra sensor in it anyway.

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.640
But then I just think they're going to alienate the producers again and nobody's going to make good games for it.

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:12.640
Here's what's going to happen. They basically said, okay, how are we going to make money based on, you know, our previous history with stuff?

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.640
What's sold so far? Okay, let's look at it today.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:22.640
Okay, what's our number one selling product? Peripheral with game for, you know, like ten bucks more, okay?

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:28.640
So we tried that again with the Wii Zapper. Not quite, you know, where we needed to be, you know, it's peripheral with, you know, a game.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.640
But it still sold pretty well because of that.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:35.640
Now, okay, what else sells really well? Well, everyone buys a Wii system for Wii Sports.

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:40.640
Okay, there we go. We're going to do Wii Sports Resort. We're going to throw in something that people need to buy.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.640
So not only is it the Wii Sports angle, but it's also the Wii Play angle at the same time.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.640
Oh, and now we're going to do the same thing, you know, with Wii Fit.

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.640
We're going to do Wii Fit Plus. We're going to add some other new thing that people probably don't need.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.640
And then we're going to try to resell it again because people eat up Wii Fit and they want to buy a Wii system for Wii Fit.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.640
What about the Core Gamer? Oh, well, you get some ported GameCube games. Sweet.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:10.640
And then we get, you know, a version of Excite Truck, which has really been toned down kid-wise.

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.640
And I hear they removed the whole, you know, custom soundtrack thing, which sucks.

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.640
Why? Let's go step backwards, you know, as far as innovation goes.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:24.640
And I will bet you anything there will be multiple colored Wiimotes and people will piss themselves over it because I don't know why.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.640
Oh, I got to own a red remote now.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:34.640
I just have to disagree on the MotionPlus because for a lot of us that bought the Wii, we thought it was going to have one-to-one control from the beginning.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.640
And I still think it should have. I don't understand why they didn't just make the Wiimote with this extra.

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.640
And I've heard people, I've heard things online that say that it does add that one-to-one control and the possibilities are great.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.640
I just, I'm going to be pissed if Nintendo alienates all the producers again and doesn't actually, you know,

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:57.640
like I heard that LucasArts was upset because they weren't aware of this before they came out with their lightsaber game.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:02.640
Yeah, AlphaKananagram backing you up in chat says they already alienated the devs.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.640
That lightsaber game and the game using the lightsaber, the devs were pissed.

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.640
And sure enough, what does Wii Sports Resort have? Like a fencing game that is, it's fucking lightsabers.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.640
And so I think that the potential is huge for those of us who bought the Wii.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:18.640
We were willing to sacrifice graphics because it was going to have this complete interactivity of one-to-one control.

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:22.640
I'm just afraid that they're not going to support people on this, so.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:29.640
You know, maybe we'll get knocked completely on our ass that they're going to reveal that game for the core gamer.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:36.640
They're going to, you know, Reggie's going to whip it out and say, you know, here it is, Kid Icarus, the game you've all been waiting for, something like that.

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.640
You know, and it's going to rock.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.640
Right, I hope.

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.640
I hope.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.640
I'm just going to put out a good music game again.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:48.640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There are patterns for a reason. And, you know, what they're going to announce, what?

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.640
A new Pikmin game. Big whoopin' shit, okay?

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:58.640
You know, big deal, okay? New Pikmin game. Oh, the fans have been crying for it, yada yada yada.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640
Maybe a new Zelda game.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:05.640
Okay, we're really going to get down to the point where we're just re-releasing the same franchise games over and over.

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.640
Let's do something new, okay?

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:11.640
I mean, the Wii Sports stuff is okay, but let's create a new character. Let's do something different.

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640
Let's make, you know, something really epic.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:22.640
But no, we're going to, you know, now you see the majority of the people that own Wiis aren't the core gamer anymore, so you're not the target audience.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:30.640
And so, unfortunately, you're not going to get these games, or if you are going to get these games, there's going to be sacrifices made, and you're going to have to wait a long time for them.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.640
You know, so if you want your new Zelda game, well, you better be prepared to wait until, like, 2010 fall, you know, if that.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:56.640
And I totally agree with you. I totally agree, and I think that my thing is with the Wii Motion Plus is that this would open up the possibility for that true new style of gaming that we were all expecting with the Wii, where it's like your virtual reality, but I'm just afraid that the third-party producers are not going to feel like they're supported by Nintendo.

01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.640
I don't think that is. What's going to happen is you're going to see a bunch of these games now. It supports the Wii Motion Plus. It's a sequel, Red Steel 2.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:09.640
Oh, but the controls still suck. You know, it's not going to help anything. It's good as a new tool and stuff, but it's not anything innovative.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.640
It's not, it's not, it's just fixing a problem. That's all it is.

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:22.640
And it's another peripheral that they can sell for ten bucks, bundle it with a game, and then they're going to include, you know, the remotes. They're going to have it built into it now.

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.640
And then it's going to be something else. It's going to be always something to fix the flaws of what the system was.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.640
Not new. And I won't be damn surprised if there's anything from this press conference that surprises me.

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:39.640
But, you know, last year it was just like, yep, stupid peripheral. Really funny.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:44.640
You know, with the whole Wii Zapper. It used to be awesome. The original Wii Zapper was really kick-ass.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.640
When they first showed off, you know, the prototype and all that stuff, they should have stuck with that.

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:54.640
No, now it's a plastic shell that I don't even use anymore. The third-party peripherals are better than the goddamn Wii Zapper.

01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:00.640
All right. Well, we'll see. We are two months away from E3, and a lot of these questions will be answered.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.640
But in the meantime, we're going to answer some of your questions by going to a segment we like to do every week known as the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.640
By the way, I do want to remind everybody in studio and in our chat live that we are doing List List tonight.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.640
And the topic tonight for List List, which we'll get to a little later in the show, but everybody should be thinking about their lists, right, for List List. It's been a little while.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:24.640
It would be the feature that the DSi should have had to get me to buy one today. So be thinking about that.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:31.640
In the meantime, let's open up the mailbag, mailbagorangehoundsradio.com, and read some of your emails right now.

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640
DarkSakura.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:38.640
We have one from Deathwishing. Hey, guys, remember how I called and ranted about how Microsoft stole my $20?

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.640
I do remember that.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:46.640
Well, patience paid off. Not only did I get my original points of $1600 back, but I threw in an extra $1600.

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.640
I guess this shows you that being polite and waiting gets you a reward better than bitching 24-7.

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:55.640
Anyways, I'm gonna sleep now. K, thanks, bye.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.640
I'm glad to hear all was resolved.

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:02.640
This is the next one is from Isabelle.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:09.640
Well, first off, I want to start off by saying hi. How's it going? I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long while now, and I hope all of it is great for you guys.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:16.640
Now to get to the point of my email, I finally got to play Tatsunoko vs Capcom after what seems like a million years, and all I have to say about that game is wow.

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:21.640
I've heard how you guys said it was well done and really awesome, but I didn't expect it to be this awesome.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.640
I played its arcade version, and for an arcade game, it's really good.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.640
DarkSakura, have you gotten to play the arcade version?

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.640
Another arcade game I got to play was Tekken 6.

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:38.640
Just from the arcade version, I can tell that once it hits homes, no one will leave their couches. Yes, it really was that good.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:42.640
So I wish you all the best, and thanks for taking time for reading this email.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:49.640
I actually haven't played the arcade version yet. I never got a chance to go check it out at any of the state local places that have it.

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:52.640
Yeah, I had no idea there was an arcade version of Tatsunoko vs Capcom. That's pretty rad.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.640
Well, it originally was the arcade version.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.640
You know, and I should have known that, but yet I didn't. I don't know why.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:04.640
But I have played the Wii version, and I played with Jun and Ken as my team, and I was very happy with it.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:08.640
I still need to get out and play Tekken 6, because I love Tekken and everything.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:14.640
So, no, but I can't really say anything else I got, you know, more about any arcade versions of them.

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:18.640
Just that Tatsunoko vs Capcom is super cool.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.640
And the last email. This comes from Spirit of Radio.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.640
Okay.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.640
I've been playing video games since I was little and never been scared in any game.

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.640
I'm sorry, but Silent Hill 2 to 3 are boring and controls like garbage.

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.640
I will agree with some of the control issues.

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:39.640
The only game that honestly gave me a hard time going to sleep was the original Manhunt.

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:44.640
The concept of someone forcing you to do snuff films is the stuff of nightmares.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:50.640
Cool first time sending guys an email. Anyways, keep up the great podcast, you guys.

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:56.640
Also, Manhunt is something that I find repugnant. I don't really care for the game at all.

01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:04.640
I like the psychological type of edge. The stuff that requires intelligence and not, you know, blood.

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.640
Well, yay for first time emailers, if nothing else.

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:12.640
Yeah. Thanks for emailing. Keep it up.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:16.640
Alright. That's it for the emails. Alright.

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:22.640
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for reading in a future show.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:28.640
In the meantime, let's get back to some gaming news. We just have a few more stories and then we're going to get into tonight's list list.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.640
And we're going to respond to some of the tweets we got on Twitter this week.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.640
We're going to respond to those in just a little bit.

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.640
We got one more round of stories, though, starting off with Loki.

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:41.640
Yes. It's interesting how, you know, April Fool's jokes can now become reality.

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:54.640
Basically, THQ and the developers of Red Faction, Guerrilla, had a funny little video that they put out of a fictional weapon that they were going to, you know, originally they were teasing.

01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.640
They were going to include in the game the Ostrich Hammer, which is basically a giant ostrich that you use as a hammer.

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.640
And funny enough, it actually made it into the game.

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.640
Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that the company behind it, Volition, also puts out Saints Row.

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.640
So they are, of course, very used to quirky, weird shit.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.640
So, Ostrich Hammer, that almost sounds like something that should be in, like, Team Fortress 2, but...

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.640
Sounds like the name of a real good metal band.

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:26.640
Ostrich Hammer!

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.640
But, yeah, so you'll be able to hit people with an ostrich.

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:34.640
Well, maybe you can use the Ostrich Hammer to mash buttons as fast as you can.

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.640
It's a new app that's coming to the iPhone. It's called the Hudson Button Masher.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.640
And, yes, all you do in this game is you mash buttons.

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.640
Look, here's the thing.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.640
I guess what the deal is is that there's this guy at Hudson, you go all the way back,

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.640
and that's actually where the name Master Higgins comes from, was his name.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.640
That's where the guy in Adventure Island comes from.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:02.640
Apparently, he was really, really famous in the 1980s because he could actually press a button 16 times in one second.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.640
16 times in one second, if you can believe that.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:14.640
Now, they made this little device back in, like, the 80s to kind of cash in on this whole button mashing thing called the Shooting Watch.

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.640
And you could use this to try and match, beat, or try and tie this guy's score.

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:26.640
Well, Shooting Watch has now been ported to the iPhone, so you can try and mash buttons as fast as you want.

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.640
But here's the thing.

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:30.640
I don't think this thing's going to be that...

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:38.640
It's going to cost you 99 cents. It's not going to be as real as the real deal because I don't think the iPhone screen is good enough.

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.640
It's not going to match the electronics of an actual button.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.640
But look, if you just want a stupid app, pointless thing, have fun.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.640
I guess you could say a little piece of history.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.640
There might be people that remember these things.

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.640
Whoa.

01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:56.640
Not yet. It's not time for listless yet. Shut up.

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.640
There might be people that remember these things that want to, you know, relive it.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.640
I guess it's 99 cents. I don't know.

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.640
Impress your friends with how fast you can hammer the screen on your iPhone.

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.640
Whatever.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.640
Yeah, and break your iPhone screen, please.

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.640
16 times in one second.

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.640
Like, imagine, 16 times. Ready?

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.640
One 1,000.

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.640
Okay, 16 times. Right in that.

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:20.640
Crazy.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.640
One more story, then listless.

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:25.640
That makes my brain hurt to think about.

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:34.640
That would have come in really freaking handy doing the drinking minigame in Chrono Trigger.

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:40.640
Anyway, speaking of, for iPhone, there is actually a good game coming out.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:43.640
Cooking Mama's a good game. This is a good game.

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:50.640
There is a version of Galaga that is coming out, which was...

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.640
You could actually play this particular version in...

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.640
I do believe that it came out in 1981? No.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.640
There was the 1995 one.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.640
That was the Galaga Remix.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.640
But, Galaga Remix is coming out on iPhone.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.640
I remember that. Wasn't that packaged with Pac-Man and Dig Dug Remixes?

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:14.640
I do believe so.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.640
I think so. I remember. They had that at a local arcade around here. It's closed down.

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:28.640
And actually, as far as I was always aware, the Galaga Remix was based off of the Galaga 90 and Galaga 88.

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:31.640
But that was just in my observation.

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:34.640
But it's supposed to be coming out on the iPhone.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:37.640
And it will be $5.99.

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:45.640
And you can use directional buttons, but there's also a sliding method and there is a tilt method.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.640
Which I'm going to use the buttons, I swear.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:54.640
Because trying to play pole position in tilt mode is not fun.

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.640
So, it's going to be pretty good. I think it's going to be good.

01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.640
I was watching a video about it. It looks pretty good.

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.640
Let's have an interesting round table on this point here before we get into the list tonight.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.640
Because an interesting comment was said in chat.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:07.640
And I think everybody might want to have to say something to this.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640
GameGuru in chat says,

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.640
I don't see how you love the iPhone and hate on the DSi.

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.640
Apple's worse with updating hardware.

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.640
I didn't say I hate it.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.640
No, you as in all of us.

01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.640
Well, I don't hate the DSi.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.640
I just haven't, I have other things to spend my money on right now, like Disneyland.

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.640
As far as, for me, here it is.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:29.640
I already have a Nintendo DS.

01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:33.640
What does the DSi add to it that the DS didn't already have?

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:37.640
Like, you know, I'm not saying the DS is a bad gaming system. It's not.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.640
And if you don't have a DS yet, the DSi is probably a pretty good purchase for you.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.640
I would actually recommend it over the DS at this point.

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:49.640
Because you know there's going to be those games later on that are going to have the DSi only functionality.

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:51.640
So you might want to think about that.

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:55.640
But with the iPhone, at least before I got one, there was really nothing like it out there before.

01:58:55.640 --> 01:59:05.640
And yeah, Apple's really bad about releasing these updates with the 3G and the GPS and all this stuff a year later.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:10.640
But at the same time, they're also really good about updating the software.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:16.640
Like, think about it. The iPhones, when they first launched, didn't have the App Store and the user-made apps and those things built into it.

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.640
So, you know, that was something that Apple added for everybody.

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:26.640
You know, whereas I feel like with the DSi, there was nothing being given to current DS users.

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.640
You can't update the firmware on the DS.

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.640
So, I don't know.

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.640
I think for me, there's kind of the difference in those two things.

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:36.640
And the iPhone's not perfect.

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:44.640
You know, yeah, Apple is a huge abuser of this whole, let's upgrade the whole thing in a year and watch everybody buy it all over again.

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:47.640
But, you know, we give them crap for that, too, and it's deserved.

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:52.640
So, anyway, speaking of that, let's get to tonight's List List.

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.640
Now, I know it's been a while since we've done one of these on the show, so let me remind everybody how it works.

02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:06.640
We are going to make the ultimate list, the definitive top three list.

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.640
And we're going to use our live chatters to help, along with the folks here in studio.

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.640
Those of us here in studio have paired our top three answers.

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:16.640
We're going to compile those into a list of 12, since there's four of us tonight.

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:22.640
Then we're going to go around the room and each one of us is going to take something off of the list, leaving a list of eight.

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:28.640
Then you guys in chat will vote on that list of eight and make our top three using your votes.

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:32.640
And then we will have the definitive top three list, no arguments, no debates.

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.640
It is the official list.

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.640
All right.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:39.640
I say that, but of course there's always room for debate.

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:44.640
Okay, so that being said, tonight's topic, feature that should have been on the DSI that would have got me to buy one today.

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.640
Who wants to start us off tonight?

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:49.640
How about Loki? Loki's always got some evil answers for us.

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.640
Loki, what is your number three answer of the feature the DSI should have had?

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.640
You know, I was thinking a bunch of different things.

02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.640
Let me say this, I'm sorry, real quick.

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.640
If it matters, if you have ideas, put them in our chat room, because if one of us gets an answer stolen,

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.640
like somebody else says the same answer we were going to use, usually we take backup answers from chat.

02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.640
So just want to get that out there.

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:09.640
Which would be kind of neat.

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:14.640
I mean, I don't really use this on the Wii, but like the DSI message board.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:19.640
You know, basically allowing you to send emails and attachments and stuff like that to each other.

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:25.640
Really, you know, DSI should have a lot of stuff that the Wii has, but you know, that's what I'm going to start with.

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.640
Alright, not a smart-ass answer from Loki, I'm impressed.

02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.640
That's a very reasonable good answer.

02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.640
Should be a way to email each other and have, you know, all that stuff.

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:35.640
A DSI message board, I like that.

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.640
The Doctor!

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.640
We'll just go on a line here.

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.640
Doctor, what is the number three feature the DSI should have had to get you to buy one today?

02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.640
Voice recognition.

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.640
Software.

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.640
I think that would be an awesome feature in games.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.640
You speak and then it responds.

02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:53.640
Well now, I think about brain training and you have the blue and some of those things, but what would be-

02:01:53.640 --> 02:02:01.640
It's so rudimentary, like actual practical where you could say, you know, you cast a spell in a fantasy game and they do it, you know.

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:03.640
I want to cast Magic Missile!

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:05.640
Yeah, really fully developed voice recognition software.

02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.640
Improved voice, okay, I can go with that.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.640
Alright, alright, cool.

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:15.640
Alright, I'll go next and my number three answer I'm going to use tonight is open app development like the iPhone.

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:19.640
That they should open up, because they're going to have this DSI downloadable stuff, I think they should open it up.

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.640
I think open app development is going to be my number three answer.

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.640
That anybody should be able to make a DS game.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.640
Because the community, I think, could come up with some good stuff and maybe like a message board.

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.640
And I think it's been very good for the iPhone, so if we're going to make that comparison, then there you go.

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.640
DarkSoccer, you're number three.

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.640
Me.

02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:40.640
Interesting.

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:50.640
I honestly think having your me being able to travel, you know, from your Wii to your DSi to go visit other people's, you know.

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.640
Technically they can already do that.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.640
Well, they're going to have support for it, but yeah, they should.

02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.640
You haven't integrated it into the actual OS of the system.

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:07.640
And I think it's kind of forgotten that you can put those things on the Wiimote, too, because there's not a lot of practical use for it.

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.640
You know what I mean?

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.640
I've brought mine over to your house before that way.

02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:10.640
I remember that.

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.640
I remember that.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640
Okay, so Mii integration, I guess we could say.

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.640
Better use of the Miis on DS.

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:14.640
I like that idea.

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:15.640
Okay, Loki.

02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:21.640
You know what would be kind of cool?

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:22.640
Bluetooth.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:23.640
Okay.

02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.640
Because just think of it as you will.

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.640
You could use your Wii Remote for motion sensitive games.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.640
You know, not necessarily obviously waggling your Wii Remote around, but like racing games or something like that.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.640
You could use it for wireless headsets.

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.640
Okay, okay.

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:43.640
Communication with other devices.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.640
Okay.

02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:47.640
The doctor, what's your number two?

02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.640
The tilt feature, the motion feature like the iPhone is.

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.640
Are you guys wanting to turn the DSI into an iPhone?

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640
What's going on here?

02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.640
Oh, I guess I did one, too.

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.640
All right, what do you think the tilt feature would add to the DSI?

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:09.640
Well, gimmicks, but it seems like that would not have been a useless feature like the camera.

02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.640
I'm sorry.

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:18.640
All right, my number two answer I'm going to say is, okay, I'm going to give the first smart ass answer of the night.

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:24.640
A virtual boy slot would have been something, too, since they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:31.640
Give me a virtual boy slot to give me a use for those games that are just collecting dust from the great red headache machine of death.

02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.640
So a virtual boy slot.

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.640
Dark Sakura, your number two pick for a feature that you most would want to see in the DSI that would have gotten you to buy one.

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:43.640
TV tuner.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.640
Oh, I like, I like that.

02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.640
Okay, TV tuner.

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:55.640
I mean, if the freaking Turbo Express, the handheld Turbo Graphics could have a TV tuner.

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.640
And NEC didn't really, well, they kind of did.

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:01.640
But anyway, why can't the other links have one, too?

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.640
Why not?

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:03.640
Why the heck not?

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:05.640
Okay, I'll tell you why not.

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.640
The nomad.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.640
No, I'm kidding.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.640
Because they're getting rid of analog TV signals soon.

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.640
Doesn't matter.

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.640
Have a digital TV tuner.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640
No.

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:13.640
That's impossible.

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.640
Yes.

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.640
Impossible.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.640
All right.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.640
Now we're getting to the number one answers.

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:24.640
The number one feature you want to see in the DSI that would get you to buy the system right now.

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.640
Loki, what is your number one answer?

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.640
My number one answer is there's nothing they can do.

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:38.640
Honestly, they would have to, it's made out of bacon.

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:39.640
I don't know.

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:51.640
I have no number one answer.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:53.640
Made out of bacon.

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:56.640
Or at least scratch and sniff bacon smell.

02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:57.640
I don't know how with that.

02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.640
Made out of bacon.

02:05:58.640 --> 02:05:59.640
Bacon integration.

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:00.640
All right.

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:01.640
I like made out of bacon.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:02.640
All right.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:09.640
The DSI would sell, you would have bought one today and it was made out of bacon.

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:14.640
The doctor, your number one answer for what would have got you to buy the DSI today.

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:16.640
Since I guess the theme is crazy stuff now.

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:20.640
Like, you know, you can interact with it, it can interact with you back.

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:25.640
So like an energy hand will come out and like slap you in the face.

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.640
Is that your real answer?

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:29.640
That is.

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:30.640
And my final answer.

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:34.640
Energy hands.

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:36.640
You know, there's so many apps for that.

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.640
Slap in the face.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:41.640
Helps with self-trouser fornication.

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:49.640
Hands made out of pure energy.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:50.640
All right.

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.640
My number one answer, it's a little bit long, but this is a true answer by the way.

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:56.640
This is not a smart ass answer.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:00.640
My number one answer for the thing that would have most got me to buy a DSI today.

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:05.640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:13.640
My runner up answer would have been a multi-touch touch screen, but you know.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.640
Like anything with a multi-touch touch screen.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.640
We're not just limiting it to the iPhone.

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.640
All right.

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:21.640
Enough about you.

02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:22.640
Let's talk about me and my answer some more.

02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:25.640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DSU money-sucking pieces of shit.

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:27.640
I think that speaks for itself.

02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:30.640
I bought these games for five damn dollars.

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.640
I ought to have the right to download it.

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.640
PS3 does it.

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:35.640
Why can't Nintendo do it?

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:37.640
Why can't you do it?

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.640
You got rid of the advanced slot, so don't give me that argument you released on the Game Boy Advance.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.640
But now I can't play them anymore.

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:46.640
So he does what Nintendon't.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:48.640
All right.

02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.640
DarkSakura, your number one answer.

02:07:51.640 --> 02:08:00.640
Mine would be to take PictoChat and make it truly networking, as in you can hop on the Wi-Fi,

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:04.640
and you don't have to be just in the general vicinity of somebody else with one.

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:11.640
You can draw penises on full-blown penor on people's DSIs in Malaysia.

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:12.640
Or an enhancement of that.

02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:16.640
It could be like there's a camera on it, like video chat.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.640
Can I just say PictoChat across the internets?

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640
That would be cool.

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:21.640
All right.

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.640
There you go.

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:29.640
Although my bullshit answer could either be a Jelly Belly dispenser or gay porn.

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:30.640
Gay porn.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.640
All right.

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:32.640
Gay porn always sells.

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:35.640
Let's see what the chat room had to say with some answers there.

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:36.640
Let's see.

02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.640
We had a DDR pad was one answer.

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.640
Airport tuner, shortwave tuner.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.640
We tried a DDR pad, remember?

02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.640
Legend of Zelda ghost camera.

02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.640
A vibrator.

02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:53.640
I think I saw different forms of vibrator, a trance vibrator was one that came up as

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.640
well.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.640
Let's see.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.640
What do we have as well?

02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:58.640
Laser Cats DSI game at launch would have made it better.

02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.640
That's from S2100mat.

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:01.640
Virtual handheld for Mac Dev.

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.640
Kind of like my answer.

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.640
How about a fart sound maker or a swear button from the Dark Knight?

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:06.640
All right.

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:07.640
There you go.

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.640
Some of the answers we have from chat.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640
But sadly...

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.640
You know, they did make a DDR pad, though, for the Game Boy back in the day.

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:11.640
Way back in the day.

02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:12.640
I have one.

02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:15.640
Because they brought out the super midi version of DDR.

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.640
They were kind of shit.

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:17.640
They were funny.

02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:19.640
Was it for your fingers, though?

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:20.640
Yeah.

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:23.640
ActDeft wins a RuPaul game for the DSiWare.

02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:24.640
All right.

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:26.640
Here's the list so far, but now we're going to get to the elimination round.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.640
Here we go.

02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:28.640
DSI message board.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.640
Voice recognition software.

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:31.640
Open app development.

02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.640
Miis.

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:33.640
Bluetooth integration.

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.640
Tilt feature like the iPhone.

02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.640
Virtual voice slot.

02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:37.640
TV tuner.

02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:38.640
Made out of bacon.

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:39.640
Energy hands.

02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:44.640
Virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit.

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.640
And PictoChat across the internets.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:54.640
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.640
Energy hands, I'm sorry.

02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.640
Energy hands.

02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:01.640
Maybe just a little too soon for energy hands.

02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:02.640
All right.

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:05.640
The Doctor, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:07.640
The virtual voice slot.

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:08.640
Oh, you bastard.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.640
All right.

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.640
Virtual voice slot comes off the list.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:17.640
I am going to say, I have to be honest, the one I've got to take out is voice recognition

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.640
software.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.640
Sorry, Doctor, that's not a retaliation thing, but I just think that would be hoarded to

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.640
the extreme and would just make the thing crap.

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.640
Dark soccer is going to be the last one to eliminate dark soccer.

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.640
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.640
It was a toss-up between one and made out of bacon.

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:39.640
And I'm going to take out the tilt function because I'd rather be made out of bacon than

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.640
have tilt function.

02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.640
All right.

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:42.640
So there you go.

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:43.640
Trust me.

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:47.640
I don't want them to even remotely consider it because some of these iPhone games are

02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:49.640
unplayable because they have tilt function.

02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:50.640
All right.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:51.640
Fair enough.

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:52.640
Fair enough.

02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:55.640
But then you have some good ones, too, like Rolando is kind of cool.

02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:56.640
Let's check it out.

02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:58.640
But I like bacon, too.

02:10:58.640 --> 02:10:59.640
No, seriously.

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.640
Fair enough.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:03.640
Every Friday after typography class now I have to go have bacon because bacon is meat

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:04.640
candy.

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:05.640
Fair enough.

02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.640
All right.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.640
So here we go.

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.640
Now here's the list you guys will vote on.

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:15.640
Spotify message board, open app development, Miis, Bluetooth integration, TV tuner, made

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:21.640
out of bacon, virtual console games on my goddamn DS, you money-sucking pieces of shit,

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640
and Picto chats across the internets.

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:24.640
Place vote now.

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.640
Send a private message with your number one and number two answer.

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.640
Make sure both are labeled or I will assume the first is your number one.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.640
Send those over private message to Rob Roberts in chat room.

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.640
And if you don't know how to do that, ask somebody or maybe somebody will mention it

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:41.640
in chat how to do that right now.

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.640
Place those votes within the next 120 seconds you have to vote.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:51.640
And we will tally it up and reveal for you who won a little later on in the show.

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:57.640
For now, while those votes are coming in, let's take a trip over to our Twitter.

02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.640
And we're actually going to look at, you know, we put a call out on Twitter today saying,

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.640
you know, we're a little short on stories this week.

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.640
What do you guys want to see us talk about?

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.640
And we put the call out on Twitter.

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.640
And we did get some replies, some various tweets in our response here.

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:13.640
And I wanted to read some of those for you guys right now,

02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:17.640
although right now I'm seeing a lot of gaming weeks.

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:18.640
Let's see.

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.640
We talked about the, let's see.

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.640
Act Def says talk about the March Madness winner some more.

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.640
We kind of talked about that already.

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.640
DJ Ratchet wants to know about the new PSP and PS2 Jackson Dexter game,

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.640
which we talked about earlier.

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.640
ZakuPilot256 asks, DSI, is it worth the upgrade?

02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:40.640
Can I get a side of handheld console wars as well, please, lol.

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.640
There hasn't been a lot of PSP bashing tonight.

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:43.640
I don't know.

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:47.640
Is there, is the DSI, I mean, okay, let me back up.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.640
The PSP's kind of a little bit behind in the console wars right now,

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.640
but the DSI is kind of out there to increase the lead, so to speak.

02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.640
I know what we could talk about.

02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.640
Did you hear about that news story where Sony apparently put out a press release

02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.640
saying that, basically saying the DSI was a kiddie system,

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.640
and then touted that it had a Miley Cyrus game in the exact same press release.

02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.640
Did you hear about that?

02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.640
Well, I mean, they have their own kiddie stuff on the PSP,

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.640
but yes, it's mainly the DS that has kiddie stuff,

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.640
but that's, you have to understand, though, there's a double edge to everything.

02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:25.640
I mean, because, yeah, you know why there's more kiddie games in there?

02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.640
Because more kids own a DS than a PSP.

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.640
D'oh.

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.640
Well, you know, I got to disagree with that a little.

02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:35.640
I just, I don't like all these uber-violent, uber-serious games.

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:38.640
I'm like, I fall asleep watching COD, I'm sorry.

02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:44.640
So I like the more down-to-earth or the more silly games myself, so.

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.640
Well, but here's the thing, and I still feel this way,

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.640
and you know, maybe, okay, the PSP is still like games and more.

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:54.640
It might not be the best system at games, even though it still has,

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:58.640
you know, it does have Disada, it does have some games that are pretty awesome,

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:01.640
but the PSP is still, you know, for that college kid.

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:06.640
This is like the great college system, because you've got your MP3 player,

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.640
you've got your little internet browser you can use at Starbucks,

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.640
you've got your gaming system, you know, it's all right there.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:15.640
And I think the DSi was trying to compete with that a little bit,

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.640
but it didn't work, because, you know, where's the internet?

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.640
Where is the MP3 player built in?

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:21.640
None of that is here.

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:25.640
So I still think the PSP excels at being more than a gaming,

02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.640
but if all you want is handheld games, I think the DS still wins.

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:31.640
And then also the DSi, though, I mean, their music player is kind of crap,

02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.640
because it's only the AAC format or whatever,

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.640
which I understand, you know, iTunes and stuff, that's fine,

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:39.640
but really I think it should have been MP3.

02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:41.640
I mean, come on, man, give it the times.

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.640
And then also, you know, there's the internet browser,

02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:50.640
which apparently is not very good anyways, so it's like, ugh, okay, whatever.

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.640
And then, you know, what, the photo manipulation stuff?

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:56.640
Really? Is that what you're going to do?

02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.640
A photo manipulation? Is that really that important?

02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.640
Are we going to, like, throw those around the internet now

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:03.640
and take pictures and manipulate them with silly faces,

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:06.640
like you couldn't do that in Microsoft Paint or something?

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.640
I mean, come on.

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:12.640
It's just, it's got potential, but they're never going to utilize it,

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:13.640
and that's sad.

02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:16.640
I like AcidicVampire's response in chat.

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.640
In the PSP's defense, the games look saucier.

02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:21.640
I like that word, saucier.

02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:24.640
They could have had MP3 support if Nintendo had paid a license,

02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:27.640
just like the Wii could have played DVDs if they had paid the license

02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:30.640
for, you know, the use of DVD codecs.

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:33.640
But you know what? You know what's more important than Nintendo?

02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:34.640
Money in their pocket.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.640
So, you know, so much for that, you know,

02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:41.640
and so I guess the consumer loses because Nintendo needs to make a buck.

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:45.640
Yeah, but nobody uses their consoles to play movies, though, anymore,

02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:47.640
I don't think, anyway.

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:49.640
I use my consoles to play movies all the time.

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.640
It's my primary DVD player.

02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.640
Whatever happens with it, PlayStation 3 is my primary movie player.

02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:00.640
We do use it for Blu-ray, and our HD DVD player is our Xbox 360.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:03.640
You know, and whatever I happen to have hooked up at the time,

02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:05.640
you know, it would be kind of cool to have, you know,

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:08.640
a DVD player for the Wii.

02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.640
Don't be surprised if that's, like, not something

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:11.640
that they're going to start selling to.

02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:14.640
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.640
And yeah, I know most people already have DVD players,

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:18.640
but you know what?

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.640
People also have TVs, too, but yet still buy tons of TVs out there.

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:24.640
And who cares? It's another DVD player.

02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.640
That's the point.

02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:27.640
You know, we may be in the kids' room or something like that,

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.640
now, boom, it's a DVD player in the kids' room.

02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.640
So, you know, I don't know.

02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.640
Minor cost for, you know, another bullet point.

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:40.640
So, whatever.

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:41.640
All right, I'm still trying to tally the votes,

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:43.640
so let's move on to another topic here.

02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:45.640
Crows asks on Twitter,

02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:48.640
maybe talk about some April Fools' jokes that spread on the internet

02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:49.640
that were actually entertaining.

02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:50.640
I don't like April Fools' Day at all,

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:53.640
although I think, you know, for hating April Fools' Day,

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:55.640
I think Dark Tetsuya did a pretty funny one on our site,

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.640
where he did for I Heart that song,

02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.640
he did Let Them Move from DD,

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.640
which is, like, a total throwback to the old school days

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:03.640
of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:06.640
So, like, I like dumb shit like that.

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:08.640
I don't know.

02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:10.640
Loki, Dark Soccer, did you guys see anything funny on the internet?

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.640
I kind of turn off the internet on April Fools' Day.

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.640
This year, they actually kind of,

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:16.640
a lot of the sites that would normally do April Fools' jokes didn't.

02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.640
They're just like, you know, I'm too busy with stuff, so forget it.

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:24.640
You know, basically, I saw a few in, like, the hacking communities,

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.640
like, some, you know, people,

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.640
oh, yeah, look, we're releasing, you know,

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.640
a tool to hack the PSP 3000,

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.640
or, you know, a new one to hack the Wii or something,

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:34.640
and it's just, whatever, you know,

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.640
those we kind of figured were fake.

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:38.640
And then, um,

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.640
I'm trying to think here, what are some of the other, you know,

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.640
April Fools' jokes that were just very obvious?

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:47.640
The new Metal Gear Solid game,

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:49.640
you know, they announced, you know,

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:51.640
what the new character was going to be,

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:52.640
which is kind of retarded,

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:53.640
and then, um,

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:55.640
I'm trying to think here.

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.640
They were kind of lame.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.640
I mean, it was, you know,

02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.640
the World of Warcraft thing that they did was kind of cool,

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.640
and then there was another one with IGN,

02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:06.640
you know, tried to do this,

02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.640
Wii Extend or Wii Expand or something like that,

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:12.640
which was supposed to be download content for, like, Wii games,

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.640
and the first one was Super Smash Brothers Brawl Extreme,

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.640
where they were going to have, like, blood and stuff like that,

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:22.640
and it just looked so fake, and, you know,

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:25.640
they had Mario getting decapitated and stuff like that.

02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.640
You know, despite all the shit we give the mainstream press sometimes on this show

02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:29.640
and all that stuff,

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:33.640
I think their Zelda trailer will never be topped.

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:35.640
That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' joke.

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.640
That was great.

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:37.640
That was a pretty fucking amazing April Fools' prank.

02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:41.640
Not for the fact that I don't think anyone really fell for it,

02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:44.640
but just, like, goddamn, they went all out with that shit that year,

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:45.640
and I think, like,

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:48.640
and, Doctor, you're a big Zelda fanboy.

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:51.640
Did you not get a huge boner April Fools' or not at that trailer?

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:53.640
No, and obviously it was fake,

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:54.640
but yeah, I mean,

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:57.640
if you've ever seen the fan-made Zelda movies,

02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:59.640
I mean, this was, like, a bazillion,

02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:02.640
the production value was pretty good.

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.640
And sadly enough, it will never come to fruition,

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:05.640
which is, you know,

02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:07.640
I don't think it would cost that much,

02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:08.640
you know, for something like that.

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.640
Now, this wasn't even an April Fools' thing,

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:11.640
but have you seen,

02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:13.640
there's a trailer for a movie that someone made,

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.640
or short movie, called Turbo,

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.640
which is a little bit of a cross between, like,

02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:19.640
Street Fighter and Tron and, you know,

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:20.640
the Karate Kid.

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:22.640
And it actually looks pretty cool,

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.640
and that's also made, you know, with a really low budget and stuff,

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.640
so, you know, nowadays,

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:28.640
you know, you can do pretty amazing stuff.

02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.640
Hell, I mean, look at that,

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:32.640
was it the Half-Life short,

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.640
or it was, like, a series that's going on,

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:37.640
and I gotta wonder if they've got more episodes for that,

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:39.640
but, you know, the guys did it, like, on a shoestring budget,

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:41.640
and it's just, like, it's amazing.

02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:44.640
It's absolutely amazing as far as visuals and stuff go,

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.640
which is sad, because sci-fi movies look like crap,

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:48.640
you know, like the sci-fi channel stuff,

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:50.640
so if a guy can do it in his basement,

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.640
then why can't they?

02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:56.640
All right, and then one other thing on Twitter

02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:57.640
I thought was pretty interesting,

02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.640
and, you know, our good friend Marin,

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.640
or Tiara, whatever you want to say,

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.640
kind of likes to pimp her own stuff,

02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.640
but I liked it.

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:08.640
It was actually a piece that she wrote on her own blog,

02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:11.640
which I've jokingly referred to as the Giggling Girls blog,

02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:14.640
but, no, it's what, AvengersTower.com?

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.640
Yes, it is.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.640
I can't remember if it's Avenger Tower or Avengers Tower.

02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:18.640
It's Avengers Tower.

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.640
Avengers Tower.

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:22.640
Like the old comic?

02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:24.640
Like the Avengers Tower and the comic books.

02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:26.640
Gotcha.

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:29.640
It was an article about the Beatles rock band,

02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:31.640
which we talked about a couple weeks on the show,

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:34.640
but what I liked was there was this article she read on March 29th

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:39.640
about how the Beatles rock band game is going to carry a price tag

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:43.640
that's like $60 more than the current Rock Band 2 bundle,

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:47.640
and she's kind of speculating where could this extra $60 be coming from,

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:48.640
and I like some of the ideas.

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.640
One rumor was a keyboard,

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:53.640
which I think is more of a wishful thinking,

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:54.640
at least on my part.

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:56.640
I would love to see a keyboard, but I don't know.

02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:57.640
I mean, definitely there are some Beatles songs

02:20:57.640 --> 02:20:59.640
that would benefit from keyboard integration.

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:02.640
Another idea was extra microphones,

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:05.640
so maybe you could have more than one person singing.

02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:07.640
You could have two people singing at once.

02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:09.640
To kind of go with the keyboard thing,

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:12.640
their site, I don't know if it's viral or what,

02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:14.640
but their actual, the Beatles site,

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:19.640
they've been having instruments slowly being added to their studio recording room,

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:21.640
and one of the instruments was a keyboard.

02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:23.640
Hmm. Interesting.

02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:27.640
Rumor number three, drums with cymbals

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:30.640
that maybe they're actually going to put actual cymbals or whatever

02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:32.640
on the drum kit for the Rock Band.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.640
Well, they did say that, you know, later on,

02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:36.640
it's potential that they can have like, say,

02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:37.640
Rock Band 3 or something like that,

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:39.640
where cymbals would be their own notes,

02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:40.640
which is kind of cool.

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:43.640
Another rumor, two guitars instead of one.

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.640
Instead of, why not have the whole band?

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:48.640
I think it's more that is what's going to be why it's more expensive,

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:51.640
is the second guitar, I think, is going to be in there,

02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:52.640
because they're going to model the bass.

02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:54.640
They're probably going to have an actual bass and then a guitar.

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:58.640
And the last rumor, just milking the damn cash cow.

02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.640
Milking the damn cash cow.

02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.640
I really hope it's the keyboard one,

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:05.640
but I think, Loki, I think it's going to be one of their bass guitars

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.640
with the regular guitar, I think.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:09.640
Especially because you have the,

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:13.640
and she goes into talking about the whole Hoffner violin bass,

02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:16.640
which, you know, it seems likely that, you know,

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:17.640
with the Beatles and everything,

02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:20.640
they would have like a special, you know, Beatles bass.

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:23.640
That seems likely.

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.640
Some folks in chat are saying, you know,

02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.640
what about like a strobe light?

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:28.640
They can already buy that.

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:30.640
Oh, no, they're talking, oh, no, no, no, no.

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:31.640
They're talking about Nine Inch Nails.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.640
I guess their April Fool's joke or something like that

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:39.640
had something to do with, oh, it was the album.

02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:41.640
Oh, that Nine Inch Nails was putting out a new album

02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:44.640
that was produced by Timbaland called Strobe Light.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.640
That was a good April Fool's joke that was out on the internet.

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:53.640
All right, let's get into the listless results.

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.640
So we can get to your calls,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.640
last minute stories, and the end of the show pretty soon.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:01.640
Believe it or not, for being a slower Newsweek,

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.640
we sure seem to fill a couple of hours

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:05.640
and then some here on the show.

02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.640
All right, here are your top three tonight,

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:09.640
the definitive list, as you guys in chat have voted

02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:12.640
for the feature that they should have put on the DSI

02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:14.640
that would have made me buy one today.

02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:19.640
Number three, open app development, just like the iPhone.

02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:20.640
Let anybody make an app.

02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:22.640
There you go, open app development.

02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:26.640
Number two feature that would have got me to buy a DSI today,

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:28.640
made out of bacon.

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:30.640
Made out of bacon was the number two feature.

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:31.640
There you go.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:33.640
Where there's bacon, there's profit.

02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:37.640
And the number one feature that would have gotten people

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:42.640
to buy the DSI today, virtual console games on my goddamn DS,

02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:44.640
you money-sucking pieces of shit.

02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:49.640
There it is, your number one answer on the list.

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:52.640
List segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:55.640
All right, all right.

02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:58.640
Lots of votes spread around amongst all the choices, though.

02:23:58.640 --> 02:23:59.640
Everybody got a little love,

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.640
but I think those three struck a particular nerve,

02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:05.640
because people just love their bacon and virtual console

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.640
and open app development.

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.640
All right, actdeft makes a good point.

02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:14.640
If anybody can make an app, you know who will make his game a reality.

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:17.640
That individual who has a game named after himself.

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:19.640
Well, you know whose game sucks balls,

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.640
because I've actually played the demo,

02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.640
and it's as crappy as it looks.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:29.640
And I'm sorry, I don't care if it's one person developing it.

02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:32.640
It's not good, and I would never...

02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:37.640
If I paid retail for that, I'd have to kick myself in the junk.

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:41.640
BlackWolf asks in chat, what if Bobby BlackWolf made a game?

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:44.640
Would you talk about it if I called it Bobby's Game?

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:46.640
Yes, I would talk about it every week.

02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:48.640
Every week, Bobby. Every week.

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:49.640
As long as it didn't suck.

02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:51.640
In fact, I think you should beat him to the market,

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:53.640
because I would laugh my ass off at that.

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.640
Do it now.

02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:55.640
But only if the theme song to the game is

02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.640
La la la la, la la la la, Bobby's World.

02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:00.640
No?

02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:03.640
Oh, my God.

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.640
All right.

02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:08.640
Also, before we get to the Skype line and so forth,

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:10.640
we have one segment we always do here on the show

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.640
that we don't want to miss,

02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:13.640
but we just haven't had any really angsty stories.

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.640
But perhaps the invoking of said name,

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.640
of said band individual from said show,

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.640
and just even thinking about his game

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:23.640
should invoke anger and rage

02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:26.640
in a certain segment we do here every week on Orange Launch Radio.

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:41.640
.

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:43.640
FUs of the Week.

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:48.640
Um, man, making me be angry, and I was starting to feel good.

02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.640
Um, FU to having to go to work tomorrow.

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:58.640
Just, I really, I, you know, that's all.

02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:01.640
I just really want to stay home and sleep.

02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:03.640
What's wrong with that?

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.640
So, FU being tired.

02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:08.640
FU to this glass of wine I'm drinking for being so yummy

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:10.640
and making me a little tipsy during the show.

02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.640
I love it.

02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:12.640
It's freaking delicious.

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:14.640
It's a muscata?

02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:15.640
It's a muscato.

02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:16.640
Muscato.

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:17.640
It's delicious.

02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:18.640
It's a sweet wine.

02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:19.640
It tastes like candy.

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:20.640
Mm-hmm.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:22.640
It tastes like champagne without the bubbles,

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:23.640
as my friend put it.

02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:25.640
It's delish.

02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:27.640
Hey there, doctor.

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:28.640
Do you have any FUs of the Week,

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:29.640
even though Loki's holding the mic?

02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:31.640
Yeah, even though this is a little old news,

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:33.640
I had a lady confront me about this the other day.

02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.640
Fuck you to anyone who doesn't support gay marriage,

02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:37.640
because you are fucking assholes.

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.640
Props to Iowa, though.

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:41.640
Props to Iowa, of all places.

02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:44.640
Props to them, although I have heard those comparisons about,

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.640
well, isn't Iowa just doing what California did,

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.640
like, five years ago, which, or however long ago it was,

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:49.640
like, three years ago,

02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:51.640
which ended up getting turned around by Prop 8 anyway.

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:53.640
Maybe, but I hear it's harder

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.640
to pass a constitutional amendment in that state,

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:59.640
so if you live in Iowa, please don't screw this up.

02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:02.640
Please don't screw this up.

02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:04.640
But right now, hey, you know,

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:07.640
I think some person in Iowa is probably really concerned.

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.640
I actually read about this somewhere,

02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:11.640
that they are concerned,

02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:14.640
the conservative moral majority, let's say, in Iowa,

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:20.640
that there's just going to be this outbreak of gay-ness

02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:22.640
throughout the state.

02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:24.640
It's going to become a gay mecca.

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:26.640
Like, there's just going to be a sodomy outbreak

02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:29.640
within the state of Iowa because of this law passing.

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.640
You know what?

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.640
Why is that a bad thing?

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:38.640
Like, maybe people can come clean the place up,

02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.640
throw a party in Des Moines that people want to come to.

02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:43.640
And make it fierce.

02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:46.640
Quick, when I say Des Moines, what do you think of?

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.640
My crappy customer.

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:51.640
Silent S. That's corn.

02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:53.640
There's not a lot else I can think of.

02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:55.640
All right, anyway.

02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:57.640
ZakuPilot256 in chat says,

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:00.640
if gay people want to ruin their life with marriage, let them.

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:02.640
Amen to that. All right, anyhow.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.640
Didn't I say it in my little rant that I put in my blog?

02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.640
That everyone should have as much right to mess it up

02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:11.640
like, you know, anyone else?

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:14.640
Just like Britney Spears. We have every right to fuck it up like Britney Spears did.

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:16.640
All right, look, I don't want to turn this into a political show,

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:19.640
but obviously it's an issue important to myself and the doctor.

02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:21.640
So yay, Iowa.

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:23.640
F you. Everybody else.

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.640
All right. Yeah, Loki, please, your F you is the week.

02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:30.640
My F you is the week goes to some of my airsoft guns not working correctly.

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:33.640
Did your airsoft thing, did you get to have that?

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.640
Because I saw multiple pleas on live channel,

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.640
and we were like, pretty please come play airsoft with me.

02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:39.640
And I felt bad, I wanted to go, but I had plans.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:42.640
No, we had like three people, including myself, and that's it.

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:44.640
But it was all right, we had fun with the small group.

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.640
I promise I will go airsoft with you in a future week.

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.640
That's fine, I just, I have, I've been bad and I've been buying too many guns.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.640
So unfortunately, unfortunately I'm probably going to sell some,

02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.640
but it's fine because I, you know, my primary gun that I normally use,

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.640
I don't really like anymore, but the new one I got is pretty cool.

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.640
But I'm going to stop buying guns and stick with the one that works really well.

02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:13.640
All right.

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.640
ActDef says, bad Loki, what will the wife say?

02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:17.640
She doesn't know.

02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:22.640
And thankfully she doesn't listen to this show, all right.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:24.640
Damn, all right, there you go.

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:27.640
Let's open up the Skype line if we can here.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.640
1-8, do not disturb, let me open it up there.

02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:33.640
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:35.640
If you want to give us a call and interact with us,

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:37.640
talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight,

02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:40.640
or as long as it's gaming related, we'll talk about anything pretty much.

02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:43.640
So go ahead and call us right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:46.640
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.640
Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for these calls to come in?

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.640
Yeah, sorry, I'm fighting a giant slug thing.

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.640
That's right, you still, well, actually you're getting saved.

02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:55.640
We've got a call right now.

02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:57.640
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:00.640
This is DS Master 26.

02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:02.640
Hey, DS Master 26, what is on your mind?

02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:04.640
Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm going to ask you.

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.640
How about the DSi?

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:12.640
Uh, seriously, I've seen, actually one of my friends has one.

02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:15.640
She gets imports from Japan a whole bunch of times,

02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:19.640
so she got one before the rest of us Americans did.

02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:24.640
And I've seen the picture printouts from that camera on that DSi.

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.640
They're a bunch of crap.

02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:28.640
Plus the internet browser,

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:31.640
we did a speed test you could get to Google first

02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:37.640
on a PSP versus DSi and the internet on there is slow as hell.

02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:43.640
Like dial up Windows 95 slow.

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:47.640
That's like on the Nintendo Wii, it's very, very slow.

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:52.640
Yeah, same thing with the DSi, but slower.

02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.640
And seriously, the music player is crap.

02:30:55.640 --> 02:31:00.640
I mean, besides, I already got that feature with my R4 card.

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.640
Wait, did they actually put a music player in the DSi?

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:04.640
I didn't even realize that was there.

02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:06.640
It's built in now?

02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:11.640
Yeah, but you use your SD card and it takes AAC.

02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:14.640
But yeah, I already have a PSP or more importantly,

02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:16.640
you know, an iPod and iPhone that will do it as well.

02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.640
You know, I do use my PSP.

02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:20.640
Yeah, same here.

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:27.640
I use my PSP, like the R4 does two videos, as I found out.

02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:30.640
Actually, that's the reason why I called in.

02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:34.640
I'm giving a review on Silent Hill, which I just saw last night.

02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:35.640
The movie?

02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:36.640
Freaking awesome.

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:37.640
Yeah.

02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:41.640
Wow, you're only about three years late, but go ahead.

02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:43.640
I'm just messing.

02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:45.640
Wow, it came out three years ago?

02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:46.640
It was a while ago.

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:47.640
I'm just messing with you.

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:49.640
I don't remember when, but it was a while ago.

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:50.640
What did you think?

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:56.640
Well, anyways, out of all the movie, out of the game movies I've seen,

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:59.640
this is like probably the best ever.

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:02.640
And plus on the factory scene, witch burnings,

02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:06.640
and then the massive blood splatter in the awesome epic Pyramid Head,

02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:09.640
which I'm thinking of being for Halloween.

02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:11.640
Awesome flick.

02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:14.640
Now you know why we fan-gasm over Pyramid Head all the time on this show.

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:15.640
He is sex.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.640
He just, he really is.

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.640
He has a lot of it with the nurses.

02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:23.640
And plus, not to mention, if you guys ever,

02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:29.640
okay, have any of you played the DDR Extreme for the US version on the PS2?

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.640
On the PS2, yes.

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:34.640
Extreme 1, yes.

02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:40.640
Okay, the ending song, the Silent Hill for the ending credits,

02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:42.640
very reminiscent to the soundtrack.

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:46.640
I think it's like the last song you'll lock in Extreme,

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:47.640
but it was very similar to me.

02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:50.640
I couldn't remember the first few times until the chorus came in.

02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:53.640
I'm like, deja vu.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:56.640
Yeah, I mean, it was pretty cool that they inserted that in the game.

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:59.640
Of course, that song originally comes from Silent Hill 3.

02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:01.640
It was like the theme song of that game.

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:05.640
But yeah, I remember they put it in DDR with a funny little video too.

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:08.640
And wasn't it Extreme 2 that had that?

02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:11.640
Because Extreme 1 had your reign from 4, if I remember right.

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:13.640
And the reason why I remember that...

02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:16.640
No, it was Extreme 1.

02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:18.640
It was. You know what, you're right, it was.

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:20.640
I remember that, though, that it also had your reign,

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:22.640
because that was a big thing for us here at OLR.

02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:24.640
We got to play that song before anyone else,

02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:26.640
and we had a ton of DDR people listening.

02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.640
That was like the night we broke through,

02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.640
and we actually got a lot of new listeners when we got that.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.640
So, anyhow.

02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:33.640
Yeah, I remember that.

02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:35.640
That was a very controversial game in the community, though,

02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:37.640
because they really changed the engine and all that stuff.

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.640
Anyway, sorry.

02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:45.640
Well, have you ever noticed there's a Pump It Up game for the PSP?

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:49.640
I had heard there was a Pump It Up game on the PSP.

02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:55.640
I found out on Playasia, and I'm like, what the heck?

02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:58.640
Okay, I can understand DDR on this thing, but not Pump It Up,

02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:01.640
because that takes five icons.

02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:04.640
And we got the four external sort of square.

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.640
I don't know what I'm supposed to use, like R.

02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:07.640
Well, what about the shoulder buttons?

02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.640
I assumed it was the shoulder button.

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.640
I mean, if you're going to play DDR on a handheld,

02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:14.640
Pump It Up makes sense to me.

02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:17.640
Especially because there's a ton of fans of that other...

02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:19.640
God damn, what's the Korean game?

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:20.640
The name escapes me.

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:21.640
DJ Maxx, thank you.

02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:24.640
There's huge fans of that game.

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.640
Yeah, even though I got to say that's a little bit harder,

02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:31.640
but okay, here's one thing I'd really love to see remade on the Wii

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.640
that Konami should really do,

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:36.640
especially with download content now available for Wii and everything,

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:37.640
the Guitar Hero.

02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:40.640
I mean, why doesn't, in 360 and PS3,

02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.640
why doesn't Konami try to re-release Beat Mania with the download content?

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:48.640
I mean, that would make a whole lot of sense.

02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:50.640
I would love that, but unfortunately,

02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.640
I think because of how Beat Mania 2 did,

02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:56.640
or I'm sorry, not Beat Mania 2, Beat Mania on the PS2 did,

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.640
I don't think they're in any hurry to put out a new Beat Mania game.

02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:01.640
I don't think it sold well enough for them.

02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:03.640
I had heard it exceeded expectations,

02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:05.640
but I could have always heard wrong,

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:06.640
because they never did do a second one.

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.640
If it sold that well, they would have done a second one.

02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:13.640
I mean, as far as I know, DDR Universe 2 did not sell that great

02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:15.640
compared to older DDR titles,

02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:16.640
but they still made a 3,

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.640
and it wasn't just a reskinned version of the other ones,

02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:23.640
because 2 was kind of just a reskinned Universe 1.

02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.640
Just thinking of DDR,

02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:29.640
haven't you noticed there hasn't been a single one out for the PS3?

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:32.640
They're still rehashing on the PS2.

02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:34.640
It is interesting there hasn't been one on the PS3,

02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:36.640
and I'm wondering if that's not going to be one of the things

02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:39.640
Konami pulls out of their hat at E3 this year,

02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:40.640
because you're right.

02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:45.640
The PS3 is one of those platforms that hasn't seen a DDR game on it yet.

02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:48.640
Maybe that will be where we start to see the download content and all that stuff.

02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:49.640
Who knows?

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.640
But I don't know.

02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:53.640
At the same time, I'm not going to hold my breath.

02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:55.640
Plus, here's one thing.

02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.640
I've been seeing tons of YouTube videos

02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:00.640
where people have been controlling Beat Mania

02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.640
using a guitar hero controller with the five keys mode.

02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:05.640
Pretty darn interesting.

02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:08.640
And then the scratch is the strum bar.

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.640
Pretty bored.

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:12.640
Let me ask you this.

02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:15.640
I would probably have to try it out, but I don't know.

02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:18.640
I'm not bored enough to set that all up.

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:20.640
If I'm going to play Beat Mania, I'm going to play it the way it was intended.

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:22.640
Let me ask you this, because the call's going a little long.

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:23.640
I've got to get some other calls.

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.640
I want to ask you this, because obviously you're a big music game fan.

02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:29.640
I want to ask you about this question that came up kind of earlier in the show

02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.640
about the whole guitar hero on the DS versus rock band on the PSP thing.

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:35.640
Are you interested in rock band on the PSP,

02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:37.640
or are you interested in guitar hero on the DS?

02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:39.640
What do you think?

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.640
I've actually bought the guitar hero DS,

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.640
and it's pretty darn interesting and pretty good for what it is.

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:51.640
I was surprised at the graphics for it for a DS game for guitar hero-wise,

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.640
and the sound quality was pretty darn good.

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.640
I think the style that they're going with,

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:59.640
the PSP version of rock band, that was pretty darn interesting.

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:05.640
You'd think they would try to mod, like, redo the guitar grip,

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.640
and then try to do some little quirky little drum set that you plug on top,

02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:12.640
and then you just hit it with your fingers,

02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:14.640
because I think that would be kind of fun.

02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:18.640
Yeah, but at the same time I like the idea that they're just doing an amplitude-type game

02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:20.640
that you're not going to need any of these stupid peripherals for.

02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:22.640
I kind of like that idea.

02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:26.640
Yeah, but that's also the same control scheme for DJ Max on the PSP,

02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.640
which I kind of suck at.

02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:33.640
I try it with the two-hand configuration like you would for Beatmania,

02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:35.640
and I still suck.

02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.640
I guess it's extremely hard even on the slow play mode.

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.640
I cannot do it.

02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:43.640
All right, well, DS Master, we've got to let you go so we can get to some more calls,

02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.640
but thank you so much for your opinions tonight,

02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:47.640
and have fun with the music games, okay?

02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:49.640
Oh, by the way, one more thing before I go.

02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.640
Hopefully EA and the whole gaming industry of America

02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.640
does not call for a bailout from Barack Obama.

02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:58.640
That would suck.

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:01.640
Do they need one? Maybe.

02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:02.640
Would they be eligible?

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:05.640
Probably midway.

02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:07.640
They need more than a bailout.

02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:09.640
They need a freaking water pump.

02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:11.640
All right, DS Master, I've got to let you go,

02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:13.640
but thank you so much for the call.

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:14.640
Take care, buddy.

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:15.640
Keep going and keep rocking the good shows.

02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:17.640
Thank you very much.

02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:22.640
All right, Dark Soccer, you seem like you're dying to comment on the bailout message.

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.640
No.

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:25.640
All right.

02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.640
Are you guys talking about the...

02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:29.640
I would think I was just saying them all.

02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:31.640
Am I seeing a glitch in Ninja Blade here?

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.640
Because the monster has no health left,

02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:36.640
and I keep hitting it, and it's not dying.

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:37.640
No, you just suck.

02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:38.640
All right, let's go to the call.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.640
It did the Mega Man 3 trick.

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:45.640
Uh-oh, did it cut off?

02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:47.640
Okay, whoever...

02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:48.640
I have to explain this trick.

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:49.640
What?

02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:50.640
Hurry, because we've got to call on the line.

02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:52.640
Okay, we'll call her going.

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:54.640
Okay, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:55.640
Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:58.640
Hey, DJ Tyrant. I haven't heard you on the show in a long time. What's up?

02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:03.640
Hey, not much. I'm trying out the Skype for iPhone app. It seems to work pretty well.

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:05.640
Whoa, you're calling us from iPhone right now?

02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.640
Yeah.

02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:09.640
Wow, not too shabby. All right, I forgot that that's available now.

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:12.640
So those of you with iPhones, you can Skype us during the show on your iPhones.

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:14.640
Thank you for reminding us of that. I have to check that out.

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:17.640
It only works on Wi-Fi, though. Remember that.

02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.640
That's true. Still, that's, you know, your regular Skype will only work with an internet connection, too.

02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:23.640
What's on your mind?

02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:30.640
That's true. Just, I know it's all the talk of today, but DSI, I really enjoy mine personally.

02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:37.640
I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade. I got to play it last week at an event I got invited to,

02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:45.640
and I don't know, I think it's a pretty good upgrade, but I can see it's not for everyone, definitely.

02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.640
What about it makes it such a great upgrade?

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:58.640
I like, I really like the screens. The controls are much better. Like, the D-pad and the buttons just in general feel a lot better and more sturdy.

02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:03.640
Because the D-pad was really floaty on the light, I thought.

02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:09.640
Sometimes I keep forgetting this is actually the third DS now we've gotten between DS Fat and DS Lite. I sometimes forget that.

02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.640
Anyhow, do you still work in games retail?

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:13.640
No, I don't.

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:16.640
Okay, I thought for some reason you did, but then I also heard you'd moved on.

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:22.640
I don't know if you still know people there or what have you, but have you heard what the reception to this has been at all?

02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:28.640
I haven't heard too much. Yeah, I haven't really heard anything.

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:31.640
Alright, sorry. My bad for asking.

02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:33.640
No worries.

02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:39.640
So, okay, so you're more of a fan of the DSI then. Is there anything that you're looking forward to?

02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:45.640
Like, we've seen some announcements recently of the Zelda Spirit Tracks and so on. What are you looking forward to from Nintendo on DS?

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:54.640
Definitely the Zelda game. I honestly am looking forward to these new play control games because I missed out on them on the GameCube.

02:40:54.640 --> 02:41:00.640
I'm kind of looking forward to them and they're not too badly priced either, which is a good thing.

02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:03.640
Cheap is good. You're right, cheap is always a good thing. I don't mind that.

02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:09.640
And of course the DSI where I really hope that that takes off like the App Store has on the iPhone.

02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:14.640
I know it's not open though. That's really going to, I think, hurt it in the long run though.

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:21.640
I tend to agree, but at the same time, you know, it is a double-edged sword and I could see the other side of the argument where,

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:27.640
well, look at all the shit that's on the iPhone store because there's some real crap apps on the iPhone.

02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:31.640
It's so hard to comb through there and find some decent games sometimes.

02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:37.640
And you think there's supposed to be some quality control out there, but it's not much. It is not much.

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:44.640
So I guess maybe, you know, by closing it off, Nintendo will release quote-unquote quality apps on the DSI,

02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:47.640
but at the same time, some of these games don't sound that quality.

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:49.640
Well, look at the WiiWare stuff.

02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:52.640
Yeah, I guess that's true. Is there anything on WiiWare you enjoy?

02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:59.640
I don't know if you really enjoy the fun. I see Crystal Chronicles, or not Crystal Chronicles, whatever.

02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:01.640
My Life is King?

02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:08.640
Yeah, and The Lost Winds has been really good. I haven't really bought anything since then because of the whole storage issue,

02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:12.640
but now that they fixed that, I might start buying again.

02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:17.640
Yeah, I actually finally updated the firmware this week and put some games on my SD card,

02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.640
and I have like 500 blocks free on my Wii now. I'm just like, wow, this isn't real.

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:26.640
I don't know if I'm going to go on a buying binge because I already bought a new sound system that sent me back a lot of money.

02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.640
But it's nice to know I have the space available when something comes out on the Wii that I must have.

02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:38.640
Yeah, but I agree with you that I really hope they have some sort of support like the PS3 and the PSP.

02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:44.640
I have a bad feeling I'm just dreaming with that, but you know it can be done.

02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.640
Look at the Nintendo channel that streams DS demos to your DS. It can be done.

02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:53.640
They just don't want to do it, or they're leaving it in their hat to unveil at a later conference.

02:42:53.640 --> 02:43:00.640
Yeah, I mean that got me to buy Rhythm Heaven because they released a demo the day they gave it out at GDC,

02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:03.640
and I tried it and I was like, well, this is a game I have to pick up.

02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.640
Yeah, you know what, I played it at PAX and I remember really enjoying it.

02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:10.640
I did not realize the demo was on Nintendo channel and I might have to go check that out.

02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:15.640
Yeah, sometimes really good games sneak on there. They don't really announce what goes out there.

02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:18.640
They really don't. People got to keep a better eye on that.

02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.640
Alright, well, Jimmy, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in tonight, but any quick closing thoughts?

02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:24.640
Thanks for having me on.

02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:26.640
No problem. Any quick closing thoughts?

02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:29.640
Um, I can't think of anything right now.

02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:31.640
Alright, that's alright. Live radio is a lot of pressure.

02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:32.640
Take care, buddy.

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:33.640
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:38.640
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:41.640
We'll probably take one or two more calls and then we're going to call it a night.

02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:43.640
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:44.640
Hi.

02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:45.640
Hi.

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:46.640
It's Deathwishing.

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:47.640
Hi, Deathwishing.

02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:48.640
What's up?

02:43:48.640 --> 02:44:01.640
Um, well, first of all, I'm burnout on my 360 and second of all, I'm rejecting that for one month because Operation Flashpoint, the new one's coming out I think next month.

02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:05.640
Okay, hold on. Back up. Aren't you the same guy that was having the points problems earlier?

02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:06.640
Yeah.

02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:14.640
Okay, so obviously that's all fixed and Nintendo. Xbox was very kind to you and all that. What did you end up running out and buying with those points?

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:35.640
Um, I bought some rock band songs, my Call of Duty maps, and then with the extra points, oh, and I bought, my extra points, I bought one rock band song and a pack of burnout cars that came with a legendary cars pack which has like a DeLorean, like Back to the Future.

02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:37.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah.

02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:39.640
It has the Manhattan, you know.

02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:40.640
The Dukes of Hazzard.

02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:47.640
The Dukes of Hazzard one, but it has a Mexican flag on it.

02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:51.640
My other question, was one of the rock band songs you bought Don't Stop Believin'?

02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:52.640
No, I didn't buy that.

02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.640
Fail.

02:44:53.640 --> 02:45:09.640
I bought, like, Trash Unreal from Against Me, Come On, Come On from the Von Bondies, The Joker from Steve Miller, Sick Sick Sick from Queens of the Stone Age, and My Curse from Kill, Switch, and Gauge.

02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.640
Now, look, those songs are all fine and dandy, but it needs more epic classic rock.

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.640
Um, thing is, I would buy classic rock, but there's no Led Zeppelin.

02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:26.640
Maybe, that's one of those bands that could put out their own game, like Aerosmith and Metallica.

02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.640
I don't like Aerosmith. In fact, I hate Aerosmith.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:35.640
Well, I'm just saying, though, they were able to put out their own game. You know, we can argue about the success of that game.

02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:37.640
Lead singer looks like a beat chick.

02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:43.640
Alright, look, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight? I asked you the question about the points. You were talking about...

02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:49.640
Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rise, I think it's Dragon Rise or something. Remember the old Operation Flashpoint? Did you ever play it?

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:51.640
What system was it on?

02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:52.640
It was a PC game.

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:53.640
And it was Xbox, I think.

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:55.640
And Xbox, same thing.

02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:01.640
I don't recall this game, but I'm going to look up and see if I get screenshots, because I'm a very visual person, sometimes that jogs my memory.

02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:03.640
I doubt it. It's a Call of Duty type of game.

02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:12.640
It's a military simulator, actually. It's like one of the more... I think, from what I remember, it was like one shot, pretty much, and we were dead.

02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:22.640
Hmm. You know, surprisingly enough, I think I saw this game, like, once. So, what about... are they making a new one, or what's up?

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:25.640
Uh, yeah. Sequel's coming out. I think it's next month.

02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:27.640
End of next month.

02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:30.640
I'm not sure, though, but it's end of next month.

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:32.640
Operation Flashpoint. Dragon Rising.

02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.640
Yeah, and it's just like... it's like what I like.

02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:45.640
I want these shoot... like, I'm this guy who wants these shooters that aren't... like, I'm tired of kind of seeing these really Call of Duty-esque super arcadey.

02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:49.640
I get shot. Oh, look. I sit in the corner, suck my thumb. I'm okay.

02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:55.640
I love this, because it's like you get shot, you bleed out while moving around, or you're downed.

02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.640
And I love games, because it has a medic system. That's simply it.

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:07.640
Um, you're a fan of shooters, and something that caught my eye this week was some of the screens from the new Wolfenstein game.

02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:09.640
What do you think of that?

02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:11.640
Is that a good... aw, was that like...

02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:13.640
It is in my pants.

02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:15.640
Okay.

02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:17.640
I wasn't gonna say that, but there you go.

02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:19.640
I think it looks like crap, but, you know, that's...

02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.640
Shut up. Okay, can you play a gag in his mouth?

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.640
Alright, well, he's playing a game.

02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:29.640
Wolfenstein Enemy Territory was so great, and it was free, too.

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:31.640
What do you think of this new one? Is it gonna...

02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:33.640
Yeah, but that's Enemy Territory, that's not...

02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:36.640
Shut up! Is it gonna make everybody talk Wolfenstein again, or what?

02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:41.640
It looks like an updated version of Wolfenstein. It looks like Wolfenstein to today's standards.

02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:45.640
Ironsight, sprinting, you know, and then, all I notice is they better keep it class-based.

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:51.640
They better keep it class-based, and they better keep it in that objective, like, online campaign stuff that I saw in Enemy Territory.

02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:57.640
Where I will go to a school, go up to the principal, hit him in the balls, and then laugh.

02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:00.640
And then go home and make myself a sandwich.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:06.640
Alright, what about the whole Hitler robot? That's what I would like to see make a comeback in Wolfenstein.

02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:08.640
Hitler robot is the boss.

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:11.640
Sounds like an idea. Sounds like a plan.

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:18.640
Don't you remember the old-school Wolfenstein? Like, I don't know, you might be a little young, but the old, old-school Wolfenstein game.

02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:22.640
Like, which one? Wolfenstein 3D or Wolfenstein, like, 2D?

02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:25.640
Okay, not that old-school. Yeah, Wolfenstein 3D.

02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:34.640
Uh, yes and no. I do remember there being a robot, but maybe I just couldn't tell if it was Hitler because I was, like, too stupid to know it was Hitler yet.

02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:41.640
And plus, you know what, he wasn't the boss in the shareware one that most people played. He had to have the full one to see that.

02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.640
Hitler robot.

02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:49.640
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail the point from what you'd called in to talk about, but I just remembered I saw those Wolfenstein.

02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.640
Because, you know, I was a fan. I may not be the biggest shooter fan, but I loved Wolfenstein 3D.

02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:55.640
I love Wolfenstein 2.

02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:56.640
So, there you go.

02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:57.640
Alright, well, uh...

02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:02.640
That's the list of the games I love. Wolfenstein and, uh, Delta Force Black Hawk Down.

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:06.640
Alright, well, we're gonna need you to call back when that game comes out, because I need to hear it from a shooter fan.

02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:09.640
Because I don't follow a lot of the shooters, so I need to know if the game's worth...

02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:10.640
I follow everything.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:11.640
Worth crossing over for.

02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:14.640
Alright, Deathwishing, any final thoughts before we let you go?

02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:15.640
Um...

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.640
I still play Street Fighter IV. It's still awesome.

02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:19.640
It is still awesome.

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:22.640
Think they'll unveil any secret characters. Downloadable.

02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:23.640
Or think it's just a dream.

02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:26.640
I think they need to get that tournament mode out quicker.

02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:27.640
Alright.

02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:29.640
If my principal's gonna get hurt faster.

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:31.640
Deathwishing, we gotta let you go.

02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:34.640
Be careful when you threaten violence on the radio. Don't do it.

02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:35.640
Alright.

02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:36.640
See you, Deathwishing. Take care, buddy.

02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:37.640
Allegedly. Bye.

02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:38.640
Bye. Allegedly.

02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:39.640
Yeah, good, good.

02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:40.640
Throw that in there.

02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:41.640
Throw that in there. Allegedly.

02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:42.640
Alright, uh...

02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:44.640
We have time for one more call?

02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:45.640
One more quick call.

02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:47.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:49.640
Uh, this is Spazinator.

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:51.640
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:53.640
Uh, yeah, um...

02:49:53.640 --> 02:50:02.640
I just wanted to get your input on the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate.

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:12.640
I was wondering, compared to Rock Band, do you think they're kind of whoring out Guitar Hero a little bit?

02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:13.640
Yeah, just a bit.

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.640
Uh, yeah, they're whoring it out a lot, but at the same time, they can kind of get away with it right now.

02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:25.640
Because, you know, Best Buys and all these stores have sections upon sections dedicated to these games because they sell.

02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:28.640
I'm not a big fan of the artist-based games.

02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:32.640
I am not a big fan of them. I don't think they need the big fanfare they're getting.

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:38.640
I think if they were released as, like, a CD and put in the CD rack or what have you, they would be a little more...

02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:41.640
I don't know. I kind of see that could be the way it's going at some point.

02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:47.640
But, I don't know. I think at some point, the market is going to crack at some point and it's...

02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:49.640
People are going to start rejecting it.

02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:58.640
And it's all going to come crashing down. Like a little leak in the dam, suddenly it's all going to come crashing down.

02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:05.640
Yeah, I was thinking more or less the same thing. I mean, although it's kind of a different genre altogether,

02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:09.640
you kind of saw the same thing with the Tony Hawk games.

02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:15.640
I mean, they were releasing iteration after iteration with that series.

02:51:15.640 --> 02:51:22.640
And basically, like what happened to that series, people kind of gave up on that series in favor of skates.

02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:31.640
I mean, you can't always draw a few parallels between the Tony Hawk series and Guitar Hero, almost.

02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:37.640
You know, I will say this, though. I think Rock Band 2 has really succeeded with the store.

02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:40.640
And, you know, I think it's succeeded in a place where Guitar Hero hasn't.

02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:45.640
Granted, Guitar Hero has released a lot of downloadable content and songs,

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:49.640
but the place where Rock Band 2 has got them is that they've done it consistently.

02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:52.640
They've consistently put out a lot of songs on their store.

02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:59.640
And, you know what? Very few games can I say that six months after release, I'm still playing it at least once a week.

02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:02.640
You know, very few games can I say that.

02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:12.640
Yeah, yeah. In fact, I'm checking the Rock Band store constantly, and to some degree I even do the same with Guitar Hero.

02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:19.640
And occasionally, you know, I do see some songs on the Guitar Hero store that I do like,

02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:27.640
like Blyton Allen's No Rain and whatnot, but compared to Rock Band, you know,

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:35.640
Guitar Hero really doesn't have a whole lot that I would consider going out and getting compared to Rock Band, you know.

02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:38.640
But, again, that's just me.

02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:47.640
You know, at least in my opinion, it seems like Rock Band has a better structure of music, though.

02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:55.640
I think Rock Band's got the better music, too, but I do understand that Guitar Hero has to lean towards more guitar-driven songs.

02:52:55.640 --> 02:53:01.640
Sometimes, you know, that might not necessarily be the same stuff I listen to, but I like Rock Band because you do more band-based songs, you know.

02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:05.640
And some have guitar solos, but some have drum solos, some have vocal.

02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:08.640
Like, Don't Stop Believin'. Not a song really notable for its...

02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:13.640
Well, it does have a pretty bitchin' guitar solo, and it's really fuckin' hard on Rock Band Expert, by the way.

02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:19.640
I can't do that part, but, like, most people know Don't Stop Believin' for the vocals.

02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:26.640
You know, you don't really get songs like that in Rock Band. I mean, in Guitar Hero.

02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:36.640
Yeah. Now, with me, one thing I noticed is, well, kind of like you, I can't really do the Expert level stuff yet.

02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:43.640
I'm still getting started on the Medium level because I'm kind of new to the whole music-y thing.

02:53:43.640 --> 02:54:03.640
But, you know, at least with Guitar Hero, since they're more or less emulating the Rock Band sets, you would think that, even though the name is Guitar Hero, they would encompass some other varieties of music.

02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:08.640
You know, it's probably some of the guitar-heavy stuff, you know?

02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:21.640
Yeah. I don't know, though. Guitar Hero just... Guitar Hero feels like a bit of a scattered mess right now, and I hope if they're going to do another big Guitar Hero, what, five this year as their big game, I hope they find some focus.

02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:26.640
But, Spaznier, we gotta let you go because we're running out of time. We want to end tonight so we can get to our afterbirth and so on.

02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:29.640
Do you have any quick final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:35.640
Uh, yeah. Final fantasy, you know, whoever rules, well, sucks. No, just kidding.

02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:39.640
Yeah, yeah. All right. Get off the show. All right. See you, Spaznier. Thanks for the call.

02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.640
All right. Take care. Have a good one.

02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:42.640
All right. Bye.

02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:51.640
By the way, I didn't mention during my gaming week this week, I actually went back to World of Warcraft this week because I'm a big fat addict, but I haven't been playing that much.

02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:56.640
Look, we got one more call coming in. I want to take it because I noticed it was a name I haven't heard from in a while. I want to let him on the show.

02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:38.640
Hi, you're on Orange

02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:00.640
It's Brad from Pod Culture.

02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:08.640
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How's Dollhouse going? I've heard Dollhouse, and I know you do your Dollhouse show, too. I've heard Dollhouse has really picked up in the last three weeks.

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:10.640
Oh, yes, it has.

02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:17.640
I need to go back and catch up because I want to watch the first couple episodes and then I just kind of got distracted and was watching other stuff, but I heard it got really good.

02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:23.640
Yeah, if you kind of gave it up, it's definitely picked up some steam.

02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:26.640
All right. Well, I think you still watch it all on Hulu, right?

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:27.640
I believe so, yeah.

02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:34.640
All right, I'm going to have to go check that out. Well, look, I know you didn't call to talk about Dollhouse so that you probably would anyway. What did you call in to talk about tonight, Brad?

02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:45.640
Actually, I don't know if you'd mentioned it on the show before, but I've got an iPhone game that is just great.

02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:46.640
Hmm, what's that?

02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:48.640
It's Zombieville, USA.

02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:52.640
I'm interested already. What's in Zombieville, USA?

02:55:52.640 --> 02:56:01.640
It's just this little side scroller cartoony shooting zombies game. Three simple controls, right, left, and you tap in the middle and you shoot.

02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:05.640
Is it a bloody game? Do you get decapitated zombies and all that fun stuff?

02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:07.640
You do, but it's kind of cartoony.

02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:15.640
I can deal with cartoon violence. I don't like blood orgy. We already had the blood orgy discussion earlier in the show. Cartoony violence, especially with zombies, is okay.

02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:24.640
Oh, it's great. It's pretty much the same level over and over, but at the end of each level you can find cash, you upgrade your weapons.

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:26.640
Is there a cost with said game?

02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:28.640
It's like two or three bucks.

02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:32.640
It's not that bad. Is there a demo or a movie or anything I can see online to get a taste for it?

02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:35.640
I'm not 100% certain.

02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:39.640
You're not the developer. I shouldn't grill you on this stuff, but I'm just curious how you found it or what have you.

02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:45.640
Well, there you go. Check that out if you're interested in some zombie killing.

02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:51.640
It's good to hear about some good iPhone games, especially when we're talking about all the crap that's out there on the marketplace as well.

02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:55.640
It's a good way to waste a lot of time.

02:56:55.640 --> 02:57:01.640
Yes, I've wasted a lot of time with some of those games, like WordFu and some of those iPhone games they have.

02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.640
Great time wasters, especially when I'm lying in bed, but I don't want to go to sleep just yet.

02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:08.640
I'll reach over and grab my phone and play a couple games and it'll make me tired.

02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:13.640
Alright, Brad, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up. Any quick thoughts for our listeners?

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:14.640
Later on.

02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:16.640
Any final thoughts?

02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:18.640
Nope.

02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:20.640
Well, take care and have a good one, buddy.

02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:21.640
Later on.

02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:25.640
Alright, that was our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad, here on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:32.640
That was definitely, definitely the last call, but he hadn't been on the show in a while and he's a good friend of the show and does his own indie podcast.

02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:39.640
We'd like to support our fellow indie podcasters, but as for tonight's show, it's got to be coming to a close.

02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:43.640
So, is there any other last minute stories that we didn't get to earlier?

02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:44.640
Yes, Loki.

02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.640
It kind of ties into what we were talking about a little bit earlier.

02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:48.640
Sure.

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:57.640
Apparently, there has been a, what is it, a kind of like a slide that had been leaked out.

02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:05.640
It was during one of the GDC, I guess one of their conferences that they had with Dan Teasdale.

02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:12.640
And he did a panel called Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Design Lessons Learned from Rock Band.

02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:24.640
And it's interesting, though, because he then released a PDF version, or they released a PDF version of the session and all the slides are on there.

02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:31.640
It had an earlier version of the slide that had been omitted from the actual show.

02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:36.640
And it reveals Lego Rock Band.

02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:38.640
I heard about this.

02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:43.640
I think Tiger Claw sent me a link to this and I neglected to get to it in the Twitter part, but okay.

02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:48.640
But it's interesting, though, they're also mentioning the PSP Rock Band is on there as well.

02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:50.640
The Beatles Rock Band.

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:55.640
And then there's a ton of Guitar Hero stuff, which I'm really whoring that stuff out.

02:58:55.640 --> 02:59:03.640
But they have Guitar Hero Modern Hits, Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits, Guitar Hero, well now Smash Hits.

02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:10.640
Guitar Hero Arcade, which I guess maybe they're porting the arcade version over, which I don't know why because it was three.

02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:13.640
Guitar Hero Fiving, Guitar Hero Band Hero.

02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:19.640
And then there's Guitar Hero Mobile 2, and Mystery Game that's also on mobile.

02:59:19.640 --> 02:59:25.640
And I know everyone says, oh my god, both companies are whoring the franchise out.

02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:33.640
And yeah, Lego Rock Band I can understand is maybe not, I don't know, it's not exactly the way they go.

02:59:33.640 --> 02:59:39.640
But the way I look at it, it's a way to introduce Rock Band to younger kids and you don't have to buy it.

02:59:39.640 --> 02:59:43.640
It's not like it's going to have songs in there that you're really probably going to need to buy.

02:59:43.640 --> 02:59:46.640
They're only going to be available in Lego Rock Band.

02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:51.640
Whereas the Guitar Hero games, you can't port that shit over.

02:59:51.640 --> 02:59:56.640
If you buy Metallica, well those Metallica songs are stuck on the Metallica game.

02:59:56.640 --> 03:00:03.640
So you can't really bring that over, which I think is where the developers differ the most.

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:10.640
That's why I kind of respect Rock Band a little bit more because at least if you're going to put out a song, or anything they do to their track packs obviously,

03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:13.640
those are also optional since they're all available online.

03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:21.640
It's an option, you don't have to buy it, but if you do buy it you can import it into your game and it all seamlessly works.

03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:24.640
Whereas Guitar Hero, I gotta have a stack of discs.

03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:28.640
That's it. Oh, that's it for that story at least.

03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:36.640
We also talked a little bit about Unreal Tournament 3 and how they had a mod for that to play in another video game, like Sonic the Hedgehog.

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:42.640
Well, Team Fortress 2, someone's made a map that's sort of like a Mario Kart track, which is kind of neat.

03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:47.640
But, I mean, it's definitely not based on a real Mario Kart track, it just kind of has the graphics of it.

03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:50.640
So that's kind of neat.

03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:54.640
And then, let's see here.

03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:59.640
There was another website, I guess, WeOperaSDK.com.

03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:07.640
They've released a Twitter, which is a WeRapid blogging, I don't know if it's, I'm assuming it's like Twitter,

03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:13.640
but it's their own website that's formatted for the Wii.

03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:15.640
Neat.

03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:18.640
Could have been that DSI message board, right?

03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:19.640
Could have been.

03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:24.640
And yeah, I guess they're going to have different things that they've incorporated to this.

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:33.640
IRC style commands, smileys, possible integration with the Wii message board, I guess email updates or something like that.

03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:38.640
Web skinning, that sort of stuff. That's neat.

03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:41.640
That's it.

03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:45.640
Alright, well we need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up the show tonight.

03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:51.640
DarkSakura, you've been awfully quiet over there in the corner, poking away, talking to some of our AIM listeners and so on.

03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:53.640
Any final thoughts tonight?

03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:57.640
Yawn, you look like you're going to, I don't think you're going to nap.

03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:00.640
If you go and lie down, you're going to go to sleep.

03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:03.640
I'm pretty tired. We spent three and a half hours in IKEA.

03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:04.640
Oh my god.

03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:11.640
We went to eat, and the intention was to spend two, and then we ran into some people that Becky knew, because I went with Becky.

03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:14.640
And I sort of know one of them.

03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:17.640
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but Swedish meatballs.

03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:18.640
And shiny.

03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.640
And Swedish meatballs.

03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.640
Well, that's what I had. And there was shiny, there was so much shiny, I kept going, ooh, shiny.

03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:24.640
Ooh, shiny.

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:28.640
And then staring at stuff, so, hi, Kia, evil.

03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:32.640
Alright. Um, the doctor, thank you so much for being here tonight.

03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:37.640
And, you know, you definitely joined in on the conversation, and we always appreciate having you here on the show.

03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:38.640
Please come back again.

03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:39.640
Woo!

03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:41.640
And thanks for participating in tonight's Listless and all that fun stuff.

03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:43.640
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:47.640
Um, in honor of Rice Princess. Poop.

03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:49.640
Why isn't she here tonight? Shame on her.

03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:50.640
I don't know, she didn't get my text.

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.640
You didn't, I didn't get your text either. I think you need to check your cell phone company.

03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:56.640
You need to call them and yell at them.

03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:03.640
Um, my final thought is, I need food. I'm very hungry. I'm, like, dying of hunger pains.

03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:05.640
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought.

03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:07.640
I don't know, I don't have anything.

03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:09.640
Alright, boy, aren't you boring.

03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:10.640
Yes, I am.

03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:13.640
How is Ninja Blade? You've been playing that for, like, three hours now during the show.

03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:18.640
It's frustrating, because you die pretty easy in it, so it's hard.

03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:20.640
And I'm playing on normal difficulty in it.

03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:34.640
Um, the thing is, I, as you probably saw, there was a glitch, a level-ending glitch where I couldn't defeat the boss because he ran out of life and I just sat there slashing at the dead corpse and it wouldn't trigger the event that I needed it to trigger.

03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:40.640
So I had to restart there, but, um, it's okay. It's alright. It's neat.

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:45.640
They've got a lot of really over-the-top stuff going on, but, um, it's a neat game.

03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:47.640
I'll probably finish it.

03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:52.640
Okay. Alright, well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:56.640

03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:08.640

Or mention us on your Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff.

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:17.640
I'm looking at Twitter right now and looking at some of the at OLR messages and DJ Ratchet says I'm listening to OLR and laughing my butt off.

03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:19.640
Well, I laughed a lot tonight too, so thank you.

03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:23.640
DJ Tyrant is pimping his appearance on the show tonight. We appreciate that. Hey, hey.

03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:27.640
So, uh, thank you guys so much for, uh, all of that, supporting the show.

03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:30.640
You guys are awesome. We do it for you guys for free every week.

03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:33.640
And we'll do it all again next week. How's that sound?

03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:35.640
Yay.

03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:37.640
Alright.

03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:45.640
Well, we'll see you in one week here on Orange Launch Radio. Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's Dark Soccer, he's Loki, he's the Dokta, and we're out of here. See you next week.

03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:17.640
Orange Launch Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Launch Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway. See you next week.
