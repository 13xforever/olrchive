Orange Lounge Radio
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco
Tonight, March 29th, 2009
Will OnLive be the next great console?
Could Netflix come out for PlayStation 3 and Wii?
And the classic 8-bit game is re-released for the iPhone
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We're back after a week vacation
To talk more about video games, video gaming, gaming culture
And the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week
As well as my awesome co-hosts
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Hi
How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?
I am
You are, because you is? I don't know
I be
Because you be
Alright, also joining us tonight
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
Hi, how's it going?
Good, how are you?
Could have been better, because
Yeah?
Yeah, Adobe Bro...
I don't know what it is, it's just like an ongoing theme of my laptop
An update from the manufacturer
Like, for example, Microsoft's update or whatever
Or Adobe, even Flash
Is breaking something
So, like, Windows update broke my computer
And I had to actually reinstall everything
And now, Flash update broke the Flash media encoder
Yeah, just to kind of explain a little bit for listeners
Especially those on the podcast
We do tape live, obviously
And live radio has interesting advantages
As in, we get to interact with you guys live
And disadvantages, as to things don't always work the way we plan
So, Loki is trying to show
Something on
Justin.tv, our video feed
Which we'll get into a little bit later
But he wants to do it, because for whatever reason
His laptop is not, suddenly decided
It didn't want to cooperate with the video anymore
Yeah, it wants to do audio, but no video
Yeah, it's weird, so
But you know, this type of thing is not limited to PCs
I'll tell you what, my laptop, my MacBook
Has been out of commission for, like, a month
Because an Apple update
Screwed up my boot up
Like, it'll get to the gray screen
And I get the spinning wheel, and it just freezes there
And from everything I've been told
I just need to reinstall OS X
I don't know where the hell I put it
I bought my laptop a year and a half ago
Yeah, stupid me for losing it, right
But now I have to find a friend's disk
To install it off of
So, yeah, I'm out of, I can't use a laptop right now
So, stinks
Alright
So anyhow, let's get into
Some, how was your gaming week?
We always like to start off the show with
How was your gaming week, so let's do that
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
For a little while, it actually was non-existent
Given that I had a mid-term
Last week, and lots of school crap
To do
But I did actually
Play Cooking Mama for
iPhone, which is
It's only got a few recipes
On it, so it's super short
But I like the control on it better than on the DS
It was actually pretty fun
So that's one game that translates itself very
Very well for iPhone
And for those that don't remember, DarkSakura loves her Cooking Mama
On DS
And
I actually downloaded another game
That let me find the name of it
Because it's also on iPhone
Really, a lot of my gaming has been iPhone-based lately
Except for Last Night, which I'll get into
In just a second
It's called LightBike, and it's a free
Lightcycle game
Like in Tron
So it's pretty cool
And then
I wouldn't say this is a game, but it's a fun little app
As I've been playing with my koi pond lately
And
Also, as I'm
Being reminded
Via hint, hint, hint
Is I did actually
Review Cooking Mama
On AvengersTower.com
So if you want to check it out
You can see my full review there
No, wait a minute, not Orangelaunchradio.com
You review games over on
Giggling Girls site, but you won't do it
I'll copy it over! I'm just messing
We're getting Tiara over, hopefully to do game reviews
As well, right? For us
Hopefully, yes, thumbs up, good
There is hope in the positive direction
She plays a lot of games I never get around to playing
So I like reading her reviews
Last night was all about
The Rufus Belly
For Street Fighter IV
No, last night at my house
Oh lordy
We got it on with video games
In a big way
My husband and I, and no it wasn't anything kinky
Got it on, huh?
With video games? Sick
Hush, hush, hush
Last night we decided
We were going to totally
Go for the PC Engine fun
So we broke out our PC Engine
Core graphics
So we could play our Japanese Hu-Cards
And then we broke out the
Turbo Duo
Which we've got to play the import
CDs
We found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone
We're so happy
My copy of Space Fantasy Zone however
Has a hole in it
Not a hole where the spindle goes
But a hole in the disc
Therefore we got to the first
Boss
How does that even happen? I don't know
There's shit in my house
We got to the first boss and is like
Game over, I quit, you win
Game over, no more
And for people who don't know
Space Fantasy Zone
Because the
Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone
Are set in the same universe
It's basically Fantasy Zone from the
Space Harrier behind the
Player perspective
So it's pretty cool
And it has remixes of
All the old Fantasy Zone music done in
Sort of that Space Harrier style
And I'll have to
Actually bring you tracks to play
On this show sometime Rob, they're really cool
And so
I went, now this game is also
A prototype, they did not release
It, they had just like
Base cover artwork for it and it never
As far as I'm aware, never got
An official release and so
I've been racking my brain trying
To find some way to burn
A new copy of the game but hell
If I know how to burn multi session you know
Audio and
Data weird compilation
I found how to do it but it's a lot of hard work
And I'm lazy
Let me read some comments from chat real quick
Here at chat.orangelandradio.com
If you're listening live on this Sunday evening
Here on All Games Radio where we broadcast every Sunday night
Live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
We chat at chat.orangelandradio.com
And there's of course some comments to
DarkSakura talking about the
Hole in her disc
Goldanthro in chat says a hole in the disc?
Mmm disc sex
Since you know you're talking about getting it on and all
Andrew says holy disc
But he forgot
He forgot the Batman part. Holy disc Batman
To be specific
It wasn't actually a physical hole through it
I found out
But somehow or another on both sides of the
Disc
The
Covering on it had been scratched
Off
So maybe it's just something that
It was clamped on
Or poked on or something I don't know
In a box or something I have no idea
By the way the chat is also reminding me
Since you're talking about getting it
Since you're talking about getting it on with video games
And all that I forgot to play something before the show tonight
The following program is intended
For mature audiences
And there you go
Just so you know don't say we didn't warn you
Alright anything else in your gaming week besides such
Nerdy PC Engine retro
Fun? Oh there's a lot more
Well it was all PC Engine though nerdy
Fun
So we took off some of the games that we're playing
We put in Dracula X, Ys, Book 1 and 2
Freaking epic
Um
We played Legend of the Valkyries
Son Son
Twinbee, we broke out our copy of
Twinbee
And um
What else did we play? God
Cause I put pictures up on the gallery
I took a picture of my foot next to our
PC Engine core graphics
So you can see how little the PC Engine core graphics
Are on my foot
We also played
Final lap
Twin
Victory run
Keith Courage, no we didn't play Keith Courage
Cause that game is crap
Adventure Island, we played Adventure Island
Which is pretty fun
So yeah we were getting on with the
Hudson play last night
It was pretty cool
Good times
Lots of classic gaming
Alright folks before we get into Loki's
Gaming week here
Justin TV is now up if you're listening live
And Loki I'm assuming you're going to talk about what's going on here on Justin TV
While you're talking about your gaming week
Yeah basically
Like I said I've been playing Grand Theft Auto
Mainly Lost in Damned cause that's all I play
But um
Oh yeah I forgot
This is my bosses 360
Well technically it's my 360 but it's the one that he
Uses cause I own 5 of them
For some reason but this is my old 360
It's modded
So I figured out how to hack
Grand Theft Auto 4
Basically because
Rockstar is so lazy when it comes to
Programming that they literally use
Files that have been around since you know
Oh and it froze
For a second there
Phone call
Anyway so basically
Uses the same PC files and stuff
So you can edit it the same way as you'd edit
Like you know handling files and that kind of thing
So for example I can
Kick that motorcycle really hard
And it will go flying
Cause I edited
The physics
The punching and stuff it's just fun
Cause my boss he's
Oh they're going into orbit
They seriously will punch a person into flying into orbit
Here I know this is horrible
Oh my god they just disappeared
Like
Sorry I know this is crappy radio
That's awesome
That is fantastic
I love it
I'm sure this will be in the archives as well
For those listening on the radio
We'll play it during break
But there's a lot more stuff you can tweak
Basically you can edit it like you can edit the PC version
If you know how to do it
And yeah
We've played it online
Between the five of us
That play Grand Theft Auto
My boss he needs all the help he can get
And you can't actually cheat
Because it's funny the way the game works
Say for example we originally
Beefed up his weapons
To make him really overpowered
Because he kind of needs that help
And we got a weird side effect
Was anybody that got near him
Would get the same kind of upgrades
To their weapons
So it kind of cancels each other out
The only thing that doesn't affect
Vehicle handling if he gets into a bus
They're basically like rockets now
They just go really fast and smash through everything
That won't affect other people
And also physics on the weapons
Like the punching I was just doing
That won't affect other people
And if you try to punch another player that you're playing with
It won't affect them either
It'll just be like a normal punch
So it's basically just to fuck around with
And this one I made a new one
To kind of demonstrate some of the crazy crap you can do in it
But it's basically just like the PC version
Reading some comments from chat
Because the live chatters are kind of watching this whole thing
And maybe I can describe
This for the folks only listening to this on the podcast version
Dark Tetsuya says
So now it's Hancock the video game
Death Wishing says Falcon Punch
X-Link says
He's Siler
And Act F says Grand Theft Auto with Crackdown Physics
Cool freaking awesome
That was pretty hilarious
It's basically
You could potentially cheat
In the online games with this
But you'd be banned pretty quick
I'm guessing he's going to be banned eventually
But what do I care?
Because it's my boss, it's not me
And it's my modded console anyway
So what do I care?
But no
It's just a really fun experiment
As far as I'm aware
I'm sure other people have done it
But the only video I've seen online
There's only been one person that's done it
And he's the guy that actually made this program called OpenIV
Which is one of the programs that I use
It basically opens one of the files that's on
The actual Xbox 360 disc
And it's also part of the PC stuff
It's kind of like their version of a zip file or something
So
I kind of figured out how to
Extract everything
It is tricky because if you change something
If you change certain bytes or whatever
The file size changes and it gets too big
But I actually overwrote
There's multiple languages on the disc
So I overwrote the Spanish language with the English language
Which was a lot smaller in file size
So I can edit whatever I want
And I can just pad it with a bunch of null bytes
But anyways, so beyond the Grand Theft Auto stuff
I did play other things
I can't stop playing PEGAL DS
And I really don't want to play it anymore
But I finished PEGAL
The regular PEGAL stuff on there
Now I unlocked PEGAL Knights
So I can play that
Which I think is basically the same thing as PEGAL
It's just everybody's now a superhero for some reason
Whatever
It's fun
Nellie hasn't gotten a chance to play it yet
So I don't know if she'd like it
But I don't know, it's fun
Just watch TV and play that game
And then I also tried TrackMania DS
Which is pretty good
But the only thing that kind of sucks about it
Is because the DS screens are so small
Your field of view is really small in the game
But other than that, it's basically just
The same as the PC version
Which is pretty awesome
So that's kind of cool
And then
I think that's about it really
I wanted to play a lot more games
I was meaning to install that new update
For the Wii
Not exactly the same way
As you'd normally update it
But, you know, special way
Because I got a 16GB card
To go with that
So maybe we'll hear some more about this next week
Yes, and then
By the way, Tigerclaw in chat says you should hack PEGAL
And put in some crazy ass physics
Just like you did in Grand Theft Auto
It's not as easy to hack other games
In Grand Theft Auto, if you literally extract
All the files that are in those compressors
It's exactly the same as what you see on the PC
Formats are the same
Files are actually somewhat the same
The only thing that's different is the texture files and stuff
But if you learn how to hack one
You can hack both versions
You probably can hack the PS3 version
If you figure out how they store it
I haven't been able to
And I really wanted to figure out how to get it to install
Because I can actually install that
To this hard drive
So you can do the game installations
On the new Xbox Experience
And yes, the disk I have obviously is modified
Because I had to burn a modified ISO
To get it to work
Because I'm editing it
But you can actually run it with the real disk
Once it's installed on the hard drive
Because all it does is check to make sure that disk is legit
And then it'll run wherever the hell you want
But I literally took apart my 360
One of the other five
To try to get it to install
I was actually going to do a disk swap
On the CD-ROM drive
I literally took the CD-ROM drive apart
Unfortunately that thing spins so fast
It's impossible to do that
But it's fun
It's cool
Repeat at your own risk
He's voiding all sorts of warranties
All sorts of warranties
If one of these Xboxes is E74
It's tough shit
And I'm not going to go post online how to do this
Basically
You can figure it out the same way
As you would modify a song in Guitar Hero
The information is out there
You just kind of have to figure it out
And really I don't want a lot of people
Just online cheating like hell
I'm not doing that
We do it for fun
For your own amusement
But as you can see
There's no way I'm faking this
Since it's lost and damned
There's no way to port that to the PC yet
It's just fun
I think you're going to play a little bit
On and off throughout the night
You might kind of pause as you're reading news stories
And so on but you can kind of watch the action
Go down at Justin TV
Which is also available, thanks to Dekeman
For reminding me, we have it in a little box now
On OrangeLawnTrader.com
I'm not used to it being right there on our homepage
But it is, so you can just look at OrangeLawnTrader.com
And you can read the reviews that were posted this week
And watch Justin TV at the same time
It's pretty cool
My gaming week, we've been out for two weeks
I actually got caught up on quite a few games
And this challenge is just so adorable
On the Nintendo DS
I can't think of a better way to describe this game
It's really adorable
Basically what they did, they took a lot of like
Inspired 8-bit games
I mean they're all original, old-school retro games
That you play in this
But they all kind of are reminiscent of games you might have played
Back in the day
On the Nintendo Entertainment System
For instance, there's a racing game
That's kind of a little bit, I don't know, like Spy Hunter-ish
Just without the weapons
Kind of a Xanax-style shooter
As well as
Galaga
Has like a type of shooter in there as well
And there's an RPG
It's just a really cute little game
Basically the way the game works is that you
Are basically sucked into the life of a child in the 80s
Playing all these new games with a friend
And the cool thing is that
As you play through these challenges
You unlock little magazines
You know, you might have heard of this
These games, game magazines
That you look through and get new tips out of
And of course they have cheat codes
There's all these little throwbacks
To things we might remember from the 80s
Like really bad Engrish and some of the games
And all this stuff
Here's the only thing I didn't like about Retro Game Challenge
Is that everything was very sequential
Like when you buy the game, you have to start with a particular shooter game
Then move on to the racing game
Then move on
You know, and I kind of would have liked a little more openness
Even if it didn't
Give you everything at once
Maybe if you started with three of the games
And you could kind of go back and forth
And beat the challenges you wanted to in one
And then move on to another
I would have liked to see a little more freedom
In the way the actual game itself was set up
But it's not enough to really distract
From the fact that the game is really a throwback
To the old school days
So honestly
Excuse me, if you were a kid gaming in the 1980s
I think you'd get a kick out of this
And might want to check it out on the Nintendo DS
Sorry, yes
Start to see us as Zanac is the game
Not Xanax, that's a, I think, drug
Anyhow, also games
That I've been playing, Bit.Trip Beat
On the Nintendo Wii
Kind of interesting, it's like Pong meets Guitar Hero
Type thing, where as you move
The paddle up and down
Which you do by tilting the Wiimote
You can control
Chiptune type music
Everything's very scripted in the game
Which you don't understand really
With the trailers, it kind of looks like you're playing
A natural game of Pong or something
But everything is very, very scripted
In these very long stages
That go on for, I think, about 15 minutes
Playing these different songs
Now the only drawback is that there's only
Three stages, so there's only really three songs
But when you consider that 600
Wii points is what you'd pay for
Three rock band songs
I still think you kind of are getting your deal out of this game
I think it's a fun little game
You know, I don't think it's anything
You're going to play forever and ever
But for $6 it's not bad
I'd recommend the game
Bobby and I were talking about it a little bit at the end of his show
Because he's on just before us
Here on All Games Radio and I gave it a B or a B-
With him, so that's about where I'd put it
Other games I've been playing
This week
Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders
Which is very similar to a lot of those
Flash tower defender games you see online
Except now with Black Mages and Archers
Surprisingly a lot of fun
I did it on both of the iPhone and the Xbox 360
And I have to admit I like it a little more
On the Xbox 360 because of the fast forward button
And if the iPhone has one I haven't found it yet
I'm sure it's in there somewhere
But I just thought that was
It's just a fun little time waster and time distracter
But on the Xbox 360 you have to remember
It is a port of a cell phone game
So you're not going to have a lot of extravagant graphics
Or anything, but you know a good game doesn't necessarily
Need great graphics, for instance BitTripBeat
Has the graphics of an Atari 2600 game
But it's still kind of fun
And then also just a few things here and there
I checked out Hasbro Family Game Night
Briefly which is a little bit
You know it's a little deceptive
Well I don't know if I should say deceptive
But it's unlike other games
Because I thought you were going to get all these games
The Kinect 4, the Scrabble
And all this stuff for 10 bucks
No no, each of those games within Scrabble
Or within Family Game Night
Cost 10 bucks
Family Game Night is like the front end
So it's an interesting way to deliver the games
But I don't know, 10 dollars
A little high for games like Kinect 4
It might be worth it to play games like Scrabble
Online, but I don't know so much
About the others, so I guess it's kind
Of cool they let you pick and choose
The other interesting thing, here's what I don't understand
About Family Game Night
Is there's a lot of people
I'm watching Twitter and stuff and a lot of people
That are getting really into this and playing this
And trying to meet up with folks online
But these are the same people that would dismiss
A lot of the Wii games that are coming out recently
As shovelware
Well, Family Game Night was released on the Wii
And if you think about it, in some ways
It almost had a better value
Because I think there's 7 games in this thing
Which would cost you 70 dollars altogether
I think the Wii version had one less game
So it was like 60 dollars
But you were only paying like 40 for it
Now granted, you know
The Wii version doesn't have internet play
So it kind of depends how much that's worth to you
And all that, but it just kind of amuses me
That I think a lot of people forget
It's one big bundle on the Wii
Something to consider
If you're going to get all these games
Or if you think this is something that might be for you
Because you have a family
There's already a version out there on the Wii
That's probably going to be in the bargain bin before too long
That might suit you better
But of course, online play goes a long way
I get that
I checked out the demo for Uno Rush
I didn't like it at all
I didn't like the way the game runs at all
It's not the video game itself
It's not the way it was ported
I don't like the game itself
I don't like the whole organizing your cards
As the game goes on
And plus, I don't think it's worth the 5 extra dollars
That they want to charge for that
As opposed to the 5 dollars for regular Uno
Which seems to be a more accepted price point
And sadly one that we rarely see anymore
Yeah, Uno is so a few years ago
Some comments from chatroom
Leo Shen says
Hardcore Xbox Connect Fucking 4 is worth 10 dollars
Drop your piece, bitch
Sneaky there, you bitch
I guess that could be worth it
I don't know, I just think it would get a little old after a while
But then again, you know what
How can I say Uno is great
And then say these games are not great
The only difference really is 5 more dollars
And these games graphically are a little more polished
Than the ones in Family Game Night
I don't know
GameGuru says you might pick it up
When it's in the bargain bin
Perhaps
That's about it for my gaming week
I have a lot of little things here and there
But I didn't play a lot of games for a long, long time
That's the weird thing
Is that I played a lot of games here and there
Probably Retro Game Challenge is the one I played the most
Because I've unlocked like
Maybe 5 different games in Retro Game Challenge now
So there's a lot, a lot of
Stuff to do there
Alright, let's move on into some housekeeping
And then we'll get into the gaming news
Because there was a lot of news this week
And that's not even counting the week we were gone
I don't even think we're going to have time to address the week we were gone
From Game Developers Conference
Just some quick housekeeping
We don't have a lot of stuff to note right off the top
But we do want to remind you guys to join our Twitter
At OLR is our username on Twitter
So that's getting more and more popular
We got like randomly like 20 new followers all in one day
I don't know if somebody followed Friday to us
Is that what it is?
There was a lot of people
Because we didn't have
But maybe 150 to begin with
So I just thought it was pretty cool
So thanks to everybody who's now following us on Twitter
If you're not on there yet, you should add us
We ask questions and we're going to read replies a little later in the show
You don't even have to really be listening live
I'm going to get to tonight's question a little bit later
And also though, you don't just have Twitter
Because I know there's a lot of anti-Twitters out there
That's fine, whatever you're into
Facebook, OLR is our club on Facebook
We have a MySpace as well
Orange Lounge Radio
But is it just me or is MySpace like quickly dying off?
Like Facebook is really stomping them out
I hated MySpace from the first day I was on it
So the only reason I
Even remotely look at it anymore
Is because my brothers every so often are on there
There were things I liked about MySpace
But I'm slowly not liking it as much anymore
The only thing that I wish that Facebook would get
Is customizable backgrounds
And then
The other thing, LiveJournal
Is also our community at Orange Lounge
Which we haven't posted a lot too lately
Especially as our
Listeners and stuff post things there
We always read that and keep an eye on that
Okay
Also yeah, Dekeman reminds us
Hey there's that little box called extended play
On the OLR homepage and it has it all
It has like our last FM group, our steam community
If you want to find some like-minded gamers
That cool people to listen to
A little internet radio program out of someone's
Garage then check it out
On OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Alright let's get into some gaming news because damn
A lot happened this week and that might be thanks to
A little thing called the Game Developers Conference
Which might I remind you is not E3
It's not where the companies are supposed
To make their big, big announcements
But sometimes you'll hear things aimed
Towards developers and we have had big announcements
Out of GDC in the past, for instance
PlayStation Home was a big one we got a couple years ago
And sometimes you get some game announcements
Here and there, but we got quite a bit out of this year's
Game Developer Conference. Loki's gonna start us off tonight
Yes, there's a new
I'm not even sure if you'd call it a console
Format I guess, on Live
Which is gonna basically
Be almost like
I guess those TiVo boxes
That you can get where you can stream
Videos to your home
This service you'll actually be able to stream
Games to your home
And it'll also be like a really small
Box that you would put next to your TV
Have a USB controller
That would plug into it and basically you'll be able to stream
High end games, everything from
Crysis to Burnout, Paradise
Stuff like that
And they're saying that they
Can do it within the limits of bandwidth
Right now and that there's minor
No lag whatsoever
But the frame rate can take a hit
If your stream isn't that
Doesn't have that much bandwidth
So you see
When I was first reading about this I was thinking
It was gonna be like GameTap
But something you took up to your TV
And I think I remember saying a long time ago
And I don't even know if it was when we interviewed
The guy from GameTap, that was a long time ago
But I remember we were talking about GameTap should be something
You can plug into your TV and this thing would
Sell like crazy
This might as well be like an extension
Of GameTap or just rename it to GameTap
And just have like
Well the same people are involved so they can't really do that
Well damn just talk to
Hey okay you got the technology
You've got the technology, they've got the name
And you know, let's do it
Not only do we get the high end PC games
Let's get some you know the retro stuff
Just have everything
Okay but the streaming frame skipping is weird to me
Because the way GameTap works
You download the whole game to your computer
And then play it that way
It doesn't sound like this works the same way
This is being run on like a remote server
That you're actually playing
Which is pretty impressive when you think about it
Because there's like little
No lag whatsoever, at least no discernible lag
So that's kind of cool
Or so they say
I mean let's face it right
Obviously right now they have to probably test the hell out of it
Because I can't imagine that this is really going to work
I mean unless they have one hell of an algorithm
Basically it is
Because the way I see it
You're going to need a PC for every one of these
Things that are going
So each person is going to need their own PC
Basically in this remote server
To be able to play this stuff
Whatever game
So this does not hook up to your TV?
No, well it does hook up to your TV
But I mean
You don't need your own PC
Your own high end PC to run this stuff
Which I think you should
Actually be able to play these games
Is the effort that it takes to
Own a PC or build a PC to do it
But whatever
In your hacking and cracking opinion
Well not really
Because I'd be pissed off if my stream crisis
Got to the end and couldn't finish it
Because the game was broken
You hook this box into your TV
Correct? Yes
So you don't need a computer at all or a monitor
That's important
All you need to do is basically hook it up to
Well
On the back here it looks like they've got a phone jack
And they've also got
That might be a USB jack actually
Never mind
But they've got an ethernet and then your HDMI
That's going to plug into that
I don't know
It looks neat
Some of the other cool features on there
They're going to have a way you can share
Videos
They call them brag clips
No real gamer score obviously
You can rent the game
You can demo it before you buy it
Obviously
Lots of cool stuff
And I don't know
It's a neat idea if they can get it to work
That'd be really cool
The problem is I don't know if they're going to be able to get it to work
Like they want to
But I think there are other applications for it
If this doesn't end up working out
I'm very curious to see what's going to happen at E3
Because you know they're going to probably
Have to kind of show a little more
Stuff at E3 and there's going to be a much bigger audience
Of people watching them at E3
I'm kind of curious to see how it really
Flows
But my thing is
If they can get to work
With this little stupid box
And stream it
What's going to say stop
Sony or Microsoft from streaming a game
A full game
Over their service
Isn't this the direction we've all seen them moving in anyway?
Yeah
It's not any surprise
Microsoft and Sony have slowly been walking
This direction anyway
Especially now that Sony offers their old school catalog
As download titles to the
TV and the
PSP
And now you can buy Burnout Paradise online
Completely
But I think this would be even better though
Because for a console manufacturer
They've already got the console to crunch everything
It wouldn't necessarily be all
On a remote server
And sending all the information
And sending it your way
You can actually use some of the processing power
Of the console itself
To kind of take care of that
So it should be easier to do it on a console
Than say whatever this little box is
Because that's basically just receiving a signal
That means converting the video feed
I think it's just a matter of time
Before we start seeing the newest, latest
And greatest games or things that you download
You know and all this
I think it's just a matter of time
To get late in this generation
I think, but especially as we start getting into
The next Microsoft
The next PS4
Or whatever, I think we're really going to start seeing
These types of ideas that
Maybe OnLive is bringing to the table
Mixed with the
Console power
So, be interesting
Alright, well
Talking about other things
That came out of
Game Developers Conference
We're talking about digital rights management
And one of the big companies of course behind DRM
Is Steam
Steamworks is a new kind of thing
That Valve is putting together and they're talking about
How it's going to make DRM
Obsolete
Apparently Steamworks has this new anti-piracy
Technology that involves
Customer executable generation
Which they're calling SEG for short
C-E-G
Although which is funny because I have a friend named SEG
But it's spelled differently
SEG
It sounds like basically each individual
Gets their own unique executable file
But you can play it
On any compatible PC
No install limits
No rootkits
But when you buy the copy
It's your customized copy
So if suddenly your copy were to show up on a torrent
Everybody would know who did it
Interesting
Kind of surprised a technique like this
Hasn't been thought of a long time ago
Wouldn't the hackers figure out a way to take
The information out of the EXE
Or block it or scramble
Or figure out how to sign it themselves
It's not going to work
It's a good attempt but it's not going to work
Well you know where there's a will
There's a way
Pirates are going to hack everything
Did they say that this way
That it will end piracy
Basically?
I don't think anybody is going to make those bold statements anymore
Like DRM obsolete
That they did claim
Okay well maybe that's not so bad but
I don't know
I still think that
Even if they don't even care
About the subject matter being put out
I'm sorry
The hacking community likes a good challenge
Tigerclaw in our chat room
chat.orangelandrater.com says it's called a watermark
Which you know
You think like a picture
Sometimes if you have a picture on a website
Some websites do this crap all the time
Like for instance
A company like IGN
Might find a logo for a brand new Wii game
On some piddly little independent radio site
And copy it
And then they'll put their watermark on it
When they put it on their own website
So that everybody knows that when they get it
From the bigger website with all the bandwidth
That it came from IGN
Which may or may not be true
Is that a good analogy?
That's a pretty good analogy I think
This is actually speaking of the same situation
What we should be doing
Is going in photoshop and adding in
The image information
Details as far as what was taken
Where it came from that type of thing
Embed all that data within the file
Where you don't actually need the watermark
I'm actually thinking that
That could be something more like what they're going to do
Actually have something
Not necessarily
Overt like
A watermark like you're saying
But something that's embedded deep into the code
Or maybe even
Some little difference
In a code like a different color
On a shirt or something
For a particular character they know they look for that character
That shirt's a different color that's your copy
You know a series of
Randomly generated events
Though that will identify it
But not be immediately
Yeah I was going to say if they want to be smart about this
They're not going to put the information out there
In the open. The subtle watermark
Will be something like
A particular pattern that appears
Or a picture that shows up somewhere
That it's going to take a while for the
Pirates to figure out
What is being watermarked
I think if you just cram name and number in the file
That's not going to be enough
And if they're not doing it that way that idea
Is copyright
2009 Jamie
That's right
Put a little watermark on it right now
I'm saying right now that's my idea
That's a very interesting way around it though
So there you go
We'll see what happens with this
You know obviously steam has a lot of power
So far I suppose you could say
So it will be interesting to see
Kind of the impact that this ultimately has
On the PC gaming and the PC
Piracy scene
Well in other PC news
And piracy
God this is going to make it so easy for the pirates
But who cares
Sims 3 is not going to use the DRM
It's actually going to
Just use a key code
A CD key
That will be broken in about 5 seconds
I know
But then again
It's seriously with as many people
Complain about DRM
It's really going to be the best way
I think right now to at least
You know
Please some of the players
So
Although I love
Love what the guy said about it
There's a quote from
Trying to see
Who the person is
Rod Humble
Who is the executive producer
Saying
We feel that this is a good time proven solution
Which makes it easy for you to play the game without
DRM methods
That feel overly invasive or leave you concerned
About authorization server access
In the distant future
I agree to that
Extent you won't have to worry about
Being authorized every time you play it
You won't have to worry about
You know having to
Be online to play it but at the same
Time it is
Going to mean that they're going to find a lot
More
I suppose hacked versions out there
You know that people are going to be breaking
Those codes
That's good I didn't want to buy that game anyways
I'm buying it
I need to make more houses
I need to burn more people
I need to drown more people in the pool
And then turn the lawn into a graveyard
That's even better
And then the people who move in
Are like haunted
There needs to be more vampires in Sims 3
And aliens
And um
Mutant powers
So it'll be Sims X3
Okay
But not a crappy sequel
Dear god no
Anyways
There's some pretty interesting stuff
I mean we've already seen this with the
Xbox 360 but now Netflix
Is kind of branching out to other
Game systems to see
You know maybe there's
Potential interest in
Streaming to theirs
For example the Playstation 3
There was a survey going around
Asking people what their
If they'd be interested in something
Like the service that they have
Right now on the Xbox 360
On the Playstation 3
However it'd be a little bit different
What would happen is you'd actually have
To purchase a Netflix
Instant streaming disc for a one time fee
Of $10 and since this can be
Put into your
Drive and then basically install
The run off there and then you have to
Connect your PS3 to the internet
And you'd be able to stream
All sorts of stuff to it
All different movies
And could this perhaps
Mean that we're going to see Netflix
Coming to other systems?
Maybe? I don't know
I think they're going to go where the money is so
Why not?
Huh
It's just interesting though because I think
In our minds we all assume that Playstation 3
Will go with a competitor like Blockbuster
Or something else so it's kind of interesting
That Netflix could essentially end up
Having Monopoly pretty soon
On the high end systems
Yeah
Well it may not just be a monopoly with the high end systems
It may be a monopoly with the
New gen systems you know whatever you want to call
The Wii as well and that is that
There's a survey going around
Apparently hinting that there could be a Netflix
Service for the Wii in the future
Apparently this is
Some type of survey
Going around that's asking
If they would be
Interested in a Netflix
Sorry Netflix instant
Streaming disc
Apparently this would be a disc that you would
Put in the Wii when you want to use the Netflix
Streaming service and it's
Not something that would come automatically with a firmware
Update so I'm not sure if you have to buy this for a fee
Or if it would be very low cost or something you could order
From Netflix no idea
Very
Interesting to see if this would actually
Be something that would happen
Oh no I'm sorry I'm looking at
It in the survey it says a one time fee
Of ten dollars for the Netflix instant
Streaming disc and then your Wii would be connected to the
Internet
So it could be that Netflix
Could automatically show up on the Wii the
PS3 and the Xbox 360
All at once and they would kind of dominate the streaming
Video market I don't know if this would
Necessarily be a bad thing I mean you know
Netflix has a pretty big library but of course little
Competitions healthy too one thing
I think Netflix suffers from is they don't have
A lot of big big stuff in
Their streaming library and I know they've talked about
Adding stuff later on for a higher fee but
They don't get a lot of brand
New stuff if it's not an obscure
Indie film or a
Documentary which don't get me wrong those aren't necessarily
Bad but some days you want to
Watch the big action shoot them up too and those things are
Never available instantly right away for
Many many many years so
I don't know I think
A little competition would be healthy if one of the other services
Would get involved at the same time if Netflix
Hopefully can get some of the newer stuff on
Their service it could be pretty awesome so
We'll see
We'll see if this uh
Survey of course surveys can sometimes be meaningless
It's just a survey don't take it too seriously
And the survey says
Who knows
Well how about something a little different
Sure
More stuff out of game developers conference
Yay
The legend of Zelda
Spirit tracks
It's sort of the makes me think of ice cream
You know what's
The one moose tracks
Is that I don't know
I want ice cream I think
Ice cream sounds delicious
I have one ice cream cone in the house
And I'm so eating it during break
You bitch don't hate me
Okay only if you buy me pie
We'll see
Anywhere
Anywhere
Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks is
Another cell
Shaded link game
But um
He's
Got a train
I guess with a cannon
I have no idea
I'm looking at some of this and it's just weird
But it looks like it's gonna be
On the Nintendo DS
Is it supposed to be some
Type of like training
Game or what is this
He's got a freaking train
Haven't they called this a rail shooter game or something?
Is what this is supposed to be
Link on a train
Seriously
It's just gonna be a standard Zelda game
It's just people are basing their
Information off of what they see in the trailer
And speculating
Okay now there's no water
But he's wearing a conductor's outfit in every darn scene you see him in
Maybe he likes it
Maybe it makes him feel sexy inside
I don't know
Maybe he's worn out the
Link on a train
I think Frisbee in chat sums it up
There's a song that would describe this game
Come on ride the train
And ride it woo woo
That should be the song they use in the trailer
I was thinking of Snakes on a Plane
Or Snakes on a Train
Wasn't that a direct to DVD version or something like that?
It was a knock off video
Alright well
I don't know
I guess more to come on this
Probably at E3
I'm assuming this is gonna be playable at E3
We'll find out more about this
When they're hurting there's a new Zelda game right?
I don't know
Yeah so
Along with that of course we have
A little bit more Zelda
Information including another
Zelda coming to Virtual Console
In Japan but you know
It's gonna be coming everywhere else eventually I'm sure
Actually
In April we're gonna be getting
Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask
On Virtual Console
Also expected out on
Sega Master System Phantasy Star
For the PC Engine
Ninja Gaiden
Also
Part of the Virtual Console Arcade
Genpai
Terma Den and Space Invaders
And then
For the Super Famicom Kirby's Dream Land 3
And
Let's see here
And then Castlevania 3
On the Famicom
So that's kinda cool
But I'm sure we'll see stuff
In other regions probably around the same time
I do want to point out though Phantasy Star is in that Ultimate Genesis Collection
You can get all of them
For like 30 bucks and you know
I would never pay 5 dollars
For just Phantasy Star when I know this is out there
With all the Phantasy Star games
For like 30 bucks
Just saying
Well their prices are a little high anyways
If you ask me
Anyhow
Look one thing that always kinda pissed me off
About Virtual Consoles is that there was no place on the damn Wii
To store all of these Virtual Console games
That sometimes I want to download
And especially add WiiWare into it
And the storage capacity on the Wii stinks
And you might remember people have been bitching about this
For a long time and what was it last like
Freaking September or October
This guy that worked for Nintendo came out and said
Nobody cares about that
Just geeks know Taku
Are the only people that care about this and I said F you buddy
May I?
Yeah exactly I said F you buddy
If that's gonna be your attitude then I
Ban myself from Virtual Console
I'm not downloading any more stuff
Cause I'll tell you what I had like 3 screens full of Virtual Console
Crap before that point I don't know how I fit it all in there
Mostly little NES games
I said you know the hell with this
If that's gonna be your attitude then I ban
Virtual Console until Nintendo addresses
This issue and guess what?
Finally
All these months later
Yes my boycott has come to an end
Because they did announce at Game Developers Conference
In 2009 that the Wii Shop channel
Would be updated with the SD Card
Menu that would allow you 20 pages
Of games on the
SD Card without having to
Copy it back and forth like you did
Before you could actually boot the damn game
From the SD Card and now
Not necessarily though
Also let me say this not just
Can you do 2GB
SD Cards which is a lot of room to begin with
Especially compared to what's on the Wii to begin with
You can now run up to 32GB
SD Cards in the slot
Loki what were you gonna say?
Technically it's not necessarily running off the
SD Card it's copying them to the Wii
Memory so that is one little
Asterisk on there you need to have
Free memory on your Wii's
Internal storage
However though if you get an SD Card
That's big enough just copy everything to the damn
SD Card at least all the games
You know save files I'm sure it'll be enough
But it alleviates the problem of having to go
Into the memory manager every single time
Which was stupid and I know a lot of people were
Emailing me saying Rob you should just copy things in the memory
I said no no that's stupid because it needs to be
Part of this whole seamless thing you know
You're making excuses for Nintendo
Having these big ideas
With what they want to do with the download service
And then not having the space to put it all
So you're making excuses so
Nintendo needs to address this directly make it very
Seamless make it easy and they
Finally did so there you go
And so of course if you were listening early in the show I talked about
I played Bit.Trip Beat I also played
Gradius Rebirth I didn't play it enough
I went on a buying binge to buy
Some of the things I missed out on
While my boycott was going on so
There you go
That happens from time to time sorry
What is this
Did you talk about your video right?
Yeah sometimes when you punch somebody they bounce
Back and they knock you open into the air
Anyways sorry back to the show
And Dr. Tutti in chat says as long as you leave enough
To load your biggest VC game should be an issue
You're right but all I do I copy all
My games to the SD card now and I'll have
Plenty of room on the
Wii I would like to point
Out and this is not unfortunately
A positive point for
Nintendo they've already figured out
How to crack this already
And now of course you can
Still load you know the 4.0
Firmware for your Wii
And still be able to install mods that
Are pirated and stuff and copy them all to your
SD cards and that sort of thing
But it does alleviate you know
Room so people can actually download more
Of your Wiiware stuff
Hmm
Alright well let's go to Twitter
And we do a little segment here on the show called
Show us your tweets and
We like to ask questions on Twitter and then you guys
Answer them and we read some of our favorite responses
Here on the show and we actually
Asked you guys just a little bit before the show started
Tonight we wanted to know
How you kind of felt about these Nintendo announcements
At GDC
We specifically asked did Nintendo's announcements
At GDC show a commitment
To us core gamers
Or are you not satisfied? Here's some of the answers we got
On Twitter which is a little
Bit diverse here
Let's see
We've got
Poor Leno111
Says to me the train plus Zelda equals
Fail I wish they would just go back to the old school
Style of Zelda
Ryan Belknap says
Just should be happy they said anything at all
They could have kept it for E3
Joy says with the new games and support
For a bigger SD card I think it's a great move
But I know tons of people will still complain
Scruffy K says no I think Nintendo
Is trying to keep the core gamers from deserting them
A Zelda in the hands is good as two
In production
Act Def says while nobody expected
Those announcements by Nintendo's part
I'm still waiting for a real core gamer
Announcement for E3 or I hope so
Crows said
Nintendo will never satisfy me until they
Make a new Star Fox game that is not full of suck
Deep Man says besides the
SD card thing I don't think I saw anything that
Impressed me from Nintendo this week
There you go
Some of the answers from our
Show us your tweets segment
We're on twitter.com under OLR
And we like to post questions for you guys to answer
Before the show
Let's move on we do have a couple more
Nintendo stories out of
Game developers conference I almost said
E3
We're a little bit
Stuck right now though so why don't I go ahead and just
Take this next one
So the next story would be about
Sorry we got some live issues going on
Live radio folks
It's called Jamie's computer is a piece of crap
That's alright well Jamie would have been excited to tell you
About the virtual console arcade that was
Also announced at game developers conference
And is now just
Loading?
Well then tell them what arcade games they can be looking forward to
Well hey there's all kinds of cool
Stuff that you can be looking forward to
In fact I would
Actually even say if you are a Namco
Fan then you're going to
Be supremely pleased
Now something that people should know
This is like now it's kind of
Like in a way they're adding a new system
To the virtual console
But that system is arcade games
Name for the Wii basically
There's actually four games that are available
Now there's
Gapless which is Namco Bondi
For 600 Wii points
Mappy we love Mappy
Annoying little freaking game that is
It's alright
500 Wii points there's
Tower of Druago which is
500 Wii points also available now
Star Force from Tecmo
500 points and then
We have a Sega game coming out
Which is my number three favorite game
Evar
Space Harrier
Hi
And then
From Namco Bondi
Again though
I'm a little torn because
Didn't a lot of these Namco games show up
In these various Namco collections they
Seem to put out on every system?
Some have not
And also other ones that are listed on here
Where we
Not seeing any too much else
Listed in the announcement list
Was Emeralda
There's also
The Return of Ishtar
So hey
Here's the mistake I don't want to make
It's very similar to the Sonic Genesis collection
I'm pretty sure I heard something about
Namco's putting out some type of new compilation
On the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
There's a new thing coming out for that
So if that is going to have Mappy
And some of these games in it
When that collection is going to be
$30 maybe $40 tops
Why would I buy one game
For 500 points when this is likely to
And again I don't know a lot about it
There's one being developed
Why would I do that?
Why wouldn't I just go buy the PS3 one
Just like I would say go buy the Sonic Genesis collection
I would actually buy
Individual games on here
Because I don't know if you remember this is an old example
You remember when I was scrambling
Like a chicken with a head cut off
To try to find the entire Namco
Playstation series
And I think I'm like
Missing the O
So I have some of the rare ones
For the trademark symbol that was only on Japan
Or the restricted symbol or whatever
But there's games on those compilations
That I wanted that we didn't get on the
US versions you know
And it would be far cheaper for me
To have my compilation and then
Just get the couple of them that I don't have
You know so like
For Tower of Druaga you know
True I have that on the Playstation
One but
It's not always convenient to hook up
You know my Playstation
Or deal with you know backwards compatibility
Or any of that
I can see that I can see that and you know like something like
A Space Harrier as much as you love that game
I can see why you would want to get that
And you know I'd have 50,000
I seriously can name off
Multiple versions of Space Harrier that I have
And what's one more right what's one more
Like I've got it on Saturn
I have it on PC Engine
I've got it on 32X
Ok it's only a 3 hour show
The 32X version is arcade perfect by the way
Insert coin instead of press start
Nice
But I was going to say you know and I think one thing
That I don't believe made our show roll tonight is about
The Final Fantasy games
All the old ones are going to be
They were officially announced that they're coming to Virtual Console
I'll pay the money for Final Fantasy 4 and 6 again
Even though I already own those games
I own 6 the cartridge
Somewhere and I own 4
Final Fantasy 5
I got 4 on the Wonderswan Color
Of all things I've got 4 on
You know the DS
I've got 4 you know
I'll buy it again on Super Nintendo that's how much I fucking love that game
Especially
Especially if they release
Although I have a feeling we're going to get the Bastard Eyes 2
That was the first release here because it is Virtual Console
But especially if we got like the Japanese retranslation
Oh my god I'd be so excited
I'd be so excited
If I had a perfect translation of Final Fantasy 3
I would be freaking in heaven
But you know what game that I totally wish
That they would bring out
That would be translated as Seiken Densetsu 3
Oh
Hi people there is an officially
There's a fully
Sprite hacked everything
Translated version out there just say
Let us use that please
Or just fucking use it because it was your game in the first place
You know what I mean
I think they would have every right to just use it
You know what I mean
What could the translators do
Gee sorry we you know kind of like
Copied your game and ROM dumped it
In the entirety of the internet right
That would totally not get
Nintendo any friends
But still
But still my point is
There that it exists
People did this in their spare time
Why can't Nintendo pay someone and just
Crank it out you know
Pay them a dollar
I don't think we'll see that ever
You know on a
Well we may eventually see it but
Never say never we did get Final Fantasy 5
Eventually
That's true
Eventually
Never say never with Second Detsetsu
Never say never
And that could be a thing that they would
Be holding back for E3 but you know
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up
And I doubt it but you know
You never know
That and Earthbound are like the two
Things they could pull out of their pants
And lay on the table and they would just like
Oh my god Fandagasm
Seriously it would be so much wank
For real
Speaking of so much wank
Oh
There's another game that will not be coming
To a Nintendo console soon
At least not through legitimate means
But now thanks to a
Coding competition there is
A new application Kamasutra
For the DS
Yes with this you can actually see
Visual representations of all the different
Kamasutra positions
And can learn about the pros and cons
Of them
No they'll release it in the states they'll just call it sex training
Yes my personal trainer
Kamasutra
They'll just rename it yoga for adults
My personal trainer butt sex
Wait is the gay Kamasutra
Part of this?
I don't know
I had it downloaded I just haven't gotten a chance to load it on my
Card yet
There's actually some other neat things that came out
But I can't remember what they were
Um
Robert M in chat is kind of referencing our
Last little bit there we were talking about Earthbound
And how it would just become fanboy wank all over the place
If that was announced for E3 and Robert M says
Didn't Black Wolf say Earthbound would not be
Coming to Virtual Console due to the pop
Culture references? True and Bobby
Did make a very good point and I'm not gonna
You know deny that there's a lot of shit they got
Away with 15 years ago they probably couldn't get away
With now especially with Wii getting sued as much as it does
However if they
Wanted to take the time to go back and recode
Some things and redo some things which you know
Wouldn't be that much time at all considering
How much this would sell
And then just kind of not tell people that
When they announce Earthbound that they oh yeah
And we changed it a lot
They'll still be wank all over the place
They did the same thing with
Tecmo Bowl, Wave Race 64
Yeah I mean it's not unheard of for them to change
Games
Granted there'd be a lot to change
But they could do it and probably make a killing
On Virtual Console they just wouldn't advertise
That they went back and changed stuff cause all the purists
Would be up in arms but it's
Better than nothing right?
The purists would be up in arms
Anyway and you know what to hell with it
As long as we get it
It depends how much they mess with it
For me but we'll see
More stuff out of Game Developer Conference
And this is also from Nintendo
A game called Rock and Roll Climber
Yeah Rock and Roll Climber
Not to be confused with Crazy Climber
That's a much different game
Ice Climber or Rock and Roll Racing
Although maybe you could unlock
Ice Climber in this game
What are you talking about?
What you talking about Loki?
What about Rock and Roll Racing or Snake and Roll
No this is a whole new game
Whole new IP so props to them for doing a new
IP but it's called Rock and Roll
Climber it's a balance board game
That you use the balance board and
The Wiimote and Nunchuck and you do
These arm movements to climb up a wall
The balance board reads your leg movements
The Wiimote and Nunchuck read your
Arm movements and
Apparently here's the weird thing
Once you get to the top you get a guitar
And you play a riff
So I'm assuming
There's some type of music
Fusion with this game I know they didn't say
A lot at GDC maybe this is one of the things
They're going to be showing more at E3 but I imagine
They're incorporating I mean to call the game Rock and Roll
Climber they're probably incorporating
Music into this now maybe it's that you have to climb
On beat or something like that I don't know it could be
Anything but I'm sure we'll see more of this
You have to wail hard
Just flail about aimlessly
I'm sure there's some type of rhythm
I'm still waiting for Air Guitar Hero
We just don't know
They have an air guitar mode in Guitar Hero
It's actually an air guitar machine
It just takes away the instruments
That they have
Anyhow there you go Rock and Roll Climber
Coming out probably
This summer or something
I may add it looked like crap
Also and it's a WiiWare title
And it looked like oh I didn't even
Catch that it's WiiWare? It's WiiWare
It's absolute crap
And everyone's like
Oh maybe it's the sequel to Ice Climber
No they would never do anything that cool
Because then if
They just kicked that guy in the face
Dark Tetsuya
You make horrible radio when you reference it
Dark Tetsuya says Sky the game kind of gives me a vibe
Of the old school NES version where it's just
Cute congrats on beating the level animation
Well maybe
That's basically it it's just another way to say
Look it's another thing you can use the Wii Fit board for
You can be fit and climb walls
Because people like climbing walls
The whole guitar thing sort of
Really makes me go back to a
Strong bad
Thing with the cheat
Here the tort have a trophy
I'm sorry I only want to climb walls
If I'm going to be chased by an American Gladiator
While I do so
There should be Frank mode where you can climb a
Button and then it falls on you and you die
And if you catch that reference you're awesome
I caught that reference and I don't even know
What it's from
Well I do know what it's from but I've never even seen the source material
Alright forget it
Let's move on
How about something crazy
And something that we already have in America
But hey our friends in the UK are finally getting it
You get Dementium
Where you can be Looney
Looney
Dementium the ward
It's for the DS
It will be out on April 17th
Two days before my birthday
But yeah we've had it since October
And it's been in Japan
Since summer
But if you want to be in a
Survival horror game
Where you can fight spooky
Monsters in a
Mental hospital
And not know how you got there
Get this game
How's that?
Wow that's a great sales pitch
Thank you
You get to be chased by monsters in the hospital
And it's not Silent Hill
I'm sure the makers of that game really appreciate you
For that little summary there
They're not even around anymore
Well they are around but they're not even Gamecock anymore
It's South Peak now
Not quite as cool
Didn't they get absorbed as part of the economy?
Gamecock has been inserted into another company
You're so mature
As we hinted earlier that the possible outcome of my console
I may remind you Rob
This console has died once
And come back to life
It's the Jesus console
Did it take you three days to revive it?
Yes it did actually
But
There is some striking
Infrural
I guess
Questionnaires that have been filled out
And people's input put in place
Both Joystick and Engadget
Have run polls regarding the E74 error
Which is
As Microsoft puts it
A general hardware error
Hmmmm
General hardware error
You say
That's funny because there's
Three lights of death I guess
There's also a general hardware error
And we don't see many of those anymore
Hmmmm
And then all of a sudden
After the new Xbox experience
Was installed
We started seeing a lot more of these E74 errors
In fact the dramatic increase of them
And
What's interesting though
Is people are kind of
Getting all conspiracy theory mode here
And thinking
Microsoft has
Specifically stated that they're gonna
Warranty these three
Red light
Errors
But the E74 errors are not
Part of that three year warranty
They're just part of the one year warranty
Is this a way for Microsoft to get out of
Warrenting those consoles that would normally be
Under the red ring
But now they have reprogrammed the error
Displaying to just do this
E74 error instead of the three red lights
Is kind of a way to save some money if you think about it
So it's actually the same
Same errors but
He's played a different way
This is all conspiracy though
Here's my question about the polling
And my initial thought when I saw these polls
Is how accurate is this
To post this on a video game website
Have you had this problem yes or no
How many people are actually gonna click yes
To that survey as opposed to those that are gonna
Click no because they're pissed off
I think for that reason alone
The statistic is skewed completely
The problem I think is
It's relevant to show that there's a point there
That it is happening
And it's happening frequently
But it's not happening nearly as much as the sites say they are
I think this way of polling people
Is not statistically so
I don't know what the actual statistics are
I do know that there are a lot more of them now
Than there were before
Which is a little kind of huh you know
And then a lot less red rings to death
And granted you can say okay maybe they're improving the hardware
But I have a feeling that
I would not be surprised if this is actually what's going on
But no one's ever gonna admit to it
They're not gonna say oh yeah we changed it
So that you know we don't have to pay out on the warranties
Yeah like they would actually do that
And you know admit to it
There'd be all sorts of lawsuits
But
I've actually you know
Most of my consoles have died either
With the three rings to death
I've only had one that didn't die that way
And it never actually popped up in error message
In the video so if it did
I would have never known
But I'm not surprised
That something like this is going on
But who knows
I mean this may become the new red ring to death thing
And you know now it's the E74 error
And it also could be you know
A way to say hey look
You know statistics
Are the three ring errors you know now
You know drop down to nothing you know
So hey look we're doing good
But really they're just kind of
You know shuffling to the side
That's shady I hope it's just a conspiracy
You're talking about there
Tigerclaw in chat makes a good point
Microsoft will have to repair the console with the E74 errors
Regardless they don't want to end up with more bad PR
Isn't that true? One way or another they're going to have to fix them anyway
But these consoles are past
That's the thing though
They don't have to fix them because there's a three year warranty
But if all these consoles start showing up
With the E74 aren't they
You know if they're newer consoles or what have you
Aren't they going to have to fix them anyway
If they're in the one year warranty otherwise
You have to pay $100 to fix it
That's where they get you because it's not the three rings
But it would be just like before
They were trying to charge $100 to all these people
With the red rings and the internet revolted
Isn't that same thing going to happen? Yeah but prove it
I mean that's the thing they're going to have to prove it
That that's actually going on
And I just find it a little shady that there's this
Error message that has the same description
As this other error message
That's you know really bad you know
It's like well it's a general
Hardware failure
Okay what's that mean you know
Is this any different than the three rings
Well it's a general hardware failure of
The graphics chip or the
Scaler chip or something else
Well that's exactly what the other one was
So
How's this any different? Oh it's not
Okay
I don't know I just hope I don't ever get one of these
I hope not either or there will be hell to pay
On the show just like when I got the red rings
I was so pissed about that thankfully
I went out of town
Anyhow we got some release dates we got to cover
And I'll start off in Japan with the Japanese
Release dates and talking about the Xbox 360
Eleven Eyes crossover
Is coming out in Japan
This is not a game I've heard of I'm wondering if it's just
A
Localized version of one of our titles
But it doesn't look like it looks like this is a new
Type of game I guess it's based on an anime
Because it looks like there's eleven chicks that this game
Stars it is an adventure
What was it again? It's called
Eleven Eyes crossover
Huh
So I don't know
What do you think of that three by three eyes?
I think it's different
On the Playstation 3 winning post world is a game coming out from Koei
This week on April the 2nd
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii
Dwalla de Wii winning post world
Also comes out on the Wii
Whoa whoa is that Dwalla?
That's the
Mascot
Yeah a little koala bear for their team
Yeah that's cute
So I'm assuming that's like a little baseball game that's coming out of there
No they're calling it a party game
So maybe it's like a baseball party game
Sports party
Who knows
So that's pretty cool
Yeah I think our friend that we both have on LiveJournal
Deanna who's been spending a lot of time over in Japan
I think I've seen pictures of her with that character
Yeah I actually
A while back I had like a little
Keychain thing that someone sent me
So I thought it was cool
Oh
Winning post world also makes its way to the Playstation 2
This is hitting multiple systems this week
I'm not exactly sure exactly what
Oh this is
Oh it's a horse racing game
I was gonna say is it the same thing as winning 11
But it's not it's a horse racing game
But it looks pretty intricate
Soccer on horses that's awesome
Isn't that just polo?
No that's croquet on horses
Yeah that'd be croquet on horses
That's a very good description of polo
Croquet on horses
Why is it not more popular here?
It sounds kinda awesome
Now what would you call it like if you had like one of those fantasy
Games where it's actual
Horses playing croquet
Would that still be considered polo?
Because you know it's a horses playing
The game I think it would be considered a fucking miracle
It would be an anamorphic croquet
Anyhow
On the Nintendo DS
Coming out in Japan on the 2nd of April
Disney fairies Tinkerbell comes out
As well as another pechi slot game from
Durasu also pro
Yaku Famitsa DS
2009 comes out from Bandai Namco
Which is yet another baseball game
Coming out from Namco with little
Chibi characters in it
On the Playstation portable
Which is the last system we cover over there
The Legend of Heroes
A lot of them move into
Price reductions
And that's really it unless you want to get some new
Covers for your PS in black, silver
And white, that's really it
So I guess Tinker, yes
As AlphaCananagram in chat says fuck yes
Tinkerbell definitely seems to be
One of the highlights on the Japanese release calendar
This week, things look a little better next week though
It's a slow week
Is it? Yes
How about going in another direction?
How about it? For our friends in the UK
On the 27th we have
Battleforge
For PC
Don King Boxing so you can have
Bizarro
Freaky hair
I guess
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time
For DS and Wii
Goblins 4 for PC
Wheelman on PC
Xbox 360, Playstation 3
Well this one doesn't have a date on it
It might have already come out
Crimecraft
Also though on April 3rd
We get Disgaea DS
In the UK
Ninja Blade on Xbox 360
And the Nintendo DSi
Also Valkyrie Profile
Covenant of the Plume
Alright
Well in the US
There's not a whole lot coming out this week
In fact a lot of it's crap
But that's okay
Because where there's crap
There's crap I guess
There is no positive there
The flowers grow? Yeah the flowers grow
Speaking of flowers! Gardening Marla
Coming out on the DS
Gardening Marla yes with the
Crappy week it is you can garden your
Wait hold on
DarkSakura, since you loved Cooking Marla
Any interest in Gardening Marla or is this
Jumping the Shark?
You haven't heard of Jumping the Shark yet
Guess what else they
Trademarked already
Crafting Marla
Scrapbooking Marla? No Crafting Marla
She's gonna make crafts
Marla goes to Michael's?
Like you know
Paladin Marla or something like that
Where Marla's in a role playing game
I wanna see Godzilla vs Marla
I wanna see DM Marla
Where she's running the game
There you go
Don't worry Marla will fix it
She slays the dragon
We've got Don King Boxing coming out on the Wii
You may remember that as Don King's Prize Fighter
They just changed the name so you forget how bad it was
Ski-Doo
Snowmobile Challenge on the Xbox
360, it's a snowmobile
racing game
Tokyo Beatdown
A traditional kind of
beat-em-up fighting game
or fighting action game
Coming from Atlas for the DS
which is pretty cool
Our music fans will love this
Major Miners Majestic March coming out on the Wii
You may remember the creators of Parappa the Rapper
created this
Oh yes I do
Marching Band
Bobby you listening?
It's a marching band game
I was in marching band
Me too but Bobby still does it
I know he plays drums
and shows
musicals
that come through his town
I could swear
and he's gonna pop and chat any minute I'm sure
I could swear he talked about Drum Corps
he still does stuff now and again with that
and that's kind of marching band
Leisure Suit
The Bus coming out on the Xbox 360 and PC
No nudity in that game
so I have no interest in it whatsoever
Dawn King Boxing
also coming to the DS
Yippee
Cradle of Rome coming to the Wii
which is another one of those
bejeweled knockoffs
Let's see here
and then
Vomit
like crap
Ok this is kind of
well another Dance Dance Revolution game
Disney Grooves now for the Wii
Hoz Party 2 with
Disney characters now
this isn't a game but I thought I'd mention it because it's pretty cool
Mad Catz has a new charging
dock coming out that charges
two controllers but what makes it special
though is it's the Rayman Rabbids
charging dock so there's a Rabbid
sitting there yelling at you
unfortunately it doesn't make noise because that would be awesome
and then
one last game coming out a week from today
Rhythm Heaven and of course
a tie along with that
Nintendo DSi coming out in black and blue
so
well that's why this is a slow
week because you have those two bombshells coming out
yes the DSi
is going to be pretty big
and then
that's pretty much it for right now
wow
now of course us talking about the Mama games
you spawned everybody in chat
talking about Mama in games
this is definitely my favorite Mama game
I mean we had 2DX Mama
we have Pop'n Music 18
Mama, Mama in Space
Neon Mama in Evangelion
my favorite though
from GS68 this is definitely my favorite Mama title
Mama vs. Capcom
that's pretty
scary
I was going to mention there is one more thing
this will make Jamie happy coming out
it's not a
game you can buy in the stores
online on Xbox Live Arcade
this week Outrun
yay
yes new Outrun game is going to be coming out
that's not old school Outrun getting upgraded
Outrun online arcade
but now see
that could be yay or that could be OMG Suck
if Yuji Naka is involved
it'll be good
the screenshots I've seen of it look pretty awesome
and they do some
neat camera stuff where
when you're drifting around some of the bends
it actually looks really cool
and Cell Factor Psychokinetic Wars
I could use a fun silly little
racing game that's not too serious
like a lot of the Xbox 360 racing games are too serious
for me I could use a fun silly little one
there's a bunch of stuff that's listed on here
that's supposedly coming out this week I'm not sure if all this is
Banjo-Tooie they're saying
I don't know that sounds kind of weird
I know one of these titles that's on this Kotaku
list is not correct Duke Nukem Trilogy
that's not coming out until September
it's funny it's coming out April 1st
you're the fool
because it's not coming out yet
what a Duke Nukem title delayed?
never
sorry that's alright
alright so we got
one more story for you guys then we're going to get to our classic
game of the week and this has to do with
Left 4 Dead which a lot of people
I know in our Steam community are still playing Left 4 Dead
this is a game I need to spend more quality time
with I played it for like a little bit and I found out
I suck at first person shooters really bad
but I need to go try to get a little better
however there is a new
download content pack coming out for
Left 4 Dead and it's coming out on April
21st for Xbox 360 gamers
and it's going to have a new
survival mode and
just wave after wave of zombies
and versus campaign support
with two more maps Dead Air and
Death Toll
by the way it's free so check that out
we like free things
right? free is awesome
except Yaris
okay we're just about to the
end of the show but of course no show
here at Orange Laundry will be complete
without the classic game of the week
actually we're only like half way done I don't want you to think
we're like actually done but we like to end part A
with the classic video game of the week
Dark Sakura goes through her dusty archives
of games and finds a game or two
maybe that she thinks you ought to be playing
and so Dark Sakura
what is your classic
game of the week?
my classic game of the week is Twinbee
which
of course we saw
a while back what
it's labeled as Rainbow Bell
I always remembered it as Twinbee so
whatever
is that familiar?
anybody that's played
the Bimani games long enough have heard some
form of the Twinbee theme in the game
this is the thing that annoys
me about Twinbee
is that every time you get a damn power up
it plays that little noise
and starts moving it over
but anyway Twinbee is a game where you
play as a little ship with arms
and you shoot
bells for your power ups and you change the color
of your bell
actually they pop out of the clouds and you shoot the clouds
and the bells will change color and you'll get a different
power up
but you just have to keep shooting it until
you
until you
get the one that you want but if you keep shooting it
it'll change into a symbol that will kill you
so
you can play as
you've got two characters in here you can play as
and it came out
for the Famicom
and it came out actually in the cartridge and disk format
the MSX
it came out, it was of course arcade
and
then we also saw Twinbee
portable for the Sony PSP
and the Konami Classic series
arcade hits for the Nintendo DS
now
I bring up Twinbee because Twinbee
leads to
actually
the one that I like better than this
can I say this though in chat real quick we have somebody saying
isn't this Stinger?
yes you got to do Stinger
so in the US it was called Stinger
yeah in the US it was Stinger
but now let's
move forward
sure let me queue up the other game here
tell them a little bit about this
now this is the one that I like better and one that my husband
and I played the crap out of last night
is Detana Twinbee
which
is
they actually came out in Europe
as bells and whistles
so anyway
this is the sequel to the original Twinbee
but the arcade
and Famicom versions and it plays
pretty much the same but it has
much much better graphics
and music in Project MC
yeah I've never seen
this game before this is pretty sweet
for an old school like 16 bit
era game this is pretty sweet
it also had little cut scenes that were in between
levels where you could see different
characters hanging around
actually one person plays as Twinbee
the other one plays as Winbee
and you can also get
a ghost
pilot which was
oh god
now I can't remember what it was called
it's definitely not in the article I'm looking at
but the green one
no I never played this game enough
oh but anyway you can also get
like a sort of ghost pilot that will hang out with you
um
and uh
it brings in the pilots of Twinbee and Winbee
which is Light and Pastel
um
also it's um you can actually get this game
in the Twinbee deluxe pack
for Playstation and Saturn
could be portable for Playstation portable
PSP sorry um
the version that I linked here is the PC
Engine version um
it also came out on the
X68000
and um
it's actually um out
um on Virtual Console
now so you can get it too
um
another thing that was cool about this one
is that it actually led to um
a Twinbee
OVO
that was actually kind of cool
but yeah this
whenever I think of Twinbee this is the game I actually think of
because it was so much fun
like some of the power ups you can get are so cool
like you've got a shadow
I think the shadow is if you hit
no red is you get a barrier
um purple is the um
the multiple
image following after you
and then you can get like you know
different directional shots you can extend your shot
you can get all kinds of different
you can actually get shadows
that follow you behind too
um you also have a charge move where you can shoot
out like a big stream of fire
and if you use your bomb button you can target
things that are on the ground
and shoot um
things that are on
the ground
like that with bombs
um but this is
to me this is probably
one of the pinnacle of
um shooting games
really is
and it's cute
and it's super cute
but don't don't don't
you know think differently because it's cute
it gets hard
you get flying like
looks can be deceiving
where I died is when all these freaking chickens appear in air
and run at you
you know I think I died in Zelda that way once
seriously it's like oh flying around
chickens run
dead die
yeah
and of course it's got beautiful voices too
and the music in it is freaking fantastic
so it's Detina Twinbee
alright there it is
Konami give us a new Twinbee
there it is folks your classic game of the week
Twinbee, Stinger, Rainbow, Bell
more importantly the game
that inspired Detina Twinbee
for the PC Engine
there it is your classic game of the week
that's going to be a hard one for folks to find
last week was easy you did what Secret of Mana
two weeks ago because we weren't here last week
you did Secret of Mana two weeks ago right?
if you've got money
or virtual console now
I was really referring to playing it on the sneeze
alright well there you go
I will say
you can get a PC Engine
core graphics for not
too much money if you know where to look
which would be where are you going to share?
was it
Pink Elephant I think
was the company
oh that was it
oh the folks that were at PAX
we got ours at Classic Gaming Expo
a while back so I'll see if I can't find the name of it
and put it up on the forum
oh my god you've got an SUV on a building
anyway
my
that's awesome
okay I'm being distracted by falling cars
but also the HuCard for Twinbee
actually shouldn't be that
expensive if you
have someone buy it for you in Japan
I don't really think the HuCard is that
expensive at all I will tell you
one thing if you're trying to play a HuCard on
an American system none of the
converters really work even if you've got that
purple one it's freaking expensive
and it works half the time so don't even bother
with it just get a PC Engine
the end
alright well we're going to take
a break here and come back with more of Orange Lounge
Radio there's still plenty we have yet to discuss
this week we haven't even gotten to some of the Playstation news
that came out of E3 we're going to talk about a little bit
of what is this cross eye
she XE
we're going to try and make some sense out of this
and what it's all about right after
a quick break so we'll be back in just a few minutes with
more of Orange Lounge Radio unless you're on the podcast
it's only a few seconds so
we'll be right back
Music
Music
Music
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this
Sunday evening March the 29th of 2009
where we're taping live
on All Games Radio www.allgames.com
bringing you
more of the latest and greatest in video
games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
we also do a little
simulcast on
Justin TV where tonight
you're not looking at our ugly mugs doing the show
we thought maybe there'd be something a little more exciting
if we have a video well A I actually
lost the camera but I think this is actually working out
where Loki's actually playing a game during the show and
tonight he's playing Grand Theft Auto 4 but he's playing a special
version that he
hacked the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto
and it has super uber physics in it
yeah it has if you're
a fan of the PC version it has the
Super Comet which I added those
physics to the bus and to the ambulance
and then I modified
the
Mac I think it's the
Mac 11 in there to have a
pretty fast
fire rate and
almost a thousand rounds
in a clip and then
my punching has
a physics force of
60,000 so I can punch cars
into space basically
so
so you're gonna continue
to kind of play that throughout the show
but you gotta start you gotta pause it and do some news
cause we wanna talk about some Sony news
here real quick yes
so there's this alternate
reality game that's going on in
home right now thanks
to Sony the game
is called well it's
xi or she or
as I'm calling it cross eyed
I don't know the symbol itself doesn't look like xi
so I don't know where they're getting that from it kind of
looks like an hourglass or something
but whatever
but anyways they have a
trailer that was released I guess and
I haven't really gotten a chance to
do any of this
but apparently they have like a weekly
recap and there's some sort of
like clues you need to find and
kind of a ticker and stuff so
um
so you said it's the Greek symbol?
it's the Greek symbol so it's xi
Greek symbol really?
yes
what if this has to do with anything that's probably gonna tie in
with an announcement for God of War 3
or at least a release date or something like that
I wonder I wonder I wonder
ooh you're smart
but really no
and it's the summer right now
so July
anyways so I don't know what exactly
this is gonna be unveiling
I'm sure it's gonna
waste enough time to
E3 and maybe it'll make some sort of announcement
that ties in with everything
but hey who doesn't like a good
ARG I mean you know
I heart bees or I love bees or something like that
yeah
so cool if you want to check it out just
go in the home
I should sue for copyright because that's how people mispronounce
my name all the time is xi
it's xi
like KSI
xer xi
no I just no I think low key
at the nail on the head though if it's for anything
it is probably some type of underground
campaign for God of War 3
yeah sounds like
but it's interesting though don't you think it's interesting that they're actually kind of
doing new shit with home?
I mean that's what's kind of nice about it
it's nice that they're actually doing shit with home
although they still don't have like
what the trophy rooms and stuff that they had promised
in the beginning I mean whatever happened to that
maybe someday I don't know
or better functionality with the groups
that whole thing
yeah who knows
alright well anyhow let's talk about some other news at a Game Developers Conference
you know we talked about OnLive
which is a new console of sorts
not really a console but this is a console
now there's something else here
Tektoy is putting out a new console
the Zeebo
and it's going to do just downloadable games
which might make you think about the Phantom and all that stuff
I don't know
but the Zeebo here's the catch
it's coming out in Brazil this July
so it's not something that's necessarily being targeted here
at markets over here in North America
it's coming out first in Brazil
and then I guess some other markets maybe in South America
or other places
what's interesting
Quake, Evil Prey and Action Hero 3D
are some of the titles that are supposed to be already on the console
by the time you get it
it's not something that's supposed to compete with the Wii
the 360 or the Playstation 3
apparently what this console is going to do
it actually connects to a large 3G network
through a big cellular provider
and apparently
it's not necessarily about being the most powerful system out there
but it's supposed to be about
getting stuff through download channels
to help combat
piracy that goes on
but this is interesting
EA Mobile, Capcom, Namco Networks
PopCap Games, THQ, they're all on board
and it's going to cost about
$7 to $13
per game
I converted to American dollars there for you
the console itself, $264 American
though
the question though, I mean
I'm not really familiar with mobile games too much
is there really that much piracy of mobile games?
I mean
I would think that they're not losing that much money on that stuff
that's just my thought
YYR in chat
has a funny thought about the trophy room
that you'll have to buy the trophy room for 99 cents
and then you'll have to buy the bookshelf
and the trophy room for 49 cents each
because they can each only hold 3 trophies
I thought he was being serious at first
but no, I don't think that's real
anyhow, so yeah
there is a new console coming out just not in the part of the world
where most of you are from
but I do know we have some international listeners
so maybe this is something some of our international listeners
might get their hands on
and see if it's worth it or not
although probably the folks listening to this program
are already importing the more expensive stuff
$260 whatever dollars
American, I think $599 brazilian
for that system
is a bargain compared to what you would pay
for a lot of the consoles imported down there
so something to think about
yeah
well, there's actually
some news on the more
conventional system
I guess front
there is a
Katamari Damacy
tribute coming to
Playstation 3
the original one
is
well, the
original version I guess is supposed to be in
Katamari Damacy tribute
where it will be presented in
1080p
and have a new visual presentation
that's a quote
it's going to have
remixes
from the previous titles
as far as the music is concerned
and it's
I'm guessing it's a big
Katamari mashup
yeah, I think it's a bunch of the levels from the other games
wish there was some new stuff
it's still going to be fun
oh yeah
I'll have to pick it up
weird six axis stuff
no, they got rid of the six axis
no, I'm actually kind of surprised
that they're doing it as a download title too
because you would think something like that would definitely be able to sell at retail
six axis is still there
flower is run completely on six axis
it's actually fairly effective
I hate the six axis though
for some games it's okay
like flower, I think is a great game
it's not something you're going to invest a lot of time in
but for what it is, it's great
sorry bogey
so, I mean that would be pretty cool
I mean
I just don't understand
I would think they'd make more money at retail
if they brought it out
but maybe they just want less
you know
packaging or something, I don't know
whatever
something else that's coming the way of the PS3
and we were talking about home a little bit earlier
they're going to get some new spaces actually
including
a Guitar Hero themed space
called backstage with Guitar Hero
and of course
they're going to have
you know, all the House of Blues
kind of stuff, I guess one of the levels from the game
there's also a VIP space
in the back, which is sealed off
by a velvet rope
I'm not sure who they're going to have back there
and
you know, other than that
there's going to be
I guess maybe a
mini game or something like that
Rock God, which is kind of like Simon
like matching the cord type thing
and then some other
possible games may be in there
I don't know about you
but I think most of these spaces
that they have in home are kind of useless
you go there once and you're like, oh that's kind of neat
and that's about it
at least you went there
it's a free commercial for the game, right?
yeah, but I mean it's not anything real cool
like you can't say play
the PlayStation 3 version or something like that
and your characters appear on stage
performing the song
or anything like that
wasn't there this whole thing though that you were going to be able to launch
PlayStation games from within home
well I guess you still can kind of do that
but I don't know, you just don't see a lot of people actually doing that
compared to, I don't know, Xbox 360
just kind of seems to make it all easy
it's just like home is like a big
non-necessity I guess
I mean it's cool
it has a lot of potential
but they're not really using it
yeah
I don't know, but again anything they do
is going to be better than the ASL stuff that's going on right now
you know what I mean?
any cute girls want to chat, that's pretty much all you ever see
in a home, so any of this extra kind of stuff
might be kind of neat, I don't know
it would be nice if they would have like different types of spaces
within home, like you could go to
one server for social chat
one server for like gamer chat
but then again we all know nobody would stay in the zone
they're supposed to, so why am I bothering?
well PlayStation Home is just going to keep growing
you guys, you know there's not only, there's the Red Bull
area, there's the Resident Evil 5 area
Warhawk, now Guitar Hero, guess what
apparently according to Jack Bueser
who is the director of PlayStation Home
if you think about a game developers conference this week
you will see about quote, three new spaces
launched a month
that does make sense
though when you consider there's like over 20 companies
that are signed up right now that are supposedly going to be
making new content for Home
so there you go, apparently Home actually has
5 million users already worldwide
about half of those being in North America
so they say
that a good space gets
about 250,000 visits
every week, and 75%
of the users will spend more than
10 minutes on the space, and like I said
before, you know, despite the quality
the fact is, you go into these spaces
and it's like a giant advertisement for the game
which you might be more likely to buy
is that 10 minutes part of the downloading the space
or the waiting for the lag, you know
might not take that long, watching the
loops of Twilight over and over
yeah
um, yeah
I don't know, well they show
new movies on there now, don't they?
I saw Mall Cop in there for like 2 weeks
something
alright, well anyhow
well, you know what's better than everything in the universe?
uh, cake
zombies!
zombies with cake?
ooh, that would be fantastic
zombie cake party?
I love loathing zombies
um, there is a newcomer
to the Playstation store
that's called Burn Zombie Burn
um, that's gonna be
on PS3, there's also
to go along with that, um
is downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet
Pain, Resistance 2
Endwar, Call of Duty 5
and a PS1 copy of Magic Carpet
oh my god
I remember that game
well, Burn Zombie Burn
is by Double Six
it's going for
£6.29
in Euros at
£7.99
um, you have to
just hold off zombies
for as long as you can
and the longer you hold them out
the higher score you get
where have I heard of this before? Left 4 Dead?
the longer you hold off the zombies
the more content you unlock
based on your score
um, for Resistance 2 there's the Aftermath
Map Pack
and um, Call of Duty
World at War will get Map Pack 1
and um
they actually
have to pay more than we did on
Xbox, but I think it's supposed to be
much more touched up
um, there's the Pain Smack Pack
the El Chilli Grande
um, character
um, I guess for that
LittleBigPlanet is getting a Buzz
costume
Endwar and Unreal Tournament 3
get the Veteran Map Pack
and Titan Pack respectively
those are free
that's kind of neat that they have
some Resistance stuff
I just have to actually play through that still
well another thing for the PSP is
Buzz Brain of the UK
hmm
so
but that's for UK only
I think
well something we're getting over here
at least on the Xbox 360
I think it's in
where the regions have the
Xbox community games
and you knew that at some point
somebody was going to do something like this
well now there's a
um, a sex-rated
uh, Xbox
community game, sex-rated I guess
because it's slightly censored but it's still
kind of got the naughty stuff in there
it's a game
called Break One Out
and it's basically a Breakout clone
or um
but what's unique about it though
is there's this chick
Kitty who looks like a cosplayer
and there's revealing
photos of her
except, you know, where all the naughty bits are covered with black bars
but she is naked in the pictures
so basically you
play the game and you unlock naked
pictures of this one chick who
I don't know, she's alright
she's not hot
but you know
as hot as I guess a cosplayer
at your average anime convention
could be
I guess somebody made this game
just for the sake of making the first
controversial titty
filled community game, correct?
Probably
so
but, you know, hey
that's uh, it's out there
and I think it's cheap, I'm not sure if it's like
two bucks or something but
you know, it doesn't look very good
but hey, if you want to see the naked pictures of her
I mean, or
as naked as she's going to get
don't play the game, you can actually watch the video
I have a video online for it
but uh
I don't know, it's just like
if you want to knock some balls around while you look at the picture
you know, you can play the game
or you can watch the video and knock
some balls around
anyhow
YYR is saying that it was
only up for a day or less, do you think this thing was already
taken down? I wouldn't be surprised
it's alright, it was crap
I kind of wish I had downloaded it
just to have it, but
oh well
Microsoft
is in a little bit of hot water this week over something
you've probably seen floating around the game
blogs this week, and this has to do with
Lionhead Studios, who is of course
a subsidiary of Microsoft, they're the folks
behind Fable
and here's the interesting
part of this story
it has to do with a gay video game designer
and his name is Jamie Durant
he's going to be suing Microsoft for
45,000 pounds
due to hurt feelings, lost pay
discrimination, all due to his sexual
orientation, and this apparently
happened after Microsoft bought Lionhead
he's worked for this company for 11 years
apparently, and he says
things began to get a little bit uneasy around there
and starting around January
of the last year, he started getting abusive
emails, with subjects reading like
me and my favorite men
I'm Jim and I'm gay, and he was
given the nickname, Fag Boy Jim
he's
apparently complained to the human resources department
but nothing happened except
a promise and a memo that was
supposed to go around to the company about
diversity in the workplace and all these types
of things that companies usually do when they're
panicked that a lawsuit might happen
and that the firm was supposed to update the policies
none of this ever happened according to the lawsuit
and Durant also claims
that he was the one who was offered counseling
which he said to that, they're making
out that I'm the one with the problem
apparently he has been out of work
suffering from depression for seven months
and he's now seeking damages due to this
but
I don't know, here's the weird
thing, and the thing that's kind of weird about
this is that Microsoft has kind of
gotten praise from the
human rights campaign foundation for
the way they treat their gay and lesbian
and bisexual workers before, so
is this a problem with
one particular office?
Is this a problem with
Lionhead? Is this a problem
with the employee?
There's two sides to every story, right?
Is there something else going on here?
I don't know, it's
hard to say, we're only kind of hearing one side
of it. They'd have to do a really
thorough investigation to get any kind of
actual
point out of that.
The part of it that's interesting is the part
that he's already been out of work for seven months
and if it's due to this
it's gotta be really bad. It's gotta be
really, really bad. But
I mean, and again, I don't know this guy,
I'm not gonna slander this guy, I don't know anything that's
going on here, but before, you know, and I think
a lot of people might read this and go, oh Rob's
gonna be pissed on the show because he's gay too,
he's gonna throw a fit over this. Not necessarily
because I also know
people that sometimes
like to be the victim. Oh yeah.
You know what I mean? And when I hear this
whole fact about he's been out of work for a long time
I start to go, you know, there could be
another side to this coin. I don't know.
I don't know the facts. I'm not him.
But I do know that there could be more
to this than meets the eye.
I would just hope to hell. Maybe
I'm just hopeful and maybe foolishly
so. I just, I'm hopeful to hell
that in this fucking year 2009
we would just get past
this stupid school
playground bullshit.
I know. Sadly we haven't.
Not completely. Maybe I'm just
spoiled because I happen to work in a place
where this shit doesn't happen.
And I'm fairly confident
and almost 100% confident this kind of shit
would not happen.
So when I read these stories I'm just like
really? Really?
Fagboy? In an email?
Really? Someone's that dumb
to do something like that that can be
traced? Really?
I don't get it.
And Goldanthro in chat
says not pissed, eh Rob?
I don't know. Like if this story is true
fuck yeah I'm pissed. This is
inexcusable. This is stupid.
But
you know there's two sides to every story.
Just because the guy filed the lawsuit
doesn't necessarily mean it's 100%
true. I think that's one thing we have to remember.
Right? So I don't want to lose my shit
and start saying oh we should boycott
Lionhead and we should boycott all these games.
I don't know. Now if
it comes out through due process
and in the court of law that yeah
Lionhead did do something wrong
then I will lose my shit and prepare to say
some choice things about the company.
But at this stage it's a little early to tell, correct?
I agree.
Regardless, very disappointing
that this lawsuit is filed one way or
the other. So
of course you knew after a story like
this could only come a segment of ours we love.
Really my F.U. of the week
is just
people who
don't want to look at the facts
and want to use their own version.
It really, okay.
Only a few people will really get
the root of this but it goes towards
something that I
have noticed that applies to politics,
religion, and fandom.
Don't
twist things
into your version
of what they should be just to justify
what you, you know, believe.
At least admit fact.
If it's what you believe
then that's what you believe but at least
accept reality.
That's all.
And also to
being super exhausted
all day yesterday and being sick from it.
Then.
I personally
do not really have many F.U.s of the week.
Things have been going fine so I'll keep an F.U. to my incessant
napping habit. I nap a lot
and it's like screwing up my sleep schedule
royally. So I need to stop
that. An F.U. to lack of motivation
into my exercise program as well.
I need to get back on that.
Um, F.U. to allergies because my nose
has been all stuffed up the last few days.
It's all windy over here.
That's it.
Alright.
That's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.
Let's get back to some gaming news.
Dark Sakura, speaking of Lionhead
Studios.
Well.
I
am happy because I am
still sort of playing this game when I can.
But there is actually supposed
to be new downloadable content
available for Fable 2.
And that is exciting.
They're still paying attention to us.
People who are still playing it.
It's supposed to be
coming out in
the spring. So I'm supposing early
spring.
But there's
nothing, I think not a whole
lot that I'm seeing about what exactly
it is. They're just revealing
they're going to be revealing information
on it.
But they say that it's supposed
to answer questions if you've been
a fan of the whole series.
And apparently
it's supposed to be really dramatic. So I don't
know.
But there actually
though has been a statement by
Jonathan Ross
that he was offered a voice role
in Fable 3.
So maybe there's
a connection there?
Maybe there's something leading up into the next
game.
Great. Fable 3.
Well I don't think that's going to be any surprise.
It would be exactly the same as Fable 1 and 2.
Well 2 had a lot of differences
from 1 I thought. I thought they were very different.
Jonathan Ross
is pretty cool.
I don't know.
That's what I say about
that.
Well something not Fable
related. But kind of cool.
I mean this is one of the first games I've played
on my old
386 computer. This was the first
first person shooter
game I've seen.
Was it
Wolfenstein 3D
being released on
the iPhone?
How cool is that?
And
possibly
soon enough, Doom will be
released as well.
But hey, Wolfenstein 3D
man, that takes me back. One of the first games I
actually edited levels for using their
I don't know if they released the level editor
or if it was one someone else made.
But pretty awesome.
And you can actually play it now on the iPhone.
And
damn I can imagine that would probably run
pretty well since the game is ancient.
But
pretty cool.
You can speculate what they're saying in German.
Yeah.
And I guess it's free.
I'm not sure if this is like a free version of the game
or if they're going to do like a
you know
Oh it is free. I guess it's actually
part of an open source project.
So check it out. Free.
Hey, that's the best price ever.
For free.
Well
there's other games coming to the iPhone that aren't
free but they're very very nostalgic
nonetheless. Mega Man 2
is out right
now. It's not coming soon. It's already out
on the iTunes app store.
It's interesting though the way it controls
because since the iPhone doesn't really have any
controls on it which you would think
they're going to release something eventually.
They can just plug into the bottom of the iPhone and
voila instant gamepad. I don't know.
But right now you use a little joystick
that's on the bottom that is like kind of
a touch and then two buttons. So it's like a virtual
joystick using the touch screen.
But yeah it's Mega Man 2.
But I would think
it's going to be difficult to control because of the
fact it's kind of those weird buttons and touch
but hey there's going to be some nostalgic
freaking people that are very excited about this game anyway.
Do you think you could still
beat the first boss in Wily's Castle without looking
Dark Soccer on the iPhone? Oh heck no.
I can't even do it anymore on the Nintendo.
Seriously I'm
so out of practice on that game.
Yeah that would be tough.
Plus I'd be worried I'd get a phone call in the middle of it
and then the whole thing is just screwed up.
You know right as I'm starting to jump over a pit or something.
Seriously? Then besides that
I can just break out my Nintendo.
TigerKlonChat wants to point out
Loki, those games you were talking about before are
$4.99 in the App Store, not free. Maybe there's a free
version or something. Well yeah that's what I was
wondering. I was like free? But it said it was part of an
open source project and it said it was released for free
but I had my doubts.
Especially with Wolfenstein 3D. It wouldn't give
us something like that away for free.
And of course our chatters are already talking about
the Mega Man 2 thing
on the iPhone and X-Link says
do not buy Mega Man 2 it is hard to control.
AcidicVampire says IGN gave
the iPhone Mega Man 2 a 1 out of 10
and it's really awful to control. Not that I would
believe everything that IGN says but in this
case I would probably believe it.
The game probably does stink. I can totally see how it would be hard to
control. Especially given
the way that it's set up.
Is there a lefty mode in it?
I saw the joystick thing.
I don't know. That's a good question.
No.
It wouldn't work.
Yeah I don't think
that game is going to be any fun to play on the iPhone
at all but hey if you're that nostalgic and you
need it in your pocket everywhere you go
go for it.
Or just get like a Game Boy
or something I don't know.
Emulate the bitch on the PSP.
Actually I'll tell you what Dan and I did
whenever we won our Mega Man 2 fix.
We actually ordered a handheld
Nintendo.
That they make.
And they're like 70 bucks.
But we ordered one a while back. I'm waiting for it to arrive.
They're supposed to be
pretty cool.
Well how about something that's a little bit
happier. How about
some Guitar Hero
World Tour information.
Actually very specifically how about
Queen
on Guitar Hero World Tour.
There's actually
going to be a song pack that has
celebrity fat bottom girls
and we are the champions for
440 points
for the pack
or you can buy each one for
160.
And they're going to be 549 on
PlayStation Network.
You actually will be able
to get them on Wii as well
for 200 Wii points.
And then there's
supposed to be a
new recording of the James Bond theme
that's supposed to be available
coming up soon.
I saw
something on YouTube. I don't know if it was that
exact one. I thought it was one that someone made
how you can make your custom tracks
or whatever.
And it was pretty awesome.
So hopefully it's the same one.
That was a pretty awesome version of the Bond theme.
Lots of liberties taken
and it looked pretty hard.
Not
quite as kick ass on
the rock band.
We get some interesting
things. Including
Spongebob Squarepants music.
Who'd have thought we'd see that
in a rock band.
But apparently we are.
The Spongebob Squarepants pack
is actually going to be
relatively cheap. It's going to be
99 cents per song or 80
Microsoft points.
Those include
I Can't Keep My Eyes Off You, Best
Day Ever, and Where's Gary.
And then other than that
Journey is going to be
getting a song on there with Don't Stop Believin'.
And
I guess also joining
that would be Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker.
And that's
coming as well.
And then some other stuff.
Glass Vegas with
Geraldine and Come On Come On by
Von Bondis.
Not Bondis.
And that's pretty
much it for this week though.
Spongebob, that's weird.
Yeah, but Journey. Freakin' Journey's coming
out. So who cares? That's amazing.
They could have put a better song in there though.
You know what, I actually agree. I think Don't Stop Believin'
is way too cliche. And especially for a rock band.
You should have put it by
Wheel in the Sky. Yeah, Wheel in the Sky
would be awesome. But you know,
whatever. I'll take what I can get. I mean,
who isn't going to want to bust out with Don't Stop
Believin' at a party, right? I just see that one as being way too easy
even on Expert. Yeah, probably.
Who knows. Anyhow,
this is the part of the show where we like to open up the old
mailbag and read some of your emails
that you send to us every week at Mailbag at
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. So let's get into it.
First email comes from J-Rod.
Hey OLR crew, I'm emailing
to try to get your stance on this guitar hero versus
rock band war people are in.
I still don't see any differences between rock bands
that download content and a guitar hero disc.
It's both companies
putting out new content to the player.
I don't even own guitar hero
but I at least think it's a good idea to let
people without an internet connection actually be able
to play new songs. Look at rock band
on the Wii. Would you seriously
be happy owning that when
you see what's on the other platforms?
Then people complain, well,
I only want three of the songs. I don't want to pay
$50 for the whole game.
But then don't complain at all when they have to
buy a new Wii track pack plus
um, I'm sorry
Wii track pack for
a few songs just because
it's the rock band title.
People say Activision is running
the series into the ground but putting out
more content but isn't rock band doing the
same thing just not with a physical
disc? I don't see
how a disc makes any amount of difference
in the equation when it's still
more songs and more content coming
out by both companies. Again
nobody made such a fuss
with the ACDC pack or with the Wii track
packs the way they do with Activision.
Um, the only one I would
say is the ACDC pack because that wasn't
available online but all the rock band
track packs are just for people that don't have
internet connections and some random
stuff that's available for download content.
You do not need to buy it. It's not
its own, you know, I mean it can be its own
game which is fine but
it's not basically
you know, it's not required. It's not like
a Guitar Hero Metallica or something like that
where you're only going to be able to get those tracks
through that disc version. So I don't
really see the harm in releasing that because it
gives people an option that don't have the
internet connection to be able to
actually download some of these tracks.
And it's completely optional. Now the ACDC thing
yeah that's no excuse. That
you did have to get through that and that was
also an exclusive through Walmart so
And it was one band.
And frankly a band I'm
not interested in. Shock and awe I know
they're a great rock band but just not my
type of thing. But look at like
I was
going to say look at the stuff that they're doing
though with Guitar Hero right
now. They've got like Guitar Hero Metallica
they've got Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero
greatest hits. All stuff
that's not necessarily available on
their service and granted greatest hits are
some of the older songs that were in the older games
but I mean they could easily
release that as you know download content
for world tour. They don't need to have
it's own game and really it's not
adding anything it's just a reskinned world tour
just you know
now with whatever band
and I think it's kind of lame
that they don't even have like a track import
function that they do with like rock band.
I do know of people
who actually
do not use live at
all who
don't you know bother
with it who don't play online
so for them Guitar Hero actually is a better
option really.
But to finish out the email
cause he actually did go on with a little
bit more. In the end if you
ask me it all comes down to people crying about
switching discs. Are you kidding me
I own both rock band games and don't have
rock band 2 imported because it takes me
6 seconds to switch a disc.
I play a few songs I want on one game
then play a few songs I want on another game
and some download content. If you have friends
over in the whole place just shuts down
because you have to switch a disc
tell them to take their ADHD medication
before they come over next time. And that's the thing
with rock band you can import that stuff so you don't have
to switch discs it's all
you know you can dump it to your hard drive. He completely has the point of what he just
said. Well
the whole I don't know. The whole point of what he just
said is that it takes 6 seconds to change a disc.
Yeah well and here's the thing
it's all optional no one's forcing you
to buy Guitar Hero or
Rock Band so if you want it you want
it cool if you don't want it then don't buy
it. But don't feel that you're forced to actually
buy this stuff cause you know
as soon as you start buying every single release
it comes out just because you want to
be able to you know have
you want to support them so that they release
you know whatever band you're waiting for or whatever
I think that's a horrible reason to do it.
Well to finish the
email cause there's still a little bit more on this
what happens when the Beatles game comes out
because I'm sure you won't be able to import that into your
library. Are people going to be bitching about that?
That's all.
Honestly I think it comes
down to personal preference. I think Rock Band
plays better than Guitar Hero
in fact I think Rock Band plays
a hell of a lot better than Guitar Hero
it just seems generally programmed
to be more responsive so I have a better time
playing that. And in defense
of importing your Rock Band
One tracks it actually if you
want to mix and match
bands from both modes especially
when you can create your own setlist
it actually
it gives you more freedom to
combine it the way that you want to.
But hey whatever sinks
your battleship. Well the thing
also with the importing on the Beatles
version I think that was a special deal
that they had with I don't know who owns it
I think it's Apple or something
Apple Music that you know they didn't
want it to be imported into Rock Band
and it's not technically a Rock Band game
it's just kind of like Rock Band presents
the Beatles it's their own game
it's their own kind of thing going on there
so that's
going to be kind of like an exception but if
no ever comes out there's a
Rock Band Metallica
or something like that then yeah
I'm pretty sure that we'll have
import
functionality and that kind of stuff and then
honestly I don't see them actually doing that I would see
them releasing it as like an album you can
download because I think that they
would get a lot more hits because a lot of people
well I don't like this song
I'm not going to buy Guitar
Hero greatest hits because it only has a couple
songs that I want on it well if you
could download those songs individually at least you sold
those two songs you know whereas someone
might just avoid the package altogether if they can't
separate them it's all about
choice as Microsoft would say
well
the next email is actually
a short one and I think this is addressed to Rob really
because I don't think either of us were really boycotting
and he pretty much already
answered it but I'm going to read it anyway that's fine
now that the boycott is over what
are you most anxious to try out if you haven't
already discussed it
Bit.Trip Beat was one I was really looking forward to
I also want to go back and check out
probably one of the Commodore 64 downloads
just because I want to see how well those came over
I'm still kind of holding out for Impossible
Mission I would like to be the one I would get
but I'm not opposed to going back and getting one of the other
Commodore 64 greats like Last Ninja
or Pitstop 2 even just because
I have memories with that one
as far as the WiiWare games I feel so far behind
on a lot of those I don't even really know where to begin
but
I know Bit.Trip Beat was one I was definitely looking
forward to personally as well as the Gradius
Rebirth which were the two I picked up right away
after my boycott was over
that's really it I might go
back and
thinking about maybe getting some obscure Neo Geo
games but I don't know I don't want to go too crazy with the
money spending either it's very
easy when you're not actually
giving away tangible
cash but you're hitting a button that
drains it out of your bank account you know what I mean
that's something you got to keep yourself in check with sometimes
I used to buy
like every single Xbox Live Arcade game that came
out and I really had to stop doing that because
some of them were crap
but yeah I got to watch
out with going too crazy
on the Wii but I'll buy good stuff as it comes out
as I notice it
there was another music game
that had come out that I want to go back and check out
that I missed and
I don't remember the name of it maybe somebody in chat
will speak up but I distinctly remember there was some other
type of beat game that had come out
previously on WiiWare that I wanted to check out
Last email
This is from Spazinator
Hi everyone
at OLR I have a few questions for you three
to mull over I'll try to keep
this email as short as possible seeing as most of the ones
I've sent were a bit on the long side
one regarding PSN's
high velocity bowling PS3's version of
Wii bowling have you folks noticed
any problems with the game? Gameplay
in and of itself
seems fine to me but I can see
how a lot of people may have a problem
with the game specifically the characters within the game
so the characters are basically stereotypes
ranging from Latinos to
70's Black Panther-esque
characters and even
a gay flight attendant
if it weren't for the stereotypes this would be a great game
but as I'm actually
embarrassed to say that
as is I'm actually
embarrassed to say that I have this
I don't even remotely resemble any of the stereotypes
yet I find myself offended for the people
that the stereotyping characters are
supposed to poke fun of what is your position
on this am I just overreacting
or is there some cause for
concern?
I have a quote I'd like to say
about this
don't be offended for other people
please I'm
going to quote one of my favorite comedians
Henry Cho for
using the term
oriental to refer to himself
and someone says oh no it's Asian American
he says well excuse me for offending myself
don't be offended
for other people if they're going to be offended
let them be offended you don't worry about it
if you're not doing the offense
then don't freaking worry about it that's what I have to say
you know you're
you didn't make the game
you bought it and you didn't know
that it was in there you know
just
roll with the punches fucking deal with it
it's there it's you know
I personally I crack
up as hell at redneck
stereotypes seriously and I
can say that's all my family
you know I know that not everyone from Alabama
is stupid and inbred but
I still laugh at Larry the cable guy
cause that's a parody
you know I
I don't see what the big deal is his name isn't
Larry and he's not really a cable guy exactly
it's parody
perpetuating a stereotype for satire
uh
I haven't played the game I don't really
want to make a comment on something I haven't really seen
first hand but it doesn't sound like it's
as long as it's there's a line
there's a real fine line a real
fine line between poking fun
and maliciously
you know hurting
people and I doubt this game is trying to maliciously
hurt people if that makes sense
um but I don't know I'd have
to see it it's a bully title how
could it be malicious unless
it's just over the top
with you know
if the characters just look that way
and may have a little bit of dialogue that's just
that's just supposed to be fun
you know
people need to really I think
just toughen up and get the hell over it
and you I
this is my opinion again I'm not telling you what to believe
but I don't think
that one person has the right
to be offended on behalf
of another person especially
if there's a chance that they're not offended
that's just
me
I doubt I would be offended
by the little gay flight attendant or whatever
in this game this is like every single
game has those kind of stereotype
characters because people can identify
with stereotype characters you know
um they're in
movies I mean
how many stereotype movies are
out there I mean of just like
all sorts of stuff it's
just it's part of everyday life
in the media unfortunately even in Austin
Powers we had Foxy Cleopatra
and that was just a nod back to the
70s movies you know like
the what's her name Pam Greer
you know
Bobby in chat says I'm offended on dark
soccer's behalf about offended people
they can
bite my ass
chew on that for a bit
seriously
68 makes an interesting comment I don't know how far we want
to go with this but I'm going to open
a whole can of worms here we go
68 says by that same token
everyone who isn't not
straight shouldn't have voted no
on prop 8
or should I don't know he used bad
grammar here should have that's
not a matter of being offended
that's a matter of a human rights issue that's
different your
that's apples and oranges right there
it's a matter of
taking something personally
that doesn't apply to you
I mean if we were really you know
this is something
that was supposed to supposedly
affect the entire
population of California
you've got
it would basically create new
taxation it would change
economic status
it was a very big
thing it's a big human rights issue
there's a difference though between
like I know people
who
may not particularly agree
you know with the lifestyle
who voted no on prop 8
just because it was
a matter of human rights
I don't know how far I want to go with this but I can just
say you know it's like
you know obviously the issue was very important to me and the
result was very very very very very disappointing and
I even had some people tell me that you know
they voted yes on it like
I don't know they felt the need to confess they
they voted yes on it because
church or god told them to
and it's so it's so frustrating because
it's like think for yourself
how would you like it if it was you
it's not a choice alright
god anyway sorry
I could go on all day about it
different show whole nother Oprah
I will go ahead and plug my blog
if anyone wants to know my
opinion on this I posted the
blog on darksacroix.com
and please don't
spam it I don't care
um so how about there's the email
yes please okay
currently I have a relatively cheap
Sony Bravia surround system
which I got from Target last year
for the most part it serves its purpose and sounds
good but there is one problem I've noticed
unless I'm playing a DVD
it's um and it's built
in DVD player I won't get surround sound
as is in terms of input
the system has typical red white RCA
jacks um mini plug input
like what you'd see on headphones
some kind of jack I'm unfamiliar with
all I know is that it's the one
iPods use for outputs
I guess um in essence
is there a way to trick my surround
system to accept stuff
like my PS3 or
360 surround which supports
sound output and actually hear it in my surround
sound and basically in my SOL
any info on this will help a lot
thanks um my recommendation
is um
to uh go on eBay and look
for a hardened Karman receiver and just
use your speakers and use that
it sounds like your receiver doesn't actually
have surround sound maybe Prologic
um which would be why you
don't have any actual digital or analog
um you know
surround sound inputs
usually you would have an optical in
um which you might see on the back of your
PS3 or your Xbox
360 on like the component cable and stuff like that
or um
sometimes a coax as
well which would be kind of like your RCA
plugs but they're orange
so um
I don't know
if you don't have either one of those you're probably not gonna
really get true surround sound unless they
have some sort of surround sound mode in it and
it's gonna have to be Prologic which you're just
gonna hook up through your um standard
RCA red and white my initial thought
with this was anytime you
use a converter you're gonna lose some sound quality
right you know so
isn't that part of the problem too
no it's just that he doesn't have an actual way
to send the 51 signal
over to his um system
it's like my old
tech support now suddenly look out
twit it's like I had a was it
I had an old system
that looked like it was you know 51
it had the surround sound speakers it had a center
channel and you know the left
and right and the two rears and stuff
um but it was not surround sound it was just
Prologic because there was no actual
surround it did no surround
sound processing uh tip from
Tigerclaw here in chat the surround receiver
must have optical inputs to plug the PS3
or 360 into it my receiver
has one optical input and I have the 360
connect to it and it's outputting 5.1 surround in the
games
act theft is calling this call for help
olr edition
nice um
I
I still say just
you can find a good used
card and receiver for not that
expensive
the new ones 700 bucks
each old ones anywhere between
150 to 300 bucks
and you will never regret it
they're fantastic have you tried
rebooting your router
did you turn this did
you turn it off
now wait a few seconds
and turn it back on no
seriously I watched the last
episode of Supernatural where they were
sort of put into alternate lives and I just the whole
tech support thing made me twitch because
I've heard all this before and it was
anyway I would I love whenever
I call Comcast to say the cables out and that's the first
thing they tell me to do I'll be like okay
okay I did it still nothing
and I didn't do a damn thing I'm just
just sitting there going oh this
still doesn't work what I do is
I I call I
I say okay please allow me to say
before we begin this discussion
yes I have reset my modem I've
reset my router I have done a repair
on the system and I've gone through all my network settings
it is not on my end
okay we'll ping it from here
that's always what happens
can you try opening the call
can you do a ping
I don't know anyway forget it let's move on
enough tech OLR
although I do have something
to add but I'll do it in last minute stories
this may be cool
Taito
guess what Taito is doing
they are still doing
more first person shooters in the
arcades you know
they did the half life 2 survivor
and now they've got one called
cyber driver which is
a take on
another first
person shooter game but it's supposed to have five on
five networked play and a different
game system so you can see
your battle damage in game
so it's supposed to be pretty
the screen capture looks pretty cool
but I'm like meh
because first person shooter
is high boring
unless they're call of duty
but it could be cool
I know
well
something else that's
interesting
this kind of goes back
to all this
stuff we've been talking about alternate services
that are going to be not necessarily competing with
consoles but
are
well level 5
from the many games
that they have put out
has announced a new
digital distribution service that will be launched
in japan in june 1st
and it's called
roid
like roid rage
but what's interesting though is
one of the first games that they're putting out
looks like earthbound
not necessarily earthbound
might be part of earthbound
but looks like earthbound
how exactly does the game
look like earthbound is it just like
sprite based modern
you know like set in kind of
city type thing looks
very earthbound-esque like the sprites
look very similar and they're wondering
could it be an earthbound game
like maybe an earthbound 4 or something like that
who knows
well
interesting I guess we'll see maybe this is something
we'll get more details at in a few months
and roid for those who may not have heard of it
is actually kind of like
a little bit like that zebo
thing that we were talking about earlier
it's its own platform
actually looks like one of those
the imac ones that they have
the little compact ones
I don't know it's interesting
it's cute
and I really dig the font
that's kind of interesting when the first thing you notice
about a game is the font
no the game the little
disc thing no I'm just messing
it's cute
I looked at the screenshots it did look a little bit
cute so
alright anyhow one more story for you guys
then we're going to open up the skype line
and it has to do with
other rpg series
full of fanboy wank we've talked about earthbound
a couple times tonight but we have yet to
address the wank that is final fantasy 7
and of course
how many final fantasy 7 fanboys
did not get the chance to fap to
advent children well advent children complete
is apparently the
final end of the
advent children saga meaning that there
is no more special
editions or directors cuts or you know
hidden scenes or any of that advent children
complete is the end of the line
which by the way did I not also read somewhere
this week that they did confirm this for the US in June
I want to say yeah but not the cool
version with the final fantasy 13
demo don't
but if you want if you're willing to
settle for the one without it or don't want to deal with the
import or what have you you can at least get it there in June
yes I'm not willing to settle for that so
import that bitch
however here's the thing
final fantasy 7 however as a whole
not done
Nomura has actually come out and said there is
still ideas for the next
product in the compilation
of course why don't you just do the final
fantasy 7 remake and then everybody will
be the next one coming
do you think
you think for real I think that final fantasy
7 remake is just something that will all
only live on in that singular tech
demo and in fanboy wank fantasies
I think final fantasy 7 will be
released on Playstation Network around the time
final fantasy 13 shows up especially
with the other final fantasies being confirmed for
the virtual console I think that's just a matter
of time and there'll be
plenty of wank and new wank
as more people discover the series for the first
time
but I don't think
that final fantasy 7 remake is gonna
happen but I'll tell you what all they
would have to do is add like
tiny little things to
final fantasy 7 when they re-release on
Playstation Network and
millions millions sold
through Playstation Network millions
just say you're gonna up the graphics
slightly and just put like fucking smoothing on
it or something and it'll sell zillions
I want a new remake
I actually do want a new
remake wank wank wank wank wank
seriously well keep in mind
final fantasy 7 is actually one of my favorite RPGs
ever it was
one of the first ones I played on the Playstation I
bought the game before I had a
Playstation if that's any indication
so I could play it at my friends
house I want final fantasy
6 to get the love
and adoration first before final fantasy 7
gets it but final fantasy 7
was really
I want to say a milestone
in the title and the fact that it brought
it into the
new realm of 3D
seriously and I
enjoyed the story I love the characters
except for Aerith who I was glad was dead
dead dead dead dead
after the first disc
and then they announced
final fantasy 7 Aerith's return
you know what I actually would not
mind seeing so you can kill her again
is them putting in the quest that they took out
for the US version where you go back and talk
to her ghost
hmm
that I would like to see actually a fully
complete version I think that would be cool
Bobby's in chat saying I bought my Playstation
1 for final fantasy 7 me too
you may not know this but me too
I couldn't afford the system but I damn well knew enough people who had
one and I bought the game
I made myself broke because I was working
in an arcade but still
it was super
cool
I was like oh my god it's 3D
and now I'm like oh my god it's blocky
alright
well we'll see what is next
in store for the final fantasy 7
sequels upon
sequels upon sequels so
alright anyhow
let's move on and get to the Skype line
if you want to give us a call now is a great time
to do so 1-877-GAME-OLR
our username on Skype is
orange lounge radio
let's go to the phones and take a call it's already
ringing hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
I'm offended
whatever
on your behalf
I am offended for you why
I don't know I was just gonna say that
hey what's up it's Bobby not much hey Bobby
I'm glad you called because you know
you have us on your show every week
and yet you know we don't get to hear from you
all the time usually because you go to bed
probably by this time
but we got to the Skype line
before midnight eastern tonight so I'm glad
to hear from you what's up Bobby what do
you think of the show tonight
I like the show from what I heard I had to go
do other things unfortunately so I'll have to listen
to the archive but no I actually had a specific reason
to call in and specifically
talk about this on your show because I
heard about this on your show several weeks ago
ok and it's
regarding iPhone games
and to preface this a little bit
Apple really takes their user
interface and their user experience
very seriously when you get
into the iPhone developer program there is
like this document you have to read through
that says this is the user experience
we expect for
every user of our device
and there's one game that
completely breaks this user experience
and I am very shocked
that it's available on the App Store
and it's one game that your
roommate Rob recommended
on this very program
oh really and that would be the
role playing game he was mentioning a couple weeks ago
right, ARVALE
A R V A L E, ARVALE
it has a lite version and so
I played the lite version because you know before
I bought the full version and he probably
hasn't seen this because he said he bought the full version
so you probably never saw the
egregious insult
to humanity that
ARVALE does
it's strictly against Apple's
user agreement so basically
when you're playing a game on your iPhone or an
iPod touch what do you expect to
happen when you hit the home button
the big square button you're gonna
go back to the main menu
exactly that's what you would think right
right and that's exactly
what Apple wants all of their
developers to do it it has to do it within a certain
time frame so you have
like literally like three to five seconds
maximum to
all your stuff save everything and go back to the
home menu well ARVALE
decided that is the perfect time
for them to try to tell you to get more
money in the lite version
of ARVALE when you hit the home button
it loads up Safari
so it goes to the menu and then
it loads up Safari which then
closes and opens up the app store
to a non active
URL
so it goes to the home page of the app store I think
they wanted to actually have it
pop up the full version of ARVALE so you
could buy it but this happens every
single time you close the app
interesting I'm on
an iPod touch so I don't know if it does that if you
get a call because I mean
I don't have the phone portions or anything
oh god that would annoy me
but yeah so when you close the app
it takes you
to Safari first
which then closes immediately
and takes you to the app store and it winds
up that the URL it gives the app store is not a valid
URL so it just goes to
the featured front page of the
app store interesting
no I mean you know
since John isn't
as into the games as the rest
of us are he probably didn't even ever really
notice this or maybe just kind of you know put up with
it because he enjoyed the game or what have you
but that's fascinating why do you think Apple
you know aren't these things supposed to be
I don't know but then again the Apple store is
swamped with these types of games
so whatever review process they
have can't be that thorough
so I suppose that's why this type of thing didn't
get caught but is it interesting that the game is
still on the store
after all this
it's not that they're not thorough because
they would have seen this because it does take
several weeks to get approved to go on the app
store once you submit it I'm not
exactly sure how much I can divulge of
it because there is like an NDA involved in stuff
but it does take a couple weeks and they do go
through and make sure that you're following
their user interface guidelines there's
several things you cannot do
in a game one of which
I believe I can go ahead and say is
you can't have any buttons on
the UI that you can't
use so you can't say this
button is disabled in the free version you can't
do that they will reject your game and they do find
that so
they do go through and make sure that every
in the game
in the light version of the game is usable
you cannot have any feature that's there
but not usable
so they go through at least that much because I know
a lot of people have complained about getting their stuff
sent back because they don't follow
these user interface guidelines so I have no
clue how RDL lite got away with
when you close the game it opens
up to other applications I don't know how they got it
but that being said I did not play it
again I deleted it right then I didn't
bother trying any further so I don't know if it's any
good or not. Interesting
huh that is a pretty shady
thing to do though with that
that's unfortunate but yeah I know
he had the lite version because he was playing it for a little
while so
but maybe some of us kind of expect
that that's what the free games are going to do and it's over
if we haven't played so it's interesting to have that insiders
perspective that they're technically violating the agreement
weird
I wonder if anything's going to happen
yeah I mean I hope
so I should probably report them and stuff but I mean
the iTunes reviews don't even mention it
there's a
then it like opened up three other apps
one
but like this game is awesome
all of our JRPG and stuff so
yeah I don't know
Bobby you're cutting in and out of there a little bit I don't know what
that was all about but
maybe yeah maybe it's just
I don't know maybe I have no
idea it's so weird that people would not call that
out in the reviews either
now I kind of want to download it to see
if it happens with me too
we'll see well they
updated it so I
you know there's no
it's a mindset
Bobby's cutting in
and out really bad Bobby
can you still hear us
are you guys able
to hear me yes we can you're just cutting in and out
we have a lot of lag issues going on I don't know what's
up with that weird
but yeah maybe I don't know could it be that the
new patch
they put out maybe cut this off
maybe
hmm interesting
so what's this about you guys coming more like
FNG with live game play
is Loki going to be taking a part
of the receiver now no I don't think this is something
you can expect every week just when we have something
to show you know this is a little special because
Loki you know I guess
thinks he's the second person ever to
attack the game like this I'm sure there's many other people
the second person that's actually posted on the internet
I see so you know
not a lot of people I guess we could say have done this
and he wants to kind of show this off and maybe if we have another
special game that we want to show
like a Tatsunoko vs Capcom kind of thing
we're doing fucking excitebots
when that comes out but I'm telling you
excitebots hell yeah
I don't think you can expect this from us every
week no I just like tossing
cards we don't have a switcher to switch back and forth from
the game to the camera and all that stuff so
it's one or the other we don't have the fancy
little set up that you
three camera set up that you have at the
gaming arena as soon as we don't have the camera
right now this is what
you're going to have to get and it's not a video
show and I don't think any of us want it
to be a video show right now I think we're all interested
maybe in doing well some of us are interested in doing video
content for the site but not
a video show it's Orange Lounge Radio
so
alright well Friday night gaming is 8pm eastern
5pm pacific on Fridays awesome way to
work in that there it is
and now a featured Ustream channel so you can watch
it on the Ustream app on your phone
alright
alright take care Bobby
bye bye
he's cutting out there even at the end what's up with that
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
uh it's deathwishing hello
deathwishing what's on your mind
uh I've been really pissed off
since not last Thursday but the Thursday
before that why is that
uh well if you didn't know when the
Call of Duty map 1 came out
there were billing problems
did you guys hear about that at all
no but again admittedly I don't think
any of us are rabid Call of Duty players
so fill us in on what's up
put it this way I bought Microsoft points
during this time with a points
card
and uh I come home
I come home right just walking home cause
gas uh
and uh I'm really excited I enter
the code in I get my points right and I'm like
cool I'm gonna get the maps it says points are added to my
account click the button buy the maps since I have
insignificant funds
I'm freaking out wait a minute are you on Twitter
no I'm not on Twitter
okay so okay somebody on Twitter
on my Twitter and I'm sorry I think was having this
exact same problem so yes I do
remember hearing about this because like didn't
something break down with like the billing service
or something that night and a bunch of people tried to redeem
their points they didn't get them okay somebody on
Twitter was complaining about this exact same thing you're
complaining about now that's why I asked this
so okay yes I did hear this
and I've been talking to Microsoft for
since then and they
first they told me 5 to 10 days and then after that
they told me uh I was
gonna get a call and I got the call saying I gotta wait
2 to 3 more days after that
and which and then the Saturday was supposed to be the
third day you know which they said I was supposed to
get the points still no points I tried
calling and now like they're not taking
my call it's
wow it's like a bad breakup
or something now they're just ditching your call
and that's like 20 bucks man
I could have done a lot with that like
yeah
so you never did get the points
you're still waiting never got the points still
waiting wow they're lucky I'm
a patient guy too I'm
wondering if it's more than I mean
it's gotta be more than just you I should figure out
who it was on Twitter and follow up with them too
but there's a bunch of people on the Xbox
forums that were complaining too well I'm sure
some people receive compensation some people
still haven't huh so this doesn't
have to do necessarily with Call of Duty
specifically it's just that it
broke Microsoft server somehow
well in a way it does have to do with Call of Duty
it's due to all the people wanting to
play Call of Duty I see
huh
well I did you were you
ever able to get the map pack like did you invest
the points later no I still haven't gotten it yet
good for you holding out because there's
there's some people that are too passive probably
myself included that would have just ended up
spending the points when the building was fixed I've been playing Call of Duty 4
and got it anyway
burnout paradise
act deft and it says
Major Nelson covered this in his Twitter maybe it's the
person you think it is Rob
no I know Major Nelson was responding
to it but I distinctly remember there were people on
my Twitter like that too it's Major Nelson
who took it and he's just sitting in his bathtub
wiping his ass with 20 dollar bills
with points
I somehow doubt
that the poor guy has to look I do
not envy what Major Nelson does okay
because he has to take the heat of the
entirety of the internet and it's not him
that's screwing up you know it's
sometimes a computer error or something
that's true he gets paid to do it
but you know I don't envy him
Major Nelson's not really a person he's just like
the voice on the computer in Star Trek
that's all he really is
and what you see is just a hologram
he doesn't exist
it's all a lie
like the cake
computer error
that's what you're going to find out
on our very last episode of
OLR because someday it has to happen folks
there will be a final episode of OLR
and that's when the twist is going to be it was all
just a dream
I just
we need to get this problem out there that there are
people out here that paid money
and not just me I mean other people
that have wasted their money
and there could be kids
you know that don't have there could have been kids
buying this stuff they don't have that much money
you know
I know there's definitely a problem out there
it's weird that I haven't seen this on a lot of game blogs
but then again if I see Call of Duty 4 in the headline
or Call of Duty whatever
I'd probably scroll past it
just because
I don't play those types of games myself
alright well thank you for helping to get the word out
by the way about Final Fantasy 7
it's very emo
and I did not like it
10 was better
out of curiosity how old are you?
me?
I am
17
see there's something about that particular
see I was like 19
when the game came out
so I don't know if it's something about a generational thing
but I notice a lot of younger people
like your age and young 20's
have a lot more hate for Final Fantasy 7
and don't understand what makes it so freaking great
but then again
I replayed it actually recently
I know I know but it doesn't stack up to today's games
what I'm saying is that at the time
it was the shit
this is again
this is why I bought a Playstation
but again it's not for everybody
I mean I admit that
and I don't think Final Fantasy 7 by any means is like the greatest game ever made
or any of that so
you know
many sequels makes me angry
I like 7 and I like 10
it is possible
but I also liked 11 for a little while
alright anyhow Death Wishing we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls
but thank you so much for calling and have a great week okay
screw you Microsoft
bye
hope that stuff gets worked out
that sucks that Microsoft is just kinda like
a responses thing that's kinda shady
in my opinion that's just kinda weird
um I think we'll do like one more call
guys then we're gonna wrap up cause it's like getting
pretty late hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio
who's this
hello you're on OrangeLawnsRadio
who's this
is your microphone on
sir or madam
I guess not
alright I'll wait for one more call
see
what happens
hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio who's this
take 2 is it actually working this time
yes it is hi how are you
this is Jason I'm 23 and I'm an addict
oh I mean I'm a Final Fantasy 7
fan did I get that right
close enough what's on your mind buddy
no anti fan wank about
scratch tonight
yeah you know I saw the story in the thread
and then I kinda you know
but here's the thing is that I figured we kind of
already talked about it a couple weeks ago
I love how everybody is describing the controller
and I have a fucking picture of it it's awesome
I know I kind of feel like we already covered it
like that this new thing didn't really show us anything we didn't
already know or did you catch something we did not
which is possible
I think it's more the fact that I probably
didn't catch it because you guys probably
talked to it on a night that I went out to the hockey game
and so I didn't I missed the part of the show
that you guys talked I am just
weeks behind with this crap aren't I
it's fine it's fine I tried to
break up DDRS you already covered it in your gaming
week I'm trying to bring up this it's old news
well then
don't worry about if you're covering something we've already
covered or not tell us what you think because this show
is all about the user interaction
anyway you are a long time Bamani
fan obviously I met you through
such avenues as DDR Freak and all this stuff
I know you're a Rabid2DX fan what do you think
of Scratch? Where every gamer
has a voice I
it's I have the
same feelings for it that I do for Rockband
I've said this many times before and I'll
continue to say it I've played a lot
of Guitar Freaks I've played a lot of Drummania
Guitar Hero was really fun
and then Rockband blew everything right
out of the freaking water
it's a great game
Rockband 2 didn't change very much
but it's a great game
I've
loved the Beatmania series I have played one of
each of them original Beatmania
original yes Beatmania
Gameboy as Black Wolf showed off
on Friday Night Gaming two weeks ago
I've obviously played lots of
2DX and I've played a couple Beatmania 3's
including some songs with the foot pedal
the thing that's different with Scratch
is that I'm not looking
forward to it to the majority of
the song list because based
off what the trailer revealed for the artists
I don't care for a lot of those I don't care for
a lot of those artists
and I'm hoping they bust out some really good
electronic music not gonna happen
because it's scratching
that's why there's not a lot of scratching
in electronica but they are trying to
feature stuff that would work with that
something to put
in perspective as well and
as much as this hurts to say this game
was not made for you and it was not made for
me and it wasn't really made for fans of
Bamani who are kinda ticked off that
Beatmania never really took off here
because of what some would argue was a
poor first showing
even though DDR had a poor first showing as well
and it really grew and took off from there but
this game was not made for you and me
this game was made for folks that want to have an authentic DJing experience
with a certain genre of music that may not be our preferred genre yeah and the
American DJ scene is a lot different than overseas scenes I'm pointing more at
like UK and European very true Japanese very very true they're gonna put stuff
in it as long as you can scratch to it I mean that's basically gonna be it and I
hate you know reading that everyone's like oh it's such a ripoff of Beatmania
yeah it the interface is similar and like it way it's played is similar but
the whole scratching stuff is totally different than what they've done in
Beatmania. Beatmania is just another way to hit another button whereas this is
actually detecting real-life scratch techniques using the crossfader and
stuff you're doing the same techniques it's like skate you know where you're
doing techniques that you you can actually do except this you're actually
performing them how you would if you did this on a turntable a real turntable it
would be it sound exactly the same and again it's hard to say without playing
it yet but I would say it's very similar to how a lot of people when they first
saw Guitar Hero were like oh it's just guitar freaks but then when you actually
play it you're like but it's so much better what made well that's kind of a
bad comparison only and the Guitar Hero did play the same it just looked a lot
better because it had the whole 3d landscape and had a solid scrolling and
way better tailored to the masses yeah absolutely and I completely understand
that it's just kind of disappointing to the same man at the same time because I
would really love a DJ sim but again I'm not sure that I'm gonna be a big fan of
the soundtrack and that's unfortunate all things considered look at the big
picture though if this game does really really well in this controllers out
there and it penetrates the marketplace it does open the door for the get type
of game you want in the future so Konami can release beat revolution just to have
a go the whole bundle for 20 bucks two months later after its release you know
in a weird way yes and yeah and I think the thing everyone's like getting all
like a big-ass boner for fucking you know DJ here and we don't even know
anything about it yet they have a teaser pages like oh my god it's epic it's a
teaser page it doesn't show anything it's like really know what it's like
scratch oh wait I mean all it's gonna be is mixing music the other mashups yeah
that makes me interested in it because you know I kind of like doing that kind
of stuff I'm really interested in scratch because I've seen what the
controller looks like it's fucking awesome so you know I I don't know I
it'll be really cool to see when it comes out you know people I'm sure gonna
say oh it's you know such a ripoff the color wise but the colors match the
colors of the Xbox 360 controller they match up to what they are on the
controller because you're gonna be able to play this with a controller if you
want you know for two-player or something like that so you know you
don't want to buy another pad or something you can do that with like I
think the analog six and stuff but it's gonna be pretty awesome and it just it
really comes down to the song list and the marketing behind it they've got a
good marketing team it's the marketing team is the guitar hero too you know and
I think it's gonna be really awesome and you haven't seen everything on it yet
and they're really gonna start revealing a lot starting pretty much in April and
onto the release which was originally supposed to be in June but now I hear
sometime in the summer so you know I I have to reiterate and I know you were
talking you were you targeted more than people who are complaining at it for the
sake of complaining I really am looking forward to the game Rob you're
absolutely right it's oh it's gonna open the door to a lot of good things guitar
hero open the door to be sold off to be turned into rock band by the same by
similar companies and as I already said at the top of this that was amazing yes
the progression that's gonna happen three years down the road stands to be
excellent absolutely awesome and if I don't like the first game and the second
game has a better soundtrack great absolutely great baby steps Jason we got
to wrap up and go so we can wrap up the show but do you have any other parting
thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm trying to think of something witty and
nothing's coming to me so I guess not Jason what are we gonna hang out again I
haven't seen you in like five years you know it's funny I was reading the thing
the stuff about e3 coming around again and I kind of want to make that as a
trip this year I think you should but I don't want to drive that long and I
probably would be driving and not to mention with the new with the new house
and whatnot all money situation saving blah blah blah I know I'm trying to work
on it we have some other ideas and I just need to have some steel deals yeah
seriously I think our tickets down the southwest because we're going down there
for Nellie's birthday and for e3 is like $59 $79 we were ridiculous I flew to
Burbank for 69 and that's like cheaper than what it cost me in gas and you guys
would definitely be flying again to LA this year and not road tripping like we
did yeah I'm how does I do yet I might be I might be road tripping I haven't
decided yet it depends because I don't know how much my husband comes with me
then I'll be road tripping I don't know how much I want to get into my personal
life but I might be going to Vegas right after for a personal engagement so if
that's the case I'm gonna fly because I can't take oh I know what you're talking
about the reopening that I can't believe that that's cool anyhow Jason we gotta
let you go but well you know if nothing else you need to make it a point bring
rye come to Disneyland at some point that sounds pretty awesome although I'm
kind of a chicken on roller coasters but hey oh it's Disneyland there you go
that's right you tell him right hey I am the world's biggest chicken and I get in
the front for this damn that's right me and rye California screaming front front
row be awesome she'll enjoy that in about 30 seconds when it comes around
with you Jason and by the way it's actually the Jason and locate can hold
hands in the back then hey we're not gonna go on but it was a trip I making
all right Jason I gotta let you go buddy take care I like guys bye what do you
mean I can be able to go on roller coaster rides no reason okay anyhow
because because I can't stand the adrenaline rush and Nelly gets sick she
gets motion sick really easy actually all right well you guys so do I but not
in the front row you guys can just ride the fucking pair of tires you were right
it's a small world over and over again if whatever in the middle I'd get six
six six six six sitting in the front no problem awesome all right that's it we
get a wrap we're trying to wrap up get out of here and get to our afterbirth
and all that stuff but we've had a wonderful show tonight yes Jamie I want
to know who is interested in winning a turbo graphics 16 with no controllers
no plug no hookups just a turbo graphics 16 and they go along with that I have a
Sega Saturn to the same same deal there so to Saturn maybe we can sign them or
something we'll sign them even though I don't think our signatures are worth
that much but I'm sure some of our listeners let us know the mailbag who's
interested there's people already saying me me me me me I'll take it I do so why
the hell do you want our broken out it's free shit maybe I'll throw in some old
e3 swag you know I have I have hella old e3 swag I'll throw into we'll just have
a win free shit from olr and just send out grab bags of shit your own plug of
shit be why OP all right lots of stuff anyhow not literal shit by the way you
sick people okay last-minute story since I forgot to get to that a dark soccer I
think you said you had one that was a holdover for the mailbag actually that
was it I have to graphic 16 I'm giving it away
Loki did you have anything tonight or yeah I had a few things okay they're
first off there's Star Trek DAC we heard a little bit about it was teased on DVD
release that they had for the Star Trek series it's actually going to be an
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network title a little bit similar to what we saw with
what was it the Bellstar Galactica thing so that's gonna be good or bad I'm not
sure how you can take it but supposed to come out around the same time as the
movie so within the next month or so Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was announced
actually I think last week and there's some more information coming out about
that the game of course is going to be a kind of a port or I don't know what
Ninja Gaiden black was to Ninja Gaiden say or Sigma the first one it basically
they're gonna take Ninja Gaiden 2 and they're going to add a bunch of stuff in
there including there's going to be dead or lives
Ayane in there as well they're gonna bring back the chick from the first game
I think and there's also the female warrior from Ninja Gaiden dragon sword
which is on the DS so that's kind of neat file front is shutting down so no
more patches and demos from that site which is too bad speaking of iPhone
games nobody nobody boy has been announced to be coming to the iPhone
that's scary there's another thing to they're saying that nobody nobody boy I
guess she was saying that in order to get to the end of I guess Pluto it would
take a hundred twenty years of the current rate right now so I don't know
if we'll ever see the end of this game or if they even program the end of this
game and then rob kind of alluded to it a little bit ago that we're gonna be
seeing some Final Fantasy tiles on the virtual console including there's I
think the cell phone gave me that had was sequel to Final Fantasy for the
after years as well which is pretty sweet and of course one that I know Rob
was excited about Hello Kitty online has been announced to be coming to the US
how did we miss that on Cheryl tonight I don't even know maybe I'm waiting for
the game to come out itself and one other iPhone app that I saw a little
thing on apparently there's an iPhone fart app that had apparently yippy
apparently the iPhone phone app aromatic and there that's the maker of pull my
finger apparently they're in negotiations to sell dispute pull my
finger once upon a time I guess was an application on the iTunes Store and
apparently was being overtaken by I fart which is now done two hundred thousand
dollars in sales since its release and now they're I guess saying that it's
been kind of ripping off of the one of the other I guess and there's some
patent lawsuits I guess I don't know really it's a farting app for the iPhone
do we really need this no we don't answer your question
all right let's go around to your base final thoughts we can wrap up and get
the hell out of here for tonight dark soccer and my final thought is wine is
tasty did it help to chill the glass Rob I didn't show long enough this is my
favorite one I did I can definitely tell leaving the bottle open really ruined
the way it was yummy on Friday your final thought my final thought is and
this is just kind of a PSA but just remember that this Wednesday happens to
be the first day of a certain month namely April which people like to pull
pranks and announce fake things and whatnot so just be wary of anything
that's being announced next week as there's a very likely chance that's
gonna be fake and most people if they have legitimate to announce they're not
gonna do it next week so just be aware I got a thought for the contest of giving
shit away if we wanted to like take those things those Saturn in the
turbo graphics and take them to e3 and get like Bobby and Scott and all them to
sign it then they might be worth a little more cuz they have all of our
signatures on it and how often are we all under one roof
hmm I might be Scott was on TV years ago I mean his autographs were something
right I don't know the only one left of us on TV too that's true we were on the
local news that all right I was a Wow expert on the news a few months ago all
right forget it we're done we're out of here have a great week everybody will
see you next week we will be back next week on orange lingerie remember we do
