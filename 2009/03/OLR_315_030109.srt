1
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:24,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, March 1st, 2009, the R4 DS card gets smacked down in Japan, Cooking Mama is ready to fix it on your iPhone, and could a remake of Silent Hill be made for the Wii?

2
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:36,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:42,711
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:48,314
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:49,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I have beef.

6
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:51,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

7
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:55,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you don't get E. coli or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that.

8
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:56,078
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Beefy!

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:58,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Beefy!

12
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:25,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time.

13
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long.

14
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:29,596
[SPEAKER_04]: All day long?

15
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I was busy.

16
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to...

17
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,054
[SPEAKER_04]: GoToFries, and we were building a computer all day, and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something.

18
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got rained out for your thing once again, didn't you?

19
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And next week, and the week after next.

20
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't get me started on that.

21
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:55,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long, and then Sunday, POUR!

22
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:03,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at the weather for next week, it's the same way, except it's pouring all week, and then it has a break, and then pouring some more on Sunday.

23
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

24
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's not snowing here.

25
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:09,314
[SPEAKER_05]: On my Twitter today, all my friends on the East Coast are like, OMG snow, OMG snow.

26
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snowing in Alabama.

27
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's snowing all over the Southeast.

28
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,116
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

29
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you something else really cool.

30
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I had cheeseburgers for breakfast, too.

31
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Denny's, Denny's

32
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's very excited, saying, yay, Cheeseburger Radio.

33
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:44,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We also like to broadcast the show on Justin.TV, which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well.

34
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

35
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can put them on YouTube, but there's like one clip.

37
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,302
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to show this on Justin.TV, so I apologize.

38
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,082
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be horrible radio.

39
00:02:57,162 --> 00:03:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But DarkSakura, talk about the donations you've made to the studios.

40
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I are doing uber cleaning.

41
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like spring cleaning for the millennium.

42
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:15,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed but I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall.

43
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:22,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of.

44
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to see on the TV, anyway.

45
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,497
[SPEAKER_01]: To the wall.

46
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:29,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that wall, but the other wall, and probably that wall, too.

47
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:31,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ceiling, maybe.

48
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:32,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

49
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be able to really decorate in here.

50
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure our landlords will love that.

51
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:38,220
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to show this one in particular, because this is one of the coolest donations, I think.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of our longtime fans are going to get a kick out of this.

53
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But tell them what I'm opening up right now.

54
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:50,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee, which I have had for quite some time.

55
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:53,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like an actual, like used in a machine type thing.

56
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you put tacks in that thing, I will shoot you.

57
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then I can't put tacks in it.

58
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:58,834
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use sticky tacks.

59
00:03:58,874 --> 00:03:59,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll figure something out.

60
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:04,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But look at that, there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner that shows you it's the real deal.

61
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It means nothing!

62
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they really pirated second mix, though.

63
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,612
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that one actually is a legit second mix marquee.

64
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's my baby.

65
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to go in the vault, but now the vault is completely empty.

66
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the metal thing from the machine.

67
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the faceplate or whatever.

68
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I never did use that for anything.

69
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's around somewhere.

70
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:29,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it on over.

71
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put it in studio.

72
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:34,719
[SPEAKER_05]: But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff, Dark Sakura?

73
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um...

74
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:37,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know yet.

75
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really official, Rob.

76
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:40,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

77
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:41,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I won't say anything else.

78
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:42,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll say something.

79
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:42,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

80
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:44,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Burn it on air!

81
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we're going to burn some of it live on air.

82
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as I'm sure our listeners know, Dan and I have a whole lot of shit.

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,601
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff, really.

84
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:07,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we're going to be thinning out the collection, some of it, I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything, I might make a big grab bag for Who Wants My Shit?

85
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone is interested in that, then quick, quick vote in the chat room, wire in or fire.

86
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wants my shit?

87
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope fire wins.

88
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:29,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationery from six years ago.

89
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

90
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rurouni Kenshin stationery from eight years ago.

91
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Who Wants Jamie's Crap?

92
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot of Ys popping up in chat.

93
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: People want your shit.

94
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,423
[SPEAKER_01]: God, you want my crap.

95
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, I want your shit.

96
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:47,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Misty wants your shit.

97
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Old E3 swag, you know, just crap.

98
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So DJ Ranma S wants to know, where's the whiteboard?

99
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: The whiteboard is here.

100
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:58,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's down for repairs before we remodel the studio.

101
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:01,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it for a side project on Thursday, and I need to clean it up.

102
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob used it for Big Brother.

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:02,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

104
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it for the Big Brother game.

105
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:05,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just guessing.

106
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:05,583
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

107
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:09,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did on my own personal J... I don't know if I want to give out the link.

108
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:10,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it out in chat or something.

109
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:14,503
[SPEAKER_05]: But on my own personal JTV channel you can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week.

110
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:15,506
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

111
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,946
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura did, and some of us were...

112
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the venue was really nice.

113
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland.

114
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pretty venue.

115
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture.

116
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a new venue?

117
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd never seen anything there before.

118
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:56,283
[SPEAKER_01]: They're remodeling it.

119
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:57,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

120
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:57,823
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

121
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:58,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly old.

122
00:06:58,524 --> 00:06:59,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Fox Theater in Oakland.

123
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:01,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

124
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:01,985
[SPEAKER_01]: On Telegraph.

125
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

126
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:10,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, we went to Video Games Live, and we had Tommy on the show probably about, what, nine months ago?

127
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Tommy Tallarico, the guy that is really the mastermind behind it.

128
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Long enough to have a baby!

129
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:17,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he talked for a long time when he was on the show.

130
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:23,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, we really got some insight as to what was going on, so we finally got to check it out, because the show's been going for, what, three, four years?

131
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I never had a chance to check it out, and Bobby reminded me,

132
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:30,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio when we tape live.

133
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong as one of the selections for inclusion in video games live.

134
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:41,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, it works.

135
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I can eat my words.

136
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:43,429
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.

137
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:50,233
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole classic game medley thing was actually one of my favorite pieces they did because it did time the music very well when it was on the screen.

138
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:51,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I, in turn, will stay...

139
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to see it, though, Loki.

140
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like for five seconds.

141
00:07:58,392 --> 00:07:59,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even that bad.

142
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:01,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I say that the Pong idea is stupid.

143
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:02,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fantastic.

144
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I go on the record saying it's retarded and not fantastic in any way.

145
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but your opinion doesn't count.

146
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just an asshole.

147
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

148
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,475
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, it was good, though.

149
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:13,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did.

150
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:14,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good way to start the show.

151
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:19,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my medley of that trick, you know, the buzzing from the screen.

152
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:19,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

153
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did have some really random stuff in there.

154
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they had this... Rastan!

155
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that... No, but I'm talking about some of the pieces.

156
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,280
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the interactive Space Invaders thing last night.

157
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,320
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun!

158
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:42,064
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a guy get up on stage, and he would run to the left, and the ship would move left, and he'd run to the right, the ship would move right, but you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick moving it in the direction that the guy's running, because there's a huge, massive lag.

159
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:46,045
[SPEAKER_04]: But no matter what he did, the Space Invaders destroyed the two...

160
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:47,885
[SPEAKER_04]: and World Trade Center.

161
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

162
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: But he didn't win because Tommy was yelling, shoot the sides, you idiot, shoot the sides.

163
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like that, but he's yelling, shoot the sides.

164
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy didn't figure out how to do it.

165
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:03,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was thinking to myself, I was like, you know, there's really not a lot of music in Space Invaders.

166
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally three notes that the orchestra is playing faster.

167
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:13,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry, four notes that the orchestra is playing faster and faster with one person assigned to be the UFO.

168
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:13,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Beep, beep, beep.

169
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chorus was singing with it though

170
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:40,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole thing is more like a night at the orchestra.

171
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:51,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, there's a little more clapping and cheering and interactivity, but if video game's live, Tommy just comes right out and says, you just scream right along, you cheer for your favorite stuff, we just want everybody to have fun.

172
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:55,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can tell right off the bat they're going for a totally different type of setup.

173
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anyone go, what?

174
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:56,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

175
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:57,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Intermission!

176
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,435
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite part!

177
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,376
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think anyone cheered for the intermission.

178
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:02,857
[SPEAKER_01]: There was applause for the intermission.

179
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:03,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there?

180
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:05,039
[SPEAKER_01]: There was applause for the intermission.

181
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they had like a loading screen, which was really funny.

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, that was cool.

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,061
[SPEAKER_05]: That was funny.

184
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked that they had before the show and during the intermission, they would have little YouTubes, like that Ms.

185
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:21,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man for Reels thing, and some of these things would show up randomly during the usually dead parts, and it was cool.

186
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I had a good time.

187
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a mini convention, and obviously a lot of the arrangements were beautiful.

188
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:29,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot just how awesome the music is in Civ 4.

189
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:33,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy they included that piece because Civilization 4 was amazing.

190
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,016
[SPEAKER_01]: The singer was very nervous.

191
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:36,497
[SPEAKER_01]: The singer was very nervous.

192
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did a good job.

193
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,179
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a gorgeous voice.

194
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:41,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

195
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:42,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The God of War.

196
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a series I've ever really been into.

197
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Her voice was impressive.

198
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

199
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Her voice was amazing.

200
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Until he makes me want to play that game now.

201
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,944
[SPEAKER_05]: The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner, obviously, if you've listened to the show long enough.

202
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sonic thing kind of wasn't mine.

203
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

204
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Crono Trigger, Crono Cross

205
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,704
[SPEAKER_01]: and the first guy gets up and goes, for the Horde!

206
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:38,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people, ah!

207
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:38,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's cheering.

208
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, for the Alliance!

209
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:41,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo!

210
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Our area was booing.

211
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:43,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.

212
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, parts I didn't like.

213
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jamie disagrees with me on this.

214
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:48,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,241
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say I didn't like it, this is like constructive criticism.

216
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, I thought the show was great.

217
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:54,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time.

218
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:55,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed myself.

219
00:11:55,281 --> 00:12:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there's one thing I could have replaced with something else, because he goes up there and he says, hey, we have like 60 things we could choose from, and it's really hard to pick 20 that we can do here at night.

220
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:10,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So my suggestion, lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith thing, because it didn't fit to me.

221
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:11,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not fit with the rest of the night.

222
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too, blah, blah, blah.

223
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, we understand Tommy Tallarico is related to...

224
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,426
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

225
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go to Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion.

226
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:23,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

227
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I sure did.

228
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It just was not what I wanted to hear.

229
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:32,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt like I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week on YouTube or any of that stuff.

230
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't care for that.

231
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:41,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I go online and see, oh, I could have heard Bioshock, and instead they gave me that, I was a little disappointed.

232
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:46,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand they wanted to give more stuff away, do another interactive cheer, cheer, cheer thing, but for me, it didn't work.

233
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:47,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like it.

234
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:52,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best thing to have done with that would be to have brought the guy out and said, here, here's your prize.

235
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,847
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the dude that won!

236
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:54,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

237
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:55,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye!

238
00:12:56,048 --> 00:13:04,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I would even go for like a music game tribute that does like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces of the songs or something.

239
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,672
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe even incorporate some DDR.

240
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

241
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be a cool Space Channel 5.

242
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:16,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, when they said that they were about to do a tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one that yelled out Space Channel 5?

243
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We all knew it would be Sonic.

244
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles.

245
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:42,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what, though.

246
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:49,329
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did, I had a fun time with this part was when he came out with the guitar before the Chrono Trigger bit.

247
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so what do you, so, you know, we're going to hear both of this.

248
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:55,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, play some Skinner, man.

249
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Freebird.

250
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling Freebird.

251
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,656
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I'm not going to play Freebird.

252
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the song was over, he says, okay, now I'm going to play Freebird.

253
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:11,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there was somebody in our section that called for Sweet Emotion.

254
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,485
[SPEAKER_01]: No, called for Dream On.

255
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:13,926
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.

256
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:14,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

257
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,147
[SPEAKER_05]: See, somebody else knew, I guess.

258
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:20,029
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolsonChat right now says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger song up on YouTube.

259
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:20,950
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good arrangement.

260
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it really hit YouTube already?

261
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, he said, get that on YouTube tonight.

262
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:26,493
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

263
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's what I thought was great.

264
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameras were encouraged.

265
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:34,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Video taping was encouraged.

266
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,367
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

267
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,948
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stick up the ass.

268
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:41,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Because keep in mind, every concert is different.

269
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, okay, here we go.

270
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is from last night.

271
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from user GBPMike has put up some of the arrangement.

272
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is from last night.

273
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back.

274
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:06,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt really bad for the flute player She missed a note big time

275
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:27,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note.

276
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I think even Martin Lern missed a note at one point.

277
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard the piano.

278
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:31,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was him on piano.

279
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a bad piano note at one point.

280
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:34,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, don't.

281
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:35,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, mistakes happen.

282
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be like that critical.

283
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,413
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just that's, you know, it didn't ruin the night.

284
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

285
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,173
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it didn't.

286
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,054
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I am.

287
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It ruined the night completely.

288
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare they miss a note?

289
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I come for a perfect performance.

290
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different when you're the soloist.

291
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

292
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:19,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, considering no doubt tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now, it's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days.

293
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

294
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:24,002
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have the money, if you have the time, check it out when it goes to your town.

295
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:32,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that, or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it, but I would definitely make it a point to see it when it comes to my town again.

296
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I might actually, you know.

297
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:35,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's going to be at E3.

298
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see different shows.

299
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: They just announced, if you go to their site, they just announced like 45 new tour dates or something like that.

300
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:48,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are going to be playing a show in LA on June 4th during E3.

301
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's, you know, they love to do that.

302
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions and things of that sort.

303
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,508
[SPEAKER_01]: WonderCon was this one.

304
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

305
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:00,965
[SPEAKER_05]: and Actdeft asked, did they play the Metal Gear Solid song?

306
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:01,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they did.

307
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:05,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even had David Hayter doing intros for each part.

308
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box and he was hiding in the box that said orange on it.

309
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:13,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of tour dates announced for Canada.

310
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,439
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Canada, you're very happy right now.

311
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:19,462
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to Saskatchewan on May 11th, Alberta, Calgary 15th, 16th, Edmonton 18th,

312
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:48,605
[SPEAKER_05]: British Columbia the 20th and 21st all those dates in May so like they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May and like even Winnipeg in July as well Singapore they're gonna be in Singapore Romania France in November later on this year they'll be in Portland Oregon for a couple of shows in November San Diego July 23rd New York Lewiston July 31st so they're gonna be all over later this year

313
00:17:49,446 --> 00:18:17,624
[SPEAKER_05]: so, alright, so that was our experience of video games live, otherwise, as far as my gaming week goes, personally, I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week that was new, didn't play a lot of new stuff still the old standby favorites but I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4, I have to remember how awesome the music is this week, I was like, oh god I need to play this again, especially the video and everything, it just, it makes you all warm and tingly like a video game fan so, DarkSakura, any anything else in your gaming week besides video game live?

314
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:42,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, right before the show, when I was getting my slab of beef with two crackers on either side I was playing Raiden 2 and Marvel vs. Capcom And oh my god, I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair Oh god I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2, that was pretty fun

315
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, speaking of arcade machines, this is going to seem completely random, but I saw a news story on this this week.

316
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games that they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch?

317
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:56,984
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to try to sell all these games.

318
00:18:57,524 --> 00:19:00,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The dude had a Hip Hop Mania machine.

319
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:01,705
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a Sega 360.

320
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:03,351
[SPEAKER_05]: He had one of those too.

321
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a lot of different types of machines, but he actually had a Hip Hop Mania cabinet.

322
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want it.

323
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:11,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the starting price I think was only like $400 to $600.

324
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about putting a bid on it just for fun.

325
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:13,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

326
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:20,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, wouldn't that be awesome to have a freaking Hip Hop Mania cabinet in here that was like once owned by Michael Jackson?

327
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,499
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of funny.

328
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that is not auctioning off his Moonwalker.

329
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but I think that's one of those random awesome things.

330
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, he had a Jumbo Safari machine.

331
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:30,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, keep in mind.

332
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

333
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was his biggest video game buddy?

334
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:35,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Sega.

335
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:36,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

336
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

337
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,303
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in Space Channel 5 Part 2.

338
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:41,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, Loki.

339
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:43,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I said video game buddy.

340
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:45,786
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

341
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: He played video games with him.

342
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company.

343
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:50,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We said buddy.

344
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:51,929
[SPEAKER_04]: You did not specify.

345
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,110
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, I wonder, did Michael Jackson even play those games?

346
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

347
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe a couple of them.

348
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, who knows?

349
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:04,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt he played them all, but it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch.

350
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:05,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

351
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:05,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

352
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that?

353
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:09,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines.

354
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:13,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't spend a lot of money, but, you know, I'll try to get something.

355
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:14,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

356
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:20,011
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S in our chatroom says, if you win that arcade machine, you better check it with a black light.

357
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a hip-hop media machine local.

358
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

359
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,337
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a beat media machine or something.

360
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:30,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent Jamie the link to it on Twitter like a while ago.

361
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That poor...

362
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was about the same price.

363
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:34,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

364
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Not from Golfland, though.

365
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought for sure Roseville, you know, Hip Hop Mania, it's gotta be from Golfland, but no.

366
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:47,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, though, if other Bomani fans out there try to outbid me on the Hip Hop Mania machine from Neverland Ranch, I will cut you.

367
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:53,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Jamie, anything else with your... I can't say names right tonight.

368
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else with your gaming week?

369
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

370
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:03,900
[SPEAKER_01]: No, City of Heroes, which my thing expired now, so I don't know if I'm going to play.

371
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:10,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And the really stupid Flash game that I can't remember.

372
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:14,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I played with my virtual pet on Facebook today.

373
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:17,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard.

374
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:18,368
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

375
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:21,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you said, I said, is there anything else in your gaming week?

376
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,231
[SPEAKER_05]: You said no, but City of Heroes and Facebook games.

377
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:27,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Rob.

378
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:28,293
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

379
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:32,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

380
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't play anything.

381
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:39,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.

382
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:41,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little feisty tonight, Loki.

383
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:42,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

384
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:44,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm getting over a cold, actually.

385
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:44,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Again.

386
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cold the sequel.

387
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I first got sick, and then I got better, and then I got the flu, and then I got better.

388
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I'm coughing again.

389
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of cheesy, but I kind of like it.

391
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got achievements like crazy.

392
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,477
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most redundant, stupid things ever.

393
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:30,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you start the game and you get an achievement immediately.

394
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

395
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,741
[SPEAKER_04]: You pause the game and you get an achievement.

396
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

397
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:42,305
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the whole game is just very...

398
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,025
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:11,053
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

401
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

402
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: One game at a time, right?

403
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be getting a new car soon.

404
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:34,763
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping.

405
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It kept me away from video games for a little while.

406
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:43,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car and have to factor in a car payment into my budget now, I'm probably going to have to really cut back on the amount of new video games I buy.

407
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:48,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can definitely feel the pain of, you know, I don't have to get Killzone 2 just because it's new.

408
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,028
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and seriously, that is the thing too.

409
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of almost feel like peer pressure based on all the advertisements and all the hype and stuff.

410
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I look at it, it's like...

411
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just another shooter game.

412
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I really need to play this?

413
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:03,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, I don't.

414
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:04,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same with Star Ocean.

415
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:05,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to buy that.

416
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:07,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, do I need to really play this right now?

417
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:08,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

418
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:14,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more I keep evaluating stuff like that, the less I'm buying, which is fine.

419
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:24,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny, and I wanted to play it, and I didn't really give a crap about the production value or anything of the game.

420
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:24,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Because

421
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not an excellent game, but it's fun.

422
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I decided to play that one.

423
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, I'm waiting for Mad World to come out because it's a lot of blood and killing, which is going to be so awesome.

424
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in chat jokes, Sky, you're getting a Yaris?

425
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:43,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm considering it.

426
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not high up on my list anymore, though.

427
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:48,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It was before, but right now I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta.

428
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, if you get a Yaris, the terrorists win.

429
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:56,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And by terrorists, I mean people that made the Yars game.

430
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:57,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shut up.

431
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:01,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else, Loki, in your gaming week?

432
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:11,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually also looking at hacking Lost and Damned, but I haven't gotten around to actually doing it yet, but I've...

433
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'll see you next time.

434
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:33,839
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, maybe you do, and that's why we put it out as a podcast.

435
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:38,862
[SPEAKER_05]: But check it out, chat.orange.com live on Sunday nights when we tape at allgames.com.

436
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to show us your tweets segment.

437
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys sometimes respond to our Twitter requests at username OLR on Twitter.

438
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:55,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And just before the show, I asked, hey, Twitter, when and if Video Games Live comes to your town, what do you hope they'll play?

439
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:56,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

440
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:09,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro.

441
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:34,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, when they came to Mexicali, I hoped they would play a Kirby song.

442
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, they didn't, but Kirby plus orchestra equals awesome.

443
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Crows says they're coming to Houston late 2009.

444
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:53,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear a crapload of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main theme of Fallout 3.

445
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:57,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion.

446
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion would be an awesome one to hear.

447
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:02,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Pigruuno says the Let's Tap theme tune.

448
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:06,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And Harry AKA says some of the beautiful music from Braid.

449
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a bad suggestion either.

450
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack that might be pretty awesome to hear live.

451
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And since they're always adding new stuff, kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh, who knows what's going to come to that in the future.

452
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:23,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Show us your tweets by following us on Twitter, username OLR.

453
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

454
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:32,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to mention something that I was going to play this week, but I didn't get a chance to, and I really, really sad.

455
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:36,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I also play more Nomi Nobi Boy, and I still don't get any, you know...

456
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:38,057
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

457
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,570
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

458
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:10,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

459
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:33,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so they have all of them, including the levels where you're inside the bases and stuff.

460
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in that same perspective and everything.

461
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty awesome.

462
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely go check those out.

463
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning on downloading them all and playing them.

464
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's it.

465
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:48,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully, I'm hoping that this whole hacking Lost and Damned thing works.

466
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: To have some more funny videos coming out.

467
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:56,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, if you break open the Lost and Damned...

468
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:58,568
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

469
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:20,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

470
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:47,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I never say never.

471
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that we thought would never happen have happened.

472
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:57,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo GameCube and see a Sega logo, right?

473
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:01,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC crossover.

474
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, that was old.

475
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,000
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

476
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, other housekeeping this week.

477
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a whole lot of housekeeping this week.

478
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I did housekeeping.

479
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:11,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

480
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:14,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, continue to support us on the web.

481
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:18,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you've not visited the new orangelaunchradio.com, you need to check it out.

482
00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:22,284
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures she took from Video Games Live, actually.

483
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:25,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I uploaded the one to the main page there of the marquee.

484
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:28,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go into the OL Army pics on the gallery page,

485
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,227
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:55,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one are really good.

487
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:56,318
[SPEAKER_05]: You should send those in.

488
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:56,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet they'd use those.

489
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:57,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I took them with my iPhone.

490
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

491
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,342
[SPEAKER_05]: For iPhone pictures, it's not bad.

492
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:04,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And then somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says, Rob is officially gayer than Christmas.

493
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:06,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob versus Christmas.

494
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,548
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll just have to check it out.

495
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:09,390
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me if it was me, and I said no.

496
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,073
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I bet anything it was Travis and John last night on Understation Live.

497
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:14,374
[SPEAKER_05]: This just seems like something they'd do.

498
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:19,018
[SPEAKER_05]: This reeks of John and Travis somehow.

499
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,441
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we fuck with the new OrangeLoungeRadio.com?

500
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:25,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, let's make a Robbis Gay joke.

501
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,083
[SPEAKER_04]: See, isn't it fun being friends with them?

502
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:29,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

503
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Those little bastards.

504
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love them.

505
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:34,746
[SPEAKER_05]: In a totally homosexual way.

506
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to some gaming news, Loki.

507
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may remember last week Capcom was teasing something that they were going to announce on Monday.

508
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:46,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that announcement was Lost Planet 2.

509
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:53,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lost Planet 2 looks very epic, very cold still, yet strangely enough is like in a jungle.

510
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a frozen jungle.

511
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have a bunch of other cool stuff.

512
00:32:58,572 --> 00:32:59,592
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty sweet.

513
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:00,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now...

514
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,091
[SPEAKER_04]: 4Player Online Co-op

515
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:43,006
[SPEAKER_04]: which is pretty neat and I don't know I think the game looks really cool different environments they even have like some sort of mech thing because you before you can get like the mech suits well now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit that's like uh Voltron-esque so that looked kind of neat but uh very exciting but uh no word on when this is planning on um

516
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:44,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising 2 Lost Planet 2

517
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:09,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's not too big of a surprise.

518
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to chat, by the way, Travis says it was not us that did the Rob is Gayer Than Christmas picture, so that'll just forever remain a mystery.

519
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's also saying Under Station Live... What if it was Fart Princess?

520
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:22,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been.

521
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:24,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end.

522
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,185
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm just like, huh?

523
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want more information on what this is all about.

524
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to call you later, Travis.

525
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,850
[SPEAKER_05]: You better call in later, Travis.

526
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I want details.

527
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:35,851
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is going on?

528
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:38,433
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, back to video games for now.

529
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:40,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin's Creed on the PSP.

530
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:47,020
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp this week about the PSP at one of their destination PlayStation events.

531
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin's Creed is going to be coming to the PSP.

532
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft will be putting it out on the Sony portable system a little later this year.

533
00:34:55,346 --> 00:35:01,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently there's also going to be an Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well with a PSP with it.

534
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

535
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin's Creed coming out a little later this year for you fans of that game and also for fans of having games on the PSP.

536
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

537
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:22,480
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news, speaking of PSP stuff, you know there's actually something about LittleBigPlanet.

538
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be on PSP, because I said so, and because apparently Sony says so too.

539
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:40,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be sometime before the end of the year, but it is in conjunction with Media Molecule, and it's supposed to be very much like the PS3 version, where you can...

540
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:47,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your levels and share them and play the game and play everybody else's crap but just take it with you.

541
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,831
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I think?

542
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:50,431
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

543
00:35:51,751 --> 00:36:05,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's going to be you would download everything through the PlayStation like you do through the PS3 like you do now with whatever link to the PSP.

544
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:09,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is one of the biggest does to come out of the PlayStation event.

545
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:12,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, LittleBigPlanet's been a huge new IP for them.

546
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know how well it's been selling here in the U.S., but I think it's been doing much better overseas.

547
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:21,499
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think this is no surprise at all that they're putting a port of this on the PSP.

548
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,039
[SPEAKER_05]: We had rumors about this a few months ago.

549
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: No surprise here.

550
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I am surprised, though, that Media Molecule's not doing it themselves.

551
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:28,781
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of...

552
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:35,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised because they're busy doing expansions and stuff for the main game.

553
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have someone else port it.

554
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:38,387
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

555
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,229
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it turns out alright.

556
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:48,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say also that I think it's pretty cool that they're actually taking the PSP seriously this year.

557
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:50,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting out some pretty strong games because I remember...

558
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:52,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think it's kind of cool.

559
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP, another PS3 franchise there, Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is of course going to be more...

560
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:17,032
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

561
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will also be ported to the PlayStation 2 as well.

562
00:37:52,878 --> 00:37:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP games to the PS2 and vice versa.

563
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:57,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

564
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,601
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still cranking out PS2 games.

565
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:00,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Still.

566
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Still selling well, so why not?

567
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:05,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the price is right.

568
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:09,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2.

569
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:11,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well.

570
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:12,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some more sales that way.

571
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, if none of those games sounded interesting to you at all, maybe this is a little more up your alley.

572
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:22,197
[SPEAKER_05]: A new Hannah Montana PSP bundle.

573
00:38:22,697 --> 00:38:23,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, joy!

574
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:23,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

575
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,600
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming out in July.

576
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a PSP in a brand new color called Lilac.

577
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:29,985
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

578
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:52,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But also it's coming out with a UMD of episodes from Hannah Montana.

579
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Also a two gigabyte memory stick coming with it.

580
00:38:55,373 --> 00:39:01,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, stickers to decorate your PSP with Hannah Montana.

581
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

582
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:27,654
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently some also casual other things coming to the PSP Ubisoft has his Pets series coming to the PSP Pets Saddle Club being one of the first releases in September obviously this is happening to compete with the DS a little bit you know because they have the whole Carrie Underwood playing a pink DS commercial so you know Sony has now tapped into Hannah Montana which is you know what

583
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:32,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Lover or hater, it's a huge brand for tween girls.

584
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess this is the way to go, right?

585
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:36,738
[SPEAKER_05]: To try and sell some of these at Christmas time?

586
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,499
[SPEAKER_04]: That they've tapped Hannah Montana?

587
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that illegal?

588
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,261
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean, you ass.

589
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,882
[SPEAKER_06]: La la la la la la.

590
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:45,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

591
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know though.

592
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want a baby shit purple PSP because I don't think anybody else would have one.

593
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:09,225
[SPEAKER_05]: it is an interesting color but I want one of the blue ones more I think I'll get the Madden pack that came with the blue PSP even though I have a perfectly fine and functioning PSP right now I kind of want the lilac one but not bad enough to go for Hannah Montana I'm also just kind of like

594
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:13,605
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the PSP2 announcement's coming, probably at E3.

595
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:20,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can at least make myself wait until E3 to upgrade my PSP, then I'll have motivation to just wait even longer until PSP2 comes out.

596
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:22,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there is going to be PSP2 at E3.

597
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there'll be something.

598
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:29,973
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be another revision, but from what I heard, it was supposed to be even slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's about it.

599
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:30,894
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

600
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:32,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll just be the same thing.

601
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, who cares?

602
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:34,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to help.

603
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:40,519
[SPEAKER_05]: GeoVidea in chat says, Tap, Ass, and Hannah Montana should not be said in the same sentence.

604
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize to any listener that was offended.

605
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,082
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

606
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:46,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough Hannah Montana.

607
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, DarkSakura, help us change the subject.

608
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:49,584
[SPEAKER_01]: How about release dates?

609
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,605
[SPEAKER_05]: How about release dates?

610
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:58,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got quite a bit for the UK, and I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday since it will already be after that by the time they get this.

611
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So on March 4th, we have Empire Total War.

612
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,680
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for PC.

613
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:06,942
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 6th, Battle Fantasia.

614
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also New Play, Control, Mario Power Tennis, Patapon 2, Tenchu, Shadow Assassins, Tom Clancy's Hawks, Watchmen, The End is Nigh.

615
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:21,629
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

616
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And Flock for Xbox 360.

617
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:28,212
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation 3 version says it's out on the 9th.

618
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:29,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are the...

619
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Live Arcade Games.

620
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:33,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

621
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Or PlayStation Network games.

622
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:36,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

623
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,630
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

624
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

625
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the US, there's actually quite a bit coming out this week.

626
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff, including, of course, the big title, Halo Wars, coming out on Xbox 360.

627
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:58,256
[SPEAKER_04]: On PSP, we're getting Phantasy Star Portable, which is the remake of the Ambition of the Illuminous expansion.

628
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:04,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also got MLB, both 09 and 2K9.

629
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:21,946
[SPEAKER_04]: 09, of course, coming out on all Sony platforms, and then 2K9 coming out on pretty much everything but the DS, because the DS version is getting MLB 2K9 Fantasy All-Stars, which is a weird-looking game, but whatever.

630
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Empire Total War coming out on PC.

631
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:37,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Also that week, we've got SBK Superbike World Championship coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii and PlayStation 2, I believe.

632
00:42:41,312 --> 00:42:47,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Tom Clancy's Hawks on Xbox 360 and on PS3.

633
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:54,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Ski and Snowboard on the Nintendo Wii, kind of a sequel to that Wii Ski game that came out last year.

634
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:59,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, coming out as well...

635
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:05,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Littlest Pet Shop Spring because there's just not enough of those games.

636
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:09,639
[SPEAKER_04]: King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match coming out on PlayStation 2.

637
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,461
[SPEAKER_04]: A little retro fighting action there.

638
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:19,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Spongebob vs. the Big One Beach Party Cook-Off, your Spongebob-themed Cookie Mama game.

639
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:21,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

640
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic and the Black Knight on the Wii.

641
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:27,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally...

642
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to do well.

643
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you right now.

644
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,841
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

645
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:12,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil, not your mom.

646
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:49,399
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 also getting Biohazard 5 which seems to be dominating the week over there this week but don't count out MLB09 the show and Senju no Valkyria is getting a price reduction as well which is just you know Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US um

647
00:44:50,965 --> 00:45:03,171
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo Wii on March 5th, only one big release is Relaxuma Mina de Goryuri Sekatsu is coming out, which looks like a game with cute little animals.

648
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:09,675
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no screenshots, just cute little finger-painted... Wouldn't that be awesome if that was a survivor horror game?

649
00:45:12,341 --> 00:45:13,562
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

650
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Kimo Koei and Simple DS Volume 47.

651
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:45,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Because every week it seems like over there there's another Simple DS game coming out.

652
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:56,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly on the PSP, it looks like they're getting the 3000 in blue this week in Japan and red.

653
00:45:58,198 --> 00:46:00,959
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of matching gear coming out to match that.

654
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:05,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, Mineno Golf Portable, which is just Hot Shots Golf, is getting a price reduction.

655
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

656
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week since you have Resident Evil 5.

657
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see their new colors that they have for the DSi?

658
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:15,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the black and the crappy blue.

659
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,688
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they have the new colors for Japan.

660
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:20,548
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not seen it.

661
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: They have this weird, not even maroon, it's like a...

662
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:30,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, pinkish-purple, magenta-colored system.

663
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,083
[SPEAKER_04]: They got this weird lime-green and then a dark blue.

664
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:37,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably better than the colors here.

665
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That light blue is terrible.

666
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want a DSi in that color.

667
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:42,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't really want a DSi anyway.

668
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:45,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sold on it yet.

669
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:46,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Me neither.

670
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:48,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe when some of the DSi games start coming out.

671
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm in bed sick or something.

672
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:53,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not a big handheld fan.

673
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

674
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Snowboard Riot

675
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:47,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.

676
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it for 800 points there.

677
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:18,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it!

678
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:22,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wanting to play it for myself and find that out, Loki.

679
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerk.

680
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:28,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball for cheaper.

681
00:48:28,717 --> 00:48:29,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get drunk.

682
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:31,978
[SPEAKER_05]: But only if you're 21 or over, please.

683
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:44,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I don't know if you noticed, this week actually was the first week that they started offering, I guess over here, I thought they were available over here already, but Commodore 64 games on the virtual console.

684
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:46,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we mentioned it last week's show?

685
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:46,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

686
00:48:46,886 --> 00:48:47,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we didn't.

687
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember getting into a conversation about it.

688
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:50,528
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I guess not.

689
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,431
[SPEAKER_05]: If they just came out on Monday, I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet.

690
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:56,972
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, no, I saw that they were there.

691
00:48:57,092 --> 00:49:01,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't downloaded any yet, because I'm still on my stupid little I'm not downloading anything else kick.

692
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:05,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, seriously, I mean, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?

693
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:05,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

694
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:07,754
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, here's the thing.

695
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:10,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is one thing that will break it.

696
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: When Impossible Mission comes out, I have to get it.

697
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to.

698
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:16,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64.

699
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:18,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that'll be the thing that gets me to break.

700
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:19,657
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta stand strong.

701
00:49:19,677 --> 00:49:21,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But that didn't come out yet, so we'll see.

702
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:38,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I never agreed to do it well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2 I probably won't even remember to download it and if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday I won't ever hear it's out but now that I said that I'll get a million emails from listeners saying hey Rob did you break your thing yet?

703
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Impossible Mission came out today jerk

704
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:45,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, though, when are they going to... They're probably going to make this big announcement at E3.

705
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:48,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yes, we're going to have a storage solution.

706
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:50,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we totally never announced this before.

707
00:49:50,498 --> 00:49:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you're going to have to buy this new system to get it.

708
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're going to have to buy... Yeah.

709
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:55,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

710
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate them.

711
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate them all.

712
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Nintendo.

713
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:02,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have Choaniki.

714
00:50:04,242 --> 00:50:04,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

715
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:07,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, not even Choaniki broke my ban.

716
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: ExciteBots Trick Racing is coming out on the Nintendo Wii April 20th.

717
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:42,890
[SPEAKER_04]: and um no one seems to know what it is it's so crazy what exactly is excite truck or excite uh bots you know it is being made by uh the people that did excite truck and the excite bike fan or franchises i've never heard this game this is completely no this is i've never this is a shock

718
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:44,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely new news to me.

719
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete utter shock to me.

720
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, really, I have heard about this.

721
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:52,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's funny that no one seems to know what the game is about.

722
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably better that they don't.

723
00:50:56,562 --> 00:51:02,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as, like, the bots, like, battle each other or something.

724
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:07,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's a racing, like, robot thing where they actually, like, a mech thing.

725
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:08,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be that stupid, would it?

726
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:12,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

727
00:51:35,237 --> 00:51:36,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be crazy.

728
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have a weird synopsis for it or something.

729
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to think of what exactly we would say.

730
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

731
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:48,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Make something up.

732
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:53,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to make up what a possible synopsis for ExciteBots might read.

733
00:51:54,451 --> 00:51:55,272
[SPEAKER_04]: ExciteBots.

734
00:51:56,232 --> 00:51:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think here.

735
00:51:59,435 --> 00:51:59,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

736
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:03,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, let's see.

737
00:52:03,806 --> 00:52:20,850
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were to guess an Excitebots trick racing synopsis, I would say that Excitebots trick racing takes the big air thrills and simple controls of Excite Truck and ramps up the fun with a non-stop barrage of funky challenges and minigames performed at a blinding speed.

738
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:30,892
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself shooting goals, throwing pies, even playing poker in the middle of racing robotic animals, insects, around off-road tracks.

739
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Goddamn, Loki, you are one hell of an improv artist.

740
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:35,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's so crazy.

741
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

742
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: How poetic in your description.

743
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:38,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

744
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:42,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also might say that it will support two to six players over Wi-Fi.

745
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:44,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't you be that eloquent normally?

746
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have it in me.

747
00:52:50,282 --> 00:53:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: you just got excited you're just too full of cheese sadly enough I do want to play this game but I'm really I'm scared that they fucked this up and you know it's like I've been waiting so long for an Excite Truck sequel and I know they fucked this up it's like you can't fuck this up you just do the same thing put out the same damn game just change the tracks add different cars you don't have to do anything it's sold okay but I know they fucked this up and it's really scaring me

748
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:25,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm loading up this to read this comment in chat.

749
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,523
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link says, Excitebox, it will make you shit your pants.

750
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:36,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week, that Flash game, Don't Shit Your Pants.

751
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite new little sound I've heard in a Flash game.

752
00:53:47,034 --> 00:53:49,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about.

753
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:50,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

754
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:55,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, uh, comments from chat, I'm sorry, no more comments from chat.

755
00:53:55,976 --> 00:53:57,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, no, okay, some comments from chat.

756
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,479
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, why can't they do a sequel to Excite Bike?

757
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Bike, not Excite Truck, but Excite Bike.

758
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:04,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they could do that!

759
00:54:05,164 --> 00:54:07,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite Truck with Excite Bikes in there!

760
00:54:07,586 --> 00:54:10,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, look at that, it's expanding on the franchise!

761
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:12,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it like MotorStorm, I mean, come on!

762
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:14,672
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 suggests Excite Pants.

763
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:33,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix the magic of Excite Truck with the suspense of Don't Shit Your Pants the game and you have Excite Pants.

764
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:35,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

765
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:36,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a toilet at one end of the course.

766
00:54:36,951 --> 00:54:38,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to play this game.

767
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to try it out.

768
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:50,135
[SPEAKER_04]: The description so far and the fact that I haven't seen any screenshots or know anything about it, it kind of scares me right now.

769
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't understand how playing poker and driving really fast...

770
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:56,016
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

771
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:21,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It was recently trademarked here in America, Final Fantasy IV The After Years, and that's a cell phone series over in Japan.

772
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:22,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

773
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:27,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been announced this week that it's going to be coming out for the Wii.

774
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:32,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess it hasn't really been announced, but the ESRB has rated the title an E on the Wii.

775
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:37,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 4 The After Years Final Fantasy 4 The After Years

776
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:52,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, because it was a cell phone game.

777
00:55:53,023 --> 00:55:56,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of curious to see if they still keep it looking like that on the Wii.

778
00:55:56,827 --> 00:55:58,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a download thing.

779
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be WiiWare.

780
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not necessarily be a disc.

781
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be something that's going to be released WiiWare.

782
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:04,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was supposed to be.

783
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be kind of cool then, because it could be in the style of Mega Man 9.

784
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

785
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:09,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool.

786
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:10,502
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of sense.

787
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:17,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could also be something that makes me want to break my little band.

788
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:20,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, I am so pissed off at Nintendo.

789
00:56:20,721 --> 00:56:22,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

790
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:25,685
[SPEAKER_04]: If they fuck this up, I'm out for blood.

791
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:28,388
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard it here first.

792
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:30,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so there you go.

793
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:31,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

794
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to definitely check that out.

795
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:47,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a device that we've discussed on the show a number of times, and I have one myself in the family of it, which I will not name nor say or let anyone know where I'm hiding it, because I actually just found it while I was cleaning.

796
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't find my DS... Thingy.

797
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't find my DS, too, and the thingy that's in the DS.

798
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:55,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I found my thingy.

799
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the thingy in the box.

800
00:56:58,488 --> 00:56:58,808
[SPEAKER_04]: What thingy?

801
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:00,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have a Ninja Pass.

802
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:03,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not used it.

803
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:04,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing on it.

804
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:05,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one.

805
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:10,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an R4 DS and an M3 and I put tons of pirated games on both of them.

806
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be honest, I haven't played my DS in forever.

807
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So much so that it's buried in a room somewhere.

808
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:18,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to my story.

809
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny that you mentioned the R4.

810
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I bought it too because it, you know.

811
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:30,546
[SPEAKER_01]: The R4 is now officially outlawed in Japan.

812
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:47,410
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually an injunction filed against the Chinese manufacturer put out by the Tokyo District Court, and it's now illegal to sell anywhere in Japan.

813
00:57:49,573 --> 00:57:53,556
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you can't find them in stores anymore at all.

814
00:57:54,256 --> 00:58:13,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Squeenix, Capcom, Nintendo, the big guys, they're saying that because of the illegal sales, they're going to also make sure that they're going to try to knock down anyone who's selling the other types that are like the R4.

815
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,111
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows?

816
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,512
[SPEAKER_01]: The other countries might be following suit.

817
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:23,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

818
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard about a lot of devices getting banned over there.

819
00:58:26,497 --> 00:58:32,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is... And now Loki, you're breaking the law of another country.

820
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob?

821
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:36,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

822
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:40,093
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that cup on the floor?

823
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:40,513
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

824
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:41,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

825
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:42,594
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd get caned for that in Singapore.

826
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gee.

827
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:44,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

828
00:58:45,136 --> 00:58:46,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're breaking the law of another country.

829
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:47,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

830
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, you know, I don't even play my DS right now.

831
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Or my PSP.

832
00:58:55,883 --> 00:59:01,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of curiosity, is there anyone in chat who owns one of these who thinks this is, you know, interesting, surprising?

833
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:04,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you scared because now you have one?

834
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:05,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you just, like, whatever?

835
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

836
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:08,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally not surprised, to be honest.

837
00:59:08,955 --> 00:59:09,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

838
00:59:09,835 --> 00:59:15,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not totally surprising, but... Oh, well.

839
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:23,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, with the DS, they can't really flash it to not work with or to basically break it or anything.

840
00:59:23,946 --> 00:59:26,808
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't do any firmware updates like they can with the PSP.

841
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:28,769
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it means they'll stop selling it?

842
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you'll still be able to get them over here?

843
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:34,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get.

844
00:59:35,679 --> 01:00:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: um in fact when I was buying mine um they were pretty hard to get and you know they were starting to pull them off you know shelves online and stuff like that so that you know they wouldn't get in any lawsuit trouble but uh luckily I got both of mine actually the M3 and R4 are almost identical in fact I think there's like one little point that you change on each chip that you can convert them back and forth and um

845
01:00:05,066 --> 01:00:06,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, they work okay.

846
01:00:06,928 --> 01:00:16,535
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I bought the M3 for, for Game Boy Advance, Homebrew stuff, because there was this one motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other Zelda-type game I wanted to try out that was kind of cool.

847
01:00:17,476 --> 01:00:24,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really played any ROMs for the Game Boy Advance, so I'm just not really interested in that.

848
01:00:24,882 --> 01:00:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out every now and then, but really nothing holds my interest for...

849
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:36,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardly any time, so I just don't see the point in spending $20 on each of these games.

850
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:43,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on a cheap game, unless you get something Square Enix, which is like $40 for a fucking DS game, which is retarded.

851
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't see myself spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only going to play for a few hours and just kind of throw to the side.

852
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:53,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just my own thing.

853
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:55,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Economy's tough, you know what?

854
01:00:55,375 --> 01:01:02,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wasn't going to buy your game anyway, so... But hey, I spend my money... I spend plenty of money on other things, you know?

855
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:11,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, you know, what, the last week or so, or a couple weeks ago, I... Five copies of Lost and Damned, so... You know, I'm paying my money.

856
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:14,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

857
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:15,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to wrap up Part A, get to Part B tonight.

858
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

859
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:20,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of a game that I like...

860
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

861
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:42,349
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds like an okay idea to me, but not that great.

862
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

863
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:59,703
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some actual characters in Saints Row, so it works, but then again, the whole game is very sandbox-ish, and you can make your own main characters, so designing who the main character is going to be is a little bit tough, I think, but as far as an actual storyline that goes, it's kind of compelling.

864
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:01,304
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one, but...

865
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:11,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think that type, anything that's sandbox-ish, as far as gameplay goes, it's going to be very hard to make a movie out of.

866
01:02:12,486 --> 01:02:27,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, he's interested in it, and he says according to 50 Cent, he said that his relationship with THQ is very good, and you'll see Saints Row, I'm optioning the rights for that right now.

867
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:31,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as Blood on the Sand.

868
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:36,651
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Blood on the Sand, I think, to be honest, is just fun.

869
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:37,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole point.

870
01:02:37,912 --> 01:02:39,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like he was trying to be serious.

871
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:40,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just fun.

872
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:47,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of plot and movies and something that didn't make our show roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before the show about this.

873
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:52,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard about how horrifically the new Street Fighter movie is doing?

874
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:55,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

875
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:56,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I would believe it.

876
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looks like crap.

877
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

878
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,505
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my LiveJournal friends went and saw it and said it is worse than the original Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine.

879
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:05,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

880
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:08,107
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually a ringing endorsement to me.

881
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:08,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I love bad movies.

882
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:10,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I kind of want to go see it.

883
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:11,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's out?

884
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it just came out on Friday.

885
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely forgot about it.

886
01:03:15,432 --> 01:03:18,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how terrible it did at the box office, because box office numbers come out.

887
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:20,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go look.

888
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:28,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much Street Fighter, the movie this week, and Jonas Brothers in 3D.

889
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Medea Goes to Jail was the number one movie this week with 16.5 million bucks.

890
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:35,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Medea Goes to Jail, okay.

891
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:42,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonas Brothers, 12.7 million, which they say was actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus movie a few months ago.

892
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:46,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Slumdog Millionaire, 12.1 million, but it just won the Oscar.

893
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:48,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was not in the top three.

894
01:03:49,713 --> 01:04:00,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Nor was it 4, 5, or 6, or 7 Street Fighter came out its opening weekend number 8 When did it beat?

895
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,278
[SPEAKER_05]: 4.6 million dollars What did it beat?

896
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:13,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Confessions of a Shopaholic in its third week of release Friday the 13th in its third week of release Fired Up in its second week of release But what beat it?

897
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:21,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul Blart, Mall Cop, and its seventh week of release made more money than Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, and its seventh week of release.

898
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:26,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie, so we don't need to make fun of that.

899
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:32,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Street Fighter movie that has like...

900
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

901
01:04:56,576 --> 01:05:08,004
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, hey, speaking of game movies, a good game movie, I think, anyway, a lot of people disagree with me, but one of the better ones in many, many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill was a video game movie that came out.

902
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:08,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

903
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:09,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We all generally liked it.

904
01:05:09,946 --> 01:05:11,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it four times in the theater.

905
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You really liked it.

906
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:12,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it twice.

907
01:05:12,988 --> 01:05:13,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki liked it, yeah.

908
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:17,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we can all agree that the Silent Hill movie is pretty awesome.

909
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:20,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, we love the series of games.

910
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:21,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the series of games.

911
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:22,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

912
01:05:22,194 --> 01:05:24,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not so much the last few, but yeah.

913
01:05:24,736 --> 01:05:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't think they were terrible.

914
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:30,121
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, obviously one of the best ones was the first one.

915
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:30,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?

916
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're talking about remaking games for the Wii, a Wii make, if you will, there's been lots of these types of Wii makes coming out recently.

917
01:05:38,288 --> 01:05:41,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, most of them, granted, have just been old GameCube games getting new controls.

918
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:47,116
[SPEAKER_05]: But what if they were to remake the original PlayStation Silent Hill game on the Nintendo Wii?

919
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:48,578
[SPEAKER_01]: With extra fog?

920
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:49,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

921
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,880
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why they did the fog?

922
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:51,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

923
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Because loading or something?

924
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:59,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, this is coming from a report from VG247.

925
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:05,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Konami is planning a port of the Silent Hill game for the Wii.

926
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:09,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming to the PSP as well, Climax.

927
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:13,417
[SPEAKER_05]: The folks who did Silent Hill Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new remake.

928
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:14,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could be interesting.

929
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm surprised that Climax hasn't exactly optioned N-Space's engine that they use for the game that's not ever coming out, unfortunately, Winter.

930
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, that game looked very much Silent Hill.

931
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if they're using it, though.

932
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:30,223
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta wonder.

933
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:39,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's part of why they're doing this on the Wii, is maybe the folks at Konami saw this and was like, hey, we want you to make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really good idea.

934
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:42,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you redo the first story or something like that, you know?

935
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

936
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:43,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be.

937
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake.

938
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:04,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

939
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a remake like a new Play Control remake.

940
01:07:08,026 --> 01:07:08,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yoink, yoink, yoink.

941
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, right?

942
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:13,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero, which is an awesome remake.

943
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:20,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to interrupt real quick, but I'm so glad that the monitor obstructed the camera's view of the gesture that you just made.

944
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:21,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

945
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:21,976
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd I do?

946
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:23,677
[SPEAKER_01]: The yank, yank, yank.

947
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:24,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

948
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:26,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have the big monitor here.

949
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:28,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It sensors my hand when I do things like that.

950
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:28,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one can see Rob fapping.

951
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:31,643
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

952
01:07:32,484 --> 01:07:32,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Look.

953
01:07:34,557 --> 01:07:35,657
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I have to derail it.

954
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:36,698
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

955
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:37,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill.

956
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:38,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

957
01:07:38,398 --> 01:07:38,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it.

958
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:41,419
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what other stuff we want?

959
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Punch Out!

960
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,301
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just want a punch.

961
01:07:45,681 --> 01:07:47,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so getting this.

962
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:51,663
[SPEAKER_01]: May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii.

963
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:54,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And little Mac looks like he all done grown up.

964
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,845
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually looks kind of mean in this picture.

965
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:06,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we will be getting some, um, punch-out, and hopefully that we will get, like, King Hippo and, you know, Glass Joe and all of those.

966
01:08:06,632 --> 01:08:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they make new characters, though.

967
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:09,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... I'm sure we're gonna get new characters.

968
01:08:10,015 --> 01:08:12,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they'll have to be some new characters.

969
01:08:12,057 --> 01:08:15,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I will bet you, I will bet you there are not new characters in this.

970
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you it's just the remake of the first game.

971
01:08:18,982 --> 01:08:19,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

972
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:20,343
[SPEAKER_04]: You think they'd be that bold?

973
01:08:21,044 --> 01:08:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they'd be that lazy.

974
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:24,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do think they'd be that lazy.

975
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:26,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not.

976
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:28,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

977
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:30,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no optimism in Nintendo anymore.

978
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

979
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:40,668
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru seems to kind of have that same skepticism, saying, I'll wait for reviews before getting Punch Out from our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.

980
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good, but... You know what I say to your skepticism?

981
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:45,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

982
01:08:47,984 --> 01:08:51,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, say that all you want, but it's going to happen the way I said it.

983
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:57,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw making an interesting point in chat room regarding remakes and this whole discussion, kind of talking about Hollywood remakes.

984
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake The NeverEnding Story?

985
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did hear that this week.

986
01:09:03,633 --> 01:09:06,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez Louise, come up with a new idea.

987
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:07,915
[SPEAKER_05]: No, exactly.

988
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:09,036
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

989
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:10,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You do not remake The NeverEnding Story.

990
01:09:10,056 --> 01:09:12,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a problem with them doing that because they weren't that great.

991
01:09:12,478 --> 01:09:13,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they were okay, but...

992
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,041
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is that great.

993
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:20,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It remains epic to this day.

994
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:23,923
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one had the guy who played the Flash as the dad.

995
01:09:24,644 --> 01:09:26,164
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always why I like that.

996
01:09:26,284 --> 01:09:29,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I kind of loved that show.

997
01:09:30,306 --> 01:09:31,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it failed.

998
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:33,147
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can do without a remake.

999
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

1000
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,489
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can actually understand her name...

1001
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:39,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Say my name!

1002
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:39,916
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't make a point.

1003
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:41,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Say my name!

1004
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,389
[SPEAKER_05]: You never understand what the hell he's saying.

1005
01:09:45,071 --> 01:09:45,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, forget it.

1006
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:49,583
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more stories and we'll get to Part B. Classic Game of the Week coming up as well.

1007
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's her name.

1008
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:51,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's foreign.

1009
01:09:52,324 --> 01:09:53,805
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1010
01:09:54,685 --> 01:10:06,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So this week, to coincide with the movie release, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC will be getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh, the kind of prequels to the whole Watchmen storyline.

1011
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be sold for a whopping $20.

1012
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:14,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 1600 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade.

1013
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:19,859
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds a bit expensive to me, but it's supposed to be pretty good.

1014
01:10:19,919 --> 01:10:24,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a brawler type game, but $20, really?

1015
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wait.

1016
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:33,387
[SPEAKER_05]: This movie is also not getting some good early reviews, although there's lots of fanboys with big, big boners for Watchmen.

1017
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:35,909
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm interested to see it, but I don't know.

1018
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:42,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd see it, but not opening day.

1019
01:10:42,496 --> 01:10:45,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it before I go see it.

1020
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the story's interesting, but it's not like, oh my god, this is the best novel ever.

1021
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:52,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is the best graphic novel ever, ever.

1022
01:10:53,478 --> 01:10:59,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if that's the best graphic novel that there ever was, thank god, graphic novels suck.

1023
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because seriously, that is where you're setting the bar?

1024
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:04,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1025
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:08,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we'll see.

1026
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:26,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the interesting thing.

1027
01:11:26,924 --> 01:11:35,067
[SPEAKER_05]: EA, apparently, it was their chief operating officer, John Pleasance, made a statement at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference.

1028
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:43,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, when we look back five years, the fantasy of being a rock star by punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen is going to be one implementation in what is going to be a very large category.

1029
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:48,494
[SPEAKER_05]: There are lots of other things you can do with music, and we're working on interesting things.

1030
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know our competition is working on interesting things.

1031
01:11:52,196 --> 01:11:54,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly are they working on?

1032
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,145
[SPEAKER_05]: However, he went on to say, we're not in any position to announce anything.

1033
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a robust category.

1034
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:04,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the coming years, there will hopefully be lots of things we will do in the music category.

1035
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:06,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So could EA be up to something?

1036
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:07,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course they're up to something.

1037
01:12:07,976 --> 01:12:09,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Music games are, you know...

1038
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1039
01:12:39,244 --> 01:12:41,106
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1040
01:12:59,228 --> 01:13:13,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Parasol Stars is in the series of Bubble Bobble, a direct sequel to Rainbow Islands, where you basically use your parasols to...

1041
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:16,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I never realized it was never an arcade game.

1042
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:16,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1043
01:13:40,603 --> 01:13:54,326
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it from Working Designs, though, in the U.S., who was responsible for bringing us tons of different, you know, really awesome games from Japan.

1044
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:58,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they gave us Rayearth, Silhouette Mirage.

1045
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:01,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they do Radiant Silvergun?

1046
01:14:02,748 --> 01:14:03,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1047
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:04,248
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1048
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:07,149
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, it's, you know...

1049
01:14:09,351 --> 01:14:17,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, another game that I'd covered on the show was Brain Fart.

1050
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:19,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Brain Fart the game?

1051
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:23,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, back to Parasol Stars.

1052
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:27,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is a Taito game, came out in 1991.

1053
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:34,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And you play as Bub and Bob, but you play as their human counterparts.

1054
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:37,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Which would be... The same characters from Rainbow Islands.

1055
01:14:38,246 --> 01:14:39,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands.

1056
01:14:39,952 --> 01:14:40,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubby and Bobby.

1057
01:14:41,196 --> 01:14:41,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1058
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:45,833
[SPEAKER_05]: What creative names.

1059
01:14:46,133 --> 01:14:48,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this game only out on TurboGrafx?

1060
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:51,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well, I thought?

1061
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:52,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong.

1062
01:14:52,337 --> 01:14:53,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll get to that.

1063
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:53,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, sorry.

1064
01:14:53,899 --> 01:14:54,199
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1065
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:07,609
[SPEAKER_01]: So, basically, Parasol Stars, though, it was sort of retconned out of their continuity because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons for Bubble Symphony and all those.

1066
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:09,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony.

1067
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:10,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1068
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:23,494
[SPEAKER_01]: and so Parasol Stars is considered a side story to the whole bubble world.

1069
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:29,656
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, like I said, you can get different items, you can also

1070
01:15:31,437 --> 01:15:41,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to collect these star items as you go through that lets you access these other planets, because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets so that you can get all the stuff to save the world.

1071
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:48,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have ten rounds on each planet, and there's a boss in each one, except a level thirty.

1072
01:15:49,214 --> 01:15:50,715
[SPEAKER_01]: and, wait, wrong, sorry.

1073
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:59,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get the star items, you have access to two other planets, one that's around Bubble Bobble and one around another game called Chack'n Pop.

1074
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:04,878
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not available on the main screen, you actually have to get stuff to unlock it.

1075
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:13,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the final boss, who is the one who is responsible for stealing all the color from the world.

1076
01:16:15,262 --> 01:16:20,347
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, it's like the uber boss of everything, and so you get the true ending that way.

1077
01:16:21,448 --> 01:16:33,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like I said, you gather the drops, you can throw them, and if you gather, like, uh, uh, five drops, then you can just do the smackdown with a big, kickass attack.

1078
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:34,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1079
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:41,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, also each of the drops has a different elemental theme, so that's pretty cool.

1080
01:16:41,766 --> 01:16:54,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, this, um, as far as I'm aware, I think this did, um, I think it came out on, um, the Amiga, if I remember correctly.

1081
01:16:55,252 --> 01:16:59,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Atari ST, there's a Game Boy version.

1082
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:01,535
[SPEAKER_01]: The NES, I want to say.

1083
01:17:04,797 --> 01:17:08,900
[SPEAKER_01]: and, of course, the TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine.

1084
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,662
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I think this came out on the NES.

1085
01:17:11,842 --> 01:17:15,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is probably its most notable version is the TurboGrafx-1.

1086
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:15,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1087
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:16,905
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1088
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1089
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go!

1090
01:17:20,388 --> 01:17:25,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Parasol Star is your classic game of the week if you're a fan of Bubble Bobble right in the same series, so check that out.

1091
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's going to bring Part A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close tonight.

1092
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But stick around, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some more news stories.

1093
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:40,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you on Justin.TV, it looks like we're going to do a little bit of a game look tonight.

1094
01:17:40,483 --> 01:17:42,843
[SPEAKER_05]: What game are you looking at on Justin.TV tonight, Loki?

1095
01:17:44,023 --> 01:17:44,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat Lead.

1096
01:17:44,564 --> 01:17:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat Lead is going to be the game we're looking at on Justin.TV during the break tonight.

1097
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:52,786
[SPEAKER_05]: However, stay tuned, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1098
01:17:55,623 --> 01:18:10,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March the 1st of 2009, here for our 315th episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which we've been looking at a game here in studio on Justin.TV, Eat Lead.

1099
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,636
[SPEAKER_05]: How's this game been going for you, Loki?

1100
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:14,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going okay.

1101
01:18:15,097 --> 01:18:15,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1102
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been watching a lot of this on Justin.TV, but I was running in the house during the break, but... Yeah, I was trying to get to a save point real quick.

1103
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:25,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Dope.

1104
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:26,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did I just die?

1105
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you did, because you turned your back when something was going ahead.

1106
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:31,808
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the switchy move.

1107
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:33,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really been paying attention.

1108
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:34,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pause it for later.

1109
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:35,169
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1110
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:37,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll look at it a little more after the show.

1111
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:38,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I'm not going to pause it.

1112
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:38,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quit.

1113
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:39,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, then quit.

1114
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:45,091
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got some news we're going to get back into here on Part B. We've got to wait for Loki to get set up here.

1115
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:47,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1116
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,032
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we kill time at this point?

1117
01:18:49,572 --> 01:18:53,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I need you to be here to start reading news at the top of the show.

1118
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I going to do?

1119
01:18:56,488 --> 01:18:58,589
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're resetting back up Justin.TV.

1120
01:18:58,629 --> 01:19:05,232
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're joining us here on this Sunday night, Justin.TV slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to see us live taping the show.

1121
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:09,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, you can always join our chat room as well, chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1122
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:10,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

1123
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:16,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Bress Lowell is there in chat and is reminding me of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight.

1124
01:19:16,898 --> 01:19:20,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That is Orange Launch Radio USL March Madness is going on right now.

1125
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:28,647
[SPEAKER_05]: and some surprising votes going on right now in the Orange Lounge Radio USL March Madness.

1126
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:36,194
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember right, last time I looked, Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time, which is certainly a controversial little matchup going on right now.

1127
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:41,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting is that there will be three Zelda games in the top eight if...

1128
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:55,977
[SPEAKER_05]: The voting does go in Zelda Ocarina of Time's favor because I think right now The Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past are both ahead as well.

1129
01:19:56,257 --> 01:20:00,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So could be very interesting how that all plays out.

1130
01:20:00,219 --> 01:20:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, if you want to participate in that, you can go to our forums.

1131
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll already be down to eight.

1132
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:10,544
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening, they're at the Sweet 16 right now.

1133
01:20:11,084 --> 01:20:12,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

1134
01:20:12,845 --> 01:20:13,105
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1135
01:20:15,066 --> 01:20:15,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost done, Loki?

1136
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:21,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, he's just plugging the computer back in, getting ready to do the encoding for JustDV.

1137
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:23,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I could read an email.

1138
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:25,031
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do an email real fast?

1139
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:25,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, why not?

1140
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:27,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a preliminary mailbag?

1141
01:20:27,992 --> 01:20:29,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because then that means there'll be less to read later.

1142
01:20:30,153 --> 01:20:31,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sure, well let's start off with an email.

1143
01:20:31,774 --> 01:20:33,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the music though, so just read an email.

1144
01:20:33,935 --> 01:20:35,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to read this because it's super amusing.

1145
01:20:35,935 --> 01:20:38,096
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an email from Sauce.

1146
01:20:38,857 --> 01:20:39,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1147
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, OLR!

1148
01:20:41,582 --> 01:20:46,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people, so I thought I would share a sad but true story with you.

1149
01:20:47,388 --> 01:20:49,930
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it video game related, imagine Super Mario Bros.

1150
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,171
[SPEAKER_01]: music playing in the background.

1151
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:53,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be able to arrange that, actually.

1152
01:20:54,615 --> 01:20:54,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1153
01:20:56,036 --> 01:20:58,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, this actually is so funny that I do want to read it right away.

1154
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:58,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1155
01:20:58,879 --> 01:20:59,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1156
01:21:00,346 --> 01:21:04,010
[SPEAKER_01]: On Friday afternoon, I was at UNLV heading to my graphic design class.

1157
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:07,153
[SPEAKER_01]: From the second floor of the building, this hallway is open air.

1158
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:11,296
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the major street in front of the university.

1159
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:14,199
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was heading into class, I witnessed a car accident.

1160
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:17,842
[SPEAKER_01]: An old, smaller-sized pickup truck rear-ended an orange new Beetle.

1161
01:21:18,303 --> 01:21:22,387
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very loud sound, so many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened.

1162
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:26,113
[SPEAKER_01]: As we watched, the Beetle pulled into the parking lot in front of our building.

1163
01:21:26,153 --> 01:21:35,229
[SPEAKER_01]: The pickup truck sat there for about a minute without pulling out of the street, and then, once the Beetle's owner had gotten out of his car, the truck made a U-turn and sped off down the street.

1164
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:39,477
[SPEAKER_01]: We were obviously quite appalled by this, but what could be done?

1165
01:21:39,797 --> 01:21:44,619
[SPEAKER_01]: We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate, and then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver, Look!

1166
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And pointed to the street.

1167
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:47,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Cue the game over music.

1168
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:57,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the middle of the street, where the accident had occurred, lay the front bumper of the truck with the license plate still attached.

1169
01:21:58,687 --> 01:22:03,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The beetle owner called the police, and a few of us gave a statement to the police officer about the accident.

1170
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know...

1171
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:07,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know why the guy in the truck took off.

1172
01:22:07,852 --> 01:22:10,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he didn't have insurance or maybe he had outstanding tickets.

1173
01:22:10,713 --> 01:22:25,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story is that if you're going to turn a car accident that you're responsible for into a felony hit and run, you might want to make sure that you don't leave any incriminating evidence behind like your bumper and your license plate.

1174
01:22:25,797 --> 01:22:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face when he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind.

1175
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:30,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, Warren.

1176
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: XBOX LIVE NAMES

1177
01:22:53,444 --> 01:22:54,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Profiles, etc.

1178
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:15,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Richard Gaywood or something like that which was his actual name and he ended up getting banned as well because Gay was in the name.

1179
01:23:16,236 --> 01:23:36,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Well now we have a self-identified lesbian being banned from Xbox Live because in her I guess profile it said that she was a lesbian and so apparently that rubbed someone the wrong way so she got banned and

1180
01:23:38,044 --> 01:23:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, people are kind of up in arms about the whole thing, and apparently Microsoft's Steven Toulouse, an Xbox Live team member, has made a post on his personal blog regarding the situation, and they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes.

1181
01:23:56,258 --> 01:24:00,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I guess, GLAAD is weighed in on the story as well, so...

1182
01:24:01,062 --> 01:24:04,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll link it in the chatroom.

1183
01:24:04,443 --> 01:24:06,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I blogged about this actually yesterday.

1184
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:15,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I have choice things to say about the way this was handled.

1185
01:24:15,587 --> 01:24:21,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think inelegant does not even remotely touch what a crying shame it was.

1186
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:24,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say more than that.

1187
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:45,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the whole situation was, as Microsoft noted in a statement, they said that users may not create a gamertag or use text in any profile field that includes comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate content of a potentially sexual nature.

1188
01:24:45,465 --> 01:24:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Profiles that do are asked to change the language and are suspended until changes are made.

1189
01:24:50,826 --> 01:24:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, I guess...

1190
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: The company also states it does not allow gamer tags or profiles to identify any form of sexual orientation.

1191
01:24:58,689 --> 01:25:02,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage nor their code of conduct.

1192
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:04,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

1193
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:08,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the entire both of them.

1194
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:16,176
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not a single thing in the terms of usage or in the code of conduct on Xbox.com.

1195
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:17,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

1196
01:25:17,536 --> 01:25:17,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.

1197
01:25:18,817 --> 01:25:19,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Zilch.

1198
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:21,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1199
01:25:21,392 --> 01:25:24,734
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this, you know, being the gay one on the show.

1200
01:25:24,814 --> 01:25:25,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1201
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things.

1202
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:33,599
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of these things on blog posts that, you know, kind of take it and run, tend to be.

1203
01:25:33,999 --> 01:25:39,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of feel like it might be one of those things that's being blown horrifically out of proportion, like there just might be something else going on.

1204
01:25:40,563 --> 01:25:40,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1205
01:25:41,043 --> 01:25:42,804
[SPEAKER_05]: For all we know, we don't know.

1206
01:25:42,964 --> 01:25:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: For all we know, she could have been doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live.

1207
01:25:47,607 --> 01:25:48,047
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

1208
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:50,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people on Xbox Live do this.

1209
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:12,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen just, you know, blatant harassment going on.

1210
01:26:13,185 --> 01:26:17,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people are like that, you know, outside of the virtual environment.

1211
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:17,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't get me wrong.

1212
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:22,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's totally inexcusable and should definitely be dealt with.

1213
01:26:22,548 --> 01:26:30,690
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no reason why someone shouldn't be able to, I mean, and I personally agree that, you know, it shouldn't matter in the end.

1214
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:32,531
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if she's...

1215
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:35,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Proud of it, why not have something in her?

1216
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:43,835
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what it said on the terms of usage on Xbox Live was, and this is item number five, how you may not use the service.

1217
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:49,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Create a gamertag avatar or use text in other profile fields that may offend other members.

1218
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,158
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it said.

1219
01:26:52,225 --> 01:27:02,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it can be summarized as the Xbox Live powers that be saying, Oh, being gay is offensive.

1220
01:27:03,271 --> 01:27:06,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're all offended that you're a lesbian.

1221
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:12,615
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much how it came out as.

1222
01:27:12,815 --> 01:27:16,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if any of those people that were harassing her were ever dealt with.

1223
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,558
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were ever punished.

1224
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:34,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response to this whole thing, they say, as stated in the Xbox Live Terms of Use, a member may not create a gamertag or use text in other profile fields that include comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate content of a potentially sexual nature.

1225
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Profiles that do are asked to change the language and suspended until changes are made.

1226
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:45,896
[SPEAKER_05]: In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags or profiles, we do not allow expression of any type of orientation, be it hetero or other.

1227
01:27:46,316 --> 01:27:47,417
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not in...

1228
01:27:48,982 --> 01:27:52,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Create a gamertag avatar or use text in the profile fields that may offend other members.

1229
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:56,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Create a gamertag avatar or use text in the profile fields that may offend other members.

1230
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:19,041
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

1231
01:28:41,052 --> 01:28:51,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because if you put on there lesbian, it's not the same as exactly saying I like to fuck chicks.

1232
01:28:54,179 --> 01:29:01,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were people up there who fully had really sexist comments in their profiles.

1233
01:29:01,943 --> 01:29:02,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them before.

1234
01:29:03,724 --> 01:29:04,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know...

1235
01:29:05,848 --> 01:29:07,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing about orientation yet.

1236
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:09,109
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all, you know, pretty offensive things.

1237
01:29:09,749 --> 01:29:10,650
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what happened to them?

1238
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't they banned?

1239
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:21,213
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think that listing your orientation exactly relates to the act of fucking.

1240
01:29:22,674 --> 01:29:29,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if she said in there, I'm a lesbian and I like, you know, big strap-ons, then I understand.

1241
01:29:29,816 --> 01:29:31,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put I heart scissoring.

1242
01:29:31,317 --> 01:29:31,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're...

1243
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:36,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I like cutting paper with scissors, therefore it's scissoring.

1244
01:29:36,908 --> 01:29:37,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I heart scissoring.

1245
01:29:54,329 --> 01:29:54,609
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1246
01:30:15,472 --> 01:30:16,313
[SPEAKER_01]: for the matter of argument?

1247
01:30:16,513 --> 01:30:16,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1248
01:30:17,493 --> 01:30:18,975
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you see what I mean?

1249
01:30:19,115 --> 01:30:20,916
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not have anything.

1250
01:30:21,256 --> 01:30:29,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he said in his comment, including, you know, orientation, you know, listening to that, but nowhere in the terms of usage.

1251
01:30:29,982 --> 01:30:32,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a blatant lie.

1252
01:30:34,894 --> 01:30:46,502
[SPEAKER_01]: He has lied to the public through MTV News and it is in print on not just my own blog but on plenty of news sites now where he is a goddamn liar.

1253
01:30:48,304 --> 01:30:49,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1254
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:59,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, still, it's not like they are talking to GLAAD about the whole thing and the Human Rights or whatever they're called, the Human Rights Campaign, HRC, and all this stuff.

1255
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:01,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like if they were that...

1256
01:31:02,907 --> 01:31:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, against all this or something, they wouldn't even be having that dialogue.

1257
01:31:06,773 --> 01:31:13,162
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in a way, I'm kind of glad that they're not star, star, starring it out like Sony does in Home.

1258
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:20,274
[SPEAKER_04]: What it is, is basically they have a list of banned words that they are considering offensive.

1259
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:26,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, they have to unfortunately cover everything, including homo and all that stuff.

1260
01:31:26,758 --> 01:31:30,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they have the gay in there as well, because people use it in derogatory fashion.

1261
01:31:31,601 --> 01:31:37,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And lesbian is in there as well, and that's unfortunate that it's on this blacklist, but that's what it is.

1262
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:41,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And because this person had it in their profile, that's why their account was banned.

1263
01:31:41,687 --> 01:31:44,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever.

1264
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:45,832
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Gaywood.

1265
01:31:45,852 --> 01:31:46,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his name.

1266
01:31:46,713 --> 01:31:48,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Hers wasn't a random banning.

1267
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:58,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Hers was banned when she reported the harassment of other people against her and they said, oh, well it's because of your profile, ban.

1268
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:03,011
[SPEAKER_01]: They banned her because other people were offended.

1269
01:32:04,554 --> 01:32:06,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd agree that's pretty messed up.

1270
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:14,360
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to ban other, you know, it's just rampant on Xbox Live and some of those games, you know, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, in some of those Halo matches.

1271
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,361
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want me as a moderator.

1272
01:32:16,362 --> 01:32:16,582
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1273
01:32:17,743 --> 01:32:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why they don't want me as a moderator.

1274
01:32:20,004 --> 01:32:21,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I will fuck their shit up.

1275
01:32:22,586 --> 01:32:23,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1276
01:32:23,226 --> 01:32:30,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they say, and you know, I've even seen people, you know, they follow on Twitter, they're like, seriously, when you see that stuff, you know, the fag, fag, fag, report it.

1277
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: They will do something about it.

1278
01:32:33,072 --> 01:32:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1279
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:36,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1280
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: When people annoy me on there, I report it.

1281
01:32:38,646 --> 01:32:39,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a tattle.

1282
01:32:40,126 --> 01:32:47,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what was happening though is if all these people are following her from area to area while she's trying to play a game and just do her own thing.

1283
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:48,588
[SPEAKER_05]: That's harassment.

1284
01:32:48,868 --> 01:32:50,449
[SPEAKER_01]: That's blatant harassment.

1285
01:32:50,469 --> 01:32:52,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Why haven't those people been banned?

1286
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:56,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that if you go after someone with malicious intent.

1287
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:57,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the question.

1288
01:32:57,311 --> 01:32:58,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know that they haven't?

1289
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:00,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Get off my internet.

1290
01:33:23,772 --> 01:33:24,353
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

1291
01:33:44,977 --> 01:33:45,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

1292
01:33:46,838 --> 01:33:47,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1293
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:49,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of curious to see what ultimately becomes of this.

1294
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I still feel like it's kind of early on.

1295
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:52,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll see more kind of come out of this next week.

1296
01:33:53,362 --> 01:33:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to end up revisiting this topic next week.

1297
01:33:55,703 --> 01:33:59,605
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, if you have your own thoughts on it, you can give us a call later in the show.

1298
01:33:59,866 --> 01:34:01,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can always send us an email, of course.

1299
01:34:02,547 --> 01:34:03,508
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura loves emails.

1300
01:34:03,988 --> 01:34:05,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1301
01:34:07,346 --> 01:34:12,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, on Xbox Live, for those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet, there are some things to look forward to in the future.

1302
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:16,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Worms Armageddon Decades is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.

1303
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: This is apparently an old game, about 10 years old, that's come out previously.

1304
01:34:23,837 --> 01:34:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: What was this on before?

1305
01:34:24,817 --> 01:34:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: The Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation and PC?

1306
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:33,603
[SPEAKER_05]: They're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade, which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original Worms

1307
01:34:33,963 --> 01:34:35,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Worms Armageddon Death Tanks Death Tanks

1308
01:35:03,772 --> 01:35:06,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's any good, but I love Scorched Earth.

1309
01:35:06,974 --> 01:35:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?

1310
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:09,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is awesome.

1311
01:35:10,516 --> 01:35:12,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's hot.

1312
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:15,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about the game, silly pants.

1313
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:18,282
[SPEAKER_01]: My pants aren't silly, they're denim.

1314
01:35:19,442 --> 01:35:20,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1315
01:35:22,353 --> 01:35:26,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the Xbox Live Arcade, even though they're bastards in charge.

1316
01:35:28,675 --> 01:35:31,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting, and this is me specifically getting this.

1317
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:32,217
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for me.

1318
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,118
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in my own private universe, this is for me.

1319
01:35:35,838 --> 01:35:42,241
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite ever games is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, according to Famitsu.

1320
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:44,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know what that is?

1321
01:35:44,261 --> 01:35:45,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a clue.

1322
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:46,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It involved twin sticks.

1323
01:35:47,482 --> 01:35:50,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I have twin sticks for this game, by the way, Rob.

1324
01:35:50,884 --> 01:35:51,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that?

1325
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I'm not surprised.

1326
01:35:54,361 --> 01:35:55,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtual On!

1327
01:35:55,781 --> 01:35:59,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Oratario Tangram is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

1328
01:35:59,663 --> 01:36:01,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't use my twin sticks!

1329
01:36:02,704 --> 01:36:04,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks.

1330
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:06,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, but you'd have to modify them.

1331
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:08,127
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1332
01:36:09,308 --> 01:36:10,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make a converter.

1333
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:17,712
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's going to be on there for 1,200 points.

1334
01:36:18,692 --> 01:36:20,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my god, I love this game!

1335
01:36:21,055 --> 01:36:22,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Michael Jackson have one of these?

1336
01:36:22,136 --> 01:36:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1337
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?

1338
01:36:24,137 --> 01:36:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I didn't look

1339
01:36:49,255 --> 01:36:54,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly though, there's only one more game really other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of.

1340
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,362
[SPEAKER_01]: But you probably can't guess what it is.

1341
01:37:00,103 --> 01:37:00,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Planet Harrier.

1342
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:06,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it's robot on robot action.

1343
01:37:06,148 --> 01:37:07,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, kinky, but seriously.

1344
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:11,552
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beat them up and get to the end of the game.

1345
01:37:11,672 --> 01:37:15,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have, Dan and I have two clocks.

1346
01:37:15,976 --> 01:37:16,877
[SPEAKER_01]: that Sega released.

1347
01:37:16,937 --> 01:37:20,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the Feiyan and then we've got one of the last boss.

1348
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,761
[SPEAKER_01]: The annoying bitch that he is.

1349
01:37:25,344 --> 01:37:25,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the game!

1350
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:34,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for that will be coming to... Well, actually, you may have to pay for this one.

1351
01:37:36,473 --> 01:37:40,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade is close to being finished.

1352
01:37:41,734 --> 01:37:45,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently this was first spotted as an ESRB leak.

1353
01:37:46,396 --> 01:37:47,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do remember the leak.

1354
01:37:47,396 --> 01:37:49,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this was around E3 even, last year.

1355
01:37:50,618 --> 01:37:50,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1356
01:37:52,537 --> 01:37:55,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's looking pretty good.

1357
01:37:55,341 --> 01:38:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of makes sense with some of the other Quake-themed stuff that was coming soon.

1358
01:38:00,529 --> 01:38:01,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

1359
01:38:04,694 --> 01:38:08,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week, and I see people talking about that in chat right now.

1360
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:13,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it looks like HitStun's looking for people to play Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue.

1361
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:20,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, the day it was announced, thousands of people in the queue because everybody was probably getting thrown to it from different blog sites.

1362
01:38:20,505 --> 01:38:29,871
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I went back earlier today to try to check it out, and the queue was only 35 people, which, sadly, I didn't have time to wait again because I had to do this show tonight.

1363
01:38:29,931 --> 01:38:31,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to try and check it out a little later on tonight.

1364
01:38:32,012 --> 01:38:34,314
[SPEAKER_05]: But in looking at the demo videos and stuff, it looks kind of awesome.

1365
01:38:34,814 --> 01:38:37,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very curious to see if it plays as well as it's advertised.

1366
01:38:37,697 --> 01:38:40,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster.

1367
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:41,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know.

1368
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:47,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, you know it's going to get hammered the first day, but it looks like it's eased up quite a bit, because the queue was only 35.

1369
01:38:47,304 --> 01:38:49,166
[SPEAKER_05]: That wouldn't have been that bad.

1370
01:38:49,186 --> 01:38:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that.

1371
01:38:51,248 --> 01:38:57,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I guess right now, right this second, there's no queue, so some of our listeners might be off to play that.

1372
01:38:57,953 --> 01:38:59,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will probably check that out a little later tonight.

1373
01:39:00,195 --> 01:39:01,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

1374
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:05,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would definitely check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live.

1375
01:39:05,141 --> 01:39:06,903
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of my favorite Quake games was the third one.

1376
01:39:06,943 --> 01:39:08,785
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of games like that that are coming out.

1377
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:10,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also that other...

1378
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:17,510
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I don't remember the name of it now, but it was the one that they had with the Aegea physics processor at one time.

1379
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That game, whatever.

1380
01:39:21,411 --> 01:39:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some psychic war game that's going to be coming out.

1381
01:39:23,651 --> 01:39:27,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think there's another game very similar to that as well that's supposed to be on its way.

1382
01:39:27,413 --> 01:39:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of those arena, Unreal type of tournament stuff coming out for Live Arcade.

1383
01:39:33,922 --> 01:39:35,182
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1384
01:40:03,352 --> 01:40:06,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they made their way to the Wii eventually with the Strong Bad games.

1385
01:40:06,873 --> 01:40:07,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Season 1 did.

1386
01:40:07,473 --> 01:40:08,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1387
01:40:08,373 --> 01:40:15,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But finally they're going to be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade and this is where people will actually be able to download a demo because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games.

1388
01:40:15,455 --> 01:40:20,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you'll probably finally see these games start to get a lot more of the attention it deserves, at least from the console people.

1389
01:40:20,856 --> 01:40:23,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it.

1390
01:40:24,236 --> 01:40:25,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is going to open it up to a whole new audience.

1391
01:40:26,257 --> 01:40:29,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is good news and kind of expected in a way.

1392
01:40:29,057 --> 01:40:30,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of figured this was going to happen eventually.

1393
01:40:31,618 --> 01:40:31,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1394
01:40:32,498 --> 01:40:32,858
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1395
01:40:32,898 --> 01:40:35,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade.

1396
01:40:37,102 --> 01:40:40,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have some interesting news.

1397
01:40:40,745 --> 01:40:41,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1398
01:40:41,385 --> 01:40:42,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to do with the ESRB.

1399
01:40:43,227 --> 01:40:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: More leaks?

1400
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:44,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1401
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:48,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic rock track for Rock Band.

1402
01:40:50,092 --> 01:40:50,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that kind of cool?

1403
01:40:51,313 --> 01:40:58,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be getting a teen rating and it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use.

1404
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:00,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1405
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:05,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just that song pack that they're going to put out of all previously released.

1406
01:41:05,953 --> 01:41:11,876
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys.

1407
01:41:12,116 --> 01:41:13,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's already there.

1408
01:41:13,637 --> 01:41:17,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is.

1409
01:41:17,779 --> 01:41:21,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect.

1410
01:41:21,755 --> 01:41:22,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

1411
01:41:22,615 --> 01:41:24,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad they don't have independent achievements.

1412
01:41:25,437 --> 01:41:26,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make it a lot more worthwhile.

1413
01:41:27,277 --> 01:41:31,159
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I wonder if that ACDC Rock Band game has really fallen in price yet.

1414
01:41:31,939 --> 01:41:36,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin, but I don't want to pay like... It's all live tracks, too.

1415
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like...

1416
01:41:38,622 --> 01:41:41,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore.

1417
01:41:41,284 --> 01:41:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library.

1418
01:41:43,845 --> 01:41:45,306
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple good ACDC songs.

1419
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:50,210
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'm not going to get it until it's in the $5 bin, which you know it will be in Walmart eventually.

1420
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive, and then you sell that shit back.

1421
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:56,834
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1422
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:57,634
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1423
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:58,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're talking.

1424
01:41:59,275 --> 01:42:01,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we do it.

1425
01:42:01,036 --> 01:42:01,856
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how we roll.

1426
01:42:25,623 --> 01:42:51,597
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well and of course these will be available in their bundles I believe or actually maybe just game only right now and then there's also going to be the standalone stuff as well and then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone

1427
01:42:53,127 --> 01:42:57,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago.

1428
01:42:57,228 --> 01:43:01,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob.

1429
01:43:01,229 --> 01:43:01,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Some bargain.

1430
01:43:01,989 --> 01:43:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree.

1431
01:43:02,529 --> 01:43:05,209
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?

1432
01:43:05,229 --> 01:43:07,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1433
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:12,291
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of bargains, HitStun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend on Steam.

1434
01:43:12,751 --> 01:43:16,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out, but then again, I never really cared for the demo.

1435
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:17,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not my kind of game.

1436
01:43:18,012 --> 01:43:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of thing.

1437
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again.

1438
01:43:22,993 --> 01:43:24,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun.

1439
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they had multiplayer.

1440
01:43:25,095 --> 01:43:26,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they do that in the second one.

1441
01:43:26,196 --> 01:43:27,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be much fun.

1442
01:43:27,136 --> 01:43:27,917
[SPEAKER_04]: They will, I'm sure.

1443
01:43:27,997 --> 01:43:28,477
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to.

1444
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:31,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band.

1445
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other Rock Band news, obviously there's a lot of PlayStation news this week at Destination PlayStation.

1446
01:43:37,504 --> 01:43:39,966
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds pretty awesome.

1447
01:43:41,147 --> 01:43:45,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP.

1448
01:43:45,531 --> 01:43:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rock band on a portable console.

1449
01:43:47,172 --> 01:43:49,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?

1450
01:43:50,094 --> 01:43:53,157
[SPEAKER_05]: The DS, but now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP.

1451
01:43:53,537 --> 01:43:54,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But guess what?

1452
01:43:54,338 --> 01:43:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that.

1453
01:43:59,042 --> 01:44:05,608
[SPEAKER_05]: No, apparently a website named Primo Tech apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like.

1454
01:44:06,008 --> 01:44:07,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Take this with a grain of salt.

1455
01:44:07,269 --> 01:44:11,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of this sounds a little bit like Fanboy Wang to me, but this could be the real deal.

1456
01:44:11,733 --> 01:44:15,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the stuff from Destination PlayStation, probably.

1457
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:19,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were... Well, let me get to that in a minute.

1458
01:44:19,598 --> 01:44:21,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this.

1459
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:26,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, you're going to be using the left, up, triangle, and circle buttons to control instruments.

1460
01:44:27,022 --> 01:44:29,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons.

1461
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going, and then you switch to a different instrument.

1462
01:44:37,286 --> 01:44:37,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1463
01:44:37,967 --> 01:44:39,427
[SPEAKER_05]: What game am I describing?

1464
01:44:40,468 --> 01:44:42,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Frequency and Amplitude, anybody?

1465
01:44:43,345 --> 01:44:50,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember a couple weeks ago, there was that guy who made the statement about, oh, we'd love to revisit Frequency or Amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself.

1466
01:44:50,489 --> 01:44:58,653
[SPEAKER_05]: If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility and a pretty good idea for a game.

1467
01:44:58,693 --> 01:45:00,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And one I would definitely pick up.

1468
01:45:00,134 --> 01:45:01,835
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like Frequency and Amplitude and that stuff.

1469
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all over this game.

1470
01:45:03,476 --> 01:45:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: All over it.

1471
01:45:05,532 --> 01:45:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hooray to that.

1472
01:45:06,534 --> 01:45:08,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that.

1473
01:45:08,697 --> 01:45:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, DarkSakura?

1474
01:45:13,583 --> 01:45:14,164
[SPEAKER_01]: They're alright.

1475
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:16,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it sound like something you might play?

1476
01:45:16,788 --> 01:45:17,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

1477
01:45:17,369 --> 01:45:17,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

1478
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:19,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, songs are everything.

1479
01:45:19,812 --> 01:45:20,393
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's...

1480
01:45:21,394 --> 01:45:22,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero DS Guitar Hero DS Guitar Hero DS

1481
01:45:38,823 --> 01:45:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the Nintendo Wii and smoosh it down into a DS?

1482
01:45:48,247 --> 01:45:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Where this is, okay, how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform knowing that these are our restrictions?

1483
01:45:56,931 --> 01:45:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Go.

1484
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:02,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it I think will help them create the better game.

1485
01:46:03,074 --> 01:46:03,534
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

1486
01:46:04,714 --> 01:46:05,935
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall soon see.

1487
01:46:07,349 --> 01:46:08,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how about more stuff?

1488
01:46:09,037 --> 01:46:10,143
[SPEAKER_05]: More stuff, my favorite.

1489
01:46:11,325 --> 01:46:40,127
[SPEAKER_01]: for iPhone people there are actually two titles that are out by Taito and though they're not Bubble Wobble the first is Cooking Mama where you can use the accelerometer and play your game it's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro there's also Space Invaders where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen and there's like bonus character art and stuff and it's like 5 bucks so cool

1490
01:46:42,683 --> 01:46:50,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting a little sick of all the let's take our existing things and push them down into the iPhone.

1491
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point from Actdeft in chat.

1492
01:46:52,432 --> 01:46:53,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Space Invaders Extreme.

1493
01:46:54,493 --> 01:46:58,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders.

1494
01:46:58,317 --> 01:47:03,362
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack, which the iPhone would be a good platform for, I would be all over that.

1495
01:47:03,462 --> 01:47:05,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't sound like it.

1496
01:47:07,947 --> 01:47:14,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content was supposed to have been out already, but it's been delayed to March 5th.

1497
01:47:14,649 --> 01:47:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that long of a wait, though.

1498
01:47:16,169 --> 01:47:18,030
[SPEAKER_04]: The price has been announced at $10.

1499
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, this game will pick up from the end of the game and hopefully make up, I guess, for what was apparently a crappy ending.

1500
01:47:28,453 --> 01:47:28,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1501
01:47:28,773 --> 01:47:31,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia.

1502
01:47:31,774 --> 01:47:33,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't get to the end either.

1503
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:35,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but...

1504
01:47:36,818 --> 01:47:37,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1505
01:47:55,686 --> 01:47:55,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1506
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:16,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account and I hardly ever use it, so it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away because I never watch the movies that they send me.

1507
01:48:16,272 --> 01:48:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing I do love about Netflix is the streaming Netflix.

1508
01:48:20,672 --> 01:48:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I like about the streaming versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail is that you don't have to wait for streaming.

1509
01:48:26,594 --> 01:48:28,574
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to watch something, you can watch it right now.

1510
01:48:28,614 --> 01:48:30,655
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you.

1511
01:48:31,055 --> 01:48:35,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love the Xbox 360 streaming, and I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week.

1512
01:48:36,236 --> 01:48:37,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Netflix is plagiarizing

1513
01:48:37,776 --> 01:48:41,918
[SPEAKER_05]: planning on a streaming-only subscription in the foreseeable future.

1514
01:48:42,018 --> 01:48:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from a report from Reuters, which is, you know, one of the massive news reporting agencies along with Associated Press.

1515
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:51,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, this sounds like it's coming in the future.

1516
01:48:51,963 --> 01:48:58,207
[SPEAKER_05]: No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription because, sadly, there isn't a lot available right now.

1517
01:48:58,227 --> 01:49:02,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's some good, like, NBC TV shows and, you know, there's some

1518
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:04,411
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1519
01:49:18,663 --> 01:49:18,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Outro

1520
01:49:44,415 --> 01:49:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1521
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:14,159
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's gonna pick out a few of her favorite emails and read them for you right now!

1522
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:26,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan was very popular on the show.

1523
01:50:26,751 --> 01:50:28,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some twits about it too and all that.

1524
01:50:28,472 --> 01:50:30,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Janai from Las Vegas, actually.

1525
01:50:31,573 --> 01:50:33,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, stupid thing.

1526
01:50:33,153 --> 01:50:35,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my plug keeps falling on my laptop.

1527
01:50:36,394 --> 01:50:38,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious.

1528
01:50:38,855 --> 01:50:42,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my seat laughing while at work.

1529
01:50:42,395 --> 01:50:43,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan needs to be on the show more often.

1530
01:50:44,016 --> 01:50:45,456
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a great radio voice too.

1531
01:50:45,956 --> 01:50:47,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the new OLR website layout.

1532
01:50:47,677 --> 01:50:49,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a nice citrus look to it.

1533
01:50:49,897 --> 01:50:51,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace slot machines and sugar cookies.

1534
01:50:51,518 --> 01:50:51,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Janai.

1535
01:50:55,051 --> 01:50:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June, and you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3.

1536
01:51:00,252 --> 01:51:00,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

1537
01:51:01,873 --> 01:51:03,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to go back to Vegas, though.

1538
01:51:03,433 --> 01:51:04,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make that happen this year.

1539
01:51:06,574 --> 01:51:13,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's just some really, really long emails.

1540
01:51:15,596 --> 01:51:20,237
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one comes up from Acidic Vampire.

1541
01:51:21,778 --> 01:51:22,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello there, OLR.

1542
01:51:22,678 --> 01:51:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Paul, a.k.a.

1543
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:27,300
[SPEAKER_01]: a sick vampire, with my virginal email to you guys.

1544
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:33,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener, been listening since August of last year, and that I enjoy the show immensely.

1545
01:51:33,682 --> 01:51:41,184
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemistry between all three hosts, the terrific news, and Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener.

1546
01:51:41,464 --> 01:51:42,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine hate.

1547
01:51:43,645 --> 01:51:46,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way, I do have a valid question.

1548
01:51:47,905 --> 01:51:54,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only heard Sky mention that he's played this game before, but if DarkSakura or Loki has played this as well, I wouldn't mind their input.

1549
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:58,214
[SPEAKER_01]: After years of being released, I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI.

1550
01:51:58,814 --> 01:52:03,558
[SPEAKER_01]: For some odd reason, I've been reading about it lately, and I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play.

1551
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:07,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, Final Fantasy VI for the win, and I've...

1552
01:52:08,482 --> 01:52:14,164
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play.

1553
01:52:14,524 --> 01:52:22,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I bought the Venatio collection recently for about $20, which includes all four expansion packs, and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my farraga on.

1554
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:30,290
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be my first MMORPG, which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers because of my inexperience, which leads to this question.

1555
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:33,471
[SPEAKER_01]: What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?

1556
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:40,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to play a TaruTaru Black Mage because they're so damn cute, but I know it'll take forever to level them up.

1557
01:52:40,455 --> 01:52:44,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like to interact with other players, but I don't want them exciting me just because I'm new to the game.

1558
01:52:45,219 --> 01:52:46,760
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been playing the game for five plus years.

1559
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:54,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Any input you have, I'm sorry, any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated.

1560
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:57,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time, and here's to another 300 shows.

1561
01:52:57,547 --> 01:52:58,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Gay gamers unite.

1562
01:52:59,789 --> 01:53:00,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave that to you.

1563
01:53:00,349 --> 01:53:01,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I played, but I didn't like it.

1564
01:53:02,304 --> 01:53:04,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, turn around and run while you still can.

1565
01:53:04,506 --> 01:53:06,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game.

1566
01:53:06,768 --> 01:53:07,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know what?

1567
01:53:07,569 --> 01:53:09,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left.

1568
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:09,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1569
01:53:09,911 --> 01:53:15,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil, if not a little longer.

1570
01:53:16,678 --> 01:53:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Loki.

1571
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your thoughts?

1572
01:53:19,727 --> 01:53:20,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

1573
01:53:20,408 --> 01:53:20,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

1574
01:53:22,429 --> 01:53:26,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked waiting for parties.

1575
01:53:26,512 --> 01:53:33,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that they fixed having to party with people, I think that would be a lot more fun now.

1576
01:53:34,737 --> 01:53:36,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of the thing that broke it for me.

1577
01:53:36,379 --> 01:53:38,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other than I didn't have time to play.

1578
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just waiting for a party.

1579
01:53:41,782 --> 01:53:43,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, okay, I have two hours to play this.

1580
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:45,120
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1581
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1582
01:54:27,025 --> 01:54:30,866
[SPEAKER_05]: 3-4 months after I left, they finally started banning people for it and they're pretty aggressive about it.

1583
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:37,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Now granted, you'll never eliminate it, but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game because the guild sellers were ruining the game.

1584
01:54:37,748 --> 01:54:41,309
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just unfortunate that Square let it go on so long.

1585
01:54:41,329 --> 01:54:45,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They lost some people like me because they just weren't more aggressive with it.

1586
01:54:46,751 --> 01:54:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1587
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:51,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I can't give the game a fair review, but dude, you already bought the pack.

1588
01:54:51,252 --> 01:54:52,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with a free month of the game.

1589
01:54:53,473 --> 01:54:54,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Go install it.

1590
01:54:54,174 --> 01:54:54,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a blast.

1591
01:54:54,814 --> 01:54:57,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now.

1592
01:54:58,136 --> 01:54:58,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1593
01:54:58,536 --> 01:54:59,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it would look nice.

1594
01:55:00,017 --> 01:55:00,558
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1595
01:55:01,398 --> 01:55:02,719
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing I prefer.

1596
01:55:03,019 --> 01:55:03,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you something.

1597
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:07,262
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy XI compared to WoW.

1598
01:55:07,922 --> 01:55:10,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I like exploring in Final Fantasy XI a lot more.

1599
01:55:10,984 --> 01:55:13,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better.

1600
01:55:13,646 --> 01:55:14,546
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just a different type.

1601
01:55:14,927 --> 01:55:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy XI, like a place you've never been before, it's like, oh, wow.

1602
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scary.

1603
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:21,072
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

1604
01:55:29,194 --> 01:55:32,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI, you really get a sense of exploration in that game.

1605
01:55:32,697 --> 01:55:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: The world is so vast in that game.

1606
01:55:34,799 --> 01:55:40,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that, but I don't know.

1607
01:55:40,483 --> 01:55:45,127
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something about Final Fantasy XI where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring.

1608
01:55:45,227 --> 01:55:47,188
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW takes itself more seriously, I think.

1609
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI takes itself more seriously than WoW.

1610
01:55:56,055 --> 01:55:58,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun asked in chat, so what happened to make WoW suck now?

1611
01:55:59,196 --> 01:56:00,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, WoW doesn't suck.

1612
01:56:00,677 --> 01:56:06,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a problem with WoW at all, but I just had to quit because I was spending too much time on it.

1613
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Or take a vacation.

1614
01:56:07,261 --> 01:56:09,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say I quit because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back.

1615
01:56:09,642 --> 01:56:10,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the case.

1616
01:56:10,182 --> 01:56:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon.

1617
01:56:12,584 --> 01:56:14,945
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just needed a break to do other things.

1618
01:56:16,045 --> 01:56:16,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hooray.

1619
01:56:18,547 --> 01:56:19,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, next email then.

1620
01:56:19,888 --> 01:56:20,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Next email.

1621
01:56:23,194 --> 01:56:26,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, LLR, I have a request for the new GameStop hate board.

1622
01:56:26,798 --> 01:56:29,500
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sell classic games or system anymore.

1623
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I was too young when they did, and I got into classic gaming.

1624
01:56:32,463 --> 01:56:34,745
[SPEAKER_01]: They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust.

1625
01:56:35,125 --> 01:56:37,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So F you to GameStop for lack of classic video games.

1626
01:56:37,487 --> 01:56:38,968
[SPEAKER_01]: How dare they call themselves a game store?

1627
01:56:39,048 --> 01:56:39,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Cheeseburger.

1628
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:41,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Good suggestion.

1629
01:56:41,831 --> 01:56:45,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the whiteboard's down for repairs right now, but we will definitely add that when it comes back.

1630
01:56:46,815 --> 01:56:47,076
Okay.

1631
01:56:50,236 --> 01:56:53,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one from Spacinator, and then I'm going to read the long, long one after that.

1632
01:56:55,151 --> 01:56:57,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments.

1633
01:56:57,753 --> 01:57:00,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, although perhaps it's not a big deal, but I'll address it anyway.

1634
01:57:00,815 --> 01:57:05,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that I sent last week with the poor grammar and spelling.

1635
01:57:05,217 --> 01:57:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it, I'm giving a hard time.

1636
01:57:07,178 --> 01:57:21,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally I take the time to make sure everything's correct, but considering that I was typing in a hurry and the fact that PlayOnline has no spellcheck, and the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time, side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal glucose levels cause me to get confused, that all ended up being a factor in the issue.

1637
01:57:21,888 --> 01:57:22,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I... I...

1638
01:57:23,391 --> 01:57:26,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I give everybody a hard time, it's not serious

1639
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:28,839
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an equal opportunity offender.

1640
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:30,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bite me.

1641
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:33,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions.

1642
01:57:33,821 --> 01:57:44,947
[SPEAKER_01]: One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments that basically you had you think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby that I want to get into.

1643
01:57:45,247 --> 01:57:49,590
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's the first time I've set foot into a showbiz pizza place formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's.

1644
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:54,832
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment that was started by...

1645
01:57:57,472 --> 01:57:58,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.

1646
01:57:58,873 --> 01:58:00,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was started by Fuck.

1647
01:58:01,095 --> 01:58:02,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Nolan Bushnell.

1648
01:58:03,658 --> 01:58:05,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of let you suffer a little bit before I helped you.

1649
01:58:10,264 --> 01:58:11,705
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to my friend's house.

1650
01:58:12,186 --> 01:58:14,308
[SPEAKER_01]: No shit, because I was little and into games.

1651
01:58:15,989 --> 01:58:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born playing video games practically.

1652
01:58:21,155 --> 01:58:38,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little and I never thought about wow I'd like to do this as a hobby it just sort of happened you know I was a little kid you know when all of this was new and interesting but it was just more like

1653
01:58:40,293 --> 01:58:42,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, Mom brought home a ColecoVision.

1654
01:58:42,256 --> 01:58:42,836
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

1655
01:58:43,577 --> 01:58:47,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm going to go play Kix during break at school.

1656
01:58:48,984 --> 01:58:52,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't factor in as a wow.

1657
01:58:52,669 --> 01:58:55,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a part of my life, always.

1658
01:58:55,192 --> 01:58:56,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So, not a big deal.

1659
01:58:57,675 --> 01:58:57,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob?

1660
01:58:59,758 --> 01:59:01,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, what are we answering?

1661
01:59:01,299 --> 01:59:06,463
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your, wow, I really like video games, you know, what got you into video games pretty much?

1662
01:59:06,903 --> 01:59:07,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1663
01:59:08,865 --> 01:59:09,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost in the same boat.

1664
01:59:09,986 --> 01:59:16,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600 and just the fact that I was interacting with it.

1665
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:20,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, no, it really was the Commodore 64, I think, that really got me into games.

1666
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:21,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And just...

1667
01:59:22,254 --> 01:59:23,055
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1668
01:59:41,954 --> 01:59:50,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of an only child, not really.

1669
01:59:50,962 --> 02:00:00,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But one reason I played video games is because I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with or go out and play on the lawn with.

1670
02:00:00,689 --> 02:00:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff, but they don't want to hang out every day.

1671
02:00:03,972 --> 02:00:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So video games were a way to pass time.

1672
02:00:06,794 --> 02:00:07,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It would entertain me.

1673
02:00:08,175 --> 02:00:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't always a lot of other people around, if that makes sense.

1674
02:00:12,258 --> 02:00:13,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, anything for you?

1675
02:00:14,139 --> 02:00:15,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you into video games?

1676
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because I always played video games.

1677
02:00:19,202 --> 02:00:20,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's tough.

1678
02:00:20,382 --> 02:00:23,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say it's just a tough question.

1679
02:00:23,905 --> 02:00:26,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just having video games from when I was four or five.

1680
02:00:27,207 --> 02:00:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That pretty much, I'll do it.

1681
02:00:31,169 --> 02:00:36,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at the stuff that you did when you were a little kid and you end up looking at it now and you're doing the same stuff.

1682
02:00:38,515 --> 02:00:43,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked tinkering with things and playing video games and messing around on a computer.

1683
02:00:44,199 --> 02:00:46,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now.

1684
02:00:47,341 --> 02:00:49,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently.

1685
02:00:49,822 --> 02:00:50,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you have it.

1686
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:51,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Driver 3

1687
02:01:12,085 --> 02:01:14,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 3 is the best worst game ever.

1688
02:01:15,087 --> 02:01:16,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so bad.

1689
02:01:16,788 --> 02:01:19,070
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday about that.

1690
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again.

1691
02:01:22,873 --> 02:01:28,076
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd basically just play the game, drive around, do stupid shit, and then watch the replay.

1692
02:01:28,416 --> 02:01:38,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the best part about it, the game was so glitchy anyways that the replays were funny, but sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more, so your character would do really crazy stuff.

1693
02:01:39,564 --> 02:01:43,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 3, absolutely a horrible game that's funny to play.

1694
02:01:44,069 --> 02:01:46,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny.

1695
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Pagel on Xbox Live Arcade

1696
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:31,296
[SPEAKER_05]: but right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook but nobody else I have the shitty team score because nobody else plays every week like me but I try to get a new score every week so if you do play you should add me on Facebook because I need a higher team score so there you go

1697
02:02:33,297 --> 02:02:36,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the third part of this email?

1698
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:36,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1699
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:43,765
[SPEAKER_01]: In your opinion, what are the odds of Square Enix re-releasing Final Fantasy XI for one or more of the current gen systems?

1700
02:02:44,305 --> 02:02:49,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're really big on re-releasing the other Final Fantasy games, so are they re-releasing Final Fantasy VII?

1701
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:52,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So re-releasing Final Fantasy VII should be a no-brainer.

1702
02:02:53,192 --> 02:02:59,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Although not everyone may agree on this, Final Fantasy VII is possibly the most popular... I think he meant...

1703
02:02:59,817 --> 02:03:00,858
[SPEAKER_01]: re-releasing Final Fantasy 7.

1704
02:03:00,958 --> 02:03:03,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, 11's already on 360.

1705
02:03:03,481 --> 02:03:11,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular and memorable game of the series, so re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual license to print a shit ton of money.

1706
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:13,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wouldn't want free money, you know?

1707
02:03:14,832 --> 02:03:16,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for reading and answering this email.

1708
02:03:16,294 --> 02:03:16,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry it's so long.

1709
02:03:19,437 --> 02:03:19,837
[SPEAKER_01]: They should.

1710
02:03:20,938 --> 02:03:21,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd play it.

1711
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:23,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of torn.

1712
02:03:23,801 --> 02:03:27,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they should, but I'd rather they just freaking finish Final Fantasy XIII.

1713
02:03:27,383 --> 02:03:30,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also interested in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy is going.

1714
02:03:30,745 --> 02:03:36,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they would have released Final Fantasy XII on the PlayStation 3 and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2.

1715
02:03:37,408 --> 02:03:41,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if it had been on the newer consoles, I would have probably spent more time with it.

1716
02:03:41,411 --> 02:03:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that seems so silly, but it's what it is.

1717
02:03:44,452 --> 02:03:46,413
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1718
02:03:46,473 --> 02:03:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1719
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:48,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you think they ought to re-release VII?

1720
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1721
02:03:49,508 --> 02:03:50,889
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a classic the way it is.

1722
02:03:51,289 --> 02:03:55,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they do need to just put it out on the download thing already on PlayStation Network.

1723
02:03:55,831 --> 02:03:57,052
[SPEAKER_05]: That I think they need to do.

1724
02:03:58,413 --> 02:03:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait until XIII comes out.

1725
02:04:00,034 --> 02:04:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: They may do that.

1726
02:04:01,274 --> 02:04:02,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could see that.

1727
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:09,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy VII before XIII comes out?

1728
02:04:15,002 --> 02:04:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake, they put it on PSN or Steam.

1729
02:04:22,988 --> 02:04:23,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of the same thing I'm thinking of.

1730
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:29,173
[SPEAKER_05]: The Last Remnant, of course, we heard is coming to Steam, which implies the whole Square partnership with Steam now.

1731
02:04:29,594 --> 02:04:33,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they will release some of the old PC classics on Steam, but we'll see.

1732
02:04:33,877 --> 02:04:34,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to hold my breath.

1733
02:04:34,598 --> 02:04:37,322
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also that good old games distribution.

1734
02:04:37,362 --> 02:04:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Eidos put them out?

1735
02:04:39,485 --> 02:04:41,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Eidos do the ports for PC?

1736
02:04:41,708 --> 02:04:42,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1737
02:04:42,148 --> 02:04:42,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.

1738
02:04:42,829 --> 02:04:43,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play them.

1739
02:04:44,031 --> 02:04:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... Slightly better graphics.

1740
02:04:47,595 --> 02:04:47,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1741
02:04:50,723 --> 02:04:51,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Last email?

1742
02:04:52,123 --> 02:04:53,544
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's long.

1743
02:04:54,184 --> 02:04:58,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been a long-time listener of your show and count it among my favorites.

1744
02:04:58,687 --> 02:05:03,369
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, when you do miss a show infrequently as it is, it leaves me feeling out of place.

1745
02:05:03,729 --> 02:05:05,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock.

1746
02:05:06,231 --> 02:05:09,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Your unique mixture of news commentary and charm are an important part of my week.

1747
02:05:10,153 --> 02:05:14,075
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first letter to you, so I thought I'd start out by thanking you all...

1748
02:05:15,375 --> 02:05:18,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all you've provided during the years.

1749
02:05:18,358 --> 02:05:20,799
[SPEAKER_01]: As an older gamer like yourselves, I'm not older.

1750
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:22,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm kidding.

1751
02:05:22,501 --> 02:05:23,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a little.

1752
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:27,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family, and the passion we feel for our hobby.

1753
02:05:28,625 --> 02:05:33,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a weekly show with pre- and post-production on top of that, and I'm amazed you've been at it for as long as you have.

1754
02:05:33,729 --> 02:05:34,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, enough of me gushing.

1755
02:05:35,070 --> 02:05:35,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we.

1756
02:05:37,332 --> 02:05:37,972
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, thank you.

1757
02:05:38,232 --> 02:05:38,813
[SPEAKER_05]: That means a lot.

1758
02:05:39,873 --> 02:05:52,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I came across a comment made by John Kohler, head of Sony PSP Hardware Marketing in North America, which suggested that the majority of Nintendo DSes are purchased by or for 12-year-olds.

1759
02:05:52,471 --> 02:05:55,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, this was meant to insult the DS handheld fanbase.

1760
02:05:56,738 --> 02:05:58,880
[SPEAKER_01]: But that aside, how much of the statement is true?

1761
02:05:59,401 --> 02:06:05,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I've searched the web for data on Nintendo demographics as they break down by age group and have a hard time finding any recent results.

1762
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:11,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Most comments are anecdotal with an equal number of people saying they see more PSPs to DSs

1763
02:06:12,038 --> 02:06:18,681
[SPEAKER_01]: among their above 12 age group as exist folks insisting there are more DSs in their circle.

1764
02:06:19,181 --> 02:06:24,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest I came to anything was an article on GayGamer.net from 2007 reporting that, according to the MPD,

1765
02:06:27,885 --> 02:06:52,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women by 42% 127% among people who age 30 and older and 212% among people 35 and older I don't know if that's just for the month of April or if it was since the last study had been made I know maybe this really isn't that big of a deal but I'm curious to know if these assertions have any factual base Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me

1766
02:06:53,968 --> 02:06:55,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely disagree with Kohler.

1767
02:06:56,350 --> 02:07:02,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I see more people who have DSs than they do PSPs.

1768
02:07:02,533 --> 02:07:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm seeing more guys in their early 20s who have PSPs.

1769
02:07:07,895 --> 02:07:08,636
[SPEAKER_01]: That I will say.

1770
02:07:09,356 --> 02:07:12,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get it 25 and up.

1771
02:07:12,758 --> 02:07:18,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get kids and all kinds of... I think more people and more families have a DS.

1772
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:20,482
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I see it.

1773
02:07:21,943 --> 02:07:29,448
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother and sister-in-law, Dan's brother and sister, they each have their own DS.

1774
02:07:30,248 --> 02:07:32,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're little, but then again, my...

1775
02:07:34,192 --> 02:07:35,193
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1776
02:07:53,729 --> 02:07:58,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I each have our own DS, but we have one PSP.

1777
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:12,310
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1778
02:08:30,455 --> 02:08:31,116
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1779
02:08:57,921 --> 02:09:08,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But the PSP does not have a lot for that same casual, I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while market.

1780
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of great puzzlers, casual games outside of Luminous.

1781
02:09:13,775 --> 02:09:15,356
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie thing didn't work out so well.

1782
02:09:16,177 --> 02:09:22,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless you have somebody that really wants that all-in-one system, and I don't know, if you held up, like if I were a parent,

1783
02:09:23,035 --> 02:09:23,335
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more.

1784
02:09:23,355 --> 02:09:23,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

1785
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:51,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I should add that I am a DS owner over 12.

1786
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:59,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not own a PSP currently, but would eagerly buy one should any of the rumors regarding the PSP2 second analog stick be realized.

1787
02:09:59,935 --> 02:10:03,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I own both a 360 and a PS3 and enjoy them equally.

1788
02:10:03,897 --> 02:10:08,560
[SPEAKER_01]: In an ideal world, all three companies will do well and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming public.

1789
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:09,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think?

1790
02:10:09,821 --> 02:10:13,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Is his comment just so much as claptrap, or is he right?

1791
02:10:13,583 --> 02:10:18,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And must all adult DS owners hang their heads in shame for being attached to a kiddie system?

1792
02:10:18,926 --> 02:10:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously say that in jest.

1793
02:10:20,648 --> 02:10:23,209
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the games are fun, what does it really matter?

1794
02:10:23,309 --> 02:10:27,272
[SPEAKER_01]: How much fun can we have even with a speak-and-spell bottle of vodka and grown-up vocabulary?

1795
02:10:28,753 --> 02:10:30,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm not going to say I ain't done yet.

1796
02:10:30,794 --> 02:10:31,234
[SPEAKER_06]: F-U-C...

1797
02:10:33,763 --> 02:10:36,645
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I want to add that I like the new site design.

1798
02:10:36,785 --> 02:10:40,927
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time coming, but it looks sweet and seems to load faster than the old one.

1799
02:10:41,327 --> 02:10:42,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, Deakman!

1800
02:10:42,856 --> 02:10:44,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice decision to keep the orange background too.

1801
02:10:45,438 --> 02:10:49,841
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a complaint, it's that the episodes on iTunes seem to be a week or two off.

1802
02:10:50,261 --> 02:10:51,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week's episode was from February 8th.

1803
02:10:52,063 --> 02:10:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th or later?

1804
02:10:54,504 --> 02:10:56,126
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's getting caught up now.

1805
02:10:56,206 --> 02:11:01,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I was having some problems because now when I do a podcast, I have to do it in two different places as opposed to before.

1806
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:05,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was just confusing me a little bit, but I'm good now.

1807
02:11:05,132 --> 02:11:10,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another one up today, and another one is edited and ready to go, and then we'll be all caught up.

1808
02:11:10,396 --> 02:11:11,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited.

1809
02:11:12,299 --> 02:11:16,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I keep saying we're all going to get caught up, but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack.

1810
02:11:16,726 --> 02:11:17,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a good thing.

1811
02:11:17,648 --> 02:11:18,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, overall, it's a great thing.

1812
02:11:19,451 --> 02:11:20,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're getting back on track.

1813
02:11:27,206 --> 02:11:28,187
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep up the good work.

1814
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:30,007
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, a loyal listener, Raymond.

1815
02:11:30,067 --> 02:11:30,408
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

1816
02:11:30,908 --> 02:11:32,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I, too, quit WoW after two years.

1817
02:11:32,909 --> 02:11:35,610
[SPEAKER_01]: One level 80, two level 70s.

1818
02:11:36,671 --> 02:11:44,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't regret the time I spent there, but the opportunities are now open to me to experience all different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest V to Flower to Gears of War 2.

1819
02:11:44,895 --> 02:11:46,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It was liberating and daunting.

1820
02:11:46,836 --> 02:11:47,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting combination.

1821
02:11:48,617 --> 02:11:53,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So many new games, so many old games to catch up on, and only so many hours available in the day.

1822
02:11:53,479 --> 02:11:54,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still open to MMOs, though.

1823
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:58,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of the superhero games or the Star Wars one will entice me back.

1824
02:11:58,682 --> 02:11:59,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It all depends on the community.

1825
02:12:00,262 --> 02:12:01,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Play Star Trek with us!

1826
02:12:02,603 --> 02:12:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that closing statement is pretty much essentially one of the big reasons why I quit WoW, right there.

1827
02:12:09,446 --> 02:12:11,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now allowed me to play other games.

1828
02:12:12,047 --> 02:12:12,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1829
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:15,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Same type of deal, dude.

1830
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:20,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably would never have played Flower or some of these other games I've been playing if I had a raid to do tonight.

1831
02:12:20,867 --> 02:12:21,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1832
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:23,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1833
02:12:24,795 --> 02:12:29,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to be tied to an MMO the way I'd be tied to, like, my job.

1834
02:12:46,442 --> 02:12:50,544
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to send an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.

1835
02:12:50,884 --> 02:13:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take your calls in just a little bit, but first we have a few more quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line and get towards closing out our show for tonight.

1836
02:13:00,449 --> 02:13:00,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki.

1837
02:13:02,029 --> 02:13:06,571
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some new download content for a rather old Command & Conquer game.

1838
02:13:06,911 --> 02:13:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Command & Conquer Generals is getting a brand new download pack.

1839
02:13:13,214 --> 02:13:16,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's Black Sheep, The Lost Mission.

1840
02:13:19,877 --> 02:13:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting that this game is from 2003 and they're doing some download content for it now.

1841
02:13:28,919 --> 02:13:29,679
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1842
02:13:57,302 --> 02:14:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're supposed to crop dust a town that's been corrupted beyond salvation.

1843
02:14:04,890 --> 02:14:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1844
02:14:05,765 --> 02:14:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 5

1845
02:14:31,045 --> 02:14:41,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have it a long long time ago but I can't find the CD which sucks because if I could then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website or whatever now and just download it I think.

1846
02:14:43,387 --> 02:14:46,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy Final Fantasy Final Fantasy

1847
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:06,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1848
02:15:24,075 --> 02:15:36,081
[SPEAKER_05]: The defendants altogether issued a joint statement saying that they regret that they have sold these copies to consumers and they would have never imported the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix would respond so aggressively to stop them.

1849
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:38,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They will never make this mistake again.

1850
02:15:38,962 --> 02:15:39,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1851
02:15:39,783 --> 02:15:51,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you anything this Final Fantasy XIII poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it on JustinTV, but right there where I'm pointing, it's behind the new penguins thing, that poster is a Final Fantasy XIII poster and I bet you anything

1852
02:15:52,589 --> 02:15:53,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bootleg.

1853
02:15:54,129 --> 02:15:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's a bootleg.

1854
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:59,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably from one of these companies that just got the $600,000 judgment.

1855
02:15:59,791 --> 02:16:02,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what Dark Tatsuya says in chat.

1856
02:16:02,271 --> 02:16:03,411
[SPEAKER_05]: $600,000 judgment sounds like a game.

1857
02:16:04,652 --> 02:16:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy XIII, who knows.

1858
02:16:07,872 --> 02:16:16,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy products and selling them for your own profit, you might want to stop before you get the next SmackDown.

1859
02:16:18,214 --> 02:16:20,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, DarkSakura, are you forging any Final Fantasy goods?

1860
02:16:22,382 --> 02:16:22,682
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1861
02:16:23,062 --> 02:16:24,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well then you have nothing to worry about.

1862
02:16:25,063 --> 02:16:25,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But how about another story?

1863
02:16:26,683 --> 02:16:27,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could do that.

1864
02:16:29,044 --> 02:16:31,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox Live Arcade Awards.

1865
02:16:33,565 --> 02:16:39,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can vote and voting stops on Tuesday, March 10th.

1866
02:16:39,506 --> 02:16:44,268
[SPEAKER_01]: The voting starts on March 3rd, so you've got that window to cast your vote for what you like best.

1867
02:16:44,988 --> 02:16:49,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got here's your, I guess, sort of virtual sample ballot.

1868
02:16:50,029 --> 02:16:57,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Best overall arcade game is Braid, Castle Crashers, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, or Portal Still Alive.

1869
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:02,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Best original game would be Castle Crashers and Plus, is that it?

1870
02:17:03,726 --> 02:17:06,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Braid, Penny Arcade Episode 1, Schizoid, Age of Booty.

1871
02:17:07,771 --> 02:17:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Family Game, Boogie Bunnies, Rugu, A Kingdom for Calflings, Lost Cities, and Medias Wars.

1872
02:17:15,613 --> 02:17:23,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Co-op, Multiplayer, Castle Crashers, Schizoid Bionic Commando Rearmed, and Plus, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2.

1873

1874
02:17:34,858 --> 02:17:50,170
[SPEAKER_01]: ResHD, Portal Still Alive, Best Innovation in Xbox Live Arcade, Braid for Time Travel, Kingdom for Keflings, Use of Avatars, Fable 2, Pub Games, Retail Game Integration, N Plus, Level Sharing, and Duke Nukem 3D Dynamic Replay.

[SPEAKER_01]: Best Graphics, Street Fighter 2, Geometry Wars, Braid, Castle Crashers, Bionic Commando, Best Classic Remake Game, Bionic Commando, Street Fighter 2, Mega Man 9, Galaga Legions, and ResHD.

1876
02:18:05,487 --> 02:18:07,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So go cast a vote then.

1877
02:18:07,468 --> 02:18:08,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote for RezHD a lot.

1878
02:18:08,588 --> 02:18:11,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I don't think our listeners should be voting in this poll.

1879
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know why?

1880
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:14,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a right to say this.

1881
02:18:14,191 --> 02:18:21,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm looking at the OLR March Madness thing going on, and apparently Tetris is currently beating Super Metroid, which is stupid.

1882
02:18:21,494 --> 02:18:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this is happening mostly in part to the whole debacle from last year.

1883
02:18:24,956 --> 02:18:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew this was going to happen.

1884
02:18:26,057 --> 02:18:27,177
[SPEAKER_05]: People want their revenge on me.

1885
02:18:28,358 --> 02:18:29,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1886
02:18:30,503 --> 02:18:30,743
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

1887
02:18:51,604 --> 02:18:53,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to vote for Tetris now.

1888
02:18:53,945 --> 02:18:55,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You're such an asshole.

1889
02:18:55,785 --> 02:18:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

1890
02:18:57,466 --> 02:19:03,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not voting for Tetris because, you know what, as much as I like Tetris, Super Metroid gets my vote.

1891
02:19:04,708 --> 02:19:05,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1892
02:19:06,608 --> 02:19:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Super Metroid pulls ahead!

1893
02:19:09,569 --> 02:19:10,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright!

1894
02:19:10,129 --> 02:19:11,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, high five, Loki!

1895
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:12,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good job, Loki!

1896
02:19:17,406 --> 02:19:17,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

1897
02:19:18,687 --> 02:19:21,209
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight, Loki.

1898
02:19:21,809 --> 02:19:22,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1899
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, I understand.

1900
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:27,713
[SPEAKER_04]: More Grand Theft Auto possibly on the PSP.

1901
02:19:27,773 --> 02:19:30,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Sony is in talks with Rockstar.

1902
02:19:30,715 --> 02:19:35,079
[SPEAKER_04]: They want some more games for their PSP system and you know what, I'm down with that.

1903
02:19:35,239 --> 02:19:37,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some San Andreas stories going on.

1904
02:19:39,244 --> 02:19:39,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1905
02:20:09,249 --> 02:20:15,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Be honest, I mean, the Giant Town Wars stuff, it's going to be good, but it's no PSP, you know, Grand Theft Auto games.

1906
02:20:15,171 --> 02:20:21,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were, you know, just like the PlayStation 2 ones, and I hope they do another one.

1907
02:20:21,933 --> 02:20:22,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1908
02:20:22,274 --> 02:20:25,395
[SPEAKER_05]: But is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP, Loki?

1909
02:20:25,435 --> 02:20:26,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.

1910
02:20:26,515 --> 02:20:27,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really?

1911
02:20:27,055 --> 02:20:29,156
[SPEAKER_04]: We played the PSP version for months.

1912
02:20:29,916 --> 02:20:31,117
[SPEAKER_04]: The multiplayer was fun.

1913
02:20:32,637 --> 02:20:34,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, it is something I would play on my PSP.

1914
02:20:36,033 --> 02:20:36,897
[SPEAKER_04]: for long hours.

1915
02:20:37,901 --> 02:20:39,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also fun to hack apart.

1916
02:20:41,018 --> 02:20:41,598
[SPEAKER_04]: for long hours.

1917
02:20:41,998 --> 02:20:45,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see a Saints Row on PSP, but no, that wouldn't happen.

1918
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:47,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even Crackdown on PSP.

1919
02:20:47,201 --> 02:20:47,761
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

1920
02:20:47,901 --> 02:20:49,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything sandbox-ish.

1921
02:20:50,022 --> 02:20:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, Atari or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver, make another Driver game.

1922
02:20:55,145 --> 02:20:56,765
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to put any effort into it.

1923
02:20:56,805 --> 02:20:57,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make another Driver game.

1924
02:20:57,766 --> 02:20:59,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it crap like the last one.

1925
02:21:00,347 --> 02:21:03,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, their last game I didn't really play, but make it like Driver 3.

1926
02:21:04,149 --> 02:21:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Just reissue Driver 3.

1927
02:21:05,989 --> 02:21:06,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Make no changes.

1928
02:21:09,614 --> 02:21:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and finally tonight, this is something interesting.

1929
02:21:14,176 --> 02:21:21,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, a 60-year-old woman got held hostage at gunpoint for 10 hours in Brazil this week.

1930
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:25,962
[SPEAKER_05]: This was reported from Globo.com, apparently broke this story.

1931
02:21:26,402 --> 02:21:30,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the part that makes it interesting and somewhat game-related.

1932
02:21:30,564 --> 02:21:35,947
[SPEAKER_05]: The gun that was used, a Sega Light Phaser from the old Sega Master System.

1933
02:21:36,547 --> 02:21:38,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil.

1934
02:21:38,788 --> 02:21:40,609
[SPEAKER_01]: The Master System is still marketed in Brazil.

1935
02:21:40,649 --> 02:21:46,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, so no surprise that the Sega Light Phaser was the light gun of choice.

1936
02:21:46,572 --> 02:21:50,054
[SPEAKER_05]: However, dude tried to hold somebody up with a light gun.

1937
02:21:52,215 --> 02:21:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't figure out that this was a fake-looking gun?

1938
02:21:55,336 --> 02:21:56,197
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 60-year-old woman.

1939
02:21:57,377 --> 02:22:03,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The man did release the hostage, good for him, negotiated with police, and there you go.

1940
02:22:04,301 --> 02:22:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1941
02:22:07,081 --> 02:22:14,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, idiots like this, anybody that uses video game equipment to hold people hostage deserves to have the FUs of the week dedicated to them.

1942
02:22:30,649 --> 02:22:38,812
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU goes to this site for not recognizing my password or giving me any way to immediately change my password.

1943
02:22:39,813 --> 02:22:40,093
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

1944
02:22:42,214 --> 02:22:44,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.

1945
02:22:44,234 --> 02:22:45,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been in a pretty good mood.

1946
02:22:45,815 --> 02:22:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I don't know.

1947
02:22:47,056 --> 02:22:49,056
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow.

1948
02:22:49,136 --> 02:22:50,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, you know, I like my job and all.

1949
02:22:50,777 --> 02:22:52,058
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm just lazy.

1950
02:22:52,318 --> 02:22:53,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather stay at home than play video games.

1951
02:22:54,358 --> 02:22:54,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So FU to that.

1952
02:22:55,379 --> 02:22:55,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1953
02:22:56,599 --> 02:22:58,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, FU to the rain still.

1954
02:22:58,615 --> 02:23:02,617
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, the way the weather patterns are, they're starting on Sundays.

1955
02:23:03,177 --> 02:23:04,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Always Sundays.

1956
02:23:04,458 --> 02:23:06,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Always the day I'm going to play Airsoft.

1957
02:23:07,059 --> 02:23:07,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1958
02:23:07,919 --> 02:23:08,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Why must you do this?

1959
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,501
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to be honest, I don't really care too much anymore, though.

1960
02:23:11,781 --> 02:23:13,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially after this week being sick.

1961
02:23:14,882 --> 02:23:19,825
[SPEAKER_04]: But it still sucks, you know, that I've been waiting for like over a month now to play.

1962
02:23:20,545 --> 02:23:24,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, it's not going to be any different for the next few weeks either, so...

1963
02:23:25,663 --> 02:23:26,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, stupid rain.

1964
02:23:26,824 --> 02:23:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: At least rain during the week.

1965
02:23:28,705 --> 02:23:30,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the weekends off, okay?

1966
02:23:31,347 --> 02:23:34,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You can rain all week long, but just give me Sunday.

1967
02:23:34,529 --> 02:23:35,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only day I want.

1968
02:23:36,631 --> 02:23:39,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we come up with some sort of compromise, Mother Nature?

1969
02:23:39,173 --> 02:23:39,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1970
02:23:41,866 --> 02:23:42,246
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1971
02:23:43,867 --> 02:23:46,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice and short FUs of the Week segment tonight.

1972
02:23:46,107 --> 02:23:46,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1973
02:23:47,288 --> 02:23:50,469
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we open up the Skype line and take some calls?

1974

[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I noticed this on the website.

1987
02:24:50,019 --> 02:24:56,702
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the neat new features now that we have more people that know how to update the website and are excited to use it to update things.

1988
02:24:57,663 --> 02:25:03,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that DarkTetsuya started the indie spotlight on the site, which was kind of an idea we were kicking around.

1989
02:25:03,245 --> 02:25:12,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the first game he highlighted, of course, La Mulana, because I know he's dropped thousands and thousands of hours into the MSX wannabe game.

1990
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:16,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, any hints as to what's coming up soon on the indie spotlight?

1991
02:25:19,422 --> 02:25:21,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking of doing a version.

1992
02:25:21,083 --> 02:25:22,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That one keeps coming up.

1993
02:25:23,865 --> 02:25:24,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1994
02:25:24,446 --> 02:25:24,726
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1995
02:25:25,166 --> 02:25:26,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's my question.

1996
02:25:26,447 --> 02:25:28,849
[SPEAKER_05]: We might have some indie developers that listen to this show.

1997
02:25:28,969 --> 02:25:32,551
[SPEAKER_05]: How can they get themselves featured on Orange Lounge Radio Indie Spotlight?

1998
02:25:34,673 --> 02:25:38,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Just drop me a line at darktotsuya at gmail.com.

1999
02:25:39,196 --> 02:25:39,436
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2000
02:25:39,476 --> 02:25:41,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a thread in the forums too, right?

2001
02:25:42,778 --> 02:25:42,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2002
02:25:44,039 --> 02:25:44,259
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2003
02:25:44,299 --> 02:25:45,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anything else you want to plug?

2004
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:46,741
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

2005
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:48,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Any video games you've been playing lately?

2006
02:25:50,277 --> 02:25:51,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to need some speed.

2007
02:25:51,518 --> 02:25:54,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to check out the world online if it launches here in the U.S.

2008
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:54,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2009
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:57,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not on Steam.

2010
02:25:57,422 --> 02:25:57,762
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's it.

2011
02:26:17,890 --> 02:26:18,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for reminding me.

2012
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:20,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have plugged it last week when it went up.

2013
02:26:20,770 --> 02:26:21,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2014
02:26:21,891 --> 02:26:29,673
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check that out, Indie Spotlight, week one featuring La Mulana, which has almost become a bit of an OLR inside joke.

2015
02:26:29,713 --> 02:26:31,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So check it out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2016
02:26:31,493 --> 02:26:31,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2017
02:26:32,794 --> 02:26:32,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2018
02:26:32,994 --> 02:26:33,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Joe.

2019
02:26:35,154 --> 02:26:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2020
02:26:35,915 --> 02:26:36,755
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2021
02:26:36,775 --> 02:26:38,695
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.

2022
02:26:39,556 --> 02:26:41,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Or on Skype, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

2023
02:26:41,936 --> 02:26:43,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got another call already coming in.

2024
02:26:43,297 --> 02:26:44,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2025
02:26:44,357 --> 02:26:44,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2026
02:26:45,546 --> 02:26:48,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Ranma, and I finally made it through after like two weeks.

2027
02:26:48,368 --> 02:26:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's been kind of crazy the past couple weeks, but that's okay.

2028
02:26:51,131 --> 02:26:54,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have to take calls from different people, you know, we gotta mix it up a little bit.

2029
02:26:54,594 --> 02:26:55,214
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

2030
02:26:55,254 --> 02:26:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Baron.

2031
02:26:56,576 --> 02:26:58,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, I want you to know something.

2032
02:26:58,537 --> 02:26:58,757
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2033
02:26:59,618 --> 02:27:02,040
[SPEAKER_03]: You almost killed me about two hours ago.

2034
02:27:02,741 --> 02:27:03,081
[SPEAKER_05]: How?

2035
02:27:04,322 --> 02:27:06,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Your comment about Foodie Monster.

2036
02:27:06,264 --> 02:27:09,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I was eating chips and drinking soda when you said that.

2037
02:27:10,137 --> 02:27:12,318
[SPEAKER_05]: The sad thing is I don't even think he's listening tonight.

2038
02:27:12,939 --> 02:27:16,621
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not, and no one's made a comment to Twitter about it to him either.

2039
02:27:16,821 --> 02:27:23,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully somebody will bring it to his attention that he ought to listen to tonight's show, because I'm sure I'll get a nasty Twitter email about it.

2040
02:27:24,847 --> 02:27:26,368
[SPEAKER_05]: If no one else does it, I will.

2041
02:27:27,008 --> 02:27:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you get to it.

2042
02:27:28,749 --> 02:27:30,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, no cons this weekend?

2043
02:27:31,551 --> 02:27:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done with the cons for the month.

2044
02:27:33,413 --> 02:27:34,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I did Comic-Con.

2045
02:27:34,413 --> 02:27:35,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I did Catacomb.

2046
02:27:35,654 --> 02:27:37,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I did Wicked Winter Ren Faire.

2047
02:27:37,255 --> 02:27:39,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on break until the end of March.

2048
02:27:40,745 --> 02:27:42,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice long break for you.

2049
02:27:42,987 --> 02:27:44,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

2050
02:27:44,328 --> 02:27:46,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of cons, have you been to Video Games Live?

2051
02:27:46,350 --> 02:27:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a mini-con.

2052
02:27:48,004 --> 02:27:48,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

2053
02:27:48,724 --> 02:27:54,386
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came around my way, I just didn't have the money, and to be perfectly honest, I wasn't really that interested at the time.

2054
02:27:54,706 --> 02:27:59,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I would say, they do a costume contest, and there were only like three people that dressed up.

2055
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:06,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, if you did your Black Luigi thing, or heck, any of your video game related costumes, I think you'd have a good shot to win like a DS or something like that.

2056
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:08,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check that out.

2057
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:09,311
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

2058
02:28:09,511 --> 02:28:10,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you could do very well.

2059
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of conventions, when you talked about the Square Enix swords, it would not be surprising that I still see them at the conventions or whatever's left.

2060
02:28:20,348 --> 02:28:22,170
[SPEAKER_03]: The price would just go double to triple.

2061
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:27,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, they're cheaper than getting them done, commissioned by actual prop makers.

2062
02:28:28,135 --> 02:28:28,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

2063
02:28:29,556 --> 02:28:30,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

2064
02:28:31,098 --> 02:28:31,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2065
02:28:31,698 --> 02:28:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this true?

2066
02:28:32,379 --> 02:28:35,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Breslow in chat saying you are going to SakuraCon.

2067
02:28:35,201 --> 02:28:36,522
[SPEAKER_05]: True or false?

2068
02:28:36,582 --> 02:28:37,143
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

2069
02:28:37,864 --> 02:28:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

2070
02:28:39,338 --> 02:28:40,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to go to SakuraCon.

2071
02:28:40,938 --> 02:28:43,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Seattle, but I also want to go to PAX.

2072
02:28:43,459 --> 02:28:44,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

2073
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:47,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And flights aren't always necessarily that cheap.

2074
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:48,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

2075
02:28:48,601 --> 02:28:50,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be able to come to SakuraCon.

2076
02:28:51,161 --> 02:28:54,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if Bress Lowell will let me crash his place on the couch or something.

2077
02:28:56,043 --> 02:28:57,883
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you don't violate him in his sleep.

2078
02:28:58,243 --> 02:28:58,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.

2079
02:29:00,084 --> 02:29:00,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be good.

2080
02:29:00,624 --> 02:29:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't violate me in my sleep.

2081
02:29:04,285 --> 02:29:05,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you telling me?

2082
02:29:05,726 --> 02:29:07,126
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs to not violate me.

2083
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:12,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you guys to know that you guys covered an article

2084
02:29:29,608 --> 02:29:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week that you covered three years ago.

2085
02:29:32,669 --> 02:29:36,811
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sometimes those oddities happen, but what was the article, just for fun?

2086
02:29:37,451 --> 02:29:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy X port on the NES.

2087
02:29:40,912 --> 02:29:41,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2088
02:29:41,492 --> 02:29:42,433
[SPEAKER_05]: That had come up before?

2089
02:29:42,453 --> 02:29:43,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was recent.

2090
02:29:43,273 --> 02:29:47,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was a VII port on the DS a few years ago.

2091
02:29:47,315 --> 02:29:50,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VII, but I didn't remember a X port.

2092
02:29:50,636 --> 02:29:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we did it.

2093
02:29:51,436 --> 02:29:53,317
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was X, because someone posted it.

2094
02:29:53,337 --> 02:29:55,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I followed the link, and I'm like, this is X, yeah.

2095
02:29:56,644 --> 02:29:57,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2096
02:29:57,545 --> 02:29:58,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, well, it happens.

2097
02:29:58,905 --> 02:29:59,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

2098
02:30:00,086 --> 02:30:03,488
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're not perfect, and the show's been going a long time.

2099
02:30:03,568 --> 02:30:06,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't remember every story we've ever done.

2100
02:30:06,089 --> 02:30:06,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna happen.

2101
02:30:07,650 --> 02:30:08,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2102
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:10,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I had no problem with that.

2103
02:30:10,051 --> 02:30:10,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

2104
02:30:11,152 --> 02:30:15,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, and of course, you know, we don't have the same listeners now that we had three years ago, either.

2105
02:30:15,574 --> 02:30:20,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, we have some of the faithfuls, like yourself, and there's some others that have been listening to the show for a long, long time.

2106
02:30:20,517 --> 02:30:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a lot of new faces, too, so...

2107
02:30:23,208 --> 02:30:24,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

2108
02:30:24,629 --> 02:30:31,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, at some point, DarkSakura might actually run out of classic games to talk about.

2109
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:32,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have to figure something out.

2110
02:30:32,891 --> 02:30:33,911
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not likely going to happen.

2111
02:30:34,051 --> 02:30:35,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt that.

2112
02:30:35,992 --> 02:30:36,332
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2113
02:30:36,852 --> 02:30:37,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Be a long time.

2114
02:30:38,452 --> 02:30:38,752
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2115
02:30:38,832 --> 02:30:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ranma, any other thoughts for us before you get to another call?

2116
02:30:42,526 --> 02:30:54,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Last thing, in regards to the whole match game debacle from a month ago, when you guys have the next contest, my group, Anime Jam Session, we want to donate a couple of prizes for the winners.

2117
02:30:55,558 --> 02:30:56,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet!

2118
02:30:57,119 --> 02:30:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, we'll make that happen.

2119
02:30:58,601 --> 02:31:02,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when we'll play match game again, but we'll try to get some guests to come in studio and we'll make that happen.

2120
02:31:03,476 --> 02:31:08,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I posted a link in the chat room for these shirts that we made called Grand Theft Chocobo.

2121
02:31:09,721 --> 02:31:10,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2122
02:31:10,282 --> 02:31:11,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that shirt.

2123
02:31:11,843 --> 02:31:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It's available in Xbox 360 White and PlayStation 3 Black.

2124
02:31:16,047 --> 02:31:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

2125
02:31:16,807 --> 02:31:17,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice pitch.

2126
02:31:17,388 --> 02:31:17,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2127
02:31:17,628 --> 02:31:18,009
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2128
02:31:18,249 --> 02:31:19,490
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the website where I can order one?

2129
02:31:20,431 --> 02:31:22,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret-Shop.com.

2130
02:31:22,572 --> 02:31:23,073
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2131
02:31:23,974 --> 02:31:26,015
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2132
02:31:26,035 --> 02:31:26,876
[SPEAKER_05]: But take care, buddy, okay?

2133
02:31:27,337 --> 02:31:27,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you too.

2134
02:31:28,037 --> 02:31:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you.

2135
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:28,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2136
02:31:28,938 --> 02:31:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2137
02:31:29,919 --> 02:31:30,179
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2138
02:31:32,601 --> 02:31:46,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Kart, according to Guinness Book of World Records, has compiled the top 50 console games of all time.

2139
02:31:47,033 --> 02:31:53,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And Super Mario Kart, apparently, has the longest legacy and the biggest impact on video games in all of history.

2140
02:31:53,758 --> 02:31:57,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is according to, again, the Guinness Book of World Records.

2141
02:31:57,441 --> 02:31:58,622
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get out of video games.

2142
02:31:58,962 --> 02:31:59,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2143
02:31:59,522 --> 02:32:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: 2, Tetris 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, Super Mario World, Zelda Ocarina of Time at No.

2144
02:32:05,365 --> 02:32:06,986
[SPEAKER_05]: 5, all the way down to OutRun 2 at No.

2145
02:32:07,006 --> 02:32:06,986
50.

2146
02:32:07,126 --> 02:32:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, seriously, Guinness, no one gives a shit about your book anymore.

2147
02:32:10,727 --> 02:32:12,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I love Guinness when it's booze.

2148
02:32:12,308 --> 02:32:16,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yes, I give a shit about their book anymore, so sorry, you're wrong.

2149
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:17,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But even about video games?

2150
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:19,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, actually.

2151
02:32:20,532 --> 02:32:24,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's fantastic that they're still keeping track of all of this.

2152
02:32:24,434 --> 02:32:24,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.

2153
02:32:25,731 --> 02:32:30,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I beg to differ if they're still using Twin Galaxies to do it, but we'll save that for another night.

2154
02:32:30,274 --> 02:32:35,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for using Twin Galaxies, but I mean, but I still think that the Guinness book is fantastic.

2155
02:32:36,579 --> 02:32:37,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we got another call waiting on the line.

2156
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:38,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2157
02:32:39,001 --> 02:32:39,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2158
02:32:40,662 --> 02:32:42,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator.

2159
02:32:42,343 --> 02:32:43,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Spazinator.

2160
02:32:43,064 --> 02:32:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2161
02:32:44,985 --> 02:32:45,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, two things.

2162
02:32:46,306 --> 02:32:52,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just want to say thank you to Loki for showing off Noby Noby Boy last week.

2163
02:32:53,011 --> 02:32:53,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

2164
02:32:53,720 --> 02:33:00,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to him showing the footage of that, I ended up buying the game during the middle of the week.

2165
02:33:00,688 --> 02:33:03,671
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite fun, so thank you to him.

2166
02:33:04,324 --> 02:33:08,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've heard kind of some mixed reviews on that, so I'm glad to hear you liked it after all.

2167
02:33:08,806 --> 02:33:09,887
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem, we tried to do that.

2168
02:33:09,907 --> 02:33:25,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we've got the Justin.TV thing hooked up pretty cool, where even though I think watching a radio show being taped is the most boring thing in the world, at least the audio now goes out over Justin.TV really well, and we do those little breaks in between that seem to work out really well for the audience over there.

2169
02:33:25,555 --> 02:33:30,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And it opens up our show to a new group of people, because there's a whole vast...

2170
02:33:31,778 --> 02:33:37,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as the second thing, I just wanted to respond to that one email that you read earlier today.

2171
02:33:37,642 --> 02:33:45,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember his name, but he was asking about advice regarding Final Fantasy XI.

2172
02:33:45,907 --> 02:33:46,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2173
02:33:59,761 --> 02:34:06,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically, I agree with a lot of your criticisms of Final Fantasy XI.

2174
02:34:06,583 --> 02:34:12,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the game is not perfect by a long shot, but still, it is pretty fun.

2175
02:34:13,705 --> 02:34:16,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing it for just barely over three years now.

2176
02:34:17,646 --> 02:34:26,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that this person get into a good link shell, which is the game's equivalent to a build.

2177
02:34:27,706 --> 02:34:32,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's, uh, you know, the game is designed to be very social.

2178
02:34:33,929 --> 02:34:42,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so even if you're just sitting around waiting to get into a party, you know, you can always shoot the breeze with your friends in the windshield.

2179
02:34:43,859 --> 02:34:44,640
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're waiting.

2180
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:18,240
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one thing that draws you to Final Fantasy XI besides the people.

2181
02:35:18,421 --> 02:35:21,842
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it about Final Fantasy XI, the game, that keeps you coming back?

2182
02:35:23,462 --> 02:35:32,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I've been a pretty big fan of the series as a whole for a number of years.

2183
02:35:32,505 --> 02:35:37,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured, you know, at the time, you know, this was the next one in the series.

2184
02:35:37,946 --> 02:35:39,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, get that started now.

2185
02:35:40,413 --> 02:35:49,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but since I'm primarily a console gamer, my selection of MMOs are kind of limited.

2186
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:58,406
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that I'm familiar with and heard of is the PlayStation 2 version of EverQuest.

2187
02:35:59,226 --> 02:36:06,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was alright, but Final Fantasy XI, in my opinion, is a whole lot better.

2188
02:36:07,172 --> 02:36:07,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

2189
02:36:08,437 --> 02:36:38,048
[SPEAKER_00]: and plus, you know, you can play as a black mage, you know, which both of my characters are and it's just so much fun nuking the shit out, you know, the beastmen in Final Fantasy XI, you know, whether you're casting fire or arrow or thunder or whatever, you know, just like doing, you know, castling, casting spells every two or three seconds, you know,

2190
02:36:39,474 --> 02:36:45,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, you know, I can see that because Final Fantasy XI was kind of a console game.

2191
02:36:45,215 --> 02:36:46,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was made for the PlayStation 2.

2192
02:36:47,176 --> 02:36:51,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people here in America played on the PC, but most people over in Japan played on PlayStation 2.

2193
02:36:51,897 --> 02:36:54,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people here in America played on PlayStation 2 as well.

2194
02:36:54,357 --> 02:36:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It is one of the few MMOs very accessible through a console.

2195
02:36:57,478 --> 02:36:58,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I can kind of see that.

2196
02:36:58,718 --> 02:37:03,639
[SPEAKER_05]: WoW is missing a significant user base from not having a version of it on consoles.

2197
02:37:03,719 --> 02:37:06,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I couldn't see WoW on a console, so I get it.

2198
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:10,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Spazinator, we're going to have to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I hope your sales pitch works.

2199
02:37:10,681 --> 02:37:11,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it will.

2200
02:37:11,261 --> 02:37:17,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Acidic Vampire will at least spend his one month in Final Fantasy XI, and hopefully he'll stay a little longer after that.

2201
02:37:17,423 --> 02:37:20,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Spazinator, thank you so much for calling, and have a good one, okay?

2202
02:37:21,725 --> 02:37:22,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, you too.

2203
02:37:22,365 --> 02:37:22,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.

2204
02:37:23,265 --> 02:37:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2205
02:37:24,786 --> 02:37:25,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2206
02:37:28,087 --> 02:37:33,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2207
02:37:34,128 --> 02:37:35,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2208
02:37:35,369 --> 02:37:35,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2209
02:37:37,097 --> 02:37:37,497
[SPEAKER_07]: and DSMaster25.

2210
02:37:38,358 --> 02:37:39,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hello, DSMaster.

2211
02:37:39,938 --> 02:37:40,319
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

2212
02:37:41,919 --> 02:37:42,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

2213
02:37:43,380 --> 02:37:46,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a few new games and a few new features on.

2214
02:37:47,182 --> 02:37:47,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2215
02:37:48,303 --> 02:37:51,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if something's weird with the audio we're getting.

2216
02:37:51,284 --> 02:37:52,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little hard to understand.

2217
02:37:52,785 --> 02:37:54,606
[SPEAKER_05]: May I want to get a little bit away from your mic?

2218
02:37:54,626 --> 02:37:55,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's up with that.

2219
02:37:55,386 --> 02:37:56,426
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

2220
02:37:56,506 --> 02:37:57,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have some new games you want to review.

2221
02:37:57,987 --> 02:37:58,327
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

2222
02:37:58,387 --> 02:37:58,768
[SPEAKER_05]: What games?

2223
02:38:00,188 --> 02:38:04,130
[SPEAKER_07]: GTA, Liberty City and Tony Stark's Project 8.

2224
02:38:04,891 --> 02:38:05,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, tell us about them.

2225
02:38:07,014 --> 02:38:10,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever you say, it's actually my first time playing it, even though I'm only 16.

2226
02:38:11,037 --> 02:38:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I got ahold of it on Amazon, my debit card.

2227
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:20,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what I like is if we play it, it's just all humans, but a lot more.

2228
02:38:22,424 --> 02:38:24,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I like rolling around in the paint and blowing stuff up.

2229
02:38:27,588 --> 02:38:29,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Blowing stuff up in games is always fun.

2230
02:38:30,816 --> 02:38:33,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was the other game you played besides Grand Theft Auto?

2231
02:38:33,177 --> 02:38:35,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Hawk's Project 8 Tell us a little more about this game.

2232
02:38:36,638 --> 02:38:38,919
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's not ringing a bell for some reason.

2233
02:38:39,399 --> 02:38:39,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically...

2234
02:39:00,407 --> 02:39:03,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like all your Tony Rock games, but a little bit more of a challenge.

2235
02:39:05,273 --> 02:39:09,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you had to keep pushing up to keep your skater going.

2236
02:39:09,559 --> 02:39:12,562
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no auto-kick option whatsoever in the game.

2237
02:39:16,127 --> 02:39:16,908
[SPEAKER_05]: What game is this?

2238
02:39:18,359 --> 02:39:20,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Hawk's Project D. It's a little bit more challenging, I will say.

2239
02:39:20,939 --> 02:39:23,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be more of a challenge for me to buy it used than I buy most games used.

2240
02:39:48,416 --> 02:39:51,459
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes this game different from the other Tony Hawk games?

2241
02:39:53,380 --> 02:39:59,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, basically, more area to explore.

2242
02:39:59,686 --> 02:40:05,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a free realm game, kind of like American Wasteland, which the PSP never got.

2243
02:40:07,812 --> 02:40:12,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the DS got American Wasteland, but the DS never got Project 8.

2244
02:40:13,377 --> 02:40:16,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, there is another game I got...

2245
02:40:17,225 --> 02:40:27,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Revolution for DS That must be interesting, Rock Revolution on the DS.

2246
02:40:27,069 --> 02:40:28,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago.

2247
02:40:28,789 --> 02:40:29,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Sauce reviewed it.

2248
02:40:30,290 --> 02:40:34,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still tempted to get it for $20 on 360, but then I'm like, oh, that's $20.

2249
02:40:34,391 --> 02:40:35,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I could, like, buy lunch.

2250
02:40:37,052 --> 02:40:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the DS version has the singing in it, which the consoles are missing.

2251
02:40:43,335 --> 02:40:44,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so weird.

2252
02:40:44,375 --> 02:40:46,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, the DS has the built-in microphone.

2253
02:40:48,393 --> 02:40:51,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, even though, here's my little problem here.

2254
02:40:51,535 --> 02:40:58,079
[SPEAKER_07]: With Blackbeard and the PSP, I mean, why didn't Hermione just go with what, um, Activision did?

2255
02:40:58,899 --> 02:41:04,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically redo the guitar grip but to fit the USB port in the clamp-on?

2256
02:41:04,483 --> 02:41:07,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would have made sense.

2257
02:41:08,085 --> 02:41:08,845
[SPEAKER_07]: For a guitar grip.

2258
02:41:09,846 --> 02:41:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm.

2259
02:41:11,167 --> 02:41:12,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be.

2260
02:41:13,848 --> 02:41:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2261
02:41:14,489 --> 02:41:14,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something.

2262
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:21,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are going to go ahead and wrap up and let you go, but keep having fun with the DS games.

2263
02:41:22,802 --> 02:41:24,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, have fun.

2264
02:41:25,183 --> 02:41:25,423
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2265
02:41:26,083 --> 02:41:33,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the PS3, and it's actually awesome, but I just got a new screen, so I just need to fix the buttons now.

2266
02:41:33,866 --> 02:41:34,246
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2267
02:41:34,286 --> 02:41:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

2268
02:41:35,266 --> 02:41:36,007
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, take care, buddy.

2269
02:41:36,147 --> 02:41:36,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2270
02:41:36,307 --> 02:41:37,627
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, take care, buddy.

2271
02:41:37,667 --> 02:41:38,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out.

2272
02:41:38,267 --> 02:41:38,587
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

2273
02:41:39,728 --> 02:41:40,028
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2274
02:41:41,659 --> 02:41:45,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that was DS Master calling in.

2275
02:41:46,704 --> 02:41:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2276
02:41:49,186 --> 02:41:50,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for the calls.

2277
02:41:50,948 --> 02:41:52,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry to those that didn't get through.

2278
02:41:52,390 --> 02:41:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's been popular the past couple weeks, but we will open it up again next week as we always do.

2279
02:41:56,554 --> 02:42:00,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget you can always send in an email or post something on the forums, etc., etc.

2280
02:42:02,919 --> 02:42:05,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2281
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:07,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to close up shop.

2282
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:08,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, last minute stories though first.

2283
02:42:08,861 --> 02:42:10,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there anything else?

2284
02:42:10,621 --> 02:42:12,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the one Guinness thing.

2285
02:42:12,862 --> 02:42:13,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2286
02:42:13,882 --> 02:42:16,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a few things real quick.

2287
02:42:16,702 --> 02:42:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the announcement this week, or they finally made it official, that the red Xbox 360 Elite system with Resident Evil 5...

2288
02:42:27,765 --> 02:42:28,846
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2289
02:42:55,387 --> 02:43:01,016
[SPEAKER_04]: All that for the low, low price of $399.99 or just the normal price of an Elite system.

2290
02:43:02,839 --> 02:43:05,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an Elite system.

2291
02:43:09,148 --> 02:43:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that's supposed to be worked on right now is apparently it is expected to sign a deal for Doom 4 later this year.

2292
02:43:19,235 --> 02:43:21,697
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they don't know who the publisher is going to be yet.

2293
02:43:21,937 --> 02:43:24,639
[SPEAKER_04]: But you better believe that you're going to see a Doom 4.

2294
02:43:25,259 --> 02:43:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA.

2295
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:30,703
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know.

2296
02:43:31,023 --> 02:43:31,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom 3 is kind of eh.

2297
02:43:32,524 --> 02:43:32,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

2298
02:43:34,766 --> 02:43:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's it.

2299
02:43:37,168 --> 02:43:37,628
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2300
02:43:39,232 --> 02:43:42,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.

2301
02:43:43,073 --> 02:43:45,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and get everybody's last final thoughts.

2302
02:43:46,475 --> 02:43:52,397
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought would be I should really play this copy of Every Extend Extra I have sitting here in front of me.

2303
02:43:53,377 --> 02:43:54,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Find my PSP because this is a great game.

2304
02:43:55,278 --> 02:43:58,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it on the Xbox Live Arcade, but I didn't play it enough on PSP.

2305
02:43:58,859 --> 02:43:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to do that this week.

2306
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:01,460
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, final thought.

2307
02:44:01,661 --> 02:44:02,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my headache to go away.

2308
02:44:03,301 --> 02:44:03,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2309
02:44:07,183 --> 02:44:08,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

2310
02:44:08,516 --> 02:44:09,036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2311
02:44:35,425 --> 02:44:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2312
02:45:03,954 --> 02:45:05,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up on our 7th anniversary if you can believe it.

2313
02:45:06,336 --> 02:45:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it.

2314
02:45:07,056 --> 02:45:07,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great night everybody.

2315
02:45:07,977 --> 02:45:10,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2316
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:29,753
[SPEAKER_02]: or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
