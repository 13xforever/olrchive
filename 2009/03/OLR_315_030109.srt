Cooking Mama is ready to fix it on your iPhone

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Could a remake of Silent Hill be made for the Wii?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have beef

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Congratulations, hopefully you don't get equal eye or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No!

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You do sound like an angry cow right there

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How are you?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Beefy

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Alright, say hello

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Are you feeling beefy as well?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How are you feeling?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Cheesy

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Cheesy, alright

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am feeling hungry

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sir Robert, are you the buns?

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I guess so

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All day long?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah because I was busy, I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to go to Fry's

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And we were building a computer all day and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So you didn't, you got rained out for your thing once again didn't you?

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And next week and the week after next

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, don't get me started on that

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long and then Sunday

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
POUR!

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You look at the weather next week, it's the same way except it's pouring all week

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then it has a break and then pouring some more on Sunday

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
At least it's not snowing here, on my Twitter today like all my friends on the east coast are like

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OMG snow, OMG snow

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's snowing in Alabama

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's snowing like all over the southeast, what?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I have to tell you something else that's really cool, I had cheeseburgers for breakfast too

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You had cheeseburgers today for breakfast?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, my leftovers from Denny's last night because we stopped in Denny's on the way home

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to say hello to of course our chatters, the always present fourth guests on the show

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we actually have a chatter named Cheeseburger who is very excited saying

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yay Cheeseburger Radio

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We also like to broadcast the show on Justin TV which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Justin.tv.orangeloungeradio

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do it!

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I can put them on YouTube but there's like one clip

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I want to show this on Justin TV so I apologize it's going to be a horrible radio

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But Darkshark talk about the donations you've made to the studio

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well first of all a little bit of background

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Dan and I are doing Uber cleaning, this is like spring cleaning for the millennium

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's hard to see on the TV anyway

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
To the wall, not only that wall but the other wall and probably that wall too

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And the ceiling maybe

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Who knows we might be able to really decorate in here I'm sure our landlords will love that

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I wanted to show this one in particular because this is one of the coolest donations I think

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And a lot of our long time fans are going to get a kick out of this

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But tell them what I'm opening up right now

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Which I have had for quite some time

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And that's like an actual like used in a machine type thing

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And if you put tacks in that thing I will shoot you

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright then I can't put tacks in it

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can use sticky tacks

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll figure something out but look at that there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That shows you it's the real deal

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It means nothing

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That one is though

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't think they really pirated second mix though

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No that one actually is a legit second mix marquee

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So it's my baby it was going to go in the vault but now the vault is completely empty

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I have the metal thing from the machine I don't remember the face plate or whatever

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I never did use that for anything

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But it's around somewhere

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bring it on over we'll put it in studio

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dark Sakura?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well I don't know yet it's not really official Rob

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh sorry then I won't say anything else

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well I'll say something

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Burn it on air

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes we're going to burn some of it live on air

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well as I'm sure our listeners know Dan and I have a whole lot of shit

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A lot of stuff really

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And because we're going to be thinning out the collection some of it

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I might make a big grab bag for who wants my shit

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So if anyone is interested in that then quick quick vote in the chat room

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wire in or fire

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Who wants my shit?

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope fire wins

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And like I'm talking like leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationary from six years ago

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Awesome

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And Rudoni Kenshin stationary from eight years ago

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who wants Jamie's crap?

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And like leftover wall scrolls and shit

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I see a lot of Y's popping up in chat people want your shit

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
God you want my crap

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Act deft I want your shit

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Like old E3 swag you know just crap

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The DJ Ronma S wants to know where's the whiteboard

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The whiteboard is here it's down for repairs before we remodel the studio

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I used it for a side project on Thursday and I need to clean it up

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Rob used it for Big Brother

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I did I used it for the Big Brother game

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was just guessing that's great

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I actually did on my own personal JTV I don't know if I want to give out the link

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll put it out in chat or something but on my own personal JTV channel

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There you go

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For my online reality game addiction

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Alright let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Actually we're going to start a little different tonight with How Was Your Gaming Week

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We're going to do something a little different

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm going to start because I can

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I want to talk about something that actually was both Dark Soccer and myself

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We went to Video Games Live last night

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Very unexpected

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Kind of came up last minute that a friend of mine had some extra tickets

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But boy did he have some good extra tickets

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We got the front row

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well I didn't Dark Soccer did

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And some of us were

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean the venue was really nice

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was a pretty venue

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is it a new venue? I've never seen anything there before

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They're remodeling it

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh okay that makes sense

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's fairly old it's the Fox Theater in Oakland

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
On telegraph

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Gotcha

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well um yeah

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We went to Video Games Live

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And you know we had Tommy on the show

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Probably about what nine months ago Tommy Tallarico

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The guy that you know is really the mastermind behind it

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Long enough to have a baby

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He talked for a long time

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
When he was on the show

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But no we really got some insight as to what was going on

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So we finally got to check it out

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because the show's been going for what three four years

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I never had a chance to check it out

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And Bobby reminded me

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bobby Black Wolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When we tape live

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
As one of the selections for

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Inclusion

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In Video Games Live

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And actually it works

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The whole classic game medley thing

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Was actually one of my favorite pieces they did

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because it did time the music very well

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I had Ross Dunn in it

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I in turn will stay um

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You need to see it though Loki

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like for five seconds it's not even that bad

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I say that the Pong idea is stupid

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was fantastic

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I know on the record scene it's retarded

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And not fantastic in any way

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're just an asshole

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No actually it was

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It was good though the whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It was a good way to start the show

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I want my medley of Vectrex

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know the buzzing from the screen

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well they did have

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Some really random stuff in there

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Like they had this

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well I'm talking about some of the pieces

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They did the interactive space invaders thing last night

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That looked fun

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They had a guy get up on stage and he would run to the left

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And the ship would move left

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And run to the right and the ship would move right

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Moving it in the direction that the guy is running

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because there's huge massive lag

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But no matter what he did the space invaders destroyed

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The two world trade centers

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Shut up

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But he did

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He didn't win because

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tommy was yelling shoot the sides you idiot

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Not like that but he's yelling shoot the sides

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And the guy didn't figure out how to do it

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I was thinking to myself

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There's really not a lot of music in space invaders

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's literally three notes

204
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That the orchestra is playing

205
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sorry four notes

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That the orchestra is playing faster and faster

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
With one person assigned to be the UFO

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Whatever the UFO would show up on screen

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think the chorus was singing with it though

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Were they really?

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought it was kind of cheesy

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it was cool

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Video games live is a very

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Unformal thing

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was comparing it to the Dear Friends concert

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That Square puts on that I've also been to

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Twice actually

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The Dear Friends thing

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That whole thing is more like

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A night at the orchestra

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Granted there's a little more clapping and cheering

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And interactivity

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But like in video games live

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tommy just comes right out and says

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You just scream right along

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You cheer for your favorite stuff

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We just want everybody to have fun

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So you can tell right off the bat

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They're going for a totally different type of setup

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Did anyone go whoa intermission

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My favorite part

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Was there? There was applause for the intermission

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because they had like a loading screen which was really funny

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I know it was cool It was funny

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I liked that they had before the show

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And during the intermission they would have little

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
YouTubes like that Miss Pacman

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
For reals thing and some of these things would

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Show up randomly during the

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Usually dead parts and it was cool

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay so I had a good time

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was like a mini convention and obviously a lot

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Of the arrangements were beautiful

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I forgot just how awesome the music is

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In Civ 4 I'm so happy they included that

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Piece because Civilization 4 was amazing

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The singer was very nervous

248
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The singer was very nervous

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But he did a good job

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's got a gorgeous voice

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh yeah the god of war

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not a series I've ever really been into

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Her voice was impressive Amazing

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Her voice was amazing

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Metroid makes me want to play that game now

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Obviously if you've listened to the show long enough

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The minute Super Metroid

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is just the ending to Sonic 1

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm going Sonic Avenger

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're just putting it up there to show the other games

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hush

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They were just showing you the Mario thing

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They showed like every Mario game in existence

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know what my favorite was Rob? What?

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross debut

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Brand new World premiere we saw last night

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Of the oft requested

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Which to me was like Scars of Time

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Plus a couple other things

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Scars of Time is one of my favorite video game songs

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Period so I was just fine with that

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That was like the World of Warcraft heckling

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There was a piece that was called

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ten Years of Warcraft

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And the first guy

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Gets up and goes FOR THE HORDE

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And there's people ahhh

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And then FOR THE ALLIANCE

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Boo

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Our area was booing, it was amazing

283
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Ok, parts I didn't like

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And Jamie disagrees with me on this

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Here's the thing, when I say I didn't like it

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is like constructive criticism

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Overall I thought the show was great

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But if there's one thing I could've replaced

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
With something else, because he goes up there and he says

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Hey we have like 60 things

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We could choose from and it's really hard to pick 20

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That we can do here tonight, so my suggestion

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thing because it didn't fit

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
To me, it did not fit with the rest of the night

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And yes I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Blah blah blah, and yes we understand

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tommy Tallarico is related to

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But, but

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Here's the thing, I didn't go to

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You know what I mean? Dude I sure did

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It just was not

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What I wanted to hear, it felt like

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week

306
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
On YouTube or any of that stuff

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I just didn't, I didn't care for that

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And then when I go online and see

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh I could've heard Bioshock and instead

310
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They gave me that, you know I just, I was a little disappointed

311
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I understand they want to give more stuff away

312
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do another interactive cheer cheer cheer thing

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But for me it didn't work, I didn't like it

314
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think the best thing to have done

315
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
With that would be to have brought the guy out

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And said here, here's your prize

317
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This is the dude that won, yay

318
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Bye, and maybe

319
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I would even go for like a

320
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Music game tribute that does

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Of the songs or something

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know maybe even incorporate some DDR

324
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know, they're gonna be cool, Space Channel 5

325
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I, I

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, when they said that they were about to do

327
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one

328
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That yelled out Space Channel 5?

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We all knew it would be Sonic

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Cause I, of course

331
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We all knew it would be Sonic, but wouldn't it be amazing

332
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If it was choo choo

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It was Yuji Naka up there, and I love that I got to see

334
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My musical hero twice

335
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Koji Kondo

336
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh yeah, he was up there on the big screen

337
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yuji Naka was like, okay I suck at English

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So I'm just gonna say it in Japanese

339
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles

340
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But um, it was

341
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll tell you what though, um

342
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What I did, I had a fun time

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
With this part, was when he came out with

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The guitar before the Chrono Trigger

345
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Bit, and like

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So what do you, so, you know, we're gonna hear

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
All of this, it's like, play some Skynyrd, man

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I was like, Freebird

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Freebird, he's like, I'm not gonna play

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Freebird, and then after

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The song was over, he says, okay, now I'm gonna play Freebird

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So

354
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Actually, there was, there was somebody in our

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Section that called for Sweet

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Emotion, that called for

357
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Dream On, that was it

358
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Really, see, somebody else knew, I guess

359
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Black Wilson Chat right now and says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Song up on YouTube, this is a good arrangement

361
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Has it really hit YouTube already?

362
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Dude, he said, get that on YouTube

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Tonight

364
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's true

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Now that's what I thought was great

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Cameras were encouraged

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Video taping was encouraged

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was fun

369
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's no stick up the ass, cause keep in mind

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Every concert

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay, here we go, we got a little bit

372
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, this is from last night, this is from user

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
GBPMike has put up

374
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Some of the arrangement

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, this is from last night

376
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back

377
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me skip ahead to some of the Scarra time piece

378
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I felt really bad for the flute player

379
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, the flute player botched a little bit

380
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Missed a note, big time

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, Scarra time is just a beautiful song

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And to hear that done live was cool

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note

384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think even Martin Learned missed a note at one point

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I heard the piano, I don't know if it was him on piano

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I heard a bad piano note at one point

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I was like, don't!

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But you know, mistakes happen, I'm not gonna be that critical

389
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's just, that's, you know

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It didn't ruin the night, come on

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No it didn't

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I am, it ruined the night completely

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How dare they miss a note

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I come for a perfect performance

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a little different when you're the soloist

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, it's tough, that's a lot of pressure

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I doubt they have a lot of time to practice either

398
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But you know, I've been there before

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I can't really say anything

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The only other thing

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It is an expensive asking price

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The seats we had were 60 bucks

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I imagine the seats up in the nosebleeds were a lot cheaper

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's a hard price to call in this economy

405
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But you know, that is the price of a video game

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know, considering no doubt

407
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now

408
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days

409
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But you know what, if you have the money

410
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you have the time

411
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Check it out when it goes to your town

412
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that

413
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it

414
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But I would definitely make it a point to see it

415
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When it comes to my town again

416
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I might actually, you know

417
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I want to see different shows

418
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They just announced, if you go to their site

419
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
They just announced like 45 new tour dates

420
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Or something like that

421
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
They are going to be playing a show

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In LA on June 4th

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
During E3

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So they love to do that

425
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions

426
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And things of that sort

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WonderCon was this one

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Act F asked did they play the Metal Gear Solid song

430
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes they did

431
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
David Hayter doing intros

432
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
For each part

433
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box

434
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And he was hiding in the box that said orange on it

435
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Lots of tour dates announced for Canada

436
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you're in Canada you're very happy right now

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They're going to Saskatchewan

438
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
On May 11th, Alberta

439
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Calgary 15th, 16th

440
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Edmonton 18th

441
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
British Columbia, the 20th and 21st

442
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
All those dates in May

443
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May

444
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like even Winnipeg in July as well

445
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Singapore, they're going to be in Singapore

446
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Romania

447
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
France in November later on this year

448
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They'll be in Portland, Oregon for a couple of shows

449
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In November

450
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
San Diego July 23rd

451
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
New York, Lewiston

452
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
July 31st, so they're going to be all over

453
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Later this year

454
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Alright

455
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So that was our experience of Video Games Live

456
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Otherwise as far as my gaming week goes personally

457
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That was new

459
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Didn't play a lot of new stuff

460
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Still the old standby favorites

461
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4

462
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
After remembering how awesome the music is this week

463
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I was like, oh god I need to play this again

464
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Especially with the video and everything

465
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It makes you all warm and tingly

466
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like a video game fan

467
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So Dark Sakura, anything else in your gaming week

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Besides Video Game Live?

469
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I actually, right before the show

470
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
When I was getting my slab of beef

471
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
With two crackers on either side

472
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I was playing Raiden 2

473
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And Marvel vs Capcom

474
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And oh my god

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair

476
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh god

477
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2

478
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That was pretty fun

479
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I was just going to say

480
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Speaking of arcade machines

481
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is going to seem completely random

482
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I saw a news story on this this week

483
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games

484
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch

485
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They're going to try to sell all these games

486
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The dude had a hip hop mania

487
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Or the machine

488
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He had a Sega 360

489
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He had one of those two, he had a lot of different types of machines

490
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But he actually had a hip hop mania cabinet

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I kind of want it

492
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like the starting price I think was only like 400 to 600 dollars

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm thinking about putting a bid on it

494
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Just for fun

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Dude, wouldn't it be awesome to have a freaking hip hop mania cabinet in here

496
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That was like once owned by Michael Jackson

497
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That would be kind of funny

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Dude, that is not auctioning off his moon walker

499
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know why

500
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I think that's one of those random awesome things

501
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Dude, he had a jumbo safari machine

502
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well keep in mind

503
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Who is his biggest

504
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Video game buddy

505
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh Sega

506
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Absolutely

507
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He was in Space Channel 5 part 2

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Shut up Loki

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I said video game buddy

510
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What? He played video games with him

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company

512
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We said buddy

513
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You did not specify

514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Tigerclaw says I wonder did Michael Jackson even play those games

515
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Probably not

516
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well maybe a couple of them

517
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But who knows

518
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I doubt he played them all

519
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch

520
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Come on, come on

521
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that

522
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines

523
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't spend a lot of money

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But you know, I'll try to get something, why not

525
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Alright

526
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because if you win that arcade machine you better check it with a black light

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They had a hip hop mania machine local

528
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Did they

529
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It was a beat mania machine or something

530
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I sent Jamie the link to it

531
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
On Twitter like a while ago

532
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That poor

533
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And it was about the same price

534
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Interesting

535
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Not from Golfland though

536
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Not for sure, Roseville

537
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Hip hop mania, it's got to be from Golfland

538
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I swear to god though

539
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If other Bamani fans out there try to outbid me on the hip hop mania machine

540
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
From Neverland Ranch

541
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I will cut you

542
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Jamie anything else

543
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't say names right tonight

544
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Anything else in your gaming week

545
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Um

546
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No

547
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
City of Heroes

548
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My thing expired now

549
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So I don't know if I'm going to play

550
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And

551
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Really stupid flash game

552
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That I can't remember

553
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh yeah, I played with my virtual pet on

554
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Facebook today

555
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard

556
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What

557
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Cause you said, I said is there anything else in your gaming week

558
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You said no, but City of Heroes

559
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And Facebook games

560
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh

561
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Rob

562
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What

563
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Loki how was your gaming week

564
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh I didn't play anything

565
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto

566
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Lost and Damned

567
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You're a little feisty tonight Loki

568
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I like this

569
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No I'm getting over a cold actually

570
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Again, it's like cold the sequel

571
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You know I first got sick and then I got better

572
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And then I got the flu

573
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then I got better

574
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But now I'm coughing again

575
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No so I was actually out sick

576
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
A couple days this week

577
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Unfortunately I forgot to bring my 360 home with me

578
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So I didn't play anything during that time

579
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Um

580
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I did play Lost and Damned

581
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mostly this week

582
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Really fun keeping me interested for a while

583
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Until I finish the story mode

584
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I also got to check out

585
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A little bit of Eat Lead

586
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The Return of Matt Hazard

587
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And it's kind of cheesy

588
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But I kind of like it

589
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's got achievements like crazy

590
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
For the most redundant stupid things ever

591
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Like you start the game

592
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And you get an achievement immediately

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's awesome

594
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You pause the game and you get an achievement

595
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Um

596
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's great

597
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But then

598
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The whole game is just very

599
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Making fun of itself

600
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And it's fun in that sense

601
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I mean the game itself is not that great

602
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They do have some really cool stuff that they did with the cover system

603
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like you can actually

604
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Look ahead and find a piece of cover

605
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you hit a button and you'll actually

606
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Sprint to that location which is pretty cool

607
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And apparently the main character

608
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Likes that cover system too

609
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
As he comments on it as you're playing the game

610
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And he also complains about having to go through

611
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A tutorial which is funny

612
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Um

613
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But yeah I haven't really gotten past the first stage yet

614
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because I literally started playing it about 20 minutes

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Before I came over here

616
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Um

617
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But it's fun

618
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And you can actually find it in stores now

619
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Or at least some stores

620
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Because Gamestop apparently

621
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Broke street on it everywhere

622
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because they had it listed in their system

623
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
For the 26th of February

624
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
March 3rd

625
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They just said ah fuck it we're not changing it in our system

626
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And so they just left it out

627
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
At what stores put it out

628
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But it will be coming out everywhere March 3rd

629
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So look for it then

630
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But um

631
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah that's pretty much it

632
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And no DJ Dark Knight I'm not talking about Killzone

633
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because I didn't buy Killzone

634
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And to be honest I'm actually gonna hold off on it

635
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2 yet

636
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So there's no way I'm gonna

637
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Start another game

638
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You know well I am starting to eat lead

639
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So I guess

640
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I can't really see much there but I'm not buying another game

641
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You know for the PS3 right now

642
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
One game at a time right

643
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah I wanna get through Resistance

644
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know Killzone I'm not too interested in

645
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I never played the first one

646
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The Resistance I've actually played you know the

647
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The first game and went through the entire story line

648
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I actually kinda know what's going on

649
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I kinda wanna play the Resistance 2 all the way through

650
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And then maybe play Resistance

651
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Retribution when that comes out

652
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Um

653
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I might be getting a new car soon

654
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping

655
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah it kept me away from video games for a little while

656
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car

657
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And have to factor in a car payment into my budget now

658
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm probably gonna have to really cut back on the amount of new video games

659
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I buy so I

660
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I can definitely feel the pain of you know I don't have to get

661
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Killzone 2 just cause it's new

662
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
No and seriously that is the thing too

663
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's like I kinda almost feel like peer pressure

664
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Based on you know all the advertisements

665
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And all the hype and stuff

666
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And I look at it and it's like

667
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You know it's just another shooter game

668
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Do I really need to play this and no I don't

669
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's the same with like Star Ocean

670
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I was gonna buy that and I'm like do I need to really play this right now

671
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
No I don't

672
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And it's the more I keep evaluating stuff like that

673
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The less I'm buying

674
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Which is fine

675
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You know cause there's gonna be

676
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny

677
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And I wanna play it and I didn't really give a crap about

678
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know the production value

679
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Or anything of the game cause

680
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You know it's not an excellent

681
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Game but it's fun

682
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So that's why I decided to play that one

683
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then of course you know

684
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm waiting for Mad World to come out

685
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Because it's a lot of blood and

686
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Killing which is gonna be so awesome

687
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Act deft in chat jokes

688
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Sky you're getting a Yaris? I'm considering it

689
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not high up on my list anymore though

690
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It was before but right now I'm

691
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta

692
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Rob if you get a Yaris the terrorists win

693
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hahahaha

694
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And by terrorists I mean

695
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
People that made the Yaris game

696
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh shut up

697
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Anything else Loki in your gaming week?

698
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I was actually

699
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Also looking at

700
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Hacking lost and damned

701
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But I haven't gotten around to actually

702
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Doing it

703
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yet but I've

704
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Been looking at how I'm going

705
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
To do it

706
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Unfolded Raptor in our chatroom chat

707
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Says ask for the Yaris with a tentacle

708
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
They'll take me seriously

709
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000

710
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000

723
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Hey Twitter when and if

724
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
VideoGamesLive comes to your town what do you hope

725
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
They'll play? Because you know I think there was

726
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Probably a song we wish they would have done

727
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But they didn't do last night

728
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
For example I kind of secretly hope

729
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The new song was like Kid Icarus

730
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That would have been pretty rad

731
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Is there something you were hoping for?

732
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro

733
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's a really good piece of music

734
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So some of the chatters showed us their tweets

735
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Earlier on Twitter

736
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
D2 says the Guardian Legend of course

737
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And I Love Pancakes

738
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
DJ Ratchet says I would want them to play

739
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Either Passion by Utada Hikaru

740
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Or the legendary theme for Guitar Man

741
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Even though I don't think that one would work

742
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And you know they do

743
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Simple and Clean obviously

744
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think they do that one every show with the Disney montage

745
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But I wouldn't mind

746
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
A little Kingdom Hearts 2 or a little bit of both

747
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Who knows

748
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Act Def says when they came to Mexicali I hope they would play

749
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
A Kirby song, sadly they didn't

750
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
A Kirby plus Orchestra equals awesome

751
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Crows says they're coming to Houston

752
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Late 2009, I want to hear a crapload

753
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main

754
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Theme of Fallout 3

755
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Ooh that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion

756
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oblivion would be an awesome one here

757
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Peeger Uno says

758
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The Let's Tap theme tune

759
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And Harry AKA says

760
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Some of the beautiful music from Braid

761
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That's not a bad suggestion either

762
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack

763
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That might be pretty awesome to hear live

764
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And since they're always adding new stuff

765
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh

766
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Who knows what's going to come to that in the future

767
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Show us your tweets

768
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
By following us on Twitter username

769
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
O-L-R, you know what

770
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was going to mention

771
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Something that I was going to play this week

772
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But I didn't get a chance to and I really

773
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Really sad

774
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh I also played more Nobby Nobby Boy

775
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I still don't get any

776
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's going on with that

777
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I might add that the Destructoid review of it

778
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Is hilarious

779
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And I couldn't stop laughing for the dumbest reason

780
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They had this song

781
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That was in the background

782
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't even know what it's called

783
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But something about wanting to smell your dick

784
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Or something like that

785
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You gotta watch it

786
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's just like the weirdest thing

787
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But that song in the background

788
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I was laughing for like 15 minutes afterwards

789
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm like what the hell was that

790
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Anyways, so completely off of that

791
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
LittleBigPlanet

792
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They had a group

793
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Of seven different creators

794
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Actually go through

795
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And create all

796
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Eight stages

797
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Of Contra

798
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
In LittleBigPlanet

799
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I've played the first one before

800
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's fun, it's fun

801
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's a good translation

802
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah so they have all of them including

803
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Levels where you're inside the bases

804
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And stuff and it's in that same perspective

805
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And everything

806
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Pretty awesome, so definitely go check those out

807
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm planning on downloading them all

808
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
But uh

809
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah that's it, and hopefully

810
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm hoping that this whole

811
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Hacking lost and damned thing works

812
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
To have some more funny videos

813
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Coming out

814
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's funny if you break open

815
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The lost and damned

816
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Download content

817
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's actually in the exact same

818
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Format as the PC

819
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Version as far as the files that are in there

820
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So

821
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
In theory you could edit it just like

822
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The PC version and do all sorts of

823
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Crazy shit, so I'm looking

824
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Forward to trying that out

825
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Interesting, by the way I'm going back and forth

826
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
A little bit in chat, apparently

827
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
According to our

828
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Old buddy Bobby

829
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
There will never be Oblivion or

830
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Prey or Guild Wars music heard

831
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
At Video Games Live

832
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And apparently there's some type of feud going on

833
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Between Jeremy Sule

834
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The guy who does the music for all those

835
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Games I just mentioned, and Tommy Tallarico

836
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Like there's a big

837
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Gamer composer feud going on

838
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
There or something, I don't know

839
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Can't we all just get along

840
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, never say never

841
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Money talks

842
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Things that we thought would never happen

843
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Have happened

844
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo

845
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
GameCube and see a Sega logo

846
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Right?

847
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC

848
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
crossover

849
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That was old

850
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Anyhow, other housekeeping this week

851
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't really have a whole lot

852
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Of housekeeping this week

853
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I did housekeeping

854
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Just continue to support us on the web

855
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Again if you've not visited the new

856
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Orangelaunchradio.com you need to

857
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Check it out, DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures

858
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
She took from Video Games Live actually

859
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I uploaded the one to the main page there

860
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Of the marquee, but if you go into

861
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The OL Army picks on the gallery

862
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You can actually upload your own pictures

863
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And DarkSakura actually uploaded

864
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Some things to the gallery

865
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Including a picture of herself

866
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Taken earlier today it looks like

867
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh my god!

868
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A wild Jamie approaches

869
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Use your pester ball

870
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And then some cool pictures from Video Games Live

871
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I love my picture of Master Chief

872
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Some of these came out great, you should send those to Tommy

873
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I bet he'd get a kick out of that

874
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one

875
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Are really good, you should send those in

876
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I took them with my iPhone

877
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
For iPhone pictures it's not bad

878
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says

879
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Rob is officially gayer than Christmas

880
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Rob versus Chris, you'll just have to

881
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Check it out

882
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, I bet anything it was Travis and John

883
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Last night on Understation Live

884
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This just seems like something they'd do

885
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This reeks of

886
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
John and Travis somehow

887
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like, hey, how can we fuck

888
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
With the new Orangelaunchradio.com, I know

889
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let's make a Rob is gay joke

890
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Ah, see, isn't it fun

891
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Being friends with them for so long

892
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I know, I know, those little bastards

893
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Alright, but I love them

894
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
In a totally homosexual way

895
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Alright, let's get to some

896
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Gaming news, low-key

897
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Well, you may remember last week, Capcom was teasing

898
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Something that they were going to announce

899
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
On Monday, well, that announcement

900
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Was Lost Planet 2

901
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And Lost Planet 2

902
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Looks very epic, very cold

903
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Still, yet strangely enough

904
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Like in a jungle

905
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's a frozen jungle

906
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But they have a bunch of other cool stuff

907
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It looks pretty sweet

908
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Right now

909
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Only announced for the 360

910
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And so it's

911
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Possibly going to be a 360

912
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Exclusive, at least for a while

913
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But, you know, the first game was that way too

914
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So, who knows

915
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And then some other cool stuff

916
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They're going to have 4 player online co-op

917
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Which is pretty neat

918
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And, I don't know, I think the game looks really cool

919
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Different environments

920
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
They even have some sort of mech thing

921
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because before you can get the mech suits

922
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Well, now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit

923
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's like

924
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Voltron-esque

925
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So, that looked kind of neat

926
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But, very exciting

927
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But, no word on when this is planning on

928
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Being put out, but I'm sure we'll hear more about it

929
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
During E3

930
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Well, I suppose that's a slight more surprise

931
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Than Dead Rising 2, which is what we predicted

932
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
On last week's show would be the announcement

933
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But at the same time, Lost Planet 2

934
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Should not be that big of a surprise

935
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, especially when you consider that

936
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
They have the Lost Planet movie

937
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
That they're pouring billions and billions of dollars into

938
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And, you know

939
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So

940
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I guess that's not too big of a surprise

941
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I was going to chat

942
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
By the way, Travis says it was not us

943
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That did the Rob is Gator than Christmas picture

944
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So, that was just forever a mystery

945
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And now he's also saying Under Station Live

946
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
What if it was Fart Princess?

947
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It could have been

948
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end

949
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I'm just like, huh?

950
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, I want more information

951
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
On what this is all about

952
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm going to call you later, Travis

953
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You better call in later, Travis

954
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I want details, what the hell is going on?

955
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Alright, anyhow, back to video games for now

956
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Assassin's Creed on the PSP

957
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp

958
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
This week about the PSP

959
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
One of their destination Playstation events

960
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Assassin's Creed is going to be coming

961
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
To the PSP

962
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Ubisoft will be putting it out on the

963
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Sony portable system a little later this year

964
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Apparently there's also going to be

965
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
An Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well

966
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
With, you know, a PSP with it

967
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So

968
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
There you go, Assassin's Creed coming out

969
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
A little later this year for you fans of that game

970
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And also for fans of

971
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Having games on the PSP

972
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So there you go

973
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
In other news

974
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Speaking of PSP stuff

975
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Um

976
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You know there's actually something

977
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
About LittleBigPlanet

978
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's going to be on PSP

979
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because I said so

980
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And because apparently Sony says so too

981
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And it's going to be sometime

982
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Before the end of the year

983
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That it is in conjunction with

984
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Media Molecule and it's supposed to be

985
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Very much like the PS3 version

986
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Where you can

987
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You know, make your levels

988
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And share them and play the game

989
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And play everybody else's crap

990
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But just take it with you

991
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know what I think

992
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I think that it's going to be

993
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You would download everything

994
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Through the Playstation

995
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Like you do

996
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Through the PS3 like you do now

997
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
With whatever link to the

998
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
PSP

999
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I think that this is one of the biggest

1000
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Does to come out of the Playstation event

1001
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean LittleBigPlanet's been

1002
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know, a huge new IP for them

1003
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Although I don't know how well it's been selling here in the US

1004
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But I think it's been doing much better overseas

1005
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But you know, I think this is no surprise

1006
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
At all that they're putting a port of this

1007
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
On the PSP, we had rumors about this a few months ago

1008
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
No surprise here

1009
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I guess I am surprised though that Media Molecule's

1010
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Not doing it themselves, that's kind of

1011
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Interesting

1012
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm not surprised because they're busy doing like

1013
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You know, expansions and stuff

1014
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
For the main game

1015
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Someone else port it, that's fine

1016
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
As long as it turns out alright

1017
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I was going to say also that

1018
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You know, I think it's pretty cool

1019
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That they're actually taking the PSP

1020
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Seriously this year

1021
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You know, putting out some pretty strong games

1022
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because remember last year and stuff

1023
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They're all like, oh that's the year of the PSP

1024
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then nothing really came out

1025
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Other than the Crysis core

1026
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Or a new PSP, a new design

1027
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What baby do, but you know

1028
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't know, I think it's kind of cool

1029
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP

1030
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Another PS3 franchise there

1031
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Motorstorm Arctic Edge

1032
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Which is of course

1033
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Going to be more

1034
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Arctic themed

1035
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Than the other games that are going to add

1036
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Snowmobiles as well

1037
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You can expect all sorts of stuff

1038
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Including some of the stuff that they

1039
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Showed off in their pre-rendered

1040
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Intro video that they kind of do

1041
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No gameplay footage is actually shown

1042
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But you know, stuff like

1043
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Maybe interactive environments including

1044
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Avalanches, collapsing

1045
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Snowbridges, you name it

1046
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And of course always some

1047
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Poor sap falling off of a dirt bike

1048
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And getting hit by some giant

1049
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Vehicle

1050
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The game will also be

1051
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Ported to the PlayStation 2

1052
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
As well, so

1053
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP

1054
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Games to the PS2 and vice versa

1055
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Makes sense

1056
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
They're still cranking out PS2 games

1057
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Still selling well, so

1058
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Why not?

1059
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I guess the price is right

1060
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2

1061
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Might as well, I mean

1062
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Get some more sales that way

1063
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Alright, well if none of those

1064
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Games sounded interesting to you at all

1065
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Maybe this is a little more up your alley

1066
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
A new Hannah Montana

1067
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
PSP bundle

1068
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Oh joy! That's right, this is coming out in

1069
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
July, it's going to be a PSP in a

1070
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Brand new color called Lilac

1071
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Imagine if babies

1072
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Shit purple, and that's the color

1073
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Of this PSP, that's pretty much the best

1074
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Way to describe it, it will come with

1075
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A new Hannah Montana rhythm game

1076
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I wonder if this is the same game that

1077
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Did somebody let Footy Monster know

1078
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That this is coming out, because he's a big fan of the

1079
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Hannah Montana music games

1080
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But also it's coming out

1081
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
With a UMD of episodes

1082
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
From Hannah Montana, also a

1083
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Two gigabyte memory stick coming with it

1084
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And, and, and

1085
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Stickers to decorate your

1086
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
PSP with Hannah Montana

1087
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So there you go

1088
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Apparently some also

1089
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Casual other things coming to the

1090
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
PSP, Ubisoft has

1091
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
His Pets series coming to the PSP

1092
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Pets Saddle Club

1093
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Being one of the first releases in September

1094
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Obviously this is happening

1095
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
To compete with the DS a little bit

1096
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because they have the whole Carrie Underwood

1097
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Playing a pink DS commercial

1098
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So Sony has

1099
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now tapped into Hannah Montana, which is

1100
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know what, lover or hater

1101
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's a huge brand for

1102
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You know, tween girls, so

1103
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I guess this is the way to go, right

1104
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
To try and sell some of these at Christmas time

1105
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That they've tapped Hannah Montana

1106
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Shh, isn't that illegal

1107
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You know what I mean, you ass

1108
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
La la la la la la

1109
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Exactly, so

1110
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't know though, I

1111
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Kind of want a baby shit purple

1112
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
PSP because I don't think anybody else would have

1113
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
One, it is an interesting

1114
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Color, but I want one of the blue ones more

1115
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think, I'll get the Madden pack

1116
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That came with the blue PSP

1117
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Even though I have a perfectly fine and

1118
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Functioning PSP right now

1119
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I kind of want the lilac one, but not bad enough to go for

1120
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hannah Montana

1121
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm also just kind of like

1122
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You know the PSP 2 announcements coming

1123
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Probably at E3, so if I can at least

1124
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Make myself wait until E3 to upgrade

1125
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
My PSP, then I'll have motivation

1126
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
To just wait even longer until PSP 2 comes out

1127
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think there will be something

1128
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
There will be another revision

1129
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
From what I heard, it was supposed to be even

1130
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's

1131
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
About it, I mean

1132
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's still best to be the same thing

1133
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Eh, whatever, who cares, it's not going to help

1134
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
GioVedea in chat says

1135
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Tap ass and Hannah Montana

1136
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Should not be said in the same sentence

1137
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I apologize to any listener that was offended

1138
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Alright

1139
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Enough Hannah Montana, please

1140
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DarkSakura, help us change the subject

1141
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
How about release dates?

1142
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Well we've got quite a bit for the UK

1143
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday

1144
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Since it will already be after that

1145
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
By the time they get this

1146
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So on March 4th, we have

1147
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Empire Total War

1148
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's for PC

1149
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
On the 6th, Battle Fantasia

1150
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
There's also

1151
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
New Play Control, Mario Power Tennis

1152
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Patapon 2

1153
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Tenchu, Shadow Assassins

1154
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Tom Clancy's Hawks

1155
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Watchmen, The End is Nigh

1156
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's for PC, Xbox 360

1157
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And Playstation 3

1158
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And Flock for Xbox 360

1159
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The Playstation 3 version

1160
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Says it's out on the 9th

1161
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah those are the

1162
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Live arcade games

1163
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Or Playstation Network games

1164
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Is that it?

1165
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Does it

1166
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well in the US, there's actually quite a bit

1167
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Coming out this week

1168
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Lots of stuff, including

1169
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The big title, Halo Wars

1170
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Coming out on Xbox 360

1171
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
On

1172
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
PSP, we're getting

1173
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Phantasy Star Portable

1174
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Which is the remake of the Ambition of the

1175
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Illuminus expansion

1176
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We've also got MLB

1177
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Both O9

1178
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And 2K9

1179
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
O9 of course coming out on all Sony

1180
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Platforms and 2K9

1181
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Coming out on pretty much everything but the

1182
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
DS

1183
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
version is getting MLB

1184
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
2K9

1185
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Phantasy All Stars

1186
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Which is a weird looking game

1187
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But whatever

1188
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Empire Total War coming out on

1189
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
PC

1190
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Also that week

1191
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We've got SBK Superbike World

1192
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Championship coming out on

1193
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000

1194
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And Wii and Playstation 2

1195
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I believe

1196
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Also

1197
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Tom Clancy's Hawks

1198
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
On Xbox 360

1199
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And on PS3

1200
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Wii Ski and Snowboard

1201
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
On the Nintendo Wii

1202
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Kind of a sequel to that

1203
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Wii Ski game that came out last year

1204
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Also

1205
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Coming out

1206
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
As well

1207
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Littlest Pet Shop Spring

1208
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Cause there's just not enough of those games

1209
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
King of Fighters 98

1210
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Ultimate Match coming out on

1211
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Playstation 2

1212
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Little retro fighting action there

1213
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then Spongebob vs.

1214
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The Big One Beach Party Cook Off

1215
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Your Spongebob themed Cookie Mama

1216
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Game

1217
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Sonic and the Black Knight

1218
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
On the Wii

1219
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And

1220
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Finally

1221
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Sad

1222
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Thing to end on but Grey's Anatomy

1223
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Coming out on PC

1224
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
DS and the Wii

1225
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm very curious to see

1226
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
How that game performs

1227
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because it's either going to start a trend

1228
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Of all these like you know

1229
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Interesting drama

1230
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's not going to do well

1231
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I can tell you right now

1232
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
They're putting it out for a reason right?

1233
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah because they bought the license rates

1234
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
These people put out weird stuff

1235
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Look at for example

1236
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
On the DS there's a company bringing out

1237
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A Johnny Bravo game

1238
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Seriously?

1239
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
A Johnny Bravo game now?

1240
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I bet that will outsell Grey's Anatomy

1241
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yes it probably would actually

1242
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Alright let's head over to Japan

1243
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And look at some of the release dates in Japan

1244
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because of course the types of things they get in Japan

1245
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Usually come out here a little later

1246
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Or around the same time as is the case of

1247
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Biohazard 5 is coming out on March 5th in Japan

1248
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Of course Biohazard is the Japanese name for

1249
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Anybody?

1250
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Anybody?

1251
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Your mom!

1252
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
PlayStation 3

1253
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Also getting Biohazard 5

1254
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Which seems to be dominating the week over there this week

1255
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But don't count out

1256
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
MLB 09 the show

1257
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And Senju no Valkyria

1258
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Is getting a price reduction as well

1259
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Which is just you know

1260
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US

1261
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
On the Nintendo Wii

1262
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
On March 5th

1263
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Only one big release is

1264
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Relaxuma

1265
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Mina de Goryuri

1266
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Sekkatsu is coming out

1267
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Which looks like a game with cute little animals

1268
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Um

1269
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
There's no screenshots

1270
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Just cute little finger painted

1271
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Survivor horror game

1272
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Somehow I doubt it

1273
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm sorry to say

1274
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
PlayStation 2 has Galaxy Angel 2

1275
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Coming out as well as Need for Speed

1276
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Pro Street and Sengokushi

1277
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
X gets a price

1278
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Reduction as it moves into

1279
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
A greatest hits type series over there

1280
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Nintendo DS 7th Dragon

1281
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Is a big release over there this week

1282
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That is a game coming from Sega

1283
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's an RPG

1284
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS

1285
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Kimo Koei

1286
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And Simple DS

1287
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Volume 47 because every week

1288
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It seems like over there there's another Simple DS game

1289
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Coming out

1290
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Lastly on the PSP

1291
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It looks like there's

1292
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They're getting the 3000

1293
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
In blue this week in Japan

1294
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And red

1295
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And a lot of matching

1296
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Gear coming out to match that

1297
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Otherwise Mina no Golf

1298
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Portable which is just Hotshots Golf

1299
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is getting a price reduction

1300
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There you go, not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week

1301
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Since you have Resident Evil 5

1302
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
New colors that they have for the DSI

1303
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Just the black and the

1304
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Crappy blue

1305
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
No they have the new colors for

1306
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Japan

1307
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They have this weird

1308
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Not even maroon it's like a

1309
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Pinkish

1310
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Purple

1311
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Magenta color system

1312
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They got this weird lime green

1313
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And a dark blue

1314
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's probably better than the colors here

1315
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That light blue is terrible

1316
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't want a DSI in that color

1317
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Well I don't really want a DSI anyway

1318
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm not sold on it yet

1319
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Me neither

1320
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Maybe when some of the DSI games start coming out

1321
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm like

1322
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Embed sick or something you know

1323
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm just not a big handheld fan

1324
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's when you have the flu

1325
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's the flu system

1326
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It's the DS flu

1327
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well how about some WiiWare stuff

1328
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah give me a reason to turn on the Wii

1329
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well you can get beer pong

1330
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Frat party games

1331
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You have a

1332
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Your table set up with

1333
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Four people

1334
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Up to four people playing

1335
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And you have to throw ping pong balls into a paper cup

1336
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Now is this story coming out of Europe

1337
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Because I would think, I thought we got that game

1338
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
A while ago. Yeah this is Europe

1339
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah I thought we had, but they had to change

1340
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It to like party toss or what did they call it

1341
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Pong toss

1342
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So they're actually getting beer pong over there

1343
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They're getting beer pong frat party games

1344
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm glad to hear their feathers aren't so ruffled over there

1345
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And they're getting speed pong

1346
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Where you use power ups

1347
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
To slow your other people down

1348
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
There's also snowboard riot

1349
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Where

1350
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You go down and you

1351
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Attack people and defend yourself

1352
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
With your snowboard?

1353
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I guess. Or you riot in LA with a snowboard

1354
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That sounds like it could be kind of fun actually

1355
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It seems like road rash with a snowboard

1356
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That might be alright

1357
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So, anyway

1358
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The beer pong is 800 Wii points

1359
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Snowboard riot is 1000

1360
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And

1361
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I guess speed pong would also be 800

1362
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I suppose

1363
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it

1364
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
For 800 points there

1365
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Dammit!

1366
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I was wanting to play it for myself

1367
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And find that out, Loki

1368
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Jerk

1369
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball

1370
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
For cheaper

1371
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And you can get drunk

1372
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But only if you're 21 or over, please

1373
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I was gonna say

1374
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I don't know if you noticed, this week actually

1375
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Was the first week that they started offering

1376
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I guess over here, I thought they were available

1377
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Over here already, but

1378
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I thought we mentioned 64 games on the virtual console

1379
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I thought we mentioned it last week's show

1380
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't remember, maybe we didn't

1381
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Because I remember getting into a conversation about

1382
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
No, I guess not, if they just came out on Monday

1383
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet

1384
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, no, I saw that they were there

1385
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I haven't downloaded any yet

1386
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Because I'm still on my stupid little

1387
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm not downloading anything else kit

1388
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Well seriously, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?

1389
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And

1390
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Here's the thing, well

1391
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
There is one thing that will break it

1392
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
When the whole mission comes out, I have to get it

1393
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I have to

1394
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64

1395
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So that'll be the thing that gets me to break

1396
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But that didn't come out yet

1397
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So we'll see

1398
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I never agreed to do it

1399
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2

1400
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I probably won't even remember to download it

1401
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday

1402
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I won't ever hear it's out

1403
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But now that I said that, I'll get a million emails

1404
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
From listeners saying, hey Rob

1405
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Did you break your thing yet?

1406
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Well the whole mission came out today

1407
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Jerk

1408
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Seriously though, when are they gonna, they're probably gonna make this big announcement

1409
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
At E3, it's like, yes

1410
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We're gonna have a storage solution

1411
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You know, we totally never announced this before

1412
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
At Christmas, or you're gonna have to buy this new system to get it

1413
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah, you're gonna have to buy, yeah

1414
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Ugh

1415
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Hate them

1416
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Hate them all

1417
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I love Nintendo

1418
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Because we have Choaniki

1419
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Whatever

1420
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So

1421
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
There's this new game

1422
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's kind of exciting

1423
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I guess

1424
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Since it does have Excite in the name

1425
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Excitebots Trick Racing

1426
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's coming out on the Nintendo Wii

1427
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
April 20th

1428
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And no one seems to know

1429
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
What it is

1430
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's so crazy

1431
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
What exactly is ExciteTruck

1432
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Or ExciteBots

1433
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It is being made by the people that did ExciteTruck

1434
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And the ExciteBike

1435
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Or franchises

1436
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I've never heard this game, this is completely

1437
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
No, this is, I've never, this is a shock

1438
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Completely new news to me

1439
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Complete utter shock to me

1440
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Okay, no, really, I have heard about this

1441
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And it's funny that no one seems to know

1442
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What the game is about

1443
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And

1444
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Probably better that they don't

1445
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I mean

1446
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as like

1447
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The bots battle each other or something

1448
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Like it's a racing like robot

1449
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Thing where they actually like a

1450
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Mech thing, it wouldn't be that stupid would it

1451
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Yeah

1452
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It wouldn't be like, you know, that they took

1453
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This awesome racing game

1454
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And said, hey you know what would be awesome instead

1455
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Of making a, I don't know, a sequel to it

1456
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And just not really changing anything

1457
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But adding some more tracks

1458
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
How about we just take the whole game, take a shit

1459
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
On it and turn it into a party game

1460
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Ha ha

1461
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And then we have ExciteBots

1462
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
No, they wouldn't do anything like that at all

1463
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh god, I hope not, in fact

1464
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It would be crazy like, you know, they could have

1465
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
A weird synopsis for it or something

1466
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Um, just trying to think of what exactly

1467
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We would say

1468
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Ha ha

1469
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Um, I don't know

1470
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Um, make something up

1471
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Try to make up what a possible synopsis

1472
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
For ExciteBots

1473
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Might read

1474
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
ExciteBots, um, let me think here

1475
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Um

1476
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Um

1477
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Uh, let's see

1478
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
If I were to guess

1479
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
An ExciteBots

1480
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Trick racing synopsis

1481
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I would say that ExciteBots

1482
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Trick racing takes the big air thrills

1483
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And simple controls of ExciteTruck

1484
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And ramps up the fun with a non-stop

1485
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Barrage of funky challenges and minigames

1486
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Performed at a blinding speed

1487
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself

1488
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Shooting goals, throwing pies

1489
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Even playing poker in the middle of racing

1490
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Robotic animals, insects

1491
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Around off-road tracks

1492
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
God damn, Loki

1493
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You are one hell of an improv artist

1494
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I know, it's so crazy

1495
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
How poetic in your description

1496
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And I also might say that it would support two to six players

1497
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Over Wi-Fi

1498
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Why can't you be that eloquent normally?

1499
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I just don't have it in me

1500
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You just got excited about it

1501
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You're just too full of cheese

1502
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Sadly enough, I do want to play this game

1503
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'm scared

1504
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That they fucked this up

1505
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And it's like

1506
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I've been waiting so long for an ExciteTruck

1507
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Sequel

1508
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And I know they fucked this up

1509
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's like, you can't fuck this up

1510
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You just do the same thing, put out the same damn game

1511
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Just change the tracks, add different cars

1512
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You don't have to do anything

1513
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's sold okay

1514
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But I know they fucked this up

1515
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And it's really scaring me

1516
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So I'm loading up this

1517
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
To read this comment in chat

1518
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Um

1519
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
X-Link says Excitebox

1520
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It will make you shit your pants

1521
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week

1522
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That Flash game

1523
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Don't shit your pants

1524
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That's my favorite

1525
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
New little sound I've heard in a Flash game

1526
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about

1527
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Um

1528
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Anyhow

1529
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Comments from chat, I'm sorry

1530
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
No more comments from chat

1531
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Tigerclass says why can't they do a sequel to ExciteBike

1532
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
ExciteBike

1533
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Not ExciteTruck, but ExciteBike

1534
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Um, they could do that

1535
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ExciteTruck with ExciteBikes in there

1536
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh my god, look at that

1537
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It's expanding on the franchise

1538
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Do it like MotorStorm, I mean come on

1539
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh no

1540
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
People that play the Wii don't want to actually play a real game

1541
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
They want to play another fucking party game

1542
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Because where will they get party games on the way

1543
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They're just not available

1544
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
GS68 suggests ExcitePants

1545
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Mix the magic of ExciteTruck with the

1546
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Suspense of don't shit your pants

1547
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The game and you have ExcitePants

1548
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm, I'm, let me put it this way

1549
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
We have a toilet at one end of the course

1550
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm still gonna play this game

1551
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm still gonna try it out

1552
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm just, the description so far

1553
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And the fact that I haven't seen any

1554
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Screenshots

1555
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Or know anything about it

1556
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It kind of scares me right now

1557
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But I don't understand how playing poker

1558
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And driving really fast

1559
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Correlate with each other

1560
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It makes no sense to me

1561
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You can always give this game the wife test

1562
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Does the wife like it?

1563
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yes, that's definitely gonna happen

1564
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Uh, hey, other news

1565
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
About the Nintendo Wii, now this sounds

1566
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Thank god, a lot different and I'm sure it's gonna

1567
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Get a lot of people very happy and I don't know how you feel

1568
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
About this one, Loki

1569
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It was recently trademarked here in America

1570
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Final Fantasy IV The After Years

1571
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And that's a cell phone series

1572
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Over in Japan, well guess what?

1573
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It has been announced this week

1574
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That it's going to be coming out for

1575
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The Wii, well I guess it hasn't really been announced

1576
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But the ESRB has rated the title

1577
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
An E on the Wii

1578
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So, uh, there you go

1579
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Final Fantasy IV The After Years

1580
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Apparently getting somewhat confirmed

1581
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
For the Nintendo Wii

1582
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So, that probably won't be

1583
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Any mini games, I don't think it was over in Japan

1584
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And I think, if I remember correctly

1585
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I think the one in Japan was actually like

1586
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
In the Final Fantasy IV engine

1587
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I think so, because it was a cell phone game

1588
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So I'm kind of curious to see if they

1589
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Still keep it looking like that on the Wii

1590
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It could be a download thing

1591
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Like it might be WiiWare, it might not necessarily be a disc

1592
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It could be something that's gonna be released

1593
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's gonna be WiiWare, that's what it was supposed to be

1594
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That could be kind of cool then, because it could be

1595
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Like in the style of Mega Man 9, right?

1596
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
That'd be cool

1597
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So, that

1598
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That could also be something that

1599
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Makes me want to break my little

1600
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Band, even though my hard drive

1601
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Is completely full

1602
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Come on, if they

1603
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Fuck this up

1604
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm out for blood

1605
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You heard it here first

1606
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Alright, so there you go, Final Fantasy IV The After Years

1607
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I want to definitely check that out

1608
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well, there's a

1609
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Device that we've discussed on the show

1610
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
A number of times, and I have

1611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
One myself in the family of it

1612
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Which I will not name nor say

1613
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Or let anyone know where

1614
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm hiding it, because I actually just found

1615
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It while I was cleaning it

1616
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah, I can't find my DS

1617
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Thingy

1618
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
No, I can't find my DS, too

1619
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And the thingy that's in the DS

1620
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I found my thingy

1621
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I found the thingy in the box

1622
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
What thingy?

1623
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Okay, I have a Ninja Pass

1624
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I have not used it, I have nothing on it

1625
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I have a 4DS and an M3

1626
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And I put tons of pirated games on both of them

1627
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But, to be honest, I haven't played my DS

1628
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
In forever, so much so that it's

1629
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Buried in a room somewhere, so

1630
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Back to my story

1631
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And it's funny that you mentioned the R4

1632
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That's why I bought it, too

1633
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Because, you know

1634
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The R4

1635
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Is now officially outlawed

1636
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
In Japan

1637
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You cannot, um

1638
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There's actually an injunction

1639
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Filed against the Chinese

1640
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Um, manufacturer

1641
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Put out by the Tokyo District Court

1642
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And, um

1643
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It's now illegal to sell

1644
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Anywhere in Japan

1645
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Um

1646
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
In fact, there, you can't find them

1647
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
In stores anymore, at all

1648
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Um, Squeenix

1649
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Capcom, Nintendo

1650
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Um

1651
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
You know, the big guys, they're

1652
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Saying that, you know

1653
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That because of the illegal sales

1654
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Um, you know, they're gonna also make

1655
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Sure that they're gonna

1656
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Try to, you know, knock down anyone

1657
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Who's selling the other types that are like

1658
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
The R4

1659
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Um, but

1660
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Who knows, the other countries might be

1661
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Following suit

1662
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Interesting

1663
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
We haven't heard about a lot of

1664
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Devices getting banned over there, so this is

1665
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Uh, and now, now

1666
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Loki, you're breaking the law

1667
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Of another country, but

1668
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Boo hoo

1669
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Rob

1670
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You see that cup

1671
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
On the floor? What?

1672
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You get caned for that in Singapore

1673
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh gee, oh no

1674
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So you're breaking the law of another country

1675
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It doesn't matter, like I said, you know, I

1676
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I don't even play

1677
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
My DS right now

1678
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Or my PSP

1679
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Uh, out of curiosity, is there anyone

1680
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
In chat who owns one of these who thinks

1681
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
This is, uh, you know, interesting

1682
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Surprising? Are you

1683
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Scared? Cause now you have one, or are you just

1684
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Like, whatever

1685
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm totally not surprised, to be honest

1686
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yeah, I know, it's not, it's not totally surprising

1687
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But, uh, you know

1688
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Oh well, there's nothing

1689
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
In, you know, unfortunately with the

1690
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Um, DS, they can't really flash it to

1691
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You know, not work

1692
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
With, or to basically

1693
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Break it or anything, they can't do any firmware updates

1694
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like they can with the, uh, PSP

1695
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Or whatever it means, they'll stop selling it

1696
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Or if you'll still be able to get them over here

1697
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Um

1698
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get

1699
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Um, in fact, when I was

1700
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Buying mine, um

1701
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
They were pretty hard to get

1702
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And

1703
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You know, they were starting to pull them off, you know

1704
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Shelves online

1705
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And stuff like that, so that

1706
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know, they wouldn't get in any lawsuit

1707
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Trouble, but, uh, luckily

1708
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I got both of mine, actually the M3

1709
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And the R4 are almost identical

1710
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
In fact, I think there's like one little point

1711
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That you change on each chip that

1712
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You can convert them back and forth

1713
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And, um

1714
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I don't know, they work okay

1715
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You know, the one I bought, the M3 for

1716
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
For Game Boy Advance

1717
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Homebrew stuff, because there was this one

1718
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other

1719
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Like Zelda type game that I wanted to try out, that was kinda cool

1720
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Um

1721
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I haven't really played any ROMs

1722
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
For the Game Boy Advance stuff

1723
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Not really interested in that

1724
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And, uh, DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out

1725
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Every now and then, but really nothing holds my

1726
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Interest for

1727
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Hardly any time, so I don't

1728
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I just don't see the point in spending, you know, 20 bucks

1729
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
On, you know, each of these games

1730
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And that's on a cheap game, you know

1731
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Unless you get something Square Enix, which is like

1732
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
$40 for a fucking DS game

1733
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Which is retarded

1734
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Um, I just can't see myself

1735
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only gonna

1736
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Play for a few hours and just kinda throw

1737
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
You know, to the side

1738
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's just my own thing, economy's tough, you know what

1739
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And I wasn't gonna buy your game anyways, so

1740
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But hey, I spend

1741
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
My money, I spend plenty of money on

1742
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Other things, you know, like I said

1743
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
You know, what, the last week or so

1744
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Or a couple weeks ago, I

1745
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Five copies of Lost and Damned, so

1746
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You know, I'm paying my money

1747
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Alright, let's move on with more news, we gotta wrap up Part A

1748
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Get to Part B tonight

1749
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yes, um, so

1750
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Kind of a game that I like

1751
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Um, you know

1752
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Saints Row, well, another

1753
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Guy, a music artist

1754
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
That has broken into the game genre as well

1755
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
50 Cent is actually

1756
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Looking to option

1757
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Saints Row for a movie

1758
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Now

1759
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
This sounds like an okay

1760
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Idea to me, but

1761
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Not that great, I don't know

1762
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
There are some actual characters in Saints

1763
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Row, so it works, but then again

1764
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
The whole game is very sandbox-ish

1765
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And you can make your own

1766
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You know, main characters, so

1767
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Designing who the main character

1768
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Is gonna be is a little bit tough, I think

1769
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But as far as an actual storyline goes

1770
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's kind of compelling, there is one

1771
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But, I don't know

1772
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I think that type, anything that's

1773
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Sandbox-ish, as far as

1774
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Gameplay goes, it's gonna be very hard to

1775
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Um, make

1776
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
A movie out of, but

1777
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Anyways, he's interested in it

1778
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
He says, according to

1779
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
50 Cent

1780
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
He said that his

1781
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Relationship with THQ

1782
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Is very good, and

1783
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
You'll see Saints Row, he's

1784
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Optioning the rights for that right now

1785
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as

1786
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Blood on the Sand

1787
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
You know, Blood on the Sand, I think to be honest

1788
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Is just

1789
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Fun, that's the whole point, it wasn't like

1790
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
He was trying to be serious, I think it was just fun

1791
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Speaking of plot and movies

1792
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And something that didn't make our show

1793
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before

1794
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
The show about this, have you heard about

1795
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
How horrifically the new

1796
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Street Fighter movie is doing, apparently it has a

1797
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
0% on Rotten Tomatoes

1798
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Right now, oh I would believe it, I mean

1799
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It looks like crap, I'm sorry

1800
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I, one of my live journal friends went

1801
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And saw it and said it is worse than the original

1802
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine

1803
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, that was actually a ringing

1804
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Endorsement to me, I love bad movies

1805
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Now I kind of want to go see it

1806
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It's out? Yeah, it just came out on Friday

1807
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I completely forgot about it

1808
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I wonder how terrible it did at the box office

1809
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Because box office numbers come out

1810
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Let me go look

1811
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It was pretty much

1812
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Street Fighter the movie this week

1813
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And Jonas Brothers

1814
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
In 3D

1815
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Okay, Madea Goes to Jail

1816
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Was the number one movie this week

1817
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
With 16.5 million bucks

1818
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Jonas Brothers

1819
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
12.7 million, which they say was

1820
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus

1821
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Movie a few months ago

1822
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Slumdog Millionaire 12.1 million

1823
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But it just won the Oscar

1824
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So it was not in the top 3

1825
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Nor was it 4

1826
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
5 or 6

1827
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Or 7

1828
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Street Fighter came out its opening weekend

1829
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Number 8

1830
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
4.6 million dollars

1831
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What did it beat? Confessions of a Shopaholic

1832
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
In its third week of release

1833
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Ah, Friday the 13th

1834
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
In its third week of release

1835
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Fired Up in its second week of release

1836
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Ah, but what beat it?

1837
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Paul Blart

1838
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Mall Cop in its seventh week of release

1839
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Hey, made more money than Street Fighter

1840
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The Legend of Chun-Li in its seventh week

1841
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Of release

1842
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie

1843
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So we don't need to make fun of that

1844
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's Street

1845
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Okay, it's a Street Fighter movie

1846
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That has like

1847
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Hardly any

1848
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Characters in it that, you know, make any

1849
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Sense, you know, Bison doesn't even look like

1850
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Bison

1851
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Balrog is, I don't even know what

1852
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Kinda character he's supposed to be playing

1853
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And Chun-Li doesn't even look like Chun-Li

1854
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And the plot's just like

1855
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Huh?

1856
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I hope they all do their pose

1857
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
At the end though, that was the best part of the first movie

1858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Alright, well hey

1859
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Speaking of game movies, a good

1860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Game movie, I think anyway, a lot of people

1861
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Disagree with me, but one of the better ones

1862
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
In many many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill

1863
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Was, you know, a video game movie

1864
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
That came out, I liked it, we all

1865
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Generally liked it right here, I saw it four times in the

1866
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Theater, you really liked it, I saw it twice

1867
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Loki liked it, yeah, so I think we can all

1868
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Agree that the Silent Hill movie's pretty awesome

1869
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And of course

1870
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
We love the series of games, love the series

1871
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Of games, well guess what, maybe not so much

1872
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The last few, but yeah, well

1873
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I didn't think they were terrible, but

1874
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Anyway, obviously one of the best ones

1875
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Was the first one, and guess what

1876
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Since we're talking about remaking games

1877
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
For the Wii, a WiiMake if you will

1878
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
There's been lots of these types of

1879
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
WiiMakes coming out recently, now most of them

1880
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Granted have just been old GameCube games getting new

1881
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Controls, but what if they were to remake

1882
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The original PlayStation Silent Hill

1883
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Game on the Nintendo Wii

1884
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
With extra fog?

1885
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Hopefully, you know why they did the fog

1886
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Why, cause loading or something?

1887
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Uh, well anyway

1888
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This is coming

1889
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
From a report from VG

1890
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
24-7, apparently Konami

1891
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Is planning a port

1892
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Of the Silent Hill game

1893
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
For the Wii, also coming to the

1894
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
PSP as well, Climax

1895
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
The folks who did Silent Hill

1896
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new

1897
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Remake, so that could be interesting

1898
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
You know, I'm surprised that Climax

1899
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Has an exactly optioned

1900
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
N-Spaces engine that they use for

1901
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The game that's not ever coming out

1902
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Unfortunately, Winter, cause remember

1903
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That game looked very much Silent Hill

1904
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Wonder if they're using it, though

1905
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
You gotta wonder, maybe that's part of

1906
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Why they're doing this on the Wii

1907
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Is maybe the folks at Konami saw this

1908
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And was like, hey, we want you to

1909
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really

1910
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Good idea, why don't you redo the

1911
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
First story, or something like that, you know?

1912
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Could be

1913
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Remake the first one is a test of your skill

1914
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Could be, huh?

1915
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Why don't they just make a new one?

1916
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Well, maybe they want the new ones to be

1917
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
On the 360 in PlayStation 3

1918
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Stop remaking shit, seriously!

1919
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I want a remake

1920
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I wouldn't mind a remake in the first game

1921
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake

1922
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Here's the thing, it could be a remake

1923
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Like a new play control remake

1924
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Yoink, yoink, yoink, whatever, right?

1925
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero

1926
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Which is an awesome remake

1927
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I hate to interrupt real quick

1928
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But I'm so glad that the

1929
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Monitor obstructed the camera's view

1930
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Of the gesture that you just made

1931
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Why? What'd I do?

1932
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh, yeah

1933
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
That's why we have the big monitor here

1934
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It censors my hand when I do things like that

1935
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
So no one can see Rob fapping

1936
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Alright, look

1937
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You know I have to derail it

1938
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Alright

1939
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Silent Hill, we want it

1940
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You know other stuff we want?

1941
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Punch out!

1942
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Nah, I just want to punch

1943
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So, so

1944
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Getting this

1945
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii

1946
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And little Mac looks like he

1947
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
All done grown up

1948
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
He actually looks kind of mean in this picture

1949
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So um

1950
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
We will be getting some um

1951
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Punch out and hopefully

1952
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That we will get like King Hippo and

1953
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
You know Glass Joe and all of those

1954
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I hope they make new characters though, I mean

1955
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I'm sure we're gonna get new characters

1956
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I think they'll have to be some new characters

1957
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I will bet you, I will bet you there are not

1958
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
New characters in this, I bet you it's just the remake

1959
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Of the first game

1960
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Really? You think they'd be that bold?

1961
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I think they'd be that lazy, yes

1962
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I do think that they'd be that lazy

1963
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I hope not

1964
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm sorry, I have no

1965
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Optimism in Nintendo anymore

1966
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh snap

1967
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Uh, GameGuru seems to

1968
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Kind of have that same skepticism saying I'll wait for

1969
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Reviews before getting Punch Out

1970
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
From our chatroom, chat.orangeandredo.com

1971
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good

1972
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But I just- You know what I say to your skepticism

1973
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Huh

1974
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Fine, say that all you want

1975
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
But it's gonna happen the way I said it

1976
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So, Tigerclaw making an

1977
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Interesting point in chatroom regarding remakes

1978
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
In this whole discussion, kind of talking about

1979
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Hollywood remakes, Tigerclaw says

1980
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake the Never

1981
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Ending story, yes I did hear that this

1982
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Week, and geez Louise

1983
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Come up with a new idea, no

1984
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Exactly, no no no no no

1985
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
You do not remake the Never Ending story

1986
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Cause they weren't that great, I mean they were

1987
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Okay, but the first movie is epic

1988
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
If you're a kid though

1989
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Is that great, it remains epic

1990
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
The other two

1991
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
The second one had the guy who played the Flash

1992
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
As the dad

1993
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's always why I like that, because I kind of

1994
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Loved that show

1995
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Even though it failed

1996
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
But I can do without a remake

1997
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Come on

1998
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
If you can actually understand her name

1999
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Say my name

2000
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It won't make a point, you know

2001
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Say my name

2002
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You never understand what the hell he's saying

2003
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Anyway, forget it

2004
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Couple more stories and we'll get to part B

2005
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Classic Game of the Week coming up as well

2006
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Maybe that's her name, it's foreign

2007
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What?

2008
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So this week to coincide with the movie release

2009
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2010
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
PlayStation Network and PC will be

2011
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh

2012
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
The kind of prequels to

2013
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
The whole Watchmen storyline

2014
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And it will be sold for a

2015
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Whopping $20

2016
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Or 1600 Microsoft points

2017
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
On Xbox Live Arcade

2018
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That sounds a bit expensive to me

2019
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But it's supposed to be pretty good

2020
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It's kind of a brawler type game

2021
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But

2022
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
20 bucks, really?

2023
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm gonna wait

2024
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
This movie is also not getting some good early reviews

2025
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Although a lot of people

2026
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
There's lots of fanboys with big big boners for Watchmen

2027
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
You know, I'm interested to see it

2028
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
But you know, I don't know

2029
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It looks okay

2030
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It looks okay

2031
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'd see it, but not opening day

2032
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it

2033
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I mean, the story's interesting

2034
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But it's not like, oh my god, this is the best

2035
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Novel ever, you know, this is the best

2036
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Graphic novel ever, ever

2037
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Cause if that's the best graphic novel

2038
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That there ever was

2039
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Thank god, graphic novels suck

2040
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I mean, cause seriously

2041
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That is where you're setting the bar

2042
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I don't think so

2043
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Alright, well we'll see

2044
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
One more story for you guys

2045
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And we'll get to the classic game of the week

2046
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And it has to do with EA

2047
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Could EA possibly be making their own music game soon?

2048
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And you might be thinking

2049
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Well, don't they already kind of do rock band?

2050
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well, yeah, but they more distribute a game

2051
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That Harmonix is making

2052
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Here's the interesting thing

2053
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
EA apparently, it was their chief operating officer

2054
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
John Pleasence

2055
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Made a statement at the Goldman Sachs

2056
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Technology and Internet Conference

2057
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Quote, when we look back five years

2058
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
The fantasy of being a rock star

2059
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
By punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen

2060
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Is going to be one implementation

2061
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
In what is going to be a very large category

2062
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
There are lots of other things you can do with music

2063
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And we're working on interesting things

2064
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And we know our competition

2065
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Is working on interesting things

2066
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So, what exactly are they working on?

2067
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
However, he went on to say

2068
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We're not in any position to announce anything

2069
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I think it's a robust category

2070
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Over the coming years

2071
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There will hopefully be lots of things

2072
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
We will do in the music category

2073
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So, could EA be up to something?

2074
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Of course they're up to something

2075
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Music games are, you know

2076
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Selling like crazy right now

2077
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Of course they're trying to get another piece of that

2078
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So, I'm sure they're trying to think of something

2079
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We have some very interesting music gaming news

2080
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Coming up a little later in part B of our show

2081
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But first, we're about to our commercial break

2082
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Or, not really commercial break

2083
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But a free break of music here on Orange LA

2084
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And before we get to that though

2085
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
We're going to get to our classic game of the week

2086
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Because we always like to pay respects

2087
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
To a classic video game here at the end of part A every week

2088
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So, to do that, DarkSakura

2089
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Is going to dig through the gaming archives

2090
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And find a game that she thinks is worthy

2091
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Of being the classic game of the week

2092
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

2093
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
The classic game of the week is Parasol Stars

2094
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Which is a fun little game

2095
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Did you ever play Parasol Stars, Rob?

2096
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yes, I did actually

2097
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Parasol Stars is actually the...

2098
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's in the series of Bubble Bobble

2099
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
A direct sequel to Rainbow Islands

2100
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Where you basically use your parasols

2101
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
To gather raindrops

2102
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Which you can shoot out at your little enemies

2103
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
You can bop them

2104
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Or you can protect yourself from the enemies

2105
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
With your little parasol

2106
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And it was actually the first one to never have an arcade release

2107
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It came out on the PC Engine in Japan

2108
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And then we got it thanks to Working Designs

2109
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I never realized it was never an arcade game

2110
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
We got it from Working Designs though

2111
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
In the US who was responsible for bringing us tons of different

2112
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Really awesome games from Japan

2113
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Like they gave us Ray Earth

2114
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Silhouette Mirage

2115
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Didn't they do Radiant Silver Gun?

2116
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I don't remember

2117
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
They were responsible? No

2118
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But at any rate, it's you know

2119
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Oh yeah, another game that I covered on the show

2120
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Was Brainfart

2121
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Popful Mail

2122
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But anyway, back to Parasol Stars

2123
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So yeah, this is a Taito game

2124
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Came out in 1991

2125
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And you play as Bub and Bob

2126
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But you play as their human counterparts

2127
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Which would be...

2128
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The same characters from Rainbow Islands

2129
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands, Bubby and Bobby

2130
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
What creative names

2131
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It was only out on TurboGrafx

2132
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well?

2133
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I could be wrong

2134
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Sorry sorry, my bad

2135
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So basically Parasol Stars though

2136
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
It was sort of retconned out of their continuity

2137
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons

2138
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
For Bubble Symphony and all those

2139
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony

2140
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And so Parasol Stars is considered sort of a side story

2141
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
A guide and a side story

2142
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
To the whole bubble world

2143
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You know

2144
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
At any rate, like I said

2145
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You can get different items

2146
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You can also

2147
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
You have to collect these star items

2148
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
As you go through that lets you access

2149
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
These other planets

2150
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets

2151
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So that you can get all the stuff to save the world

2152
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So you have 10 rounds on each planet

2153
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And there's a boss on each one

2154
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Except on level 30

2155
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Wait, wrong, sorry

2156
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But when you get the star items

2157
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You have access to two other planets

2158
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
One that's around Bubble Bobble

2159
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And one around another game called Jack and Pop

2160
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They're not available on the main screen

2161
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
You actually have to get stuff to unlock it

2162
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And then

2163
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You have the final boss

2164
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Who is the one responsible for stealing all the color

2165
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
From the world

2166
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And

2167
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Is like the uber boss of everything

2168
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And so you get the true ending that way

2169
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So like I said

2170
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You gather the drops, you can throw them

2171
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And if you gather like

2172
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Five drops

2173
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Then you can just do the smack down with a big

2174
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Kick ass

2175
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Attack

2176
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So

2177
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh also each of the drops has a different elemental theme

2178
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So that's pretty cool

2179
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
But yeah

2180
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
As far as I'm aware

2181
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I think this did

2182
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I think it came out on

2183
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
The Amiga

2184
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
If I remember correctly

2185
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
The Atari ST

2186
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
There's a Game Boy version

2187
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
The NES

2188
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I want to say

2189
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And

2190
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Of course the

2191
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Turbo Graphics 16

2192
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Or PC Engine

2193
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
But yeah I think this came out on the

2194
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
NES

2195
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Which is probably its most notable version

2196
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Is the Turbo Graphics one

2197
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
There you go

2198
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Alright

2199
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
There you go

2200
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Parasol Star is your classic game of the week

2201
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
If you're a fan of Bubble Bobble

2202
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Right in the same series

2203
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So check that out

2204
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Alright that's going to bring Part A of Orange Lounge Radio

Game look tonight

2209
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
What game are you looking at on Justin TV tonight Loki?

2210
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000

01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
This is going to be the game we're looking at on Justin TV

2212
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
During the break tonight

2213

Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2216
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
On this lovely Sunday evening

2217
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
March the 1st of 2009

2218
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Here for our 315th episode

2219
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2220
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Which we've been looking at a game

2221
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Here in studio on Justin TV

2222
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Eat Lead

2223
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
How's this game been going for you Loki?

2224
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's going okay

2225
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I haven't been watching a lot of this on

2226
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Justin TV

2227
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I was running the house during the break

2228
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I was trying to get to a

2229
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Save point real quick

2230
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Did I just die?

2231
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I think you did because you turned your back

2232
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
When something was going ahead

2233
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I haven't really been paying attention

2234
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Well I'll pause it for later

2235
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Alright maybe we'll look at it a little more

2236
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Actually no I'm not going to pause it I'm going to quit

2237
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Alright we got some

2238
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
News we're going to get back into here on part B

2239
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
We got to wait for Loki to get set up here

2240
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
So um

2241
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I don't know how do we kill time at this point

2242
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Loki I need you to

2243
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Be here to start reading news at the top of the show

2244
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
What are we going to do?

2245
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Alright we're

2246
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Resetting back up Justin TV if you're joining us

2247
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Here on this Sunday night

2248
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Justin TV slash Orange Launch Radio

2249
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
If you want to see us live

2250
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Taping the show

2251
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And of course you can always join our chat room as well

2252
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

2253
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Oh thank you

2254
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Breslull is there in chat and is reminding me

2255
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight

2256
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
That is Orange Launch Radio

2257
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
U.S. All March Madness is going on right now

2258
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And some surprising

2259
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Not ties but some surprising votes

2260
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Going on right now

2261
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Orange Launch Radio U.S. All March Madness

2262
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
If I remember right last time I looked

2263
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time

2264
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Which is certainly a controversial

2265
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Little match up going on right now

2266
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But what's interesting is that there will be

2267
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Three things in the

2268
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Or three Zelda games in the top eight

2269
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
If um

2270
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
The voting does

2271
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Go in Zelda Ocarina of Time

2272
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Favor because I think right now

2273
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The Legend of Zelda and

2274
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Link to the Past

2275
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Are both ahead as well

2276
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Could be very interesting

2277
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
How that all plays out

2278
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
So again if you want to participate in that you can go to our forums

2279
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast

2280
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It will already be down to eight

2281
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening

2282
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They're at the Sweet 16 right now

2283
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So check that out

2284
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Alright

2285
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Almost done Loki?

2286
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Alright

2287
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
He's just plugging the computer back in getting ready to do

2288
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The encoding for JustDB

2289
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You want to do an email real fast?

2290
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Sure why not?

2291
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Do a preliminary mailbag?

2292
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yes because then that means there will be less to read later

2293
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Alright sure well let's start off with an email

2294
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I don't have the music though so uh just read an email

2295
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I have to read this because it's super amusing

2296
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
This is an email from Sauce

2297
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Alrighty

2298
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Hey OLR I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people

2299
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So I thought I would share

2300
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
A sad but true story with you

2301
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
To make it video game related

2302
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Imagine Super Mario Brothers music playing in the background

2303
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Uh I might be able to arrange that actually

2304
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Okay

2305
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm sorry this is actually so funny that I do want to read it right away

2306
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Okay

2307
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Um on Friday afternoon I was at UNLV

2308
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Heading to my graphic design class

2309
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
From the second floor of the building

2310
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
This hallway is open air

2311
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You can see the major street

2312
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
In front of the university

2313
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
As I was heading into class

2314
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I witnessed a car accident

2315
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
An old smaller size pickup truck rear-ended

2316
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
An orange new beetle

2317
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
A loud sound

2318
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened

2319
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
As we watched the beetle pulled into the parking lot

2320
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
In front of our building

2321
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
The pickup truck sat there for about a minute

2322
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Without pulling out of the street

2323
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And then once the beetle's owner had gotten out of his car

2324
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
The truck made a u-turn and sped off down the street

2325
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We were obviously quite appalled by this

2326
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
But what could be done

2327
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate

2328
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver

2329
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
LOOK

2330
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
And pointed to the street

2331
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And it became over music

2332
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Because in the middle of the street

2333
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Where the accident had occurred

2334
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Laid the front bumper of the truck

2335
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
With the license plate still attached

2336
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
The beetle owner called the police

2337
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And a few of us gave a statement to the police officer

2338
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
About the accident

2339
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
We don't know

2340
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
We don't know why the guy in the truck took off

2341
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Maybe he didn't have insurance

2342
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Or maybe he had outstanding tickets

2343
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story

2344
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Is that if you're going to turn

2345
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
A car accident that you were responsible for

2346
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Into a felony hit and run

2347
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You might want to make sure that you don't leave

2348
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Any incriminating evidence behind

2349
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Like your bumper and your license plate

2350
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face

2351
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
When he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind

2352
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Cheers, Lauren

2353
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
That was worthwhile

2354
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news

2355
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
That was a good story

2356
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Loki, yes

2357
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So

2358
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
There's some interesting stuff

2359
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
We've heard some controversy before

2360
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
About Xbox Live names and

2361
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Profiles, etc. containing

2362
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Different things and getting accounts banned

2363
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Including

2364
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
There was one that someone had made

2365
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
That was to the effect of

2366
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Gay gamer or something like that

2367
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And they got banned because of the word

2368
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Gay in there

2369
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
There was a guy named Richard

2370
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Which was his actual name

2371
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
And he ended up getting banned as well

2372
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Because gay was in the name

2373
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Well now we have a self-identified lesbian

2374
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Being banned from Xbox Live

2375
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Because in her

2376
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I guess

2377
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Profile it said that she was a lesbian

2378
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And so

2379
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Apparently

2380
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
That rubbed someone the wrong way

2381
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So she got banned

2382
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And

2383
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Now of course people

2384
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
All are kind of up in arms

2385
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
About the whole thing and

2386
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Apparently

2387
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Microsoft's Steven Toulouse

2388
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
An Xbox Live team member

2389
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Has made a post on his

2390
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Personal blog regarding the situation

2391
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes

2392
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And also

2393
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I guess Glad is waiting on the story

2394
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
As well, so

2395
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well, I just

2396
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I'll link it in the chatroom, I blogged about

2397
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
This actually yesterday

2398
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I have choice things to say about

2399
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
The way this was handled

2400
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And I think Inelegant does not

2401
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Even remotely

2402
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Touch what a crying shame it was

2403
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So

2404
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I won't say more than that

2405
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Basically the whole situation was

2406
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
As Microsoft noted

2407
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
In a statement they said

2408
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
That users may not create a gamertag

2409
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Or use text in any

2410
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Profile field that includes

2411
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Comments that look, sound, like

2412
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate

2413
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Or insinuate

2414
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Content of a potentially sexual nature

2415
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Profiles that do are asked

2416
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
To change the language and are suspended

2417
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Until changes are made

2418
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And it says, I guess

2419
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
The company also states it does not allow

2420
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Gamertags or profiles to identify any form

2421
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Of sexual orientation

2422
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage

2423
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Nor their code of conduct

2424
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Nothing

2425
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I read the entire

2426
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Both of them

2427
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
There is not a single thing

2428
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
In the terms of usage

2429
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Or in the code of conduct

2430
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
On Xbox.com

2431
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Nothing, zero

2432
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Zilch

2433
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I don't know, you'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this

2434
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You know, being the gay one on the show

2435
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
But I don't know

2436
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things

2437
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
There's a lot of these things on blog posts

2438
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
That, you know, kind of take it and run

2439
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Tend to be, I kind of feel like it might be one of those things

2440
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
That's being blown horrifically out of proportion

2441
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Like there just might be something

2442
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Else going on

2443
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I don't know, for all we know

2444
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
For all we know, she could have been

2445
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live

2446
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We don't know

2447
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Basically what was going on

2448
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Did you actually read her post on the consumerist?

2449
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Yeah, I read all the things on the consumerist

2450
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But the consumerist is also not

2451
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Widely known for always doing complete research

2452
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
According to other sites

2453
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But I'm saying from her post

2454
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Yeah, I saw her post

2455
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Well, the thing is that I've seen people on

2456
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Xbox Live do this

2457
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I've seen just, you know, blatant

2458
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Harassment going on

2459
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And, you know, people are like that

2460
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You know, outside of the virtual environment

2461
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Oh, don't get me wrong

2462
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
That's totally inexcusable

2463
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And should definitely be dealt with

2464
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But there's no reason why someone

2465
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Shouldn't be able to, I mean

2466
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I actually agree that, you know

2467
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It shouldn't matter in the end

2468
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But, you know, if she's

2469
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Proud of it, why not have something

2470
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
In her, you know, what is said

2471
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
On the terms of usage on

2472
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Xbox Live was, and this is

2473
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Item number five, how you may not

2474
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Use the service

2475
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Create a gamertag avatar or use text

2476
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
In other profile fields that may offend

2477
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Other members, that's what it said

2478
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So basically

2479
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's, you know

2480
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It can be summarized as

2481
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
The Xbox Live powers

2482
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
That be saying, oh

2483
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Being gay is offensive

2484
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Because they're all offended

2485
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That you're a lesbian

2486
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
That's

2487
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
How, you know, that's pretty much

2488
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
How it came out as

2489
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I wonder if any of these people that were harassing her

2490
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Were ever dealt with

2491
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
If they were ever punished

2492
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response

2493
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
To this whole thing, they say

2494
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
In the Xbox Live terms of use

2495
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
A member may not create a gamertag or use

2496
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Text in other profile fields that include

2497
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at

2498
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Abbreviate, or insinuate content

2499
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Of a potentially sexual nature

2500
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Profiles that do are asked to change the language

2501
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And suspended until changes are made

2502
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags

2503
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Or profiles we do not allow expression

2504
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Of any type of orientation, be it

2505
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Hetero or other

2506
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That is not in

2507
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Their terms of usage, in fact

2508
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It's in terms of use right now

2509
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Could it be, make sure you're looking at Xbox Live

2510
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And not Xbox.com, because there probably are

2511
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Different ones

2512
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
There's the Xbox Live terms of use, that's what I went to

2513
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
So, hold on, let me find it real quick

2514
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Because, yeah, I'm curious kind of what, you know

2515
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Why they would say this

2516
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
If it's not something, you know

2517
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And I realize they could be kind of blurring what's really there

2518
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And what it is

2519
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Here's what it says

2520
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Create a gamertag, avatar, or use text in the profile fields

2521
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
That may offend other members

2522
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
That includes comments that look like, sound like

2523
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate

2524
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Or relate to any of the following

2525
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Profane words, phrases, topics

2526
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Or content of a sexual nature

2527
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Hate speech, including but not limited to

2528
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Racial, ethnic, or religious slurs

2529
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Illegal drugs slash controlled substances

2530
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Or illegal activities

2531
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It does not say

2532
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Orientation

2533
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
You know, just because

2534
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Just because, you know, if you put on there

2535
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Lesbian, it's not saying

2536
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Um, it's not the same

2537
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
As exactly saying, I like to fuck chicks

2538
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And now

2539
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
If she, because there were people

2540
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
There were people up there

2541
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Who fully had, you know

2542
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Really sexist comments

2543
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
In their profiles, I've seen them before

2544
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
But, you know

2545
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Nothing about orientation

2546
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
These were all, you know, pretty offensive things

2547
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
You know, what happened to them?

2548
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Why aren't they banned?

2549
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
You know, I don't think

2550
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
That listing your orientation

2551
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Exactly relates to the act of fucking

2552
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Now if she said in there

2553
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Um, I'm a lesbian

2554
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And I like, you know

2555
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Big strap-ons, then I understand

2556
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Just put, I heart scissoring

2557
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Well you're, hey

2558
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I like cutting paper with scissors

2559
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Therefore it's scissoring

2560
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Here's my question

2561
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Is that if they allow her back on the service

2562
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Which is gonna be the inevitable conclusion

2563
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
You know this is what's gonna happen

2564
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Is that Microsoft's gonna have to, you know

2565
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Kinda eat it up on this or whatever

2566
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And let this person back

2567
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Does that mean that Loki could go on and on his profile

2568
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Put, I love lesbians

2569
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
There's nothing wrong with that

2570
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
It's not, you know, slanderous

2571
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Or anything like that, it's just stating

2572
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
What is probably a fact

2573
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Loki, do you love lesbians?

2574
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Some lesbians

2575
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I don't really love or hate them

2576
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Let's just assume Loki wants to put

2577
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
His hands on his profile

2578
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's like bird watching

2579
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
For the matter of argument

2580
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I don't know

2581
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
But do you see what I mean

2582
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
They did not have anything

2583
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
You know, he said in his comment

2584
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Including, you know, orientation

2585
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
You know, listening to that

2586
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
But nowhere in the terms of usage

2587
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That is a blatant lie

2588
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Interesting

2589
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He has lied to the public

2590
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Through MTV News

2591
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It is in print

2592
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
On not just my own blog

2593
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
But on plenty of news sites now

2594
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Where he is a goddamn liar

2595
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
But, I don't know

2596
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I mean, still

2597
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It's not like they are talking to

2598
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
GLAAD about the whole thing

2599
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And the human rights

2600
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Or whatever they're called

2601
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You know, the human rights campaign

2602
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
HRC and all this stuff

2603
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It just seems like if they were that

2604
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
You know, against all this or something

2605
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
You know, in a way

2606
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I'm kind of glad that they're not star star

2607
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Starring it out like Sony does in

2608
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Home

2609
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
It's basically, they have a list

2610
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Of banned words

2611
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
That are considered offensive

2612
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And yeah, they have to unfortunately

2613
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Cover everything

2614
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Including, you know, homo

2615
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And all that stuff

2616
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And that's why they have the gay in there as well

2617
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Because people use it in derogatory fashion

2618
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And lesbian is in there as well

2619
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
That's on this black list

2620
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
But that's what it is

2621
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And because this person had it in their profile

2622
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That's why their account was banned

2623
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever

2624
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
His name is Gaywood, that's his name

2625
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Hers wasn't a random banning

2626
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Hers was banned

2627
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
When she reported

2628
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
The harassment of other people against her

2629
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And they said, oh, well it's because of your

2630
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Profile ban

2631
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
They banned her

2632
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Because other people were offended

2633
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah, I'd agree

2634
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
That's pretty messed up

2635
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
They need to ban other

2636
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's just rampant on Xbox Live

2637
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
In some of those games, you know

2638
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
They don't want me as a moderator

2639
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
No

2640
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
You know why they don't want me as a moderator

2641
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I will fuck their shit up

2642
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Seriously

2643
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
They say, and you know, I've even seen

2644
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
People that follow on Twitter, they're like

2645
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Seriously, when you see that stuff

2646
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
You know, the fag, fag, fag, report it

2647
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
They will do something about it

2648
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So, I don't know

2649
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I do, when I

2650
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
When people annoy me on there, I report it

2651
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I'm a tattle

2652
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Basically what was happening though

2653
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Is all these people are following her from area to area

2654
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
While she's trying to play a game

2655
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And just do her own thing

2656
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That's blatant harassment

2657
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Why haven't those people been banned

2658
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I mean, I think that if you go after someone

2659
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
With malicious intent

2660
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Well, here's the question though

2661
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Because we don't know who they are

2662
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I would love to find out

2663
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
But at the same time

2664
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
You know, I think that any kind of

2665
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Malicious act like that

2666
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Should be immediately

2667
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Dealt with, I think that there needs to be

2668
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Some, I think that if

2669
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You're reported for a malicious act

2670
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Then you need to

2671
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
At least have

2672
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You know

2673
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Get off my internet

2674
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Like, say an hour suspension

2675
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
So that you're

2676
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
The situation can be reviewed

2677
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Uh, cheeseburger

2678
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
In chat, chat.orangelandradio.com says

2679
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
All hail DarkSakura or ban

2680
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Haha

2681
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Uh, DarkSakura agrees

2682
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Ban the guy they're targeting

2683
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Um

2684
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Yeah

2685
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know, I'm kinda curious to see what ultimately

2686
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Becomes of this, I still feel like it's kinda early on

2687
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I think we'll see more kinda come out of this next week

2688
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And I think we're gonna end up revisiting this topic

2689
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Next week, but in the meantime

2690
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
If you have your own thoughts on it

2691
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
You can give us a call later in the show

2692
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Or you can always send us an email, of course

2693
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
DarkSakura loves emails

2694
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Mailbag at orangelandradio.com

2695
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Uh, well on Xbox Live

2696
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
For those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet

2697
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
There are some things to look forward to in the future

2698
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Worms Armageddon Decades

2699
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade

2700
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Uh, this is

2701
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Apparently a

2702
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Like, old game, about 10 years old

2703
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
It's coming out previously, what was this on before?

2704
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Like the Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation

2705
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And PC

2706
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Uh, they're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade

2707
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original

2708
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Worms is a pretty good seller

2709
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
On Xbox Live Arcade

2710
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So it's about time for a quote unquote

2711
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Sequel, and that's what this is

2712
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
There you go

2713
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Worms Armageddon, coming out soon on Xbox Live

2714
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
There was so much, my husband

2715
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Played Worms so much

2716
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's no Scorched Earth

2717
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Just because I love Worms, it's no Scorched Earth

2718
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's cute though

2719
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But Scorched Earth is hardcore

2720
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Did you play the other game that's like Scorched Earth, sorta?

2721
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Uh, no, what's it called?

2722
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Death Tanks? No, I haven't played that

2723
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
That's on there, interesting

2724
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I don't know if it's any good, but

2725
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I love Scorched Earth

2726
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?

2727
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
That game is awesome

2728
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Cause, it's hot

2729
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Talk about the game, silly pants

2730
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
My pants aren't silly, they're denim

2731
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Moving on

2732
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Back to the Xbox Live Arcade

2733
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Even though they're

2734
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Bastards in charge

2735
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Um, I'm getting

2736
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And this is me specifically

2737
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Getting this, this is for me

2738
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
At least in my own private universe, this is for me

2739
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
One of my favorite

2740
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Ever games

2741
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade

2742
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
According to Famitsu

2743
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Do we know what that is? I'll give you a clue

2744
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It involved twin sticks

2745
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I have twin sticks for this game

2746
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
By the way, Rob

2747
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Did you know that?

2748
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Somehow I'm not surprised

2749
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Virtual On, Oratario Tangrum

2750
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade

2751
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And they can't use my twin sticks!

2752
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks

2753
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
You can

2754
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
But you'd have to modify them

2755
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Ugh, no

2756
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I'll just make a converter

2757
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Um, but yeah

2758
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It's gonna be on there for

2759
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Uh, 1200 points

2760
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And, oh my god

2761
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I love this game

2762
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Now could you use the twin sticks on like the maim version

2763
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Or something? Do they even have a maim version?

2764
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
There's a maim version, but

2765
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You have to have like the

2766
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I think you do have to

2767
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Play it with twin sticks

2768
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Cause they're twin analog

2769
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Yeah

2770
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know, I want one of these cabinets in my house

2771
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Because this game is fucking sexy

2772
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Did Michael Jackson have one of these?

2773
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Huh? Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?

2774
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I don't know

2775
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I didn't look

2776
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Honestly though

2777
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
There's only one more game really

2778
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of

2779
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
But

2780
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
You probably can't guess what it is

2781
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Planet Harrier

2782
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
But um

2783
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Anyway, but yeah

2784
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It's robot on robot action

2785
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Ooh kinky, but seriously

2786
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It's um, just beat em up

2787
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
At the end of the game, and I actually

2788
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Have, um, Dan and I have two clocks

2789
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
That Sega released

2790
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I have one of the Fayen, and then we've got

2791
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
One of the last boss

2792
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
The annoying bitch that he is

2793
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So

2794
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Get the game

2795
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Um

2796
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Well there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for

2797
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
That will be coming to

2798
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Well actually you may have to pay for this one

2799
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Um

2800
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade

2801
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Is close to being finished

2802
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And apparently this was first

2803
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Spotted as an ESRB link

2804
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Uh, a leak

2805
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Actually I do remember the leak, I think this was around E3 even

2806
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Last year

2807
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And um

2808
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Apparently it's um

2809
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Looking pretty good, and that kind of makes sense

2810
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
You know with some of the other Quake themed stuff

2811
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That was um, or coming soon so

2812
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Um

2813
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Neat

2814
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You know speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week

2815
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And I see people talking about that in chat right now actually

2816
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Um, it looks like Hitstun's looking for people to play

2817
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue

2818
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Cause you know the day it was announced

2819
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Thousands of people in the queue because everybody was

2820
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Uh, probably getting thrown to it

2821
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
From different blog sites, but you know

2822
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I went back earlier today to try to check it out

2823
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
And the queue was only 35 people

2824
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Which sadly I didn't have time to wait

2825
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Again because um, I had to do

2826
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
This show tonight, but I'm gonna try and check it out a little

2827
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Later on tonight, but in looking at the demo videos

2828
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And stuff, it looks kinda awesome

2829
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I'm very curious to see if it plays

2830
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
As well as it's advertised

2831
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster

2832
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Maybe, I don't know, no I mean

2833
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
You know it's gonna get hammered the first day

2834
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
But it looks like it's eased up quite a bit

2835
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Cause the queue was only 35, that wouldn't have been that bad

2836
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
You know I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that

2837
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But um, yeah

2838
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I guess right now, right this second there's no queue

2839
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
So some of our listeners might be off to play that

2840
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Um, but I will probably check that out a little later tonight

2841
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
So, we'll see

2842
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Um, and I would definitely

2843
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live

2844
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
That was one of my favorite Quake games, was the third one

2845
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
There's a lot of games like that that are coming out

2846
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
There's also that, um, other

2847
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Uh, god I don't remember the name of it now

2848
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
But it was the one that they had

2849
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
With the geophysics processor at one time

2850
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Um, that game

2851
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Uh, whatever

2852
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's some psychic war game that's gonna be coming out

2853
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And then I think there's another game

2854
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Very similar to that as well, that's supposed to be on its way

2855
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
So a lot of those arena, unreal

2856
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Type of tournament stuff

2857
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Coming out for Live Arcade

2858
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Makes sense because everybody

2859
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Loves first person shooters on the 360, you know

2860
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Mhmm

2861
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Uh, also big on the 360 soon

2862
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Will be Sam and Max, the first two

2863
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Seasons of Sam and Max are on their way

2864
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
To Xbox Live Arcade, that's right

2865
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Sam and Max Save the World

2866
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Is the name of episode one, or season one

2867
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
And Sam and Max Beyond Time

2868
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
and Space season two, they are on their way

2869
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
To Xbox Live Arcade

2870
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Uh, which is good because this will really expand the audience

2871
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So previously these games were only available on PC

2872
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I think a lot of people played them through GameTap

2873
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Um, I think they made their way to the Wii

2874
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Eventually, with the strong pack games

2875
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Uh, season one did

2876
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So, but finally they're gonna be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade

2877
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And this is where people will actually be able to download a demo

2878
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games

2879
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I think you'll probably finally see

2880
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
These games start to get a lot more of the

2881
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Attention it deserves, at least from the console people

2882
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it

2883
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Uh, but this is gonna open it up

2884
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
To a whole new audience

2885
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Good news, and kind of expected in a way

2886
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
You kind of figured this was gonna happen eventually

2887
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So, there you go

2888
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade

2889
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Well, I have some interesting news

2890
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Oh really?

2891
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Has to do with the ESRB

2892
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
More leaks?

2893
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Yep, classic rock track for rock band

2894
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Um, isn't that kind of cool

2895
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It's supposed to be getting a teen rating

2896
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And uh, it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use

2897
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
So

2898
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I think it's just that song pack that they're gonna put out of all previously released

2899
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,000
They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys

2900
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Oh yeah, that's already there

2901
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Yeah, it sounds like it's gonna be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is

2902
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect

2903
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Gotcha

2904
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Too bad they don't have independent achievements

2905
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
That would make it a lot more worthwhile

2906
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
You know, I wonder if that ACDC rock band game's really fallen in price yet

2907
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin

2908
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But I don't want to pay like

2909
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It's all live tracks too, it's kind of like ehhhh

2910
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore

2911
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library

2912
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
There's a couple good ACDC songs

2913
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
But, um, you know, I'm not gonna get it until it's in the $5 bin

2914
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Which you know it will be in Walmart eventually

2915
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive

2916
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And then you sell that shit back

2917
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
There you go

2918
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
There you go

2919
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Now you're talking

2920
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
That's how we do it

2921
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
This is how we roll

2922
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
This is how we roll

2923
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah, some other stuff that's interesting for Rock Band 2

2924
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
The UK's finally getting a few different versions of Rock Band 2

2925
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Apparently the 360 version was on its exclusive kick over there as well

2926
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Now Rock Band 2 will be coming to the Playstation 3 and Playstation 2

2927
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
On March 27th in the UK

2928
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And will be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well

2929
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And of course these will be available in their bundles, I believe

2930
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
And, or actually maybe just game only right now

2931
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And then there's also gonna be the standalone stuff as well

2932
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
And then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition

2933
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone

2934
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I just wanna say, Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago

2935
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob

2936
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Some bargain, I agree

2937
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?

2938
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Yeah

2939
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,000
But speaking of bargains, Hitstun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend

2940
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
On Steam

2941
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out

2942
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
But then again, I never really cared for the demo, it's just not my kind of game

2943
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of game

2944
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again

2945
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun, I wish I had multiplayer, I hope they do that in the second one

2946
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It'll be much fun

2947
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
They will, I'm sure

2948
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
They've got to

2949
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band

2950
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Well in other Rock Band news, obviously there was a lot of Playstation news this week at Destination Playstation

2951
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
This sounds pretty awesome

2952
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP

2953
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
It's a rock band on a portable console

2954
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?

2955
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
The DS

2956
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
But now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP

2957
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But guess what?

2958
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that

2959
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
No, apparently a website named Primotek apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like

2960
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Take this with a grain of salt

2961
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Some of this sounds a little bit like fanboy wank to me

2962
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
This could be the real deal

2963
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I think it's the stuff from Destination Playstation probably

2964
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Well also kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were, well let me get to that in a minute

2965
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this

2966
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Apparently you're going to be using the left, up, triangle and circle buttons to control instruments

2967
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons

2968
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going

2969
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And then you switch to a different instrument

2970
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Hmm, what game am I describing?

2971
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Frequency and amplitude anybody?

2972
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And remember a couple weeks ago there was that guy who made the statement about

2973
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Oh we'd love to revisit frequency or amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself

2974
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,000
If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility

2975
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And a pretty good idea for a game

2976
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And one I would definitely pick up

2977
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
This is like frequency and amplitude and that stuff, I'm all over this game

2978
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
All over it

2979
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
So hooray to that, and I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that

2980
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, Dark Sakura?

2981
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Does this sound like something you might play?

2982
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Maybe

2983
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Again, songs are everything

2984
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
You know, that's one other thing to keep in mind

2985
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Is that if the song list sucks, then forget it

2986
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
However if MTV Games is involved, I'm sure they will be able to get the artist they need

2987
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
So I would be far more interested in this than the Guitar Hero one

2988
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Because what I like, what kind of the difference is

2989
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Is that Guitar Hero DS was like

2990
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:46,000
How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the, you know, Nintendo Wii

2991
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And smush it down into a DS

2992
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Where this is, okay how do we build a band

2993
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Or how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform

2994
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Knowing that these are our restrictions

2995
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Go

2996
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
You know, I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it

2997
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think will help them create the better game

2998
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
But we'll see

2999
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
We shall soon see

3000
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Well how about More Stuff?

3001
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
More Stuff, my favorite

3002
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:16,000
For iPhone people, there are actually two titles that are out by Taito

3003
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And no, they're not bubble wobble

3004
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
The first is Cooking Mama

3005
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Where you can use the accelerometer and play your game

3006
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro

3007
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
There's also Space Invaders

3008
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen

3009
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
And there's bonus character art and stuff

3010
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And it's like 5 bucks

3011
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
So cool

3012
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Neat

3013
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I'm getting a little, I don't know

3014
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I'm getting a little sick of all the, let's take our existing things

3015
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And push them down into the iPhone

3016
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I'm putting on Try Cooking Mama

3017
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Good point for MacDeft and Chad

3018
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
It's not Space Invaders Extreme

3019
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I'm a little, you know, I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders

3020
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack

3021
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Which the iPhone would be a good platform for

3022
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I would be all over that, but

3023
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Doesn't sound like it

3024
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Oh well

3025
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content

3026
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Was supposed to have been out already

3027
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
But it's been delayed to March 5th

3028
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Not that long of a wait though

3029
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
The price has been announced at $10

3030
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And of course this game

3031
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It will pick up from the end of the game

3032
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And hopefully make up I guess for what was apparently

3033
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
A crappy ending, I don't know

3034
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia

3035
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Actually I didn't get to the end either

3036
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but

3037
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I probably played a little more than you

3038
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It was a good time, but I just got distracted

3039
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Well you definitely played more than me because I didn't touch it at all

3040
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Oh well there you go

3041
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It's fine, you should pop it in and check it out

3042
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's a fun game

3043
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You gave it to me, it was a good game

3044
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But um

3045
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Yeah

3046
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Easy achievements if you kept the 360 version

3047
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I have the PS3 one

3048
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So it's trophies, but still

3049
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Same idea, right?

3050
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Well once again it's just too many games coming out

3051
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't have enough time to play them all

3052
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Oh well

3053
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Well I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account

3054
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And I hardly ever use it

3055
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
So it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away

3056
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Because I never watch the movies that they send me

3057
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
But one thing I do love about Netflix

3058
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Is the streaming Netflix

3059
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
One thing I like about the streaming

3060
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail

3061
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Is that you don't have to wait for streaming

3062
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
If you want to watch something you can watch it right now

3063
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you

3064
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So I love the Xbox 360 streaming

3065
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week

3066
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Apparently Netflix is planning on a streaming only subscription

3067
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
In the foreseeable future

3068
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
This comes from a report from Reuters

3069
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Which is one of the massive news reporting agencies

3070
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Along with Associated Press

3071
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So yeah this sounds like it's coming in the future

3072
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription

3073
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Because sadly there isn't a lot available right now

3074
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I mean there's some good like NBC TV shows

3075
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
And you know there's some indie movies

3076
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And random ass documentaries

3077
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Are available on the service

3078
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
But they don't have a lot of new news stuff you know

3079
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So it could use a little buffing up

3080
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But who knows

3081
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Apparently Netflix is considering launching a streaming only plan

3082
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
But no word on exactly how much that's going to cost

3083
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Apparently Netflix just exploded in the amount of usage of the streaming movie service

3084
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
In the last few months

3085
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
No doubt from the 360 Netflix app

3086
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Which earlier was reported they have what a million people using it

3087
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
So there you go

3088
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Hopefully it won't be that expensive

3089
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Apparently you know maybe I should just downgrade my plan to the $8.99 plan

3090
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Because right now I think I have like the $12 plan

3091
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
So I should at least just download the one movie a month plan

3092
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Or one disc at a time, four movies a month or whatever it is

3093
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Because I just never watch the movies they send

3094
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I just never get around to it

3095
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Like I'm always in the mood for something else by the time I get the movie

3096
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm just that impatient I don't know

3097
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Alright anyhow let's take a trip into the old mailbag

3098
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Darkstalker read one letter a little bit ago

3099
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
But now we're going to officially open up the mailbag

3100
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
For your emails at mailbag.orangelawandtrader.com

3101
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Darkstalker is going to pick out a few of her favorite emails

3102
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And read them for you right now

3103
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I get a ton of emails so I'm not going to be able to read all of them

3104
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But did you lose a sock so do you like Dan?

3105
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Dan was very popular on the show

3106
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I saw some twits about it too and all that so

3107
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Jenai from Las Vegas actually

3108
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Oh god stupid thing

3109
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Sorry my plug keeps falling on my laptop

3110
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious

3111
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my suit laughing while at work

3112
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Dan needs to be on the show more often he's got a great radio voice too

3113
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I love the new LLR website layout it has a nice citrus look to it

3114
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Peace slot machines and sugar cookies Jenai

3115
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June

3116
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3

3117
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Damn it

3118
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I really want to go back to Vegas though I will make that happen this year

3119
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Well there's just some really really long emails

3120
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
The next one comes up from AcidicVampire

3121
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Hello there OLR this is Paul aka AcidicVampire with my virginal email to you guys

3122
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener

3123
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Been listening since August of last year

3124
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
That I enjoy the show immensely

3125
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
History between all three hosts the terrific news

3126
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener

3127
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Imagine hate

3128
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way I do have a valid question

3129
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Now I've only heard Sky mention that he has played this game before

3130
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
But if DarkSakuraLoki has played this as well I wouldn't mind their input

3131
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
After years of being released I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI

3132
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
For some odd reason I've been reading about it lately

3133
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
And I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play

3134
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan Final Fantasy VI for the win

3135
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:14,000
But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play

3136
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Well I bought the Vanadium collection recently for about 20 bucks

3137
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Which includes all four expansion packs and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my Ferraga on

3138
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:28,000
This will be my first MMORPG which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers

3139
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Because of my inexperience which leads to this question

3140
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?

3141
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I like to play a Taru Taru Black Mage because they're so damn cute

3142
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
But I know it'll take forever to level them up

3143
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I also like to interact with other players but I don't want them excited on me just because I'm new to the game

3144
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
They've been playing the game for five plus years

3145
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Any input you have

3146
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm sorry

3147
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated

3148
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Thanks for your time and here's to another 300 shows

3149
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Gay gamers unite

3150
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I'll leave that to you, I played but I didn't like it

3151
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Yeah, turn around and run while you still can

3152
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game

3153
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
No, you know what, I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left

3154
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,000
You know what, Loki actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil if not a little longer

3155
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I don't know, Loki, what was your thoughts?

3156
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I liked it, it was fun

3157
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:30,000
It sucked waiting for parties and now that they've fixed the having to party with people

3158
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I think that would be a lot more fun now

3159
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
That was kind of the thing that broke it for me is, well other than that I didn't have time to play

3160
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Is just waiting for a party and you're like, okay I have two hours to play this

3161
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And of that two hours you're spending an hour and 45 minutes waiting for a party

3162
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And it's like by the time you're, it's like crap I don't have time to play anymore

3163
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Well 15 minutes of a party yay

3164
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Or you know someone else leaves and you have to wait for a party

3165
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Yeah I feel like I heard they changed a lot of very fundamental things about the game

3166
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Including the whole level sync thing that like I can't give this a fair shot

3167
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
You know cause I could sit here and bitch about every reason why I left it

3168
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But I'm not giving the game a fair shot because they've addressed some of those issues

3169
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You know the economy was the biggest thing for me

3170
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I thought it was absolute bullshit that if you wanted to get anywhere in the economy of the game

3171
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
You pretty much had to buy gold because they were refusing to do anything about the, or Gil or whatever

3172
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
They were refusing to do anything about the Gil sellers in the game

3173
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,000
But about three, four months after I left they finally started banning people for it

3174
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And they were pretty aggressive about it

3175
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Now granted you'll never eliminate it but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game

3176
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Because the Gil sellers were ruining the game

3177
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
But it's just unfortunate the Square let it go on so long

3178
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You know they didn't, kind of weren't, you know they lost some people like me

3179
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Because they just weren't more aggressive with it

3180
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So I don't know, I feel like I can't give the game a fair review

3181
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
But dude you already bought the pack, it comes with a free month of the game

3182
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Go install it, have a blast, go play for that month

3183
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now

3184
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Yeah I know, I bet it would look nice

3185
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
But I don't know, you know one thing I prefer

3186
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'll tell you something, to be fair I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy 11 compared to WoW

3187
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I like exploring in Final Fantasy 11 a lot more

3188
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better

3189
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
They're just a different type

3190
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
And like when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy 11

3191
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Like a place you've never been before

3192
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
It's like oh wow, it's scary as shit

3193
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Yeah sometimes it's scary as shit

3194
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Like especially the first time you're in Gunga mines and you hear the sirens go off

3195
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
You're like what the fuck is that?

3196
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But you know, like Final Fantasy 11 you really get a sense of exploration in that game

3197
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And like just the world is so vast in that game

3198
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And it's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that

3199
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
But I don't know, there's something about Final Fantasy 11

3200
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring

3201
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
WoW takes itself more seriously I think

3202
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Versus, you know, or not WoW takes

3203
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Final Fantasy 11 takes itself more seriously than WoW

3204
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,000
So, hitstun asked in chat so what happened to make WoW suck now

3205
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Actually WoW doesn't suck

3206
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I don't have a problem with WoW at all

3207
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
But I just had to quit because I just was spending too much time on it

3208
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Or take a vacation, I don't want to say I quit

3209
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back

3210
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
And that's not the case, I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon

3211
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
But I just needed a break to do other things

3212
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
So, hooray

3213
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Alright, next email then

3214
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Next email

3215
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Hey O.L.R. I have a request for the new Gamestop hate board

3216
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
They don't sell classic games or system anymore

3217
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I was too young when they did and I got into classic gaming

3218
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust

3219
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
So F you to Gamestop for lack of classic video games

3220
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
How dare they call themselves a game store, that's from Cheeseburger

3221
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Good suggestion

3222
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Unfortunately the white board is down for repairs right now

3223
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But we will definitely add that when it comes back

3224
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Alright, one from Spassinator and then I'm going to read the long long one after that

3225
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Alright

3226
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments

3227
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Firstly, although perhaps not a big deal

3228
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
But I'll address it anyway

3229
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that it sent last week

3230
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
With the poor grammar and spelling, don't worry about it

3231
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I'm giving a hard time

3232
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Normally I take the time to make sure everything is correct

3233
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
But considering that I was typing in a hurry

3234
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
And the fact that play online has no spell check

3235
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time

3236
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal

3237
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Glucose levels cause me to get confused

3238
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
But I'll end up being a factor in the issue

3239
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I really, I give everybody a hard time

3240
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
It's not serious

3241
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
She's an equal opportunity offender

3242
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Oh, bite me

3243
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions

3244
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments

3245
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
That basically you had

3246
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
You think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby

3247
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
That I want to get into

3248
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
For me it's the first time I set foot into a showbiz pizza place

3249
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's

3250
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment

3251
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That was started by

3252
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Fuck

3253
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I don't think it was started by fuck

3254
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Nolan Bushnell

3255
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I just want to let you suffer a little bit before I help you

3256
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
It was going to my friend's house

3257
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
No shit, cause I was little in indie games

3258
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I was born playing video games practically

3259
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little

3260
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And I never thought about wow, I'd like to do this as a hobby

3261
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It just sort of happened

3262
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I was a little kid when all of this was new and interesting

3263
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
But it was just more like

3264
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Hey look, mom brought home a clique-o-vision, that's cool

3265
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Oh, I'm going to go play kicks during break at school

3266
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
It just didn't factor in as a wow

3267
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
It was a part of my life, always

3268
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Not a big deal

3269
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Rob?

3270
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I'm sorry, what are we answering?

3271
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
What was your wow, I really like video games?

3272
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
What got you into video games pretty much?

3273
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Oh god

3274
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I'm almost in the same boat

3275
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600

3276
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Just the fact that I was interacting with it

3277
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
No, it really was the Commodore 64

3278
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I think, that really got me into games

3279
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I don't know, the games

3280
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I can't remember a single moment because I was so young

3281
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You don't remember a lot when you're 4 or 5

3282
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
But I've just always been playing Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games

3283
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And just been having a good time with the game

3284
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You know, maybe, I don't remember Dark Sakura's upbringing stories

3285
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
But I know in my particular situation

3286
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
My brother and sister are much older than I am

3287
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
14 years and 16 years older than I am

3288
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
So I was kind of an only child, not really

3289
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
But one reason I played video games is because

3290
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with

3291
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Or, you know, go out and play on the lawn with

3292
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff

3293
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
They don't want to hang out every day

3294
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
So, you know, video games were a way to pass time

3295
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
You know, it would entertain me

3296
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
There were not always a lot of other people around

3297
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
If that makes sense

3298
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So, Loki, anything for you?

3299
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Why are you into video games?

3300
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I don't know, because I always played video games

3301
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I know, it's tough

3302
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I don't want to say, it's just a tough question

3303
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
There's nothing, really

3304
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Just having video games from like when I was 4 or 5

3305
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
You know, that pretty much

3306
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
That'll do it

3307
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
So there you go

3308
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
You look at the stuff you did when you were a little kid

3309
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
You end up looking at it now

3310
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
And you're doing the same stuff

3311
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
You know, I liked tinkering with things

3312
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And playing video games

3313
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And messing around on a computer

3314
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now

3315
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,000
We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently

3316
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
So there you have it

3317
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Alright, now for the long, long, long, long, long email

3318
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Actually, there's more of this, sorry

3319
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I think I'm just going to post the long email

3320
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
On the forums again, sorry for the cop-out

3321
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
My throat hurts

3322
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So I'll finish this one

3323
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Have you ever played any memorable games that are so incredibly bad

3324
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
In a weird sort of way that ended up being good?

3325
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Yes

3326
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Driver 3

3327
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Driver 3 is the best, worst game ever

3328
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It's just so bad

3329
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday

3330
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
About that, and she's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again

3331
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
She would basically just play the game

3332
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Drive around, do like stupid shit

3333
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
And then watch the replay

3334
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Because the best part about it

3335
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
The game was so glitchy anyways

3336
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
That the replays were funny

3337
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more

3338
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So your character would do really crazy stuff

3339
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
But yeah, Driver 3

3340
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Absolutely a horrible game

3341
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
That's funny to play

3342
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny

3343
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
That was the one I played on Flash

3344
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
That was the one I played on Flash

3345
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Logie had mentioned last week

3346
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I don't know, I can't think of a lot of console games that I go

3347
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Wow, that game was bad

3348
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Bejeweled

3349
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But yeah, I love Bejeweled

3350
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
But Bejeweled's not a bad game, it's a great casual

3351
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Well, no, it's like Tetris

3352
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
It's like a puzzle game, it's not a bad game

3353
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Did you see that they're bringing Bejeweled Twist to DS?

3354
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Yeah, but I'll be more interested when Bejeweled Twist is free to play on the website

3355
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Like all the other games

3356
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Also, I will get Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade

3357
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
When it comes out

3358
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Definitely, definitely

3359
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
But right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook

3360
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But nobody else, I have the shitty team score

3361
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Because nobody else plays every week like me

3362
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
But I try to get a new score every week

3363
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
So

3364
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
If you do play, you should add me on Facebook

3365
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Because I need a higher team score, so there you go

3366
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Well, um

3367
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
The third part of this email

3368
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Yep

3369
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
In your opinion, what are the odds of releasing Final Fantasy

3370
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
11 for

3371
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
one or more of the current gen systems

3372
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I know they're really big on re-releasing

3373
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
the other Final Fantasy games

3374
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
So are they re-releasing Final Fantasy 7

3375
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
So re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 should be a no-brainer

3376
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Although not everyone

3377
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
may agree on this

3378
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Final Fantasy 7 is possibly

3379
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
the most popular, I think it meant

3380
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
re-releasing Final Fantasy 7

3381
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Because I was gonna say, 11's already on 360

3382
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular

3383
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
memorable game of the series

3384
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual

3385
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
license to print a shit ton of money

3386
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Who wouldn't want free money, you know

3387
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Well thanks for reading and answering this email

3388
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Sorry it's so long

3389
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Um

3390
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I'd play it

3391
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm kinda torn

3392
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Yes they should, but I'd rather they just freakin' finish

3393
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Final Fantasy 13, like I'm also interested

3394
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy

3395
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
is going. I wish they would have released

3396
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Final Fantasy 12 on the Playstation 3

3397
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2

3398
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
And I think if it had

3399
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
been on the newer consoles, I would have

3400
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
probably spent more time with it. I know that seems so

3401
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
silly, but that's what it is

3402
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
So

3403
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
There you go, I don't know, Loki you think they ought to re-release 7?

3404
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
No

3405
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
It's a classic the way it is. I think they do need

3406
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
to just put it out on the download thing already

3407
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
on Playstation Network

3408
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
That I think they need to do

3409
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Um, just wait until 13 comes out

3410
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
they may do that

3411
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Yeah, I could see that

3412
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months

3413
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy 7

3414
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
before 13 comes out?

3415
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Because it doesn't tie really

3416
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
with each other, it's just a really

3417
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
uber Final Fantasy game that

3418
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
goes along with another uber Final Fantasy game

3419
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Well you know there is that whole, and GameGuru

3420
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake they put it on

3421
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
PSN or Steam, kind of the same thing I'm thinking of

3422
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
The last remnant of course we heard is coming

3423
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
to Steam, which implies the whole Square

3424
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
partnership with Steam now. Hopefully

3425
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
they will release some of the old PC classics

3426
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
on Steam, but we'll see

3427
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath

3428
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Didn't Eidos

3429
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
put them out? Didn't Eidos

3430
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
do the ports for PC?

3431
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I could be wrong, I didn't play them

3432
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Slightly better

3433
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
graphics, eh, I don't know

3434
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Not sure if I want to play these

3435
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Last email? Yes

3436
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
This one's long. Alright

3437
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been

3438
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
a long time listener of your show and counted among my favorites

3439
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
In fact, when you do miss

3440
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
a show infrequently as it is

3441
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
leaves me feeling out of place

3442
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock

3443
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Your unique mixture of news commentary

3444
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
and charm are an important part of my week

3445
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
This is my first letter to you, so I thought

3446
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I'd start out by thanking you all

3447
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
thanking

3448
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
you for all you've provided during the years

3449
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
As an older gamer like yourselves

3450
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm not older, okay, I'm kidding

3451
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Maybe a little

3452
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family

3453
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
and the passion we feel for our hobby

3454
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Add a weekly show with

3455
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
pre and post production on top of that and I'm amazed

3456
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
you've been at it for as long as you have

3457
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Anyway, enough of me gushing

3458
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
So are we!

3459
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
But no, thank you, that means a lot

3460
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Recently I came across a comment made by

3461
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
John Kohler, head of Sony PSP hardware marketing

3462
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
in North America, which suggested that

3463
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
the majority of Nintendo DS's

3464
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
are purchased

3465
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
by or for 12 year olds

3466
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Obviously this was meant to insult the DS

3467
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
handheld fan base

3468
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
But that aside, how much of the

3469
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
statement is true?

3470
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
It's up for data on Nintendo demographics

3471
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
as they break down by age group and have a hard time

3472
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
finding any recent results

3473
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Most comments are anecdotal, with an equal number

3474
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
of people saying they see

3475
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
more PSP's to DS's

3476
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
among their above

3477
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
12 age group, as exist folks

3478
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
insisting there are more DS's

3479
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
in their circle. The closest I

3480
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
came to anything was an article on

3481
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
GayGamer.net

3482
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
from 2007, reporting that

3483
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
according to the NPD

3484
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women

3485
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
by 42%, 127%

3486
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
among people who age 30

3487
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and older, and 212%

3488
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
among people 35 and older

3489
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I don't know if that's just for the

3490
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
month of April or if it was since the last study

3491
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
had been made. I know

3492
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
maybe this really isn't that big of a

3493
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
deal, but I'm curious to know if these

3494
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
assertions have any factual base

3495
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me

3496
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I

3497
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
completely disagree with Kohler

3498
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I think that, you know, I see

3499
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
more people who have

3500
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
DS's than they do

3501
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
PSP's. Now I'm seeing

3502
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
more guys in their

3503
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
early 20's who have PSP's

3504
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
that I will say, but

3505
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
you get it 25 and up

3506
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
you know, and you get kids and

3507
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
all kinds of, I think more people

3508
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
and more families

3509
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
have a DS

3510
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
that's how I see it, like

3511
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
my brother and sister-in-law

3512
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Dan's brother and sister

3513
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
they each have their own DS

3514
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
so, I mean

3515
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
now they're little, but then again

3516
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
you know, my

3517
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
you know, I know tons of people who

3518
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
are my age, you know, back

3519
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
you know, where I'm from, who all have

3520
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
DS's, you've got

3521
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
well, you don't have PSP DS

3522
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
No, I own both. I bought a PSP when they first came out

3523
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Luminous. I was all about Luminous. I bought a

3524
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
PSP just for Luminous, practically. But I know

3525
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
that all of us in this room

3526
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
own both

3527
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Dan and I each have our own DS

3528
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
We're a little different too

3529
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
We're crazy, but I would say you're right

3530
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I think generally, you see

3531
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
the college boys probably have the PSP

3532
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
and are using it, you know, as their multi-device

3533
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
which is what the PSP does best, like MP3's and all that stuff

3534
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
but, so like, if you were to look at

3535
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
demographics, like different

3536
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
demographics, I bet if you looked at the sales figures

3537
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
like males age 18 to

3538
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
24 who own a PSP and DS

3539
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
it's probably a little closer

3540
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
to even, I bet DS still outdoes it though

3541
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
it's probably a lot closer to even

3542
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
than any other demographic you look at

3543
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
but when you look at things as a whole, especially

3544
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
with the DS aggressively targeting women

3545
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
the way it has been with the

3546
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
lifetime commercials, Carrie Underwood

3547
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
pink DS's, all this stuff

3548
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
you know, and as much as you want to

3549
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
point and laugh at these Imagine games

3550
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and the cats and all this stuff, it works

3551
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
they're selling, or they wouldn't

3552
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
make them, you know, they're

3553
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
just selling to your little sister

3554
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
or, you know what I mean, they're just not

3555
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
selling to people that probably listen

3556
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
to this show, if that makes sense

3557
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
so, you know

3558
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
it's working, but

3559
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
the PSP does not have a lot

3560
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
for that

3561
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
same casual

3562
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe

3563
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while

3564
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
market, there's not a lot of

3565
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
great puzzlers, casual games

3566
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
outside of Luminous, the movie

3567
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
thing didn't work out so well

3568
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
so unless you have somebody that really wants

3569
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
that all in one system, and I don't know

3570
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
if you held up, like if I

3571
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
were a parent, you know, who didn't know better

3572
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and you held up a PSP

3573
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and you held up a DS and said which is more

3574
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
durable for my seven year old child

3575
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I would go with the DS because it

3576
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
closes and it protects the screen, the PSP

3577
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
just looks flimsier

3578
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
that makes sense, and sometimes

3579
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
it's little things like that

3580
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
that sell the system

3581
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
you'd be surprised

3582
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
there's more

3583
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
me

3584
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
they actually said, I should add that I'm a DS

3585
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
owner over 12

3586
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I do not own a PSP currently, but would

3587
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
eagerly buy one should any of the rumors

3588
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
regarding the PSP2 second analog stick

3589
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
be realized

3590
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I own both a 360 and a PS3

3591
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
and enjoy them equally

3592
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
in an ideal world, all three companies will do well

3593
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming

3594
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
public, so what do you think

3595
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
in this comment just so much as Claptrap or is it

3596
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
or is he right, and must all

3597
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
adult DS owners hang their heads in

3598
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
shame for being attached to a kiddie

3599
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
system, I obviously say that in jest

3600
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
as long as the games are fun

3601
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
what does it really matter, how much fun can

3602
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
we have even with a Speak and Spell bottle of vodka

3603
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
and grown up vocabulary

3604
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
hey, I'm not gonna say I

3605
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
don't know

3606
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
in closing

3607
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I want to add that I like the new site

3608
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
design, it's been a long time coming

3609
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
but it looks sweet and seems to load

3610
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
faster than the old one

3611
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
nice decision to keep the

3612
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
orange background too, if I have a

3613
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
complaint it's that the episodes on iTunes seem

3614
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
to be a week or two off

3615
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
last week's episode was from February 8th

3616
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th

3617
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
or later, no it's getting caught up

3618
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I was having some problems because now

3619
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
when I do a podcast I have to do it in

3620
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
two different places as opposed to before

3621
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
so it was just confusing me a little bit

3622
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
but I'm good now, I got

3623
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
another one up today and another one

3624
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
is edited and ready to go and then we'll be all caught up

3625
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
so I'm excited

3626
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
and I know I keep saying we're all gonna get caught up

3627
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack

3628
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
but it's a good thing, I mean overall

3629
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
it's a great thing, so and we're

3630
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
getting back on track

3631
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
um, did I already

3632
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
yeah, okay

3633
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
well keep up the good work

3634
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
in the meantime, loyal listener Raymond

3635
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
PS, I too quit WoW after

3636
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
two years, one level 80

3637
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
two level 70s

3638
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I don't regret the time

3639
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I spent there but the opportunities are now open to me

3640
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
to experience all

3641
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest 5 to

3642
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Flower to Gears of War 2, it was liberating

3643
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
and daunting, that's an interesting combination

3644
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
so many new games

3645
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
so many old games to catch up on

3646
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
and only so many hours available in the day, I'm still

3647
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
open to MMOs though, maybe one of the

3648
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
superhero games or the Star Wars one will

3649
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
entice me back, it all depends on the community

3650
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
play Star Trek with us!

3651
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
You know, um, that closing

3652
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
statement is pretty much essentially

3653
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
the reason, one of the big reasons why I

3654
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
quit WoW right there, is that it's now

3655
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
allowed me to play other games

3656
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
you know what I mean?

3657
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Same type of deal dude, I probably would never

3658
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
play Flower or some of these other games I've been playing

3659
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
if I had a raid to do

3660
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
tonight, you know what I mean? So

3661
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
yep

3662
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I just don't want to be tied

3663
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
to an MMO the way I'd be tied

3664
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
to like, my job

3665
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
exactly, exactly, and I don't think

3666
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
you know, it's not like I was in one of those guilds

3667
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I was in a very very casual guild, but I was

3668
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I was being too aggressive with the raiding and stuff

3669
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
and I just needed to cut back

3670
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
you know, and just keep WoW as a casual game like

3671
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
others, make WoW like

3672
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Bejeweled basically, alright

3673
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
if you want to send an email, mailbag

3674
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
at orangeloungeradio.com is the place

3675
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
to do it, we're going to take your calls in

3676
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
just a little bit, but first we have a few more

3677
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get

3678
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
to the Skype line and

3679
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
get towards closing out our show

3680
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
for tonight, so Loki!

3681
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
There is some new download content

3682
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
for a rather old Command & Conquer

3683
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
game, Command & Conquer Generals

3684
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
is getting a brand

3685
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
new download

3686
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
pack, I guess it's

3687
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Black Sheep, The Lost Mission

3688
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and

3689
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
it's

3690
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
interesting that this game

3691
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
you know, it's from like 2003

3692
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
and they're doing some download content

3693
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
for it now

3694
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
didn't even know they were still

3695
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
working on that game

3696
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
might have been something that just wasn't quite done

3697
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
and then they're just like, okay let's finish this

3698
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
and go

3699
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
but yeah, it's available to download now

3700
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
very small download, so

3701
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
check it out I guess

3702
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
basically the mission, you're giving

3703
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I guess, given the command of a

3704
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
toxin attractor

3705
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
it's a modified farm vehicle

3706
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
that sprays

3707
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
icky green stuff

3708
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
and you're

3709
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
supposed to crop dust a town

3710
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
that's been corrupted beyond salvation

3711
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
huh, it's interesting

3712
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
they're releasing download content for such an old game

3713
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
though, but it's still popular, I mean, yeah, right

3714
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
it's like Starcraft still getting patches

3715
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
all these years later

3716
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
well there's still a lot of people playing it, I don't know about

3717
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Command & Conquer Generals, but that's neat

3718
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
you know what I have an odd urge

3719
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
to play, like I was just feeling

3720
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
this the other day, Diablo 2

3721
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
like, I don't know why

3722
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
but there's still people that hella play that game too

3723
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I just like, really want to play Diablo 2 for some reason

3724
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
but I don't, I used to

3725
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
have it a long, long time ago

3726
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
but I can't find the CD

3727
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
which sucks, because if I could

3728
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website

3729
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
or whatever now and just download it I think

3730
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
ugh, oh well

3731
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
anyhow, sorry Random

3732
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Final Fantasy was a game we were talking about a little bit

3733
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
earlier ago, and you know what's kind of

3734
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
funny, I think we were talking about this a lot when we were talking about

3735
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
video games live as well, is that the whole Squeenix

3736
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
likes to protect their stuff

3737
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and they don't want their images shown

3738
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
well, they don't want folks to

3739
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
knock off their Final Fantasy products either

3740
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
apparently they filed a

3741
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
federal lawsuit

3742
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
against

3743
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Edgework Imports, Top Swords,

3744
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Wholesale Gallery, Pacific Solutions Marketing

3745
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
$600,000 judgment

3746
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
and they are no longer allowed to make

3747
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
fake Final Fantasy goods

3748
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
whether it be inside their own stores or doing it on

3749
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
eBay and Amazon

3750
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
the defendants altogether issued a joint

3751
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
statement saying that they regret

3752
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
that they have sold these copies to consumers

3753
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and they would have never imported

3754
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix

3755
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
would respond so aggressively to stop them

3756
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
they will never make this mistake again

3757
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
sorry

3758
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I bet you anything this Final Fantasy 13

3759
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it

3760
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
on Justin.tv, but right there where I'm pointing

3761
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
it's behind the new penguins thing

3762
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
that poster is a Final Fantasy 13

3763
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
poster and I bet you anything

3764
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
it's a bootleg

3765
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
of course it's a bootleg

3766
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
it's probably from one of these companies that just got the

3767
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
$600,000 judgment

3768
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I like what darktatsuya says in chat

3769
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
$600,000 judgment sounds like a game

3770
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy 13

3771
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
who knows

3772
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
so if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy

3773
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
products and selling them for your own profit

3774
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
you might want to stop

3775
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
before you get the next Smackdown

3776
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
so I don't know dark soccer are you forging any

3777
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Final Fantasy goods?

3778
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
no

3779
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
alright well then you have nothing to worry about

3780
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
but how about another story?

3781
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
well I could do that

3782
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000

so basically you can

3785
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
vote and voting stops

3786
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000

02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
the voting starts on March 3rd

3788
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
so you've got that window to cast

3789
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
your vote for what you like best

3790
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
so we've got

3791
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000

vote for Res HD a lot but at the same

3832
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
time I don't think our listeners should be

3833
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
voting in this poll because you know why

3834
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and I have a right to say this because I'm looking at

3835
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
the OLR March Madness thing going on

3836
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
and apparently Tetris is currently beating

3837
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Super Metroid which is stupid

3838
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and I know this is happening mostly

3839
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
in part to the whole debacle from last year

3840
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I knew this was going to happen people want their revenge

3841
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
on me nah nah nah nah nah but you know what

3842
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
if you're one of the people

3843
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
that voted Tetris over Super Metroid

3844
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
please do not vote in this poll because

3845
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
you obviously don't know what you're talking about

3846
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
dear people stop listening to

3847
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Rob the end

3848
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
I thought I'd

3849
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
say something controversial alright

3850
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
couple more news stories and we're going to get your calls

3851
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000

3853
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I got to vote for

3854
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Tetris now you're such an asshole

3855
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
nah I'm just kidding I'm not

3856
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I am not voting for Tetris because

3857
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
you know what as much as I like

3858
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Tetris Super Metroid

3859
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
gets my vote

3860
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
good job

3861
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Super Metroid pulls ahead

3862
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
alright good job

3863
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000

02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
alright anyhow

3865

couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight

3866
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Loki sorry

3867
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
that's alright I understand

3868
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
more Grand Theft Auto possibly

3869
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
on the PSP apparently

3870
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Sony is in talks with Rockstar

3871
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
they want some more games for their PSP system

3872
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
and you know what I'm down with that

3873
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
let's get some San Andreas stories going on

3874
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
um

3875
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
apparently they're interested to see how

3876
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars does

3877
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
um you know cause

3878
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
for a while there you know they have

3879
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
the exclusive rights to the

3880
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
handheld stuff now

3881
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
you know the DS getting its own version of

3882
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
the you know Grand Theft Auto series

3883
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
uh oh

3884
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
so uh be interesting to see

3885
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I know both of the PSP titles were

3886
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
you know best sellers on

3887
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
the console so

3888
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
be very interesting to see how

3889
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Chinatown Wars does

3890
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
but be honest I mean the Chinatown Wars

3891
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
stuff it's going to be good but it's

3892
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
no PSP Grand Theft Auto games

3893
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
those were you know just like the

3894
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
PlayStation 2 ones and um

3895
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I hope they do another one

3896
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I really don't

3897
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
but is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP

3898
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Loki I mean you're a Grand Theft Auto fan

3899
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
we played the PSP version for months

3900
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
the multiplayer was fun

3901
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
and yes

3902
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
it is something I would play on my PSP

3903
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
for long hours

3904
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
and it's also fun to hack

3905
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
apart

3906
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
for long hours I'd like to see a Saints Row

3907
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
on PSP but no that

3908
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
wouldn't happen or even like Crackdown on PSP

3909
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
that'd be awesome anything sandbox-ish

3910
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
hell Atari

3911
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver

3912
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
make another Driver game

3913
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
you don't have to put any effort into it

3914
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
just make another Driver game make it crap like the last one

3915
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
make it very cr- well their last game

3916
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
I didn't really play but make it like Driver 3

3917
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
just reissue Driver 3

3918
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
make no changes

3919
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
alright and uh finally

3920
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
tonight um this is

3921
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
something interesting apparently a

3922
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
60 year old woman

3923
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
got held hostage at gunpoint

3924
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
for 10 hours in Brazil

3925
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
um this week this is reported from

3926
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
globo.com apparently

3927
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
broke this story but here's the part

3928
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
that makes it interesting and somewhat game

3929
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
related um the gun

3930
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
that was used a Sega

3931
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
light phaser from the old Sega

3932
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Master System of course

3933
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil

3934
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
the Master System is still marketed in Brazil

3935
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
that's right so uh you know no surprise that

3936
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
uh the Sega light phaser

3937
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000

02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
that he ought to listen to tonight's show

no cons this weekend

4066
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
um I'm done with the cons for

4067
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
the month I did comic con I did

4068
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
catacon I did wicked winter

4069
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
ren fair I'm on break until the end

4070
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
of March oh nice

4071
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
long break for you

4072
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
something like that have you speaking of cons

4073
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
have you been to video games live it's like a mini

4074
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
con not yet when it

4075
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
came around my way I just didn't have the money

4076
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
and to be perfectly honest I wasn't

4077
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
really that interested at the time you know

4078
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I would say they do a costume contest

4079
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
and there were only like three people

4080
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
that dressed up so like if you did

4081
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
your black luigi thing or heck any of your

4082
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
video game related costumes I think you'd have a good

4083
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
shot to win like a DS or something like that

4084
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I'll check that out you should

4085
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I bet you could do very well

4086
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
yeah and speaking of like

4087
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
conventions when you talked about the square enix

4088
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
swords it would not be surprising

4089
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
that I still see them at the conventions

4090
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
or whatever's left the price would just

4091
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
go double the triple for some odd

4092
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
believe it or not they're cheaper than getting them

4093
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
done commissioned by actual

4094
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
prop makers probably

4095
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
probably

4096
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
is this true I see Breslull

4097
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
in chat are saying you are going to sakura con

4098
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
true or false no I'm not

4099
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
oh

4100
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I kind of want to go to sakura con

4101
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I love seattle but I also want to go to packs

4102
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
so I don't know and flights

4103
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
aren't always necessarily

4104
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
that cheap but I don't know I might be able

4105
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
to come to sakura con

4106
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
maybe if Breslull will let me

4107
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
crash his place on the couch or something

4108
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
as long as you don't violate

4109
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
him in his sleep I promise

4110
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I'll be good

4111
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
and um last week you guys

4112
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
he can't violate me in my sleep why are you telling

4113
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
me he needs to not violate me

4114
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
he would

4115
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
be the one to do that

4116
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
gs68 says come to faname

4117
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
dammit I'm almost positive I'll

4118
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
be at faname this year in fact we need to talk about

4119
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
orange launch radio panel I think that is happening

4120
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I don't know so we'll

4121
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
figure it out

4122
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
wow

4123
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
um I want you guys to know that

4124
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
you guys covered an article

4125
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
last week that you covered

4126
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
like 3 years ago

4127
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
you know sometimes those oddities

4128
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
happen but what was the article just for fun

4129
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
final fantasy 10 port

4130
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
on the nes

4131
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
really that had come up before I thought it was

4132
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
recent I remember there was a 7

4133
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
port on the ds a few years ago

4134
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
that final fantasy 7 but I didn't remember

4135
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
a 10 port so that's why

4136
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
it was a 10 because someone

4137
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
posted I followed the link and I'm like

4138
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
this is 10 yeah

4139
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
interesting well it happens

4140
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
whatever you know we're not

4141
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
perfect and the show's been going a long

4142
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
time we can't remember

4143
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
every story we've ever done it's gonna happen

4144
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
that's fine I mean I was

4145
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I had no problem with that that was pretty cool

4146
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
yeah you know and of course you know we

4147
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
don't have the same listeners now that we had 3

4148
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
years ago either thankfully we have some of the faithfuls

4149
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
like yourself and there's you know some others that

4150
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
have been listening to the show for a long long time there's also

4151
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
a lot of new faces too so you know

4152
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
yeah definitely

4153
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
so you know at some point

4154
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Dark Sakura might

4155
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
actually run out of classic games

4156
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
to talk about so we're gonna have to figure something out

4157
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
that's not likely gonna happen I doubt

4158
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I doubt that alright

4159
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
be a long time alright

4160
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000

hey i love guinness when it's booze

4207
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
actually yes i give a shit about their book anymore

4208
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
so sorry you're wrong

4209
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
but even about video games?

4210
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
yes actually

4211
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
i think that it's fantastic that they're

4212
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
still keeping track of all of this i think it's great

4213
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
well i beg to differ

4214
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
if they're still using twin galaxies to do it

4215
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
but we'll save that another night

4216
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
not using twin galaxies but i mean

4217
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
but i still think that the

4218
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
guinness book is fantastic

4219
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
thanks for the call waiting on the line

4220
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

4221
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
hi this is spazzinator

4222
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
hi spazzinator what's on your mind

4223
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
um two things

4224
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
um i just want to say thank you to

4225
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
loki for showing off

4226
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
nobody boy last week

4227
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
uh thanks to him

4228
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
showing off the folders

4229
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
i ended up buying the game

4230
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
uh during the middle of the week

4231
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
it's actually quite fun

4232
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
so uh thank you to him

4233
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
we did some mixed reviews on that

4234
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
so i'm glad to hear you liked it after all

4235
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
no problem we tried to do that now that we've got the

4236
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
justin tv thing hooked up pretty cool where

4237
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
you know even though i think watching

4238
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
a radio show being taped is the most boring thing

4239
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
in the world at least the audio now

4240
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
goes out over justin tv really well

4241
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
and um you know we do those little breaks

4242
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
in between that seem to work out really well

4243
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
for the audience over there so and it

4244
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
you know it opens up our show to a new group of people

4245
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
cause there's a whole vast

4246
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
you know user base on justin tv

4247
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
that would never think to seek out all games

4248
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
dot com or orange lounge radio otherwise

4249
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
so hey it works

4250
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
and um

4251
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
as far as the

4252
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
second thing um i just wanted

4253
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
to respond to that one email

4254
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
that you read earlier today

4255
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
i can't remember his name

4256
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
but he was asking about

4257
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
you know advice

4258
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
regarding final fantasy

4259
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
11 yeah

4260
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
yeah basically

4261
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
you know i agree with a lot

4262
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
of your criticisms of

4263
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
final fantasy 11 i know

4264
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
the game is not perfect

4265
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
by a long shot but still

4266
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
it is pretty fun

4267
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
um i've been playing for

4268
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
just barely over 3 years now

4269
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
um i would recommend

4270
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
that this person

4271
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
get into a good

4272
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
link shell which is

4273
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
you know the game is equivalent to a guild

4274
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
um and there's

4275
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
uh you know the game

4276
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
is designed to be very social

4277
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
um so even if

4278
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
you're just sitting around waiting

4279
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
to get into a party

4280
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
you know you can always you know shoot the

4281
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
breeze with your friends in the link shell

4282
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
uh while waiting

4283
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
spazzinator i think it's um

4284
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
that's true about like almost any mmo

4285
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
is that like if you ask people

4286
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
why do you play this game so much like i would say

4287
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
this about wow it's the people

4288
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
the people and the community is always going to be

4289
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
what brings you you know to the game

4290
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
so you're absolutely right no matter what

4291
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
mmo you're going to play if you play wow you

4292
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
need a guild if you play 11

4293
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
you need a link shell you know or the equivalent

4294
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
of these things in other games here i'm going to

4295
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
try to ask you a question here what

4296
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
would you say is

4297
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
the number one thing

4298
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
that draws you to final fantasy 11

4299
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
besides the people what is it about

4300
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
final fantasy 11 the game that

4301
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
keeps you coming back

4302
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
well you know

4303
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
i've been a

4304
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
pretty big fan of the series

4305
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
as a whole

4306
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
for a number of years and i figured

4307
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
you know at the time

4308
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
you know this was the next one

4309
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
in the series now get that started

4310
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
uh not only that

4311
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
but since i'm primarily a console

4312
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
gamer now my

4313
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
selection of

4314
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
mmo's are kind of limited

4315
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
uh the

4316
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
only other one that i'm familiar with

4317
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
and heard of is

4318
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
the playstation 2

4319
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
version of everquest

4320
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
and that was alright

4321
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
but in final

4322
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
fantasy 11 in my opinion

4323
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
is a whole lot better

4324
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
um and

4325
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
plus you know you can play as

4326
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
a black mage you know which

4327
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
both of my characters are

4328
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
and it's just so

4329
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
much fun nuking the shit out

4330
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
uh the beastmen in

4331
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
final fantasy 11 you know whether

4332
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
you're casting fire or

4333
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
arrow or

4334
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
thunder or whatever

4335
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
you know just like

4336
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
uh doing you know

4337
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
casually uh casting

4338
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
spells you know every

4339
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
2 or 3 seconds you know

4340
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
alright

4341
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
well you know um i can see that because

4342
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
final fantasy 11 was kind of a console

4343
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
game you know it was made for the playstation 2

4344
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
i know a lot of people here in america play it on

4345
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
pc but most people over in japan play it on playstation 2

4346
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
and a lot of people here in america play

4347
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
it on playstation 2 as well it is one of the few

4348
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
mmos very accessible through a

4349
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
console so you know i can kind of see that wow

4350
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
wow is missing um a significant user

4351
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
base from not having a version of it

4352
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
on consoles but then again i couldn't see wow

4353
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
on a console so i get it well spazzinator

02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
getting it's a little hard to understand

4377
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
may i want to get a little bit away from your mic

4378
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
i don't know what's up with that no that's all right

4379
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
um so you have some new games you want to review what's up what games

4380
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
um gta

4381
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
uh liberty city

4382
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
and tony arx project 8

4383
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
well tell us about them

4384
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
well where we see stories

4385
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
first time playing it even though

4386
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
i'm only 16

4387
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
i've been on amazon my debit card

4388
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
um basically

4389
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
what i like is if we play

4390
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
it just for all humans but a lot more

4391
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
i like rolling

4392
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
around in the tank blowing stuff up

4393
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
blowing

4394
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
blowing stuff up in games is always fun

4395
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
plus

4396
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
the custom soundtrack option even though it comes

4397
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
up in your safe house as corrupted

4398
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
which is

4399
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
weird but uh you can put

4400
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
except it's very complicated to

4401
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
put them into tsc and then put them

4402
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
to that gta

4403
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
for your songs

4404
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
it's kind of cool though

4405
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
so what was the other game you played besides grand theft auto

4406
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
tony arx project 8

4407
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
tell us a little more about

4408
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
this game i don't this one's not ringing a bell

4409
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
for some reason

4410
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
basically it's like

4411
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
all your tony arx games but a little bit more

4412
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
of a challenge um

4413
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
basically you had to keep

4414
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
pushing up to keep your

4415
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
skater going there is no auto kick option

4416
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
whatsoever in the game

4417
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
what game is this

4418
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
what game is this

4419
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
tony arx project 8

4420
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
ok yeah now i understand

4421
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
ok cause like when it was coming through

4422
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
was it just me i couldn't understand what he was saying before

4423
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
ok now i get it

4424
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
so um

4425
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
ok so is this a game

4426
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
worthy of the tony arx series or is it

4427
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
you know kind of average or what

4428
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
um

4429
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
it's a little bit more challenging i will say

4430
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
it's going to be more of a challenge

4431
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
for me

4432
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
what makes

4433
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
this game

4434
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
different from the other tony

4435
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
arx games

4436
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
like

4437
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
basically um

4438
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
more area to explore

4439
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
it's like a free realm

4440
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
um game kind of like

4441
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
american wasteland which the psp

4442
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
never got

4443
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
um because the ds

4444
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
got american wasteland but

4445
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
the ds never got project 8

4446
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
and uh actually there is

4447
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
another game i got

4448
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
rock revolution for ds

4449
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
that must be uh

4450
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
that must be

4451
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
interesting rock revolution on the ds

4452
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
i know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago

4453
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
i think sauce reviewed it i'm still tempted

4454
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
to get it for 20 bucks on 360

4455
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
i'm like oh that's 20 dollars i could like

4456
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
buy lunch

4457
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
actually the uh ds version

4458
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
has the singing in it

4459
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
which the consoles are missing

4460
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
that is so weird but of course

4461
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
the ds has the built in microphone

4462
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
yeah

4463
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
even though here's my little problem

4464
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
here was when i've been on the psp

4465
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
i mean why didn't her

4466
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
mics just go with what um

4467
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
activision did

4468
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
and basically redo

4469
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
the guitar grip but to fit the USB

4470
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
port in a clamp on

4471
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
because that one made sense

4472
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
for a guitar grip

4473
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
hmm

4474
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
could be

4475
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
alright

4476
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
well um we are going to

4477
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
um go ahead and wrap up

4478
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
and let you go but uh keep having fun with

4479
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
the ds games

4480
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
so uh you know have fun

4481
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
alright i love the psp

02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
real quick um there was

4507
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
uh the announcement this week

4508
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
or they finally made it

4509
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
you know official that the

4510
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
red xbox 360

4511
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
elite system with resident evil

4512
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
5 will be making its way

4513
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
to stores at the same time as

4514
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
the game by itself um

4515
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
the system of course would be just like

4516
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
your normal elite system except it's

4517
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
going to be all red um

4518
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
as well as there's going to be a red

4519
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
uh controller to go along with it

4520
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
you're going to get a

4521
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
an exclusive resident evil 5 theme

4522
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
and also a um

4523
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
copy of super street fighter 2

4524
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
turbo hd remix

4525
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
as well as of course a resident evil 5

4526
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
all that for the

4527
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
low low price of $399.99

4528
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
or just the normal price of an elite system

4529
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
so um

4530
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an elite

4531
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
system

4532
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
and um the other thing

4533
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
um that's supposed to be worked on right

4534
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
now is apparently it is expected to

4535
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
sign a deal for doom 4

4536
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
um later this year

4537
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
however they don't know who the publishers

4538
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
going to be yet but you better believe

4539
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
that you're going to see a doom 4

4540
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA

4541
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
but you know

4542
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I don't know

4543
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
doom 3 was kind of eh it was alright

4544
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
and then

4545
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
that's it

4546
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
alright

4547
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
well uh I guess that's going to do

4548
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
it for tonight's show

4549
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
let's go around and get everybody's last

4550
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
final thoughts um my final

4551
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
thought would be I should

4552
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000

I love it on the xbox live arcade

4556
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
but I didn't play it enough on psp I think

4557

4558
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
