00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, March 29th, 2009

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Will OnLive be the next great console?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Could Netflix come out for PlayStation 3 and Wii?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the classic 8-bit game is re-released for the iPhone

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're back after a week vacation

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To talk more about video games, video gaming, gaming culture

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the gamer lifestyle

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
As well as my awesome co-hosts

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You are, because you is? I don't know

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I be

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Because you be

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, also joining us tonight

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi, how's it going?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good, how are you?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Could have been better, because

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, Adobe Bro...

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know what it is, it's just like an ongoing theme of my laptop

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
An update from the manufacturer

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like, for example, Microsoft's update or whatever

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Or Adobe, even Flash

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is breaking something

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, like, Windows update broke my computer

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And I had to actually reinstall everything

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And now, Flash update broke the Flash media encoder

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, just to kind of explain a little bit for listeners

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Especially those on the podcast

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We do tape live, obviously

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And live radio has interesting advantages

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As in, we get to interact with you guys live

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And disadvantages, as to things don't always work the way we plan

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, Loki is trying to show

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Something on

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Justin.tv, our video feed

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Which we'll get into a little bit later

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But he wants to do it, because for whatever reason

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
His laptop is not, suddenly decided

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It didn't want to cooperate with the video anymore

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, it wants to do audio, but no video

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, it's weird, so

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But you know, this type of thing is not limited to PCs

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll tell you what, my laptop, my MacBook

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Has been out of commission for, like, a month

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because an Apple update

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Screwed up my boot up

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Like, it'll get to the gray screen

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I get the spinning wheel, and it just freezes there

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And from everything I've been told

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I just need to reinstall OS X

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know where the hell I put it

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I bought my laptop a year and a half ago

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, stupid me for losing it, right

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But now I have to find a friend's disk

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
To install it off of

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, yeah, I'm out of, I can't use a laptop right now

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, stinks

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So anyhow, let's get into

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Some, how was your gaming week?

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We always like to start off the show with

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How was your gaming week, so let's do that

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For a little while, it actually was non-existent

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Given that I had a mid-term

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Last week, and lots of school crap

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
To do

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I did actually

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Play Cooking Mama for

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
iPhone, which is

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's only got a few recipes

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
On it, so it's super short

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I like the control on it better than on the DS

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was actually pretty fun

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So that's one game that translates itself very

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Very well for iPhone

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And for those that don't remember, DarkSakura loves her Cooking Mama

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
On DS

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I actually downloaded another game

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That let me find the name of it

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because it's also on iPhone

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Really, a lot of my gaming has been iPhone-based lately

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Except for Last Night, which I'll get into

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In just a second

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's called LightBike, and it's a free

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Lightcycle game

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Like in Tron

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it's pretty cool

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I wouldn't say this is a game, but it's a fun little app

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As I've been playing with my koi pond lately

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Also, as I'm

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Being reminded

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Via hint, hint, hint

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is I did actually

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Review Cooking Mama

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
On AvengersTower.com

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So if you want to check it out

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can see my full review there

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, wait a minute, not Orangelaunchradio.com

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You review games over on

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Giggling Girls site, but you won't do it

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll copy it over! I'm just messing

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We're getting Tiara over, hopefully to do game reviews

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
As well, right? For us

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hopefully, yes, thumbs up, good

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There is hope in the positive direction

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She plays a lot of games I never get around to playing

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I like reading her reviews

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Last night was all about

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Rufus Belly

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
For Street Fighter IV

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, last night at my house

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh lordy

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We got it on with video games

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In a big way

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My husband and I, and no it wasn't anything kinky

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Got it on, huh?

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
With video games? Sick

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hush, hush, hush

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Last night we decided

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We were going to totally

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go for the PC Engine fun

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we broke out our PC Engine

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Core graphics

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we could play our Japanese Hu-Cards

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then we broke out the

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Turbo Duo

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which we've got to play the import

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
CDs

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We're so happy

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My copy of Space Fantasy Zone however

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Has a hole in it

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Not a hole where the spindle goes

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But a hole in the disc

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Therefore we got to the first

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Boss

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How does that even happen? I don't know

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's shit in my house

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We got to the first boss and is like

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Game over, I quit, you win

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Game over, no more

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And for people who don't know

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Space Fantasy Zone

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Because the

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are set in the same universe

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's basically Fantasy Zone from the

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Space Harrier behind the

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Player perspective

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So it's pretty cool

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And it has remixes of

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All the old Fantasy Zone music done in

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sort of that Space Harrier style

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'll have to

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Actually bring you tracks to play

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
On this show sometime Rob, they're really cool

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And so

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I went, now this game is also

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
A prototype, they did not release

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It, they had just like

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Base cover artwork for it and it never

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
As far as I'm aware, never got

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
An official release and so

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been racking my brain trying

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
To find some way to burn

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A new copy of the game but hell

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If I know how to burn multi session you know

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Audio and

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Data weird compilation

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I found how to do it but it's a lot of hard work

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I'm lazy

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me read some comments from chat real quick

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you're listening live on this Sunday evening

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Here on All Games Radio where we broadcast every Sunday night

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We chat at chat.orangelandradio.com

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And there's of course some comments to

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
DarkSakura talking about the

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hole in her disc

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Goldanthro in chat says a hole in the disc?

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mmm disc sex

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Since you know you're talking about getting it on and all

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Andrew says holy disc

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But he forgot

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He forgot the Batman part. Holy disc Batman

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
To be specific

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It wasn't actually a physical hole through it

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I found out

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But somehow or another on both sides of the

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Disc

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Covering on it had been scratched

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Off

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So maybe it's just something that

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was clamped on

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Or poked on or something I don't know

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In a box or something I have no idea

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
By the way the chat is also reminding me

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Since you're talking about getting it

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Since you're talking about getting it on with video games

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And all that I forgot to play something before the show tonight

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The following program is intended

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
For mature audiences

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And there you go

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just so you know don't say we didn't warn you

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Alright anything else in your gaming week besides such

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Nerdy PC Engine retro

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Fun? Oh there's a lot more

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well it was all PC Engine though nerdy

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Fun

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So we took off some of the games that we're playing

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We put in Dracula X, Ys, Book 1 and 2

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Freaking epic

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Um

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We played Legend of the Valkyries

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Son Son

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Twinbee, we broke out our copy of

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Twinbee

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And um

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What else did we play? God

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Cause I put pictures up on the gallery

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I took a picture of my foot next to our

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
PC Engine core graphics

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So you can see how little the PC Engine core graphics

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are on my foot

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We also played

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Final lap

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Twin

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Victory run

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Keith Courage, no we didn't play Keith Courage

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Cause that game is crap

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Adventure Island, we played Adventure Island

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Which is pretty fun

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So yeah we were getting on with the

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hudson play last night

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was pretty cool

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Good times

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Lots of classic gaming

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Alright folks before we get into Loki's

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Gaming week here

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Justin TV is now up if you're listening live

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And Loki I'm assuming you're going to talk about what's going on here on Justin TV

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
While you're talking about your gaming week

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah basically

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like I said I've been playing Grand Theft Auto

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mainly Lost in Damned cause that's all I play

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But um

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh yeah I forgot

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is my bosses 360

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well technically it's my 360 but it's the one that he

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Uses cause I own 5 of them

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
For some reason but this is my old 360

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's modded

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I figured out how to hack

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Basically because

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Rockstar is so lazy when it comes to

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Programming that they literally use

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Files that have been around since you know

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh and it froze

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
For a second there

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Phone call

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Anyway so basically

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Uses the same PC files and stuff

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So you can edit it the same way as you'd edit

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like you know handling files and that kind of thing

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So for example I can

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Kick that motorcycle really hard

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And it will go flying

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Cause I edited

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The physics

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The punching and stuff it's just fun

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Cause my boss he's

291
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh they're going into orbit

292
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They seriously will punch a person into flying into orbit

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Here I know this is horrible

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh my god they just disappeared

295
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sorry I know this is crappy radio

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's awesome

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That is fantastic

299
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I love it

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sure this will be in the archives as well

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
For those listening on the radio

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We'll play it during break

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But there's a lot more stuff you can tweak

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Basically you can edit it like you can edit the PC version

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you know how to do it

306
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And yeah

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We've played it online

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Between the five of us

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That play Grand Theft Auto

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My boss he needs all the help he can get

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And you can't actually cheat

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because it's funny the way the game works

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Say for example we originally

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Beefed up his weapons

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
To make him really overpowered

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because he kind of needs that help

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And we got a weird side effect

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Was anybody that got near him

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Would get the same kind of upgrades

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
To their weapons

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it kind of cancels each other out

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The only thing that doesn't affect

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Vehicle handling if he gets into a bus

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're basically like rockets now

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They just go really fast and smash through everything

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That won't affect other people

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And also physics on the weapons

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like the punching I was just doing

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That won't affect other people

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And if you try to punch another player that you're playing with

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It won't affect them either

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It'll just be like a normal punch

333
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So it's basically just to fuck around with

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And this one I made a new one

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
To kind of demonstrate some of the crazy crap you can do in it

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But it's basically just like the PC version

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Reading some comments from chat

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because the live chatters are kind of watching this whole thing

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And maybe I can describe

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This for the folks only listening to this on the podcast version

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Dark Tetsuya says

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So now it's Hancock the video game

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Death Wishing says Falcon Punch

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
X-Link says

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He's Siler

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And Act F says Grand Theft Auto with Crackdown Physics

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Cool freaking awesome

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That was pretty hilarious

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's basically

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You could potentially cheat

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
In the online games with this

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But you'd be banned pretty quick

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm guessing he's going to be banned eventually

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But what do I care?

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because it's my boss, it's not me

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it's my modded console anyway

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So what do I care?

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But no

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's just a really fun experiment

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
As far as I'm aware

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sure other people have done it

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But the only video I've seen online

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's only been one person that's done it

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And he's the guy that actually made this program called OpenIV

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which is one of the programs that I use

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It basically opens one of the files that's on

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The actual Xbox 360 disc

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's also part of the PC stuff

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's kind of like their version of a zip file or something

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I kind of figured out how to

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Extract everything

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It is tricky because if you change something

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you change certain bytes or whatever

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The file size changes and it gets too big

376
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I actually overwrote

377
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's multiple languages on the disc

378
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So I overwrote the Spanish language with the English language

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Which was a lot smaller in file size

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I can edit whatever I want

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I can just pad it with a bunch of null bytes

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But anyways, so beyond the Grand Theft Auto stuff

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I did play other things

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't stop playing PEGAL DS

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And I really don't want to play it anymore

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But I finished PEGAL

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The regular PEGAL stuff on there

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Now I unlocked PEGAL Knights

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I can play that

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Which I think is basically the same thing as PEGAL

391
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's just everybody's now a superhero for some reason

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Whatever

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's fun

394
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Nellie hasn't gotten a chance to play it yet

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I don't know if she'd like it

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I don't know, it's fun

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Just watch TV and play that game

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then I also tried TrackMania DS

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Which is pretty good

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But the only thing that kind of sucks about it

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is because the DS screens are so small

402
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Your field of view is really small in the game

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But other than that, it's basically just

404
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The same as the PC version

405
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which is pretty awesome

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So that's kind of cool

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think that's about it really

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I wanted to play a lot more games

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was meaning to install that new update

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
For the Wii

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Not exactly the same way

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
As you'd normally update it

414
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But, you know, special way

415
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because I got a 16GB card

416
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
To go with that

417
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So maybe we'll hear some more about this next week

418
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, and then

419
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
By the way, Tigerclaw in chat says you should hack PEGAL

420
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And put in some crazy ass physics

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just like you did in Grand Theft Auto

422
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's not as easy to hack other games

423
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In Grand Theft Auto, if you literally extract

424
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All the files that are in those compressors

425
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's exactly the same as what you see on the PC

426
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Formats are the same

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Files are actually somewhat the same

428
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The only thing that's different is the texture files and stuff

429
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But if you learn how to hack one

430
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can hack both versions

431
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You probably can hack the PS3 version

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you figure out how they store it

433
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I haven't been able to

434
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I really wanted to figure out how to get it to install

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because I can actually install that

436
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
To this hard drive

437
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So you can do the game installations

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
On the new Xbox Experience

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And yes, the disk I have obviously is modified

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because I had to burn a modified ISO

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
To get it to work

442
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because I'm editing it

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But you can actually run it with the real disk

444
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Once it's installed on the hard drive

445
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Because all it does is check to make sure that disk is legit

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And then it'll run wherever the hell you want

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I literally took apart my 360

448
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
One of the other five

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
To try to get it to install

450
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I was actually going to do a disk swap

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
On the CD-ROM drive

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I literally took the CD-ROM drive apart

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Unfortunately that thing spins so fast

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's impossible to do that

455
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But it's fun

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's cool

457
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Repeat at your own risk

458
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He's voiding all sorts of warranties

459
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
All sorts of warranties

460
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If one of these Xboxes is E74

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's tough shit

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I'm not going to go post online how to do this

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Basically

464
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can figure it out the same way

465
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
As you would modify a song in Guitar Hero

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The information is out there

467
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You just kind of have to figure it out

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And really I don't want a lot of people

469
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Just online cheating like hell

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not doing that

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We do it for fun

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
For your own amusement

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But as you can see

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There's no way I'm faking this

475
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Since it's lost and damned

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There's no way to port that to the PC yet

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's just fun

478
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think you're going to play a little bit

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
On and off throughout the night

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You might kind of pause as you're reading news stories

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And so on but you can kind of watch the action

482
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Go down at Justin TV

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Which is also available, thanks to Dekeman

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
For reminding me, we have it in a little box now

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
On OrangeLawnTrader.com

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm not used to it being right there on our homepage

487
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But it is, so you can just look at OrangeLawnTrader.com

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And you can read the reviews that were posted this week

489
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And watch Justin TV at the same time

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's pretty cool

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
My gaming week, we've been out for two weeks

492
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I actually got caught up on quite a few games

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And this challenge is just so adorable

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
On the Nintendo DS

495
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't think of a better way to describe this game

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's really adorable

497
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Basically what they did, they took a lot of like

498
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Inspired 8-bit games

499
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean they're all original, old-school retro games

500
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That you play in this

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But they all kind of are reminiscent of games you might have played

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Back in the day

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
On the Nintendo Entertainment System

504
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
For instance, there's a racing game

505
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's kind of a little bit, I don't know, like Spy Hunter-ish

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Just without the weapons

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Kind of a Xanax-style shooter

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
As well as

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Galaga

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Has like a type of shooter in there as well

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And there's an RPG

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's just a really cute little game

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Basically the way the game works is that you

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Are basically sucked into the life of a child in the 80s

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Playing all these new games with a friend

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And the cool thing is that

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
As you play through these challenges

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You unlock little magazines

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, you might have heard of this

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
These games, game magazines

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That you look through and get new tips out of

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And of course they have cheat codes

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There's all these little throwbacks

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
To things we might remember from the 80s

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like really bad Engrish and some of the games

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And all this stuff

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Here's the only thing I didn't like about Retro Game Challenge

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that everything was very sequential

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like when you buy the game, you have to start with a particular shooter game

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then move on to the racing game

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Then move on

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You know, and I kind of would have liked a little more openness

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Even if it didn't

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Give you everything at once

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Maybe if you started with three of the games

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And you could kind of go back and forth

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And beat the challenges you wanted to in one

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then move on to another

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I would have liked to see a little more freedom

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
In the way the actual game itself was set up

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But it's not enough to really distract

542
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
From the fact that the game is really a throwback

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
To the old school days

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So honestly

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Excuse me, if you were a kid gaming in the 1980s

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think you'd get a kick out of this

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And might want to check it out on the Nintendo DS

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sorry, yes

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Start to see us as Zanac is the game

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Not Xanax, that's a, I think, drug

551
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Anyhow, also games

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That I've been playing, Bit.Trip Beat

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
On the Nintendo Wii

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Kind of interesting, it's like Pong meets Guitar Hero

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Type thing, where as you move

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The paddle up and down

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Which you do by tilting the Wiimote

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can control

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Chiptune type music

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Everything's very scripted in the game

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Which you don't understand really

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
With the trailers, it kind of looks like you're playing

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
A natural game of Pong or something

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But everything is very, very scripted

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In these very long stages

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That go on for, I think, about 15 minutes

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Playing these different songs

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Now the only drawback is that there's only

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Three stages, so there's only really three songs

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But when you consider that 600

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wii points is what you'd pay for

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Three rock band songs

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I still think you kind of are getting your deal out of this game

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think it's a fun little game

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You know, I don't think it's anything

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're going to play forever and ever

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But for $6 it's not bad

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'd recommend the game

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Bobby and I were talking about it a little bit at the end of his show

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because he's on just before us

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Here on All Games Radio and I gave it a B or a B-

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
With him, so that's about where I'd put it

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Other games I've been playing

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This week

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Which is very similar to a lot of those

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Flash tower defender games you see online

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Except now with Black Mages and Archers

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Surprisingly a lot of fun

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I did it on both of the iPhone and the Xbox 360

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And I have to admit I like it a little more

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
On the Xbox 360 because of the fast forward button

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And if the iPhone has one I haven't found it yet

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sure it's in there somewhere

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But I just thought that was

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's just a fun little time waster and time distracter

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But on the Xbox 360 you have to remember

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It is a port of a cell phone game

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So you're not going to have a lot of extravagant graphics

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Or anything, but you know a good game doesn't necessarily

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Need great graphics, for instance BitTripBeat

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Has the graphics of an Atari 2600 game

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But it's still kind of fun

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And then also just a few things here and there

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I checked out Hasbro Family Game Night

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Briefly which is a little bit

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know it's a little deceptive

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well I don't know if I should say deceptive

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But it's unlike other games

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Because I thought you were going to get all these games

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The Kinect 4, the Scrabble

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And all this stuff for 10 bucks

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No no, each of those games within Scrabble

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Or within Family Game Night

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Cost 10 bucks

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Family Game Night is like the front end

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So it's an interesting way to deliver the games

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But I don't know, 10 dollars

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
A little high for games like Kinect 4

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It might be worth it to play games like Scrabble

621
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Online, but I don't know so much

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
About the others, so I guess it's kind

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Of cool they let you pick and choose

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The other interesting thing, here's what I don't understand

625
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
About Family Game Night

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Is there's a lot of people

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm watching Twitter and stuff and a lot of people

628
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That are getting really into this and playing this

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And trying to meet up with folks online

630
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But these are the same people that would dismiss

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
A lot of the Wii games that are coming out recently

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
As shovelware

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, Family Game Night was released on the Wii

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And if you think about it, in some ways

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It almost had a better value

636
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because I think there's 7 games in this thing

637
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Which would cost you 70 dollars altogether

638
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think the Wii version had one less game

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So it was like 60 dollars

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But you were only paying like 40 for it

641
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Now granted, you know

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The Wii version doesn't have internet play

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So it kind of depends how much that's worth to you

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And all that, but it just kind of amuses me

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That I think a lot of people forget

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's one big bundle on the Wii

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Something to consider

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you're going to get all these games

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Or if you think this is something that might be for you

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Because you have a family

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There's already a version out there on the Wii

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's probably going to be in the bargain bin before too long

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That might suit you better

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But of course, online play goes a long way

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I get that

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I checked out the demo for Uno Rush

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I didn't like it at all

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I didn't like the way the game runs at all

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's not the video game itself

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's not the way it was ported

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't like the game itself

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't like the whole organizing your cards

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
As the game goes on

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And plus, I don't think it's worth the 5 extra dollars

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That they want to charge for that

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
As opposed to the 5 dollars for regular Uno

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Which seems to be a more accepted price point

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And sadly one that we rarely see anymore

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, Uno is so a few years ago

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Some comments from chatroom

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Leo Shen says

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hardcore Xbox Connect Fucking 4 is worth 10 dollars

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Drop your piece, bitch

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sneaky there, you bitch

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I guess that could be worth it

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know, I just think it would get a little old after a while

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But then again, you know what

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
How can I say Uno is great

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then say these games are not great

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The only difference really is 5 more dollars

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And these games graphically are a little more polished

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Than the ones in Family Game Night

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't know

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
GameGuru says you might pick it up

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
When it's in the bargain bin

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Perhaps

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's about it for my gaming week

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I have a lot of little things here and there

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I didn't play a lot of games for a long, long time

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's the weird thing

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Is that I played a lot of games here and there

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Probably Retro Game Challenge is the one I played the most

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Because I've unlocked like

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Maybe 5 different games in Retro Game Challenge now

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So there's a lot, a lot of

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Stuff to do there

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Alright, let's move on into some housekeeping

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And then we'll get into the gaming news

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Because there was a lot of news this week

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And that's not even counting the week we were gone

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't even think we're going to have time to address the week we were gone

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
From Game Developers Conference

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just some quick housekeeping

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We don't have a lot of stuff to note right off the top

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But we do want to remind you guys to join our Twitter

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
At OLR is our username on Twitter

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So that's getting more and more popular

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We got like randomly like 20 new followers all in one day

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't know if somebody followed Friday to us

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Is that what it is?

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
There was a lot of people

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Because we didn't have

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But maybe 150 to begin with

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So I just thought it was pretty cool

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So thanks to everybody who's now following us on Twitter

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
If you're not on there yet, you should add us

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We ask questions and we're going to read replies a little later in the show

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You don't even have to really be listening live

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going to get to tonight's question a little bit later

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And also though, you don't just have Twitter

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because I know there's a lot of anti-Twitters out there

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's fine, whatever you're into

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Facebook, OLR is our club on Facebook

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We have a MySpace as well

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But is it just me or is MySpace like quickly dying off?

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Like Facebook is really stomping them out

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I hated MySpace from the first day I was on it

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So the only reason I

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Even remotely look at it anymore

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Is because my brothers every so often are on there

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There were things I liked about MySpace

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But I'm slowly not liking it as much anymore

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The only thing that I wish that Facebook would get

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Is customizable backgrounds

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The other thing, LiveJournal

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Is also our community at Orange Lounge

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Which we haven't posted a lot too lately

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Especially as our

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Listeners and stuff post things there

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We always read that and keep an eye on that

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Also yeah, Dekeman reminds us

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hey there's that little box called extended play

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
On the OLR homepage and it has it all

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It has like our last FM group, our steam community

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If you want to find some like-minded gamers

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That cool people to listen to

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
A little internet radio program out of someone's

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Garage then check it out

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
On OrangeLoungeRadio.com

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Alright let's get into some gaming news because damn

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
A lot happened this week and that might be thanks to

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
A little thing called the Game Developers Conference

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Which might I remind you is not E3

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's not where the companies are supposed

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
To make their big, big announcements

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But sometimes you'll hear things aimed

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Towards developers and we have had big announcements

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Out of GDC in the past, for instance

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
PlayStation Home was a big one we got a couple years ago

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And sometimes you get some game announcements

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Here and there, but we got quite a bit out of this year's

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Game Developer Conference. Loki's gonna start us off tonight

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes, there's a new

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm not even sure if you'd call it a console

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Format I guess, on Live

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Which is gonna basically

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Be almost like

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I guess those TiVo boxes

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That you can get where you can stream

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Videos to your home

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
This service you'll actually be able to stream

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Games to your home

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And it'll also be like a really small

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Box that you would put next to your TV

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Have a USB controller

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That would plug into it and basically you'll be able to stream

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
High end games, everything from

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Crysis to Burnout, Paradise

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Stuff like that

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And they're saying that they

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Can do it within the limits of bandwidth

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Right now and that there's minor

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No lag whatsoever

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But the frame rate can take a hit

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If your stream isn't that

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Doesn't have that much bandwidth

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So you see

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
When I was first reading about this I was thinking

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It was gonna be like GameTap

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But something you took up to your TV

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I think I remember saying a long time ago

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I don't even know if it was when we interviewed

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The guy from GameTap, that was a long time ago

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But I remember we were talking about GameTap should be something

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can plug into your TV and this thing would

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Sell like crazy

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This might as well be like an extension

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Of GameTap or just rename it to GameTap

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And just have like

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well the same people are involved so they can't really do that

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Well damn just talk to

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Hey okay you got the technology

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You've got the technology, they've got the name

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And you know, let's do it

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Not only do we get the high end PC games

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's get some you know the retro stuff

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Just have everything

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay but the streaming frame skipping is weird to me

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because the way GameTap works

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You download the whole game to your computer

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then play it that way

815
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It doesn't sound like this works the same way

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This is being run on like a remote server

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That you're actually playing

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Which is pretty impressive when you think about it

819
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because there's like little

820
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
No lag whatsoever, at least no discernible lag

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So that's kind of cool

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Or so they say

823
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I mean let's face it right

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Obviously right now they have to probably test the hell out of it

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Because I can't imagine that this is really going to work

826
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I mean unless they have one hell of an algorithm

827
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Basically it is

828
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because the way I see it

829
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You're going to need a PC for every one of these

830
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Things that are going

831
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So each person is going to need their own PC

832
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Basically in this remote server

833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
To be able to play this stuff

834
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Whatever game

835
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So this does not hook up to your TV?

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No, well it does hook up to your TV

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But I mean

838
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You don't need your own PC

839
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Your own high end PC to run this stuff

840
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Which I think you should

841
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Actually be able to play these games

842
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Is the effort that it takes to

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Own a PC or build a PC to do it

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But whatever

845
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
In your hacking and cracking opinion

846
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well not really

847
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because I'd be pissed off if my stream crisis

848
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Got to the end and couldn't finish it

849
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Because the game was broken

850
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You hook this box into your TV

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Correct? Yes

852
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So you don't need a computer at all or a monitor

853
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That's important

854
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
All you need to do is basically hook it up to

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well

856
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
On the back here it looks like they've got a phone jack

857
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And they've also got

858
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That might be a USB jack actually

859
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Never mind

860
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But they've got an ethernet and then your HDMI

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's going to plug into that

862
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know

863
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It looks neat

864
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Some of the other cool features on there

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They're going to have a way you can share

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Videos

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They call them brag clips

868
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No real gamer score obviously

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You can rent the game

870
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You can demo it before you buy it

871
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Obviously

872
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Lots of cool stuff

873
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And I don't know

874
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's a neat idea if they can get it to work

875
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That'd be really cool

876
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The problem is I don't know if they're going to be able to get it to work

877
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like they want to

878
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But I think there are other applications for it

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If this doesn't end up working out

880
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm very curious to see what's going to happen at E3

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because you know they're going to probably

882
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Have to kind of show a little more

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Stuff at E3 and there's going to be a much bigger audience

884
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Of people watching them at E3

885
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm kind of curious to see how it really

886
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Flows

887
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But my thing is

888
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
If they can get to work

889
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
With this little stupid box

890
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And stream it

891
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What's going to say stop

892
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Sony or Microsoft from streaming a game

893
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
A full game

894
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Over their service

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Isn't this the direction we've all seen them moving in anyway?

896
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah

897
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's not any surprise

898
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Microsoft and Sony have slowly been walking

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This direction anyway

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Especially now that Sony offers their old school catalog

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
As download titles to the

902
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
TV and the

903
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
PSP

904
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And now you can buy Burnout Paradise online

905
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Completely

906
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But I think this would be even better though

907
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Because for a console manufacturer

908
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They've already got the console to crunch everything

909
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It wouldn't necessarily be all

910
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
On a remote server

911
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And sending all the information

912
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And sending it your way

913
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You can actually use some of the processing power

914
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Of the console itself

915
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
To kind of take care of that

916
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So it should be easier to do it on a console

917
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Than say whatever this little box is

918
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because that's basically just receiving a signal

919
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That means converting the video feed

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I think it's just a matter of time

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Before we start seeing the newest, latest

922
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And greatest games or things that you download

923
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You know and all this

924
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think it's just a matter of time

925
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
To get late in this generation

926
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think, but especially as we start getting into

927
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The next Microsoft

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The next PS4

929
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Or whatever, I think we're really going to start seeing

930
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
These types of ideas that

931
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Maybe OnLive is bringing to the table

932
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Mixed with the

933
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Console power

934
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, be interesting

935
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Alright, well

936
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Talking about other things

937
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That came out of

938
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Game Developers Conference

939
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We're talking about digital rights management

940
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And one of the big companies of course behind DRM

941
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Is Steam

942
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Steamworks is a new kind of thing

943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That Valve is putting together and they're talking about

944
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How it's going to make DRM

945
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Obsolete

946
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Apparently Steamworks has this new anti-piracy

947
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Technology that involves

948
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Customer executable generation

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Which they're calling SEG for short

950
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
C-E-G

951
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Although which is funny because I have a friend named SEG

952
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But it's spelled differently

953
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
SEG

954
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It sounds like basically each individual

955
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Gets their own unique executable file

956
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But you can play it

957
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
On any compatible PC

958
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
No install limits

959
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No rootkits

960
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But when you buy the copy

961
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's your customized copy

962
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So if suddenly your copy were to show up on a torrent

963
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Everybody would know who did it

964
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Interesting

965
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Kind of surprised a technique like this

966
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Hasn't been thought of a long time ago

967
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Wouldn't the hackers figure out a way to take

968
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The information out of the EXE

969
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Or block it or scramble

970
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Or figure out how to sign it themselves

971
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's not going to work

972
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's a good attempt but it's not going to work

973
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well you know where there's a will

974
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There's a way

975
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Pirates are going to hack everything

976
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Did they say that this way

977
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That it will end piracy

978
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Basically?

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't think anybody is going to make those bold statements anymore

980
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like DRM obsolete

981
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That they did claim

982
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay well maybe that's not so bad but

983
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't know

984
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I still think that

985
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Even if they don't even care

986
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
About the subject matter being put out

987
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sorry

988
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The hacking community likes a good challenge

989
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room

990
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
chat.orangelandrater.com says it's called a watermark

991
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Which you know

992
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You think like a picture

993
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Sometimes if you have a picture on a website

994
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Some websites do this crap all the time

995
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like for instance

996
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A company like IGN

997
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Might find a logo for a brand new Wii game

998
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
On some piddly little independent radio site

999
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And copy it

1000
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And then they'll put their watermark on it

1001
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
When they put it on their own website

1002
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So that everybody knows that when they get it

1003
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
From the bigger website with all the bandwidth

1004
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That it came from IGN

1005
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Which may or may not be true

1006
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is that a good analogy?

1007
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's a pretty good analogy I think

1008
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This is actually speaking of the same situation

1009
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What we should be doing

1010
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Is going in photoshop and adding in

1011
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The image information

1012
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Details as far as what was taken

1013
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Where it came from that type of thing

1014
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Embed all that data within the file

1015
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Where you don't actually need the watermark

1016
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm actually thinking that

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That could be something more like what they're going to do

1018
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Actually have something

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Not necessarily

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Overt like

1021
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
A watermark like you're saying

1022
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But something that's embedded deep into the code

1023
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Or maybe even

1024
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Some little difference

1025
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In a code like a different color

1026
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
On a shirt or something

1027
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
For a particular character they know they look for that character

1028
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That shirt's a different color that's your copy

1029
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know a series of

1030
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Randomly generated events

1031
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Though that will identify it

1032
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But not be immediately

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah I was going to say if they want to be smart about this

1034
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They're not going to put the information out there

1035
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
In the open. The subtle watermark

1036
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Will be something like

1037
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A particular pattern that appears

1038
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Or a picture that shows up somewhere

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That it's going to take a while for the

1040
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Pirates to figure out

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What is being watermarked

1042
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I think if you just cram name and number in the file

1043
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's not going to be enough

1044
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And if they're not doing it that way that idea

1045
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Is copyright

1046
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
2009 Jamie

1047
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's right

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Put a little watermark on it right now

1049
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm saying right now that's my idea

1050
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's a very interesting way around it though

1051
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So there you go

1052
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We'll see what happens with this

1053
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You know obviously steam has a lot of power

1054
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So far I suppose you could say

1055
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So it will be interesting to see

1056
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Kind of the impact that this ultimately has

1057
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
On the PC gaming and the PC

1058
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Piracy scene

1059
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Well in other PC news

1060
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And piracy

1061
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
God this is going to make it so easy for the pirates

1062
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But who cares

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Sims 3 is not going to use the DRM

1064
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's actually going to

1065
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Just use a key code

1066
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
A CD key

1067
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That will be broken in about 5 seconds

1068
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I know

1069
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But then again

1070
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's seriously with as many people

1071
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Complain about DRM

1072
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's really going to be the best way

1073
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think right now to at least

1074
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You know

1075
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Please some of the players

1076
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So

1077
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Although I love

1078
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Love what the guy said about it

1079
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
There's a quote from

1080
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Trying to see

1081
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Who the person is

1082
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Rod Humble

1083
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Who is the executive producer

1084
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Saying

1085
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We feel that this is a good time proven solution

1086
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Which makes it easy for you to play the game without

1087
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
DRM methods

1088
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That feel overly invasive or leave you concerned

1089
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
About authorization server access

1090
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In the distant future

1091
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I agree to that

1092
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Extent you won't have to worry about

1093
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Being authorized every time you play it

1094
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You won't have to worry about

1095
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You know having to

1096
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Be online to play it but at the same

1097
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Time it is

1098
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Going to mean that they're going to find a lot

1099
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
More

1100
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I suppose hacked versions out there

1101
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You know that people are going to be breaking

1102
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Those codes

1103
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's good I didn't want to buy that game anyways

1104
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm buying it

1105
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I need to make more houses

1106
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I need to burn more people

1107
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I need to drown more people in the pool

1108
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And then turn the lawn into a graveyard

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's even better

1110
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And then the people who move in

1111
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Are like haunted

1112
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There needs to be more vampires in Sims 3

1113
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And aliens

1114
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And um

1115
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Mutant powers

1116
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So it'll be Sims X3

1117
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Okay

1118
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But not a crappy sequel

1119
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Dear god no

1120
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Anyways

1121
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There's some pretty interesting stuff

1122
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean we've already seen this with the

1123
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Xbox 360 but now Netflix

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Is kind of branching out to other

1125
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Game systems to see

1126
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You know maybe there's

1127
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Potential interest in

1128
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Streaming to theirs

1129
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
For example the Playstation 3

1130
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
There was a survey going around

1131
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Asking people what their

1132
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If they'd be interested in something

1133
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Like the service that they have

1134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Right now on the Xbox 360

1135
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
On the Playstation 3

1136
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
However it'd be a little bit different

1137
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What would happen is you'd actually have

1138
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
To purchase a Netflix

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Instant streaming disc for a one time fee

1140
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Of $10 and since this can be

1141
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Put into your

1142
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Drive and then basically install

1143
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The run off there and then you have to

1144
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Connect your PS3 to the internet

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And you'd be able to stream

1146
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
All sorts of stuff to it

1147
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
All different movies

1148
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And could this perhaps

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Mean that we're going to see Netflix

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Coming to other systems?

1151
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Maybe? I don't know

1152
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think they're going to go where the money is so

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Why not?

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Huh

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's just interesting though because I think

1156
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
In our minds we all assume that Playstation 3

1157
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Will go with a competitor like Blockbuster

1158
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Or something else so it's kind of interesting

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That Netflix could essentially end up

1160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Having Monopoly pretty soon

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
On the high end systems

1162
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah

1163
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well it may not just be a monopoly with the high end systems

1164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It may be a monopoly with the

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
New gen systems you know whatever you want to call

1166
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The Wii as well and that is that

1167
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
There's a survey going around

1168
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Apparently hinting that there could be a Netflix

1169
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Service for the Wii in the future

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Apparently this is

1171
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Some type of survey

1172
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Going around that's asking

1173
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If they would be

1174
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Interested in a Netflix

1175
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Sorry Netflix instant

1176
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Streaming disc

1177
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Apparently this would be a disc that you would

1178
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Put in the Wii when you want to use the Netflix

1179
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Streaming service and it's

1180
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Not something that would come automatically with a firmware

1181
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Update so I'm not sure if you have to buy this for a fee

1182
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Or if it would be very low cost or something you could order

1183
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
From Netflix no idea

1184
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Very

1185
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Interesting to see if this would actually

1186
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Be something that would happen

1187
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Oh no I'm sorry I'm looking at

1188
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It in the survey it says a one time fee

1189
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Of ten dollars for the Netflix instant

1190
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Streaming disc and then your Wii would be connected to the

1191
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Internet

1192
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So it could be that Netflix

1193
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Could automatically show up on the Wii the

1194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
PS3 and the Xbox 360

1195
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
All at once and they would kind of dominate the streaming

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Video market I don't know if this would

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Necessarily be a bad thing I mean you know

1198
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Netflix has a pretty big library but of course little

1199
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Competitions healthy too one thing

1200
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think Netflix suffers from is they don't have

1201
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
A lot of big big stuff in

1202
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Their streaming library and I know they've talked about

1203
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Adding stuff later on for a higher fee but

1204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
They don't get a lot of brand

1205
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
New stuff if it's not an obscure

1206
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Indie film or a

1207
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Documentary which don't get me wrong those aren't necessarily

1208
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Bad but some days you want to

1209
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Watch the big action shoot them up too and those things are

1210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Never available instantly right away for

1211
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Many many many years so

1212
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know I think

1213
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
A little competition would be healthy if one of the other services

1214
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Would get involved at the same time if Netflix

1215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Hopefully can get some of the newer stuff on

1216
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Their service it could be pretty awesome so

1217
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We'll see

1218
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We'll see if this uh

1219
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Survey of course surveys can sometimes be meaningless

1220
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's just a survey don't take it too seriously

1221
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And the survey says

1222
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Who knows

1223
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well how about something a little different

1224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Sure

1225
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
More stuff out of game developers conference

1226
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yay

1227
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The legend of Zelda

1228
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Spirit tracks

1229
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's sort of the makes me think of ice cream

1230
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You know what's

1231
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The one moose tracks

1232
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Is that I don't know

1233
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I want ice cream I think

1234
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Ice cream sounds delicious

1235
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I have one ice cream cone in the house

1236
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And I'm so eating it during break

1237
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You bitch don't hate me

1238
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Okay only if you buy me pie

1239
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We'll see

1240
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Anywhere

1241
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Anywhere

1242
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks is

1243
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Another cell

1244
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Shaded link game

1245
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But um

1246
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He's

1247
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Got a train

1248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I guess with a cannon

1249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I have no idea

1250
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm looking at some of this and it's just weird

1251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But it looks like it's gonna be

1252
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
On the Nintendo DS

1253
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Is it supposed to be some

1254
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Type of like training

1255
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Game or what is this

1256
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He's got a freaking train

1257
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Haven't they called this a rail shooter game or something?

1258
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Is what this is supposed to be

1259
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Link on a train

1260
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Seriously

1261
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's just gonna be a standard Zelda game

1262
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's just people are basing their

1263
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Information off of what they see in the trailer

1264
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And speculating

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Okay now there's no water

1266
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But he's wearing a conductor's outfit in every darn scene you see him in

1267
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Maybe he likes it

1268
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Maybe it makes him feel sexy inside

1269
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't know

1270
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Maybe he's worn out the

1271
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Link on a train

1272
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I think Frisbee in chat sums it up

1273
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
There's a song that would describe this game

1274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Come on ride the train

1275
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And ride it woo woo

1276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That should be the song they use in the trailer

1277
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I was thinking of Snakes on a Plane

1278
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Or Snakes on a Train

1279
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Wasn't that a direct to DVD version or something like that?

1280
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It was a knock off video

1281
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Alright well

1282
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I don't know

1283
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I guess more to come on this

1284
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Probably at E3

1285
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm assuming this is gonna be playable at E3

1286
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We'll find out more about this

1287
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
When they're hurting there's a new Zelda game right?

1288
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know

1289
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah so

1290
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Along with that of course we have

1291
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
A little bit more Zelda

1292
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Information including another

1293
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Zelda coming to Virtual Console

1294
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
In Japan but you know

1295
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's gonna be coming everywhere else eventually I'm sure

1296
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Actually

1297
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
In April we're gonna be getting

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask

1299
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
On Virtual Console

1300
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Also expected out on

1301
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Sega Master System Phantasy Star

1302
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
For the PC Engine

1303
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Ninja Gaiden

1304
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Also

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Part of the Virtual Console Arcade

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Genpai

1307
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Terma Den and Space Invaders

1308
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And then

1309
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
For the Super Famicom Kirby's Dream Land 3

1310
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And

1311
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Let's see here

1312
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And then Castlevania 3

1313
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
On the Famicom

1314
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So that's kinda cool

1315
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But I'm sure we'll see stuff

1316
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
In other regions probably around the same time

1317
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I do want to point out though Phantasy Star is in that Ultimate Genesis Collection

1318
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You can get all of them

1319
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
For like 30 bucks and you know

1320
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I would never pay 5 dollars

1321
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
For just Phantasy Star when I know this is out there

1322
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
With all the Phantasy Star games

1323
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
For like 30 bucks

1324
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Just saying

1325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well their prices are a little high anyways

1326
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
If you ask me

1327
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Anyhow

1328
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Look one thing that always kinda pissed me off

1329
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
About Virtual Consoles is that there was no place on the damn Wii

1330
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
To store all of these Virtual Console games

1331
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That sometimes I want to download

1332
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And especially add WiiWare into it

1333
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And the storage capacity on the Wii stinks

1334
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And you might remember people have been bitching about this

1335
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
For a long time and what was it last like

1336
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Freaking September or October

1337
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This guy that worked for Nintendo came out and said

1338
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Nobody cares about that

1339
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Just geeks know Taku

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Are the only people that care about this and I said F you buddy

1341
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
May I?

1342
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah exactly I said F you buddy

1343
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
If that's gonna be your attitude then I

1344
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Ban myself from Virtual Console

1345
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm not downloading any more stuff

1346
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Cause I'll tell you what I had like 3 screens full of Virtual Console

1347
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Crap before that point I don't know how I fit it all in there

1348
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Mostly little NES games

1349
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I said you know the hell with this

1350
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
If that's gonna be your attitude then I ban

1351
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Virtual Console until Nintendo addresses

1352
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This issue and guess what?

1353
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Finally

1354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
All these months later

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes my boycott has come to an end

1356
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because they did announce at Game Developers Conference

1357
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
In 2009 that the Wii Shop channel

1358
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Would be updated with the SD Card

1359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Menu that would allow you 20 pages

1360
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Of games on the

1361
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
SD Card without having to

1362
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Copy it back and forth like you did

1363
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Before you could actually boot the damn game

1364
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
From the SD Card and now

1365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Not necessarily though

1366
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Also let me say this not just

1367
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Can you do 2GB

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
SD Cards which is a lot of room to begin with

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Especially compared to what's on the Wii to begin with

1370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You can now run up to 32GB

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
SD Cards in the slot

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Loki what were you gonna say?

1373
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Technically it's not necessarily running off the

1374
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
SD Card it's copying them to the Wii

1375
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Memory so that is one little

1376
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Asterisk on there you need to have

1377
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Free memory on your Wii's

1378
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Internal storage

1379
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
However though if you get an SD Card

1380
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That's big enough just copy everything to the damn

1381
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
SD Card at least all the games

1382
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You know save files I'm sure it'll be enough

1383
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But it alleviates the problem of having to go

1384
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Into the memory manager every single time

1385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Which was stupid and I know a lot of people were

1386
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Emailing me saying Rob you should just copy things in the memory

1387
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I said no no that's stupid because it needs to be

1388
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Part of this whole seamless thing you know

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You're making excuses for Nintendo

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Having these big ideas

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
With what they want to do with the download service

1392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And then not having the space to put it all

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So you're making excuses so

1394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Nintendo needs to address this directly make it very

1395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Seamless make it easy and they

1396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Finally did so there you go

1397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And so of course if you were listening early in the show I talked about

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I played Bit.Trip Beat I also played

1399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Gradius Rebirth I didn't play it enough

1400
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I went on a buying binge to buy

1401
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Some of the things I missed out on

1402
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
While my boycott was going on so

1403
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
There you go

1404
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That happens from time to time sorry

1405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
What is this

1406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Did you talk about your video right?

1407
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah sometimes when you punch somebody they bounce

1408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Back and they knock you open into the air

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Anyways sorry back to the show

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And Dr. Tutti in chat says as long as you leave enough

1411
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
To load your biggest VC game should be an issue

1412
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You're right but all I do I copy all

1413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
My games to the SD card now and I'll have

1414
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Plenty of room on the

1415
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Wii I would like to point

1416
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Out and this is not unfortunately

1417
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
A positive point for

1418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Nintendo they've already figured out

1419
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
How to crack this already

1420
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And now of course you can

1421
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Still load you know the 4.0

1422
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Firmware for your Wii

1423
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And still be able to install mods that

1424
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Are pirated and stuff and copy them all to your

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
SD cards and that sort of thing

1426
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But it does alleviate you know

1427
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Room so people can actually download more

1428
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Of your Wiiware stuff

1429
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Hmm

1430
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Alright well let's go to Twitter

1431
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And we do a little segment here on the show called

1432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Show us your tweets and

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
We like to ask questions on Twitter and then you guys

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Answer them and we read some of our favorite responses

1435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Here on the show and we actually

1436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Asked you guys just a little bit before the show started

1437
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Tonight we wanted to know

1438
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
How you kind of felt about these Nintendo announcements

1439
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
At GDC

1440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We specifically asked did Nintendo's announcements

1441
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
At GDC show a commitment

1442
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
To us core gamers

1443
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Or are you not satisfied? Here's some of the answers we got

1444
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
On Twitter which is a little

1445
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Bit diverse here

1446
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let's see

1447
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
We've got

1448
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Poor Leno111

1449
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Says to me the train plus Zelda equals

1450
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Fail I wish they would just go back to the old school

1451
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Style of Zelda

1452
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Ryan Belknap says

1453
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Just should be happy they said anything at all

1454
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They could have kept it for E3

1455
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Joy says with the new games and support

1456
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
For a bigger SD card I think it's a great move

1457
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But I know tons of people will still complain

1458
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Scruffy K says no I think Nintendo

1459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is trying to keep the core gamers from deserting them

1460
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
A Zelda in the hands is good as two

1461
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
In production

1462
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Act Def says while nobody expected

1463
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Those announcements by Nintendo's part

1464
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm still waiting for a real core gamer

1465
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Announcement for E3 or I hope so

1466
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Crows said

1467
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Nintendo will never satisfy me until they

1468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Make a new Star Fox game that is not full of suck

1469
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Deep Man says besides the

1470
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
SD card thing I don't think I saw anything that

1471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Impressed me from Nintendo this week

1472
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
There you go

1473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Some of the answers from our

1474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Show us your tweets segment

1475
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
We're on twitter.com under OLR

1476
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And we like to post questions for you guys to answer

1477
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Before the show

1478
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Let's move on we do have a couple more

1479
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Nintendo stories out of

1480
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Game developers conference I almost said

1481
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
E3

1482
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We're a little bit

1483
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Stuck right now though so why don't I go ahead and just

1484
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Take this next one

1485
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So the next story would be about

1486
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Sorry we got some live issues going on

1487
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Live radio folks

1488
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's called Jamie's computer is a piece of crap

1489
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That's alright well Jamie would have been excited to tell you

1490
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
About the virtual console arcade that was

1491
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Also announced at game developers conference

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And is now just

1493
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Loading?

1494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Well then tell them what arcade games they can be looking forward to

1495
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Well hey there's all kinds of cool

1496
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Stuff that you can be looking forward to

1497
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
In fact I would

1498
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Actually even say if you are a Namco

1499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Fan then you're going to

1500
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Be supremely pleased

1501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Now something that people should know

1502
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
This is like now it's kind of

1503
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Like in a way they're adding a new system

1504
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
To the virtual console

1505
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But that system is arcade games

1506
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Name for the Wii basically

1507
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
There's actually four games that are available

1508
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Now there's

1509
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Gapless which is Namco Bondi

1510
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
For 600 Wii points

1511
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Mappy we love Mappy

1512
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Annoying little freaking game that is

1513
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It's alright

1514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
500 Wii points there's

1515
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Tower of Druago which is

1516
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
500 Wii points also available now

1517
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Star Force from Tecmo

1518
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
500 points and then

1519
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We have a Sega game coming out

1520
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Which is my number three favorite game

1521
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Evar

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Space Harrier

1523
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Hi

1524
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And then

1525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
From Namco Bondi

1526
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Again though

1527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm a little torn because

1528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Didn't a lot of these Namco games show up

1529
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
In these various Namco collections they

1530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Seem to put out on every system?

1531
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Some have not

1532
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And also other ones that are listed on here

1533
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Where we

1534
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Not seeing any too much else

1535
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Listed in the announcement list

1536
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Was Emeralda

1537
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
There's also

1538
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The Return of Ishtar

1539
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So hey

1540
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Here's the mistake I don't want to make

1541
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's very similar to the Sonic Genesis collection

1542
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm pretty sure I heard something about

1543
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Namco's putting out some type of new compilation

1544
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
On the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1545
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
There's a new thing coming out for that

1546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So if that is going to have Mappy

1547
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And some of these games in it

1548
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
When that collection is going to be

1549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
$30 maybe $40 tops

1550
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Why would I buy one game

1551
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
For 500 points when this is likely to

1552
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And again I don't know a lot about it

1553
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
There's one being developed

1554
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Why would I do that?

1555
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Why wouldn't I just go buy the PS3 one

1556
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Just like I would say go buy the Sonic Genesis collection

1557
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I would actually buy

1558
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Individual games on here

1559
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Because I don't know if you remember this is an old example

1560
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You remember when I was scrambling

1561
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Like a chicken with a head cut off

1562
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
To try to find the entire Namco

1563
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Playstation series

1564
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And I think I'm like

1565
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Missing the O

1566
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So I have some of the rare ones

1567
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
For the trademark symbol that was only on Japan

1568
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Or the restricted symbol or whatever

1569
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But there's games on those compilations

1570
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That I wanted that we didn't get on the

1571
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
US versions you know

1572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And it would be far cheaper for me

1573
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
To have my compilation and then

1574
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Just get the couple of them that I don't have

1575
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You know so like

1576
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
For Tower of Druaga you know

1577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
True I have that on the Playstation

1578
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
One but

1579
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's not always convenient to hook up

1580
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You know my Playstation

1581
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Or deal with you know backwards compatibility

1582
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Or any of that

1583
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I can see that I can see that and you know like something like

1584
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
A Space Harrier as much as you love that game

1585
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I can see why you would want to get that

1586
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And you know I'd have 50,000

1587
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I seriously can name off

1588
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Multiple versions of Space Harrier that I have

1589
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And what's one more right what's one more

1590
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Like I've got it on Saturn

1591
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I have it on PC Engine

1592
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I've got it on 32X

1593
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Ok it's only a 3 hour show

1594
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The 32X version is arcade perfect by the way

1595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Insert coin instead of press start

1596
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Nice

1597
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But I was going to say you know and I think one thing

1598
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That I don't believe made our show roll tonight is about

1599
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The Final Fantasy games

1600
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
All the old ones are going to be

1601
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
They were officially announced that they're coming to Virtual Console

1602
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'll pay the money for Final Fantasy 4 and 6 again

1603
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Even though I already own those games

1604
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I own 6 the cartridge

1605
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Somewhere and I own 4

1606
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Final Fantasy 5

1607
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I got 4 on the Wonderswan Color

1608
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Of all things I've got 4 on

1609
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You know the DS

1610
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I've got 4 you know

1611
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'll buy it again on Super Nintendo that's how much I fucking love that game

1612
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Especially

1613
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Especially if they release

1614
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Although I have a feeling we're going to get the Bastard Eyes 2

1615
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That was the first release here because it is Virtual Console

1616
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But especially if we got like the Japanese retranslation

1617
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh my god I'd be so excited

1618
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'd be so excited

1619
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
If I had a perfect translation of Final Fantasy 3

1620
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I would be freaking in heaven

1621
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But you know what game that I totally wish

1622
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That they would bring out

1623
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That would be translated as Seiken Densetsu 3

1624
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh

1625
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Hi people there is an officially

1626
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
There's a fully

1627
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Sprite hacked everything

1628
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Translated version out there just say

1629
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Let us use that please

1630
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Or just fucking use it because it was your game in the first place

1631
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You know what I mean

1632
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I think they would have every right to just use it

1633
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You know what I mean

1634
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
What could the translators do

1635
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Gee sorry we you know kind of like

1636
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Copied your game and ROM dumped it

1637
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
In the entirety of the internet right

1638
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That would totally not get

1639
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Nintendo any friends

1640
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But still

1641
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But still my point is

1642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There that it exists

1643
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
People did this in their spare time

1644
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Why can't Nintendo pay someone and just

1645
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Crank it out you know

1646
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Pay them a dollar

1647
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I don't think we'll see that ever

1648
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You know on a

1649
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Well we may eventually see it but

1650
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Never say never we did get Final Fantasy 5

1651
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Eventually

1652
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
That's true

1653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Eventually

1654
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Never say never with Second Detsetsu

1655
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Never say never

1656
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And that could be a thing that they would

1657
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Be holding back for E3 but you know

1658
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up

1659
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And I doubt it but you know

1660
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
You never know

1661
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That and Earthbound are like the two

1662
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Things they could pull out of their pants

1663
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And lay on the table and they would just like

1664
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh my god Fandagasm

1665
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Seriously it would be so much wank

1666
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
For real

1667
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Speaking of so much wank

1668
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh

1669
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
There's another game that will not be coming

1670
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
To a Nintendo console soon

1671
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
At least not through legitimate means

1672
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But now thanks to a

1673
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Coding competition there is

1674
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
A new application Kamasutra

1675
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
For the DS

1676
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yes with this you can actually see

1677
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Visual representations of all the different

1678
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Kamasutra positions

1679
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And can learn about the pros and cons

1680
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Of them

1681
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No they'll release it in the states they'll just call it sex training

1682
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yes my personal trainer

1683
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Kamasutra

1684
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
They'll just rename it yoga for adults

1685
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
My personal trainer butt sex

1686
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Wait is the gay Kamasutra

1687
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Part of this?

1688
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I don't know

1689
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I had it downloaded I just haven't gotten a chance to load it on my

1690
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Card yet

1691
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
There's actually some other neat things that came out

1692
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But I can't remember what they were

1693
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Um

1694
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Robert M in chat is kind of referencing our

1695
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Last little bit there we were talking about Earthbound

1696
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And how it would just become fanboy wank all over the place

1697
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
If that was announced for E3 and Robert M says

1698
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Didn't Black Wolf say Earthbound would not be

1699
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Coming to Virtual Console due to the pop

1700
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Culture references? True and Bobby

1701
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Did make a very good point and I'm not gonna

1702
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You know deny that there's a lot of shit they got

1703
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Away with 15 years ago they probably couldn't get away

1704
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
With now especially with Wii getting sued as much as it does

1705
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
However if they

1706
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Wanted to take the time to go back and recode

1707
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Some things and redo some things which you know

1708
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Wouldn't be that much time at all considering

1709
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
How much this would sell

1710
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And then just kind of not tell people that

1711
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
When they announce Earthbound that they oh yeah

1712
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And we changed it a lot

1713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
They'll still be wank all over the place

1714
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
They did the same thing with

1715
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Tecmo Bowl, Wave Race 64

1716
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah I mean it's not unheard of for them to change

1717
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Games

1718
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Granted there'd be a lot to change

1719
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But they could do it and probably make a killing

1720
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
On Virtual Console they just wouldn't advertise

1721
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That they went back and changed stuff cause all the purists

1722
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Would be up in arms but it's

1723
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Better than nothing right?

1724
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The purists would be up in arms

1725
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Anyway and you know what to hell with it

1726
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
As long as we get it

1727
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It depends how much they mess with it

1728
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
For me but we'll see

1729
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
More stuff out of Game Developer Conference

1730
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And this is also from Nintendo

1731
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
A game called Rock and Roll Climber

1732
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah Rock and Roll Climber

1733
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Not to be confused with Crazy Climber

1734
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's a much different game

1735
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Ice Climber or Rock and Roll Racing

1736
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Although maybe you could unlock

1737
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Ice Climber in this game

1738
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
What are you talking about?

1739
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
What you talking about Loki?

1740
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What about Rock and Roll Racing or Snake and Roll

1741
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
No this is a whole new game

1742
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Whole new IP so props to them for doing a new

1743
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
IP but it's called Rock and Roll

1744
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Climber it's a balance board game

1745
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That you use the balance board and

1746
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The Wiimote and Nunchuck and you do

1747
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
These arm movements to climb up a wall

1748
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
The balance board reads your leg movements

1749
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
The Wiimote and Nunchuck read your

1750
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Arm movements and

1751
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Apparently here's the weird thing

1752
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Once you get to the top you get a guitar

1753
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And you play a riff

1754
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So I'm assuming

1755
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's some type of music

1756
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Fusion with this game I know they didn't say

1757
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
A lot at GDC maybe this is one of the things

1758
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
They're going to be showing more at E3 but I imagine

1759
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
They're incorporating I mean to call the game Rock and Roll

1760
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Climber they're probably incorporating

1761
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Music into this now maybe it's that you have to climb

1762
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
On beat or something like that I don't know it could be

1763
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Anything but I'm sure we'll see more of this

1764
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You have to wail hard

1765
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Just flail about aimlessly

1766
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm sure there's some type of rhythm

1767
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm still waiting for Air Guitar Hero

1768
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We just don't know

1769
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
They have an air guitar mode in Guitar Hero

1770
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's actually an air guitar machine

1771
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It just takes away the instruments

1772
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
That they have

1773
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Anyhow there you go Rock and Roll Climber

1774
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Coming out probably

1775
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
This summer or something

1776
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I may add it looked like crap

1777
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Also and it's a WiiWare title

1778
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And it looked like oh I didn't even

1779
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Catch that it's WiiWare? It's WiiWare

1780
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's absolute crap

1781
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And everyone's like

1782
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Oh maybe it's the sequel to Ice Climber

1783
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
No they would never do anything that cool

1784
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because then if

1785
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They just kicked that guy in the face

1786
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Dark Tetsuya

1787
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You make horrible radio when you reference it

1788
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Dark Tetsuya says Sky the game kind of gives me a vibe

1789
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Of the old school NES version where it's just

1790
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Cute congrats on beating the level animation

1791
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Well maybe

1792
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That's basically it it's just another way to say

1793
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Look it's another thing you can use the Wii Fit board for

1794
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You can be fit and climb walls

1795
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Because people like climbing walls

1796
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The whole guitar thing sort of

1797
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Really makes me go back to a

1798
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Strong bad

1799
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Thing with the cheat

1800
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Here the tort have a trophy

1801
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm sorry I only want to climb walls

1802
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
If I'm going to be chased by an American Gladiator

1803
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
While I do so

1804
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
There should be Frank mode where you can climb a

1805
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Button and then it falls on you and you die

1806
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And if you catch that reference you're awesome

1807
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I caught that reference and I don't even know

1808
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
What it's from

1809
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well I do know what it's from but I've never even seen the source material

1810
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Alright forget it

1811
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Let's move on

1812
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
How about something crazy

1813
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And something that we already have in America

1814
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But hey our friends in the UK are finally getting it

1815
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You get Dementium

1816
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Where you can be Looney

1817
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Looney

1818
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Dementium the ward

1819
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's for the DS

1820
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It will be out on April 17th

1821
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Two days before my birthday

1822
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But yeah we've had it since October

1823
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And it's been in Japan

1824
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Since summer

1825
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But if you want to be in a

1826
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Survival horror game

1827
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Where you can fight spooky

1828
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Monsters in a

1829
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Mental hospital

1830
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And not know how you got there

1831
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Get this game

1832
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
How's that?

1833
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Wow that's a great sales pitch

1834
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Thank you

1835
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You get to be chased by monsters in the hospital

1836
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And it's not Silent Hill

1837
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'm sure the makers of that game really appreciate you

1838
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
For that little summary there

1839
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
They're not even around anymore

1840
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Well they are around but they're not even Gamecock anymore

1841
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's South Peak now

1842
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Not quite as cool

1843
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Didn't they get absorbed as part of the economy?

1844
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Gamecock has been inserted into another company

1845
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You're so mature

1846
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
As we hinted earlier that the possible outcome of my console

1847
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I may remind you Rob

1848
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
This console has died once

1849
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And come back to life

1850
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It's the Jesus console

1851
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Did it take you three days to revive it?

1852
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yes it did actually

1853
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But

1854
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
There is some striking

1855
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Infrural

1856
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I guess

1857
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Questionnaires that have been filled out

1858
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And people's input put in place

1859
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Both Joystick and Engadget

1860
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Have run polls regarding the E74 error

1861
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Which is

1862
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
As Microsoft puts it

1863
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
A general hardware error

1864
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Hmmmm

1865
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
General hardware error

1866
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You say

1867
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That's funny because there's

1868
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Three lights of death I guess

1869
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
There's also a general hardware error

1870
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And we don't see many of those anymore

1871
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Hmmmm

1872
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And then all of a sudden

1873
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
After the new Xbox experience

1874
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Was installed

1875
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We started seeing a lot more of these E74 errors

1876
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
In fact the dramatic increase of them

1877
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And

1878
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
What's interesting though

1879
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Is people are kind of

1880
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Getting all conspiracy theory mode here

1881
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And thinking

1882
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Microsoft has

1883
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Specifically stated that they're gonna

1884
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Warranty these three

1885
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Red light

1886
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Errors

1887
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But the E74 errors are not

1888
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Part of that three year warranty

1889
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
They're just part of the one year warranty

1890
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Is this a way for Microsoft to get out of

1891
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Warrenting those consoles that would normally be

1892
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Under the red ring

1893
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But now they have reprogrammed the error

1894
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Displaying to just do this

1895
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
E74 error instead of the three red lights

1896
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Is kind of a way to save some money if you think about it

1897
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So it's actually the same

1898
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Same errors but

1899
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
He's played a different way

1900
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This is all conspiracy though

1901
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Here's my question about the polling

1902
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And my initial thought when I saw these polls

1903
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Is how accurate is this

1904
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
To post this on a video game website

1905
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Have you had this problem yes or no

1906
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
How many people are actually gonna click yes

1907
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
To that survey as opposed to those that are gonna

1908
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Click no because they're pissed off

1909
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I think for that reason alone

1910
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
The statistic is skewed completely

1911
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
The problem I think is

1912
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's relevant to show that there's a point there

1913
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That it is happening

1914
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And it's happening frequently

1915
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But it's not happening nearly as much as the sites say they are

1916
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I think this way of polling people

1917
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Is not statistically so

1918
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I don't know what the actual statistics are

1919
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I do know that there are a lot more of them now

1920
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Than there were before

1921
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Which is a little kind of huh you know

1922
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And then a lot less red rings to death

1923
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And granted you can say okay maybe they're improving the hardware

1924
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But I have a feeling that

1925
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I would not be surprised if this is actually what's going on

1926
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But no one's ever gonna admit to it

1927
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
They're not gonna say oh yeah we changed it

1928
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
So that you know we don't have to pay out on the warranties

1929
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah like they would actually do that

1930
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And you know admit to it

1931
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
There'd be all sorts of lawsuits

1932
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
But

1933
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I've actually you know

1934
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Most of my consoles have died either

1935
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
With the three rings to death

1936
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I've only had one that didn't die that way

1937
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And it never actually popped up in error message

1938
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
In the video so if it did

1939
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I would have never known

1940
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But I'm not surprised

1941
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That something like this is going on

1942
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But who knows

1943
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I mean this may become the new red ring to death thing

1944
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And you know now it's the E74 error

1945
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And it also could be you know

1946
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
A way to say hey look

1947
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You know statistics

1948
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Are the three ring errors you know now

1949
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
You know drop down to nothing you know

1950
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So hey look we're doing good

1951
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But really they're just kind of

1952
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You know shuffling to the side

1953
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
That's shady I hope it's just a conspiracy

1954
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You're talking about there

1955
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Tigerclaw in chat makes a good point

1956
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Microsoft will have to repair the console with the E74 errors

1957
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Regardless they don't want to end up with more bad PR

1958
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Isn't that true? One way or another they're going to have to fix them anyway

1959
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But these consoles are past

1960
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That's the thing though

1961
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
They don't have to fix them because there's a three year warranty

1962
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But if all these consoles start showing up

1963
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
With the E74 aren't they

1964
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You know if they're newer consoles or what have you

1965
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Aren't they going to have to fix them anyway

1966
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
If they're in the one year warranty otherwise

1967
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You have to pay $100 to fix it

1968
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
That's where they get you because it's not the three rings

1969
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
But it would be just like before

1970
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
They were trying to charge $100 to all these people

1971
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
With the red rings and the internet revolted

1972
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Isn't that same thing going to happen? Yeah but prove it

1973
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I mean that's the thing they're going to have to prove it

1974
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
That that's actually going on

1975
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And I just find it a little shady that there's this

1976
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Error message that has the same description

1977
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
As this other error message

1978
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's you know really bad you know

1979
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It's like well it's a general

1980
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Hardware failure

1981
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Okay what's that mean you know

1982
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Is this any different than the three rings

1983
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Well it's a general hardware failure of

1984
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
The graphics chip or the

1985
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Scaler chip or something else

1986
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Well that's exactly what the other one was

1987
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So

1988
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
How's this any different? Oh it's not

1989
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Okay

1990
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I don't know I just hope I don't ever get one of these

1991
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I hope not either or there will be hell to pay

1992
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
On the show just like when I got the red rings

1993
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I was so pissed about that thankfully

1994
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I went out of town

1995
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Anyhow we got some release dates we got to cover

1996
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And I'll start off in Japan with the Japanese

1997
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Release dates and talking about the Xbox 360

1998
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Eleven Eyes crossover

1999
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Is coming out in Japan

2000
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
This is not a game I've heard of I'm wondering if it's just

2001
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
A

2002
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Localized version of one of our titles

2003
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But it doesn't look like it looks like this is a new

2004
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Type of game I guess it's based on an anime

2005
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Because it looks like there's eleven chicks that this game

2006
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Stars it is an adventure

2007
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
What was it again? It's called

2008
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Eleven Eyes crossover

2009
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Huh

2010
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So I don't know

2011
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
What do you think of that three by three eyes?

2012
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I think it's different

2013
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
On the Playstation 3 winning post world is a game coming out from Koei

2014
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
This week on April the 2nd

2015
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii

2016
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Dwalla de Wii winning post world

2017
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Also comes out on the Wii

2018
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Whoa whoa is that Dwalla?

2019
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That's the

2020
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Mascot

2021
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah a little koala bear for their team

2022
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah that's cute

2023
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So I'm assuming that's like a little baseball game that's coming out of there

2024
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
No they're calling it a party game

2025
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So maybe it's like a baseball party game

2026
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Sports party

2027
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Who knows

2028
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So that's pretty cool

2029
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah I think our friend that we both have on LiveJournal

2030
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Deanna who's been spending a lot of time over in Japan

2031
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I think I've seen pictures of her with that character

2032
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yeah I actually

2033
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
A while back I had like a little

2034
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Keychain thing that someone sent me

2035
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So I thought it was cool

2036
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh

2037
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Winning post world also makes its way to the Playstation 2

2038
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
This is hitting multiple systems this week

2039
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm not exactly sure exactly what

2040
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh this is

2041
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Oh it's a horse racing game

2042
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I was gonna say is it the same thing as winning 11

2043
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But it's not it's a horse racing game

2044
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But it looks pretty intricate

2045
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Soccer on horses that's awesome

2046
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Isn't that just polo?

2047
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
No that's croquet on horses

2048
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah that'd be croquet on horses

2049
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's a very good description of polo

2050
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Croquet on horses

2051
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Why is it not more popular here?

2052
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It sounds kinda awesome

2053
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Now what would you call it like if you had like one of those fantasy

2054
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Games where it's actual

2055
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Horses playing croquet

2056
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Would that still be considered polo?

2057
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Because you know it's a horses playing

2058
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The game I think it would be considered a fucking miracle

2059
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It would be an anamorphic croquet

2060
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Anyhow

2061
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
On the Nintendo DS

2062
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Coming out in Japan on the 2nd of April

2063
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Disney fairies Tinkerbell comes out

2064
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000

01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000

2066
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yaku Famitsa DS

2067
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
2009 comes out from Bandai Namco

2068
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Which is yet another baseball game

2069
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Coming out from Namco with little

2070
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Chibi characters in it

2071
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
On the Playstation portable

2072
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Which is the last system we cover over there

2073
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
The Legend of Heroes

2074
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
A lot of them move into

2075
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Price reductions

2076
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And that's really it unless you want to get some new

2077
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Covers for your PS in black, silver

2078
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And white, that's really it

2079
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So I guess Tinker, yes

2080
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
As AlphaCananagram in chat says fuck yes

2081
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Tinkerbell definitely seems to be

2082
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
One of the highlights on the Japanese release calendar

2083
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
This week, things look a little better next week though

2084
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It's a slow week

2085
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Is it? Yes

2086
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
How about going in another direction?

2087
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
How about it? For our friends in the UK

2088
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000

Freaky hair

2094
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000

Well this one doesn't have a date on it

2101
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It might have already come out

2102

Alright

2111
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Well in the US

2112
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
There's not a whole lot coming out this week

2113
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
In fact a lot of it's crap

2114
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But that's okay

2115
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Because where there's crap

2116
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
There's crap I guess

2117
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
There is no positive there

2118
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
The flowers grow? Yeah the flowers grow

2127
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You haven't heard of Jumping the Shark yet

2128
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000

Marla goes to Michael's?

2134
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000

01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
There you go

2141
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Don't worry Marla will fix it

2142

We've got Don King Boxing coming out on the Wii

01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You may remember that as Don King's Prize Fighter

2145
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
They just changed the name so you forget how bad it was

2146
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Ski-Doo

2147
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000

beat-em-up fighting game

2153
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
or fighting action game

2154

Coming from Atlas for the DS

2155
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
which is pretty cool

2156
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Our music fans will love this

2157
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Major Miners Majestic March coming out on the Wii

2158
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You may remember the creators of Parappa the Rapper

2159
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
created this

2160
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000

01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Bobby you listening?

2163
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's a marching band game

2164
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I was in marching band

2165
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Me too but Bobby still does it

2166
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I know he plays drums

2167
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and shows

2168
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
musicals

2169
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that come through his town

2170
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I could swear

2171
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and he's gonna pop and chat any minute I'm sure

2172
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I could swear he talked about Drum Corps

2173
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
he still does stuff now and again with that

2174
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and that's kind of marching band

2175
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Leisure Suit

2176
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The Bus coming out on the Xbox 360 and PC

2177
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
No nudity in that game

2178
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
so I have no interest in it whatsoever

2179
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Dawn King Boxing

2180
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000

01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and then

2187
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Vomit

2188
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
like crap

2189
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Ok this is kind of

2190
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
well another Dance Dance Revolution game

2191
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Disney Grooves now for the Wii

2192
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Hoz Party 2 with

2193
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Disney characters now

2194
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
this isn't a game but I thought I'd mention it because it's pretty cool

2195
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Mad Catz has a new charging

2196
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
dock coming out that charges

2197
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
two controllers but what makes it special

2198
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
though is it's the Rayman Rabbids

2199
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
charging dock so there's a Rabbid

2200
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
sitting there yelling at you

2201
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
unfortunately it doesn't make noise because that would be awesome

2202
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
and then

2203
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
one last game coming out a week from today

2204
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Rhythm Heaven and of course

2205
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
a tie along with that

2206
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Nintendo DSi coming out in black and blue

2207
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
so

2208
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
well that's why this is a slow

2209
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
week because you have those two bombshells coming out

2210
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
yes the DSi

2211
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
is going to be pretty big

2212
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and then

2213
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
that's pretty much it for right now

2214
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
wow

2215
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
now of course us talking about the Mama games

2216
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
you spawned everybody in chat

2217
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
talking about Mama in games

2218
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
this is definitely my favorite Mama game

2219
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I mean we had 2DX Mama

2220
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
we have Pop'n Music 18

2221
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Mama, Mama in Space

2222
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Neon Mama in Evangelion

2223
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
my favorite though

2224
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
from GS68 this is definitely my favorite Mama title

2225
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Mama vs. Capcom

2226
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
that's pretty

2227
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
scary

2228
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I was going to mention there is one more thing

2229
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
this will make Jamie happy coming out

2230
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
it's not a

2231
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
game you can buy in the stores

2232
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
online on Xbox Live Arcade

2233
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
this week Outrun

2234
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
yay

2235
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
yes new Outrun game is going to be coming out

2236
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that's not old school Outrun getting upgraded

2237
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Outrun online arcade

2238
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
but now see

2239
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
that could be yay or that could be OMG Suck

2240
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
if Yuji Naka is involved

2241
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
it'll be good

2242
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
the screenshots I've seen of it look pretty awesome

2243
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and they do some

2244
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
neat camera stuff where

2245
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
when you're drifting around some of the bends

2246
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
it actually looks really cool

2247
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
and Cell Factor Psychokinetic Wars

2248
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I could use a fun silly little

2249
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
racing game that's not too serious

2250
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
like a lot of the Xbox 360 racing games are too serious

2251
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
for me I could use a fun silly little one

2252
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
there's a bunch of stuff that's listed on here

2253
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
that's supposedly coming out this week I'm not sure if all this is

2254
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Banjo-Tooie they're saying

2255
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't know that sounds kind of weird

2256
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I know one of these titles that's on this Kotaku

2257
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
list is not correct Duke Nukem Trilogy

2258
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
that's not coming out until September

2259
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
it's funny it's coming out April 1st

2260
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
you're the fool

2261
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
because it's not coming out yet

2262
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
what a Duke Nukem title delayed?

2263
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
never

2264
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
sorry that's alright

2265
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
alright so we got

2266
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
one more story for you guys then we're going to get to our classic

2267
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
game of the week and this has to do with

2268
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Left 4 Dead which a lot of people

2269
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I know in our Steam community are still playing Left 4 Dead

2270
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
this is a game I need to spend more quality time

2271
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
with I played it for like a little bit and I found out

2272
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I suck at first person shooters really bad

2273
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
but I need to go try to get a little better

2274
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
however there is a new

2275
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
download content pack coming out for

2276
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Left 4 Dead and it's coming out on April

2277
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
21st for Xbox 360 gamers

2278
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and it's going to have a new

2279
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
survival mode and

2280
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
just wave after wave of zombies

2281
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and versus campaign support

2282
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
with two more maps Dead Air and

2283
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Death Toll

2284
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
by the way it's free so check that out

2285
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
we like free things

2286
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
right? free is awesome

2287
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
except Yaris

2288
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
okay we're just about to the

2289
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
end of the show but of course no show

2290
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
here at Orange Laundry will be complete

2291
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
without the classic game of the week

2292
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
actually we're only like half way done I don't want you to think

2293
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
we're like actually done but we like to end part A

2294
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
with the classic video game of the week

2295
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Dark Sakura goes through her dusty archives

2296
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of games and finds a game or two

2297
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
maybe that she thinks you ought to be playing

2298
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
and so Dark Sakura

2299
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
what is your classic

2300
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
game of the week?

2301
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
my classic game of the week is Twinbee

2302
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
which

2303
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
of course we saw

2304
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
a while back what

2305
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
it's labeled as Rainbow Bell

2306
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I always remembered it as Twinbee so

2307
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
whatever

2308
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
is that familiar?

2309
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
anybody that's played

2310
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
the Bimani games long enough have heard some

2311
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
form of the Twinbee theme in the game

2312
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
this is the thing that annoys

2313
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
me about Twinbee

2314
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
is that every time you get a damn power up

2315
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
it plays that little noise

2316
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and starts moving it over

2317
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
but anyway Twinbee is a game where you

2318
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
play as a little ship with arms

2319
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
and you shoot

2320
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
bells for your power ups and you change the color

2321
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
of your bell

2322
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
actually they pop out of the clouds and you shoot the clouds

2323
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and the bells will change color and you'll get a different

2324
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
power up

2325
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
but you just have to keep shooting it until

2326
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
you

2327
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
until you

2328
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
get the one that you want but if you keep shooting it

2329
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
it'll change into a symbol that will kill you

2330
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
so

2331
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
you can play as

2332
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
you've got two characters in here you can play as

2333
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and it came out

2334
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
for the Famicom

2335
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and it came out actually in the cartridge and disk format

2336
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the MSX

2337
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
it came out, it was of course arcade

2338
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and

2339
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
then we also saw Twinbee

2340
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
portable for the Sony PSP

2341
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and the Konami Classic series

2342
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
arcade hits for the Nintendo DS

2343
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
now

2344
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I bring up Twinbee because Twinbee

2345
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
leads to

2346
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
actually

2347
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
the one that I like better than this

2348
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
can I say this though in chat real quick we have somebody saying

2349
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
isn't this Stinger?

2350
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
yes you got to do Stinger

2351
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
so in the US it was called Stinger

2352
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
yeah in the US it was Stinger

2353
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
but now let's

2354
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
move forward

2355
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
sure let me queue up the other game here

2356
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
tell them a little bit about this

2357
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
now this is the one that I like better and one that my husband

2358
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and I played the crap out of last night

2359
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
is Detana Twinbee

2360
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
which

2361
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
is

2362
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
they actually came out in Europe

2363
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
as bells and whistles

2364
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
so anyway

2365
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
this is the sequel to the original Twinbee

2366
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
but the arcade

2367
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and Famicom versions and it plays

2368
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
pretty much the same but it has

2369
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
much much better graphics

2370
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
and music in Project MC

2371
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
yeah I've never seen

2372
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
this game before this is pretty sweet

2373
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
for an old school like 16 bit

2374
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
era game this is pretty sweet

2375
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
it also had little cut scenes that were in between

2376
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
levels where you could see different

2377
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
characters hanging around

2378
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
actually one person plays as Twinbee

2379
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
the other one plays as Winbee

2380
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and you can also get

2381
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
a ghost

2382
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
pilot which was

2383
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
oh god

2384
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
now I can't remember what it was called

2385
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
it's definitely not in the article I'm looking at

2386
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
but the green one

2387
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
no I never played this game enough

2388
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
oh but anyway you can also get

2389
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
like a sort of ghost pilot that will hang out with you

2390
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
um

2391
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and uh

2392
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
it brings in the pilots of Twinbee and Winbee

2393
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
which is Light and Pastel

2394
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
um

2395
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
also it's um you can actually get this game

2396
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
in the Twinbee deluxe pack

2397
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
for Playstation and Saturn

2398
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
could be portable for Playstation portable

2399
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
PSP sorry um

2400
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
the version that I linked here is the PC

2401
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Engine version um

2402
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
it also came out on the

2403
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
X68000

2404
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and um

2405
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
it's actually um out

2406
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
um on Virtual Console

2407
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
now so you can get it too

2408
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
um

2409
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
another thing that was cool about this one

2410
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
is that it actually led to um

2411
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
a Twinbee

2412
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
OVO

2413
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
that was actually kind of cool

2414
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
but yeah this

2415
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
whenever I think of Twinbee this is the game I actually think of

2416
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
because it was so much fun

2417
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
like some of the power ups you can get are so cool

2418
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
like you've got a shadow

2419
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I think the shadow is if you hit

2420
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
no red is you get a barrier

2421
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
um purple is the um

2422
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
the multiple

2423
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
image following after you

2424
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and then you can get like you know

2425
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
different directional shots you can extend your shot

2426
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
you can get all kinds of different

2427
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
you can actually get shadows

2428
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that follow you behind too

2429
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
um you also have a charge move where you can shoot

2430
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
out like a big stream of fire

2431
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
and if you use your bomb button you can target

2432
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
things that are on the ground

2433
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and shoot um

2434
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
things that are on

2435
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
the ground

2436
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
like that with bombs

2437
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
um but this is

2438
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to me this is probably

2439
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
one of the pinnacle of

2440
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
um shooting games

2441
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
really is

2442
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and it's cute

2443
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and it's super cute

2444
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
but don't don't don't

2445
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
you know think differently because it's cute

2446
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
it gets hard

2447
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
you get flying like

2448
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
looks can be deceiving

2449
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
where I died is when all these freaking chickens appear in air

2450
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
and run at you

2451
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
you know I think I died in Zelda that way once

2452
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
seriously it's like oh flying around

2453
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
chickens run

2454
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
dead die

2455
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
yeah

2456
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and of course it's got beautiful voices too

2457
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and the music in it is freaking fantastic

2458
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
so it's Detina Twinbee

2459
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
alright there it is

2460
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Konami give us a new Twinbee

2461
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
there it is folks your classic game of the week

2462
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Twinbee, Stinger, Rainbow, Bell

2463
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
more importantly the game

2464
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
that inspired Detina Twinbee

2465
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
for the PC Engine

2466
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
there it is your classic game of the week

2467
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that's going to be a hard one for folks to find

2468
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
last week was easy you did what Secret of Mana

2469
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
two weeks ago because we weren't here last week

2470
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
you did Secret of Mana two weeks ago right?

2471
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
if you've got money

2472
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
or virtual console now

2473
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I was really referring to playing it on the sneeze

2474
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
alright well there you go

2475
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I will say

2476
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
you can get a PC Engine

2477
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
core graphics for not

2478
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
too much money if you know where to look

2479
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
which would be where are you going to share?

2480
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
was it

2481
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Pink Elephant I think

2482
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
was the company

2483
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
oh that was it

2484
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
oh the folks that were at PAX

2485
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
we got ours at Classic Gaming Expo

2486
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
a while back so I'll see if I can't find the name of it

2487
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and put it up on the forum

2488
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
oh my god you've got an SUV on a building

2489
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
anyway

2490
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
my

2491
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
that's awesome

2492
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
okay I'm being distracted by falling cars

2493
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
but also the HuCard for Twinbee

2494
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
actually shouldn't be that

2495
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
expensive if you

2496
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
have someone buy it for you in Japan

2497
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I don't really think the HuCard is that

2498
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
expensive at all I will tell you

2499
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
one thing if you're trying to play a HuCard on

2500
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
an American system none of the

2501
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
converters really work even if you've got that

2502
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
purple one it's freaking expensive

2503
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and it works half the time so don't even bother

2504
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
with it just get a PC Engine

2505
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
the end

2506
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
alright well we're going to take

2507
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
a break here and come back with more of Orange Lounge

2508
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Radio there's still plenty we have yet to discuss

2509
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
this week we haven't even gotten to some of the Playstation news

2510
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
that came out of E3 we're going to talk about a little bit

2511
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
of what is this cross eye

2512
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
she XE

2513
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
we're going to try and make some sense out of this

2514
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and what it's all about right after

2515
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
a quick break so we'll be back in just a few minutes with

2516
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
more of Orange Lounge Radio unless you're on the podcast

01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
we'll be right back

2519
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Music

2520
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Music

2521
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Music

2522
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this

2523
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Sunday evening March the 29th of 2009

2524
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
where we're taping live

2525
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
on All Games Radio www.allgames.com

2526
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
bringing you

2527
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
more of the latest and greatest in video

2528
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

2529
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
we also do a little

2530
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
simulcast on

2531
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Justin TV where tonight

2532
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
you're not looking at our ugly mugs doing the show

2533
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
we thought maybe there'd be something a little more exciting

2534
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
if we have a video well A I actually

2535
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
lost the camera but I think this is actually working out

2536
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
where Loki's actually playing a game during the show and

2537
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
tonight he's playing Grand Theft Auto 4 but he's playing a special

2538
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
version that he

2539
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
hacked the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto

2540
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and it has super uber physics in it

2541
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
yeah it has if you're

2542
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
a fan of the PC version it has the

2543
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Super Comet which I added those

2544
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
physics to the bus and to the ambulance

2545
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and then I modified

2546
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
the

2547
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Mac I think it's the

2548
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Mac 11 in there to have a

2549
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
pretty fast

2550
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
fire rate and

2551
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
almost a thousand rounds

2552
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
in a clip and then

2553
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
my punching has

2554
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
a physics force of

2555
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
60,000 so I can punch cars

2556
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
into space basically

2557
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
so

2558
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
so you're gonna continue

2559
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
to kind of play that throughout the show

2560
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
but you gotta start you gotta pause it and do some news

2561
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
cause we wanna talk about some Sony news

2562
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
here real quick yes

2563
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
so there's this alternate

2564
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
reality game that's going on in

2565
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
home right now thanks

2566
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
to Sony the game

2567
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
is called well it's

2568
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
xi or she or

2569
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
as I'm calling it cross eyed

2570
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I don't know the symbol itself doesn't look like xi

2571
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
so I don't know where they're getting that from it kind of

2572
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
looks like an hourglass or something

2573
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
but whatever

2574
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
but anyways they have a

2575
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
trailer that was released I guess and

2576
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I haven't really gotten a chance to

2577
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
do any of this

2578
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
but apparently they have like a weekly

2579
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
recap and there's some sort of

2580
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
like clues you need to find and

2581
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
kind of a ticker and stuff so

2582
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
um

2583
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
so you said it's the Greek symbol?

2584
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
it's the Greek symbol so it's xi

2585
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Greek symbol really?

2586
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
yes

2587
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
what if this has to do with anything that's probably gonna tie in

2588
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
with an announcement for God of War 3

2589
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
or at least a release date or something like that

2590
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I wonder I wonder I wonder

2591
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
ooh you're smart

2592
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
but really no

2593
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and it's the summer right now

2594
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
so July

2595
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
anyways so I don't know what exactly

2596
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
this is gonna be unveiling

2597
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I'm sure it's gonna

2598
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
waste enough time to

2599
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
E3 and maybe it'll make some sort of announcement

2600
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
that ties in with everything

2601
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
but hey who doesn't like a good

2602
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
ARG I mean you know

2603
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I heart bees or I love bees or something like that

2604
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
yeah

2605
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
so cool if you want to check it out just

2606
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
go in the home

2607
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I should sue for copyright because that's how people mispronounce

2608
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
my name all the time is xi

2609
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
it's xi

2610
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
like KSI

2611
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
xer xi

2612
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
no I just no I think low key

2613
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
at the nail on the head though if it's for anything

2614
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it is probably some type of underground

2615
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
campaign for God of War 3

2616
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
yeah sounds like

2617
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
but it's interesting though don't you think it's interesting that they're actually kind of

2618
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
doing new shit with home?

2619
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I mean that's what's kind of nice about it

2620
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it's nice that they're actually doing shit with home

2621
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
although they still don't have like

2622
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
what the trophy rooms and stuff that they had promised

2623
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
in the beginning I mean whatever happened to that

2624
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
maybe someday I don't know

2625
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
or better functionality with the groups

2626
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
that whole thing

2627
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
yeah who knows

2628
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
alright well anyhow let's talk about some other news at a Game Developers Conference

2629
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
you know we talked about OnLive

2630
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
which is a new console of sorts

2631
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
not really a console but this is a console

2632
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
now there's something else here

2633
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Tektoy is putting out a new console

2634
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
the Zeebo

2635
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and it's going to do just downloadable games

2636
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
which might make you think about the Phantom and all that stuff

2637
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I don't know

2638
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
but the Zeebo here's the catch

2639
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
it's coming out in Brazil this July

2640
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
so it's not something that's necessarily being targeted here

2641
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
at markets over here in North America

2642
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
it's coming out first in Brazil

2643
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
and then I guess some other markets maybe in South America

2644
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
or other places

2645
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
what's interesting

2646
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Quake, Evil Prey and Action Hero 3D

2647
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
are some of the titles that are supposed to be already on the console

2648
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
by the time you get it

2649
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
it's not something that's supposed to compete with the Wii

2650
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
the 360 or the Playstation 3

2651
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
apparently what this console is going to do

2652
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
it actually connects to a large 3G network

2653
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
through a big cellular provider

2654
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and apparently

2655
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
it's not necessarily about being the most powerful system out there

2656
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
but it's supposed to be about

2657
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
getting stuff through download channels

2658
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
to help combat

2659
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
piracy that goes on

2660
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
but this is interesting

2661
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
EA Mobile, Capcom, Namco Networks

2662
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
PopCap Games, THQ, they're all on board

2663
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and it's going to cost about

2664
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
$7 to $13

2665
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
per game

2666
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I converted to American dollars there for you

2667
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
the console itself, $264 American

2668
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
though

2669
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
the question though, I mean

2670
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I'm not really familiar with mobile games too much

2671
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
is there really that much piracy of mobile games?

2672
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I mean

2673
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I would think that they're not losing that much money on that stuff

2674
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
that's just my thought

2675
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
YYR in chat

2676
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
has a funny thought about the trophy room

2677
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that you'll have to buy the trophy room for 99 cents

2678
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and then you'll have to buy the bookshelf

2679
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and the trophy room for 49 cents each

2680
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
because they can each only hold 3 trophies

2681
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I thought he was being serious at first

2682
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
but no, I don't think that's real

2683
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
anyhow, so yeah

2684
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
there is a new console coming out just not in the part of the world

2685
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
where most of you are from

2686
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
but I do know we have some international listeners

2687
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
so maybe this is something some of our international listeners

2688
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
might get their hands on

2689
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and see if it's worth it or not

2690
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
although probably the folks listening to this program

2691
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
are already importing the more expensive stuff

2692
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
$260 whatever dollars

2693
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
American, I think $599 brazilian

2694
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
for that system

2695
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
is a bargain compared to what you would pay

2696
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
for a lot of the consoles imported down there

2697
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
so something to think about

2698
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
yeah

2699
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
well, there's actually

2700
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
some news on the more

2701
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
conventional system

2702
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I guess front

2703
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
there is a

2704
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Katamari Damacy

2705
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
tribute coming to

2706
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Playstation 3

2707
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
the original one

2708
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
is

2709
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
well, the

2710
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
original version I guess is supposed to be in

2711
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Katamari Damacy tribute

2712
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
where it will be presented in

2713
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
1080p

2714
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and have a new visual presentation

2715
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
that's a quote

2716
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
it's going to have

2717
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
remixes

2718
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
from the previous titles

2719
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
as far as the music is concerned

2720
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
and it's

2721
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm guessing it's a big

2722
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Katamari mashup

2723
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
yeah, I think it's a bunch of the levels from the other games

2724
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
wish there was some new stuff

2725
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
it's still going to be fun

2726
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
oh yeah

2727
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I'll have to pick it up

2728
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
weird six axis stuff

2729
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
no, they got rid of the six axis

2730
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
no, I'm actually kind of surprised

2731
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
that they're doing it as a download title too

2732
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
because you would think something like that would definitely be able to sell at retail

2733
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
six axis is still there

2734
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
flower is run completely on six axis

2735
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it's actually fairly effective

2736
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I hate the six axis though

2737
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
for some games it's okay

2738
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
like flower, I think is a great game

2739
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
it's not something you're going to invest a lot of time in

2740
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
but for what it is, it's great

2741
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
sorry bogey

2742
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
so, I mean that would be pretty cool

2743
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I mean

2744
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I just don't understand

2745
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I would think they'd make more money at retail

2746
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if they brought it out

2747
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
but maybe they just want less

2748
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
you know

2749
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
packaging or something, I don't know

2750
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
whatever

2751
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
something else that's coming the way of the PS3

2752
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
and we were talking about home a little bit earlier

2753
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
they're going to get some new spaces actually

2754
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
including

2755
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
a Guitar Hero themed space

2756
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
called backstage with Guitar Hero

2757
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and of course

2758
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
they're going to have

2759
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
you know, all the House of Blues

2760
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
kind of stuff, I guess one of the levels from the game

2761
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
there's also a VIP space

2762
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
in the back, which is sealed off

2763
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
by a velvet rope

2764
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I'm not sure who they're going to have back there

2765
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and

2766
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
you know, other than that

2767
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
there's going to be

2768
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I guess maybe a

2769
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
mini game or something like that

2770
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Rock God, which is kind of like Simon

2771
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
like matching the cord type thing

2772
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and then some other

2773
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
possible games may be in there

2774
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I don't know about you

2775
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
but I think most of these spaces

2776
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
that they have in home are kind of useless

2777
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
you go there once and you're like, oh that's kind of neat

2778
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and that's about it

2779
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
at least you went there

2780
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
it's a free commercial for the game, right?

2781
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
yeah, but I mean it's not anything real cool

2782
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
like you can't say play

2783
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
the PlayStation 3 version or something like that

2784
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and your characters appear on stage

2785
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
performing the song

2786
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
or anything like that

2787
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
wasn't there this whole thing though that you were going to be able to launch

2788
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
PlayStation games from within home

2789
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
well I guess you still can kind of do that

2790
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
but I don't know, you just don't see a lot of people actually doing that

2791
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
compared to, I don't know, Xbox 360

2792
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
just kind of seems to make it all easy

2793
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
it's just like home is like a big

2794
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
non-necessity I guess

2795
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I mean it's cool

2796
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
it has a lot of potential

2797
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
but they're not really using it

2798
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
yeah

2799
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I don't know, but again anything they do

2800
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
is going to be better than the ASL stuff that's going on right now

2801
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
you know what I mean?

2802
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
any cute girls want to chat, that's pretty much all you ever see

2803
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
in a home, so any of this extra kind of stuff

2804
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
might be kind of neat, I don't know

2805
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
it would be nice if they would have like different types of spaces

2806
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
within home, like you could go to

2807
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
one server for social chat

2808
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
one server for like gamer chat

2809
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
but then again we all know nobody would stay in the zone

2810
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
they're supposed to, so why am I bothering?

2811
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
well PlayStation Home is just going to keep growing

2812
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
you guys, you know there's not only, there's the Red Bull

2813
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
area, there's the Resident Evil 5 area

2814
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Warhawk, now Guitar Hero, guess what

2815
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
apparently according to Jack Bueser

2816
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
who is the director of PlayStation Home

2817
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
if you think about a game developers conference this week

2818
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
you will see about quote, three new spaces

2819
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
launched a month

2820
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
that does make sense

2821
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
though when you consider there's like over 20 companies

2822
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
that are signed up right now that are supposedly going to be

2823
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
making new content for Home

2824
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
so there you go, apparently Home actually has

2825
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
5 million users already worldwide

2826
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
about half of those being in North America

2827
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
so they say

2828
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
that a good space gets

2829
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
about 250,000 visits

2830
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
every week, and 75%

2831
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
of the users will spend more than

2832
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
10 minutes on the space, and like I said

2833
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
before, you know, despite the quality

2834
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
the fact is, you go into these spaces

2835
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
and it's like a giant advertisement for the game

2836
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
which you might be more likely to buy

2837
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
is that 10 minutes part of the downloading the space

2838
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
or the waiting for the lag, you know

2839
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
might not take that long, watching the

2840
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
loops of Twilight over and over

2841
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
yeah

2842
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
um, yeah

2843
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I don't know, well they show

2844
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
new movies on there now, don't they?

2845
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I saw Mall Cop in there for like 2 weeks

2846
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
something

2847
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
alright, well anyhow

2848
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
well, you know what's better than everything in the universe?

2849
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
uh, cake

2850
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
zombies!

2851
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
zombies with cake?

2852
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
ooh, that would be fantastic

2853
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
zombie cake party?

2854
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I love loathing zombies

2855
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
um, there is a newcomer

2856
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
to the Playstation store

2857
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
that's called Burn Zombie Burn

2858
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
um, that's gonna be

2859
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
on PS3, there's also

2860
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
to go along with that, um

2861
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
is downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet

2862
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Pain, Resistance 2

2863
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Endwar, Call of Duty 5

2864
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and a PS1 copy of Magic Carpet

2865
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
oh my god

2866
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I remember that game

2867
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
well, Burn Zombie Burn

2868
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
is by Double Six

2869
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
it's going for

2870
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
£6.29

2871
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
in Euros at

2872
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
£7.99

2873
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
um, you have to

2874
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
just hold off zombies

2875
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
for as long as you can

2876
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
and the longer you hold them out

2877
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the higher score you get

2878
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
where have I heard of this before? Left 4 Dead?

2879
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
the longer you hold off the zombies

2880
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
the more content you unlock

2881
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
based on your score

2882
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
um, for Resistance 2 there's the Aftermath

2883
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Map Pack

2884
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and um, Call of Duty

2885
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
World at War will get Map Pack 1

2886
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and um

2887
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
they actually

2888
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
have to pay more than we did on

2889
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Xbox, but I think it's supposed to be

2890
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
much more touched up

2891
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
um, there's the Pain Smack Pack

2892
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
the El Chilli Grande

2893
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
um, character

2894
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
um, I guess for that

2895
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
LittleBigPlanet is getting a Buzz

2896
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
costume

2897
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Endwar and Unreal Tournament 3

2898
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
get the Veteran Map Pack

2899
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
and Titan Pack respectively

2900
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
those are free

2901
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
that's kind of neat that they have

2902
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
some Resistance stuff

2903
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I just have to actually play through that still

2904
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
well another thing for the PSP is

2905
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Buzz Brain of the UK

2906
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
hmm

2907
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
so

2908
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
but that's for UK only

2909
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I think

2910
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
well something we're getting over here

2911
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
at least on the Xbox 360

2912
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I think it's in

2913
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
where the regions have the

2914
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Xbox community games

2915
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
and you knew that at some point

2916
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
somebody was going to do something like this

2917
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
well now there's a

2918
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
um, a sex-rated

2919
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
uh, Xbox

2920
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
community game, sex-rated I guess

2921
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
because it's slightly censored but it's still

2922
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
kind of got the naughty stuff in there

2923
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
it's a game

2924
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
called Break One Out

2925
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and it's basically a Breakout clone

2926
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
or um

2927
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
but what's unique about it though

2928
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
is there's this chick

2929
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Kitty who looks like a cosplayer

2930
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and there's revealing

2931
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
photos of her

2932
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
except, you know, where all the naughty bits are covered with black bars

2933
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
but she is naked in the pictures

2934
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
so basically you

2935
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
play the game and you unlock naked

2936
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
pictures of this one chick who

2937
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I don't know, she's alright

2938
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
she's not hot

2939
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
but you know

2940
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
as hot as I guess a cosplayer

2941
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
at your average anime convention

2942
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
could be

2943
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I guess somebody made this game

2944
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
just for the sake of making the first

2945
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
controversial titty

2946
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
filled community game, correct?

2947
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Probably

2948
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
so

2949
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
but, you know, hey

2950
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
that's uh, it's out there

2951
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and I think it's cheap, I'm not sure if it's like

2952
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
two bucks or something but

2953
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
you know, it doesn't look very good

2954
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
but hey, if you want to see the naked pictures of her

2955
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I mean, or

2956
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
as naked as she's going to get

2957
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
don't play the game, you can actually watch the video

2958
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I have a video online for it

2959
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
but uh

2960
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I don't know, it's just like

2961
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
if you want to knock some balls around while you look at the picture

2962
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
you know, you can play the game

2963
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
or you can watch the video and knock

2964
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
some balls around

2965
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
anyhow

2966
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
YYR is saying that it was

2967
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
only up for a day or less, do you think this thing was already

2968
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
taken down? I wouldn't be surprised

2969
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
it's alright, it was crap

2970
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I kind of wish I had downloaded it

2971
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
just to have it, but

2972
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
oh well

2973
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Microsoft

2974
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
is in a little bit of hot water this week over something

2975
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
you've probably seen floating around the game

2976
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
blogs this week, and this has to do with

2977
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Lionhead Studios, who is of course

2978
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
a subsidiary of Microsoft, they're the folks

2979
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
behind Fable

2980
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and here's the interesting

2981
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
part of this story

2982
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
it has to do with a gay video game designer

2983
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
and his name is Jamie Durant

2984
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
he's going to be suing Microsoft for

2985
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
45,000 pounds

2986
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
due to hurt feelings, lost pay

2987
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
discrimination, all due to his sexual

2988
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
orientation, and this apparently

2989
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
happened after Microsoft bought Lionhead

2990
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
he's worked for this company for 11 years

2991
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
apparently, and he says

2992
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
things began to get a little bit uneasy around there

2993
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and starting around January

2994
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
of the last year, he started getting abusive

2995
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
emails, with subjects reading like

2996
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
me and my favorite men

2997
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I'm Jim and I'm gay, and he was

2998
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
given the nickname, Fag Boy Jim

2999
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
he's

3000
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
apparently complained to the human resources department

3001
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
but nothing happened except

3002
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
a promise and a memo that was

3003
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
supposed to go around to the company about

3004
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
diversity in the workplace and all these types

3005
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
of things that companies usually do when they're

3006
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
panicked that a lawsuit might happen

3007
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and that the firm was supposed to update the policies

3008
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
none of this ever happened according to the lawsuit

3009
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
and Durant also claims

3010
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
that he was the one who was offered counseling

3011
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
which he said to that, they're making

3012
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
out that I'm the one with the problem

3013
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
apparently he has been out of work

3014
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
suffering from depression for seven months

3015
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
and he's now seeking damages due to this

3016
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
but

3017
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I don't know, here's the weird

3018
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
thing, and the thing that's kind of weird about

3019
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
this is that Microsoft has kind of

3020
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
gotten praise from the

3021
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
human rights campaign foundation for

3022
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
the way they treat their gay and lesbian

3023
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
and bisexual workers before, so

3024
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
is this a problem with

3025
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
one particular office?

3026
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Is this a problem with

3027
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Lionhead? Is this a problem

3028
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
with the employee?

3029
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
There's two sides to every story, right?

3030
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Is there something else going on here?

3031
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I don't know, it's

3032
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
hard to say, we're only kind of hearing one side

3033
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
of it. They'd have to do a really

3034
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
thorough investigation to get any kind of

3035
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
actual

3036
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
point out of that.

3037
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
The part of it that's interesting is the part

3038
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
that he's already been out of work for seven months

3039
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and if it's due to this

3040
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
it's gotta be really bad. It's gotta be

3041
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
really, really bad. But

3042
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I mean, and again, I don't know this guy,

3043
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I'm not gonna slander this guy, I don't know anything that's

3044
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
going on here, but before, you know, and I think

3045
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
a lot of people might read this and go, oh Rob's

3046
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
gonna be pissed on the show because he's gay too,

3047
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
he's gonna throw a fit over this. Not necessarily

3048
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
because I also know

3049
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
people that sometimes

3050
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
like to be the victim. Oh yeah.

3051
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
You know what I mean? And when I hear this

3052
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
whole fact about he's been out of work for a long time

3053
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I start to go, you know, there could be

3054
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
another side to this coin. I don't know.

3055
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't know the facts. I'm not him.

3056
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But I do know that there could be more

3057
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
to this than meets the eye.

3058
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I would just hope to hell. Maybe

3059
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I'm just hopeful and maybe foolishly

3060
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
so. I just, I'm hopeful to hell

3061
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that in this fucking year 2009

3062
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
we would just get past

3063
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
this stupid school

3064
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
playground bullshit.

3065
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I know. Sadly we haven't.

3066
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Not completely. Maybe I'm just

3067
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
spoiled because I happen to work in a place

3068
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
where this shit doesn't happen.

3069
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And I'm fairly confident

3070
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and almost 100% confident this kind of shit

3071
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
would not happen.

3072
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So when I read these stories I'm just like

3073
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
really? Really?

3074
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Fagboy? In an email?

3075
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Really? Someone's that dumb

3076
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
to do something like that that can be

3077
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
traced? Really?

3078
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I don't get it.

3079
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And Goldanthro in chat

3080
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
says not pissed, eh Rob?

3081
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I don't know. Like if this story is true

3082
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
fuck yeah I'm pissed. This is

3083
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
inexcusable. This is stupid.

3084
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
But

3085
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
you know there's two sides to every story.

3086
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Just because the guy filed the lawsuit

3087
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
doesn't necessarily mean it's 100%

3088
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
true. I think that's one thing we have to remember.

3089
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Right? So I don't want to lose my shit

3090
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
and start saying oh we should boycott

3091
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Lionhead and we should boycott all these games.

3092
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I don't know. Now if

3093
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
it comes out through due process

3094
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
and in the court of law that yeah

3095
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Lionhead did do something wrong

3096
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
then I will lose my shit and prepare to say

3097
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
some choice things about the company.

3098
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
But at this stage it's a little early to tell, correct?

3099
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I agree.

3100
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Regardless, very disappointing

3101
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
that this lawsuit is filed one way or

3102
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
the other. So

3103
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
of course you knew after a story like

3104
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:34,000
this could only come a segment of ours we love.

3105
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Really my F.U. of the week

3106
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
is just

3107
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
people who

3108
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
don't want to look at the facts

3109
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and want to use their own version.

3110
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It really, okay.

3111
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Only a few people will really get

3112
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
the root of this but it goes towards

3113
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
something that I

3114
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
have noticed that applies to politics,

3115
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
religion, and fandom.

3116
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Don't

3117
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
twist things

3118
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
into your version

3119
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
of what they should be just to justify

3120
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
what you, you know, believe.

3121
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
At least admit fact.

3122
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
If it's what you believe

3123
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
then that's what you believe but at least

3124
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
accept reality.

3125
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
That's all.

3126
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And also to

3127
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
being super exhausted

3128
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
all day yesterday and being sick from it.

3129
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Then.

3130
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I personally

3131
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
do not really have many F.U.s of the week.

3132
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Things have been going fine so I'll keep an F.U. to my incessant

3133
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
napping habit. I nap a lot

3134
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
and it's like screwing up my sleep schedule

3135
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
royally. So I need to stop

3136
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
that. An F.U. to lack of motivation

3137
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
into my exercise program as well.

3138
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I need to get back on that.

3139
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Um, F.U. to allergies because my nose

3140
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
has been all stuffed up the last few days.

3141
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
It's all windy over here.

3142
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
That's it.

3143
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Alright.

3144
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.

3145
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Let's get back to some gaming news.

3146
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Dark Sakura, speaking of Lionhead

3147
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Studios.

3148
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Well.

3149
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I

3150
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
am happy because I am

3151
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
still sort of playing this game when I can.

3152
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
But there is actually supposed

3153
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
to be new downloadable content

3154
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
available for Fable 2.

3155
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And that is exciting.

3156
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
They're still paying attention to us.

3157
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
People who are still playing it.

3158
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
It's supposed to be

3159
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
coming out in

3160
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
the spring. So I'm supposing early

3161
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
spring.

3162
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
But there's

3163
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
nothing, I think not a whole

3164
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
lot that I'm seeing about what exactly

3165
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
it is. They're just revealing

3166
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
they're going to be revealing information

3167
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
on it.

3168
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
But they say that it's supposed

3169
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
to answer questions if you've been

3170
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
a fan of the whole series.

3171
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And apparently

3172
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
it's supposed to be really dramatic. So I don't

3173
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
know.

3174
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
But there actually

3175
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
though has been a statement by

3176
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Jonathan Ross

3177
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
that he was offered a voice role

3178
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
in Fable 3.

3179
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
So maybe there's

3180
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
a connection there?

3181
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Maybe there's something leading up into the next

3182
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
game.

3183
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Great. Fable 3.

3184
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Well I don't think that's going to be any surprise.

3185
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It would be exactly the same as Fable 1 and 2.

3186
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Well 2 had a lot of differences

3187
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
from 1 I thought. I thought they were very different.

3188
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Jonathan Ross

3189
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
is pretty cool.

3190
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I don't know.

3191
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
That's what I say about

3192
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
that.

3193
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Well something not Fable

3194
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
related. But kind of cool.

3195
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I mean this is one of the first games I've played

3196
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
on my old

3197
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
386 computer. This was the first

3198
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
first person shooter

3199
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
game I've seen.

3200
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Was it

3201
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Wolfenstein 3D

3202
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
being released on

3203
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
the iPhone?

3204
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
How cool is that?

3205
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And

3206
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
possibly

3207
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
soon enough, Doom will be

3208
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
released as well.

3209
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But hey, Wolfenstein 3D

3210
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
man, that takes me back. One of the first games I

3211
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
actually edited levels for using their

3212
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I don't know if they released the level editor

3213
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
or if it was one someone else made.

3214
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
But pretty awesome.

3215
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And you can actually play it now on the iPhone.

3216
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
And

3217
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
damn I can imagine that would probably run

3218
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
pretty well since the game is ancient.

3219
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
But

3220
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
pretty cool.

3221
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
You can speculate what they're saying in German.

3222
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Yeah.

3223
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And I guess it's free.

3224
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I'm not sure if this is like a free version of the game

3225
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
or if they're going to do like a

3226
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
you know

3227
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Oh it is free. I guess it's actually

3228
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
part of an open source project.

3229
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So check it out. Free.

3230
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Hey, that's the best price ever.

3231
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
For free.

3232
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Well

3233
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
there's other games coming to the iPhone that aren't

3234
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
free but they're very very nostalgic

3235
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
nonetheless. Mega Man 2

3236
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
is out right

3237
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
now. It's not coming soon. It's already out

3238
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
on the iTunes app store.

3239
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
It's interesting though the way it controls

3240
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
because since the iPhone doesn't really have any

3241
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
controls on it which you would think

3242
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
they're going to release something eventually.

3243
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
They can just plug into the bottom of the iPhone and

3244
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
voila instant gamepad. I don't know.

3245
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
But right now you use a little joystick

3246
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
that's on the bottom that is like kind of

3247
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
a touch and then two buttons. So it's like a virtual

3248
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
joystick using the touch screen.

3249
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
But yeah it's Mega Man 2.

3250
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
But I would think

3251
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
it's going to be difficult to control because of the

3252
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
fact it's kind of those weird buttons and touch

3253
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
but hey there's going to be some nostalgic

3254
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
freaking people that are very excited about this game anyway.

3255
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Do you think you could still

3256
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
beat the first boss in Wily's Castle without looking

3257
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Dark Soccer on the iPhone? Oh heck no.

3258
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I can't even do it anymore on the Nintendo.

3259
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Seriously I'm

3260
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
so out of practice on that game.

3261
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Yeah that would be tough.

3262
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Plus I'd be worried I'd get a phone call in the middle of it

3263
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
and then the whole thing is just screwed up.

3264
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
You know right as I'm starting to jump over a pit or something.

3265
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Seriously? Then besides that

3266
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I can just break out my Nintendo.

3267
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
TigerKlonChat wants to point out

3268
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Loki, those games you were talking about before are

3269
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
$4.99 in the App Store, not free. Maybe there's a free

3270
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
version or something. Well yeah that's what I was

3271
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
wondering. I was like free? But it said it was part of an

3272
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
open source project and it said it was released for free

3273
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
but I had my doubts.

3274
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Especially with Wolfenstein 3D. It wouldn't give

3275
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
us something like that away for free.

3276
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And of course our chatters are already talking about

3277
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
the Mega Man 2 thing

3278
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
on the iPhone and X-Link says

3279
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
do not buy Mega Man 2 it is hard to control.

3280
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
AcidicVampire says IGN gave

3281
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
the iPhone Mega Man 2 a 1 out of 10

3282
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and it's really awful to control. Not that I would

3283
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
believe everything that IGN says but in this

3284
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
case I would probably believe it.

3285
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
The game probably does stink. I can totally see how it would be hard to

3286
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
control. Especially given

3287
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
the way that it's set up.

3288
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Is there a lefty mode in it?

3289
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I saw the joystick thing.

3290
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I don't know. That's a good question.

3291
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
No.

3292
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It wouldn't work.

3293
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Yeah I don't think

3294
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
that game is going to be any fun to play on the iPhone

3295
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
at all but hey if you're that nostalgic and you

3296
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
need it in your pocket everywhere you go

3297
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
go for it.

3298
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Or just get like a Game Boy

3299
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
or something I don't know.

3300
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Emulate the bitch on the PSP.

3301
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Actually I'll tell you what Dan and I did

3302
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
whenever we won our Mega Man 2 fix.

3303
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
We actually ordered a handheld

3304
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Nintendo.

3305
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
That they make.

3306
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
And they're like 70 bucks.

3307
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
But we ordered one a while back. I'm waiting for it to arrive.

3308
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
They're supposed to be

3309
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
pretty cool.

3310
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Well how about something that's a little bit

3311
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
happier. How about

3312
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
some Guitar Hero

3313
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
World Tour information.

3314
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Actually very specifically how about

3315
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Queen

3316
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
on Guitar Hero World Tour.

3317
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
There's actually

3318
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
going to be a song pack that has

3319
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
celebrity fat bottom girls

3320
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
and we are the champions for

3321
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
440 points

3322
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
for the pack

3323
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
or you can buy each one for

3324
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
160.

3325
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
And they're going to be 549 on

3326
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
PlayStation Network.

3327
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You actually will be able

3328
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
to get them on Wii as well

3329
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
for 200 Wii points.

3330
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
And then there's

3331
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
supposed to be a

3332
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
new recording of the James Bond theme

3333
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
that's supposed to be available

3334
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
coming up soon.

3335
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I saw

3336
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
something on YouTube. I don't know if it was that

3337
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
exact one. I thought it was one that someone made

3338
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
how you can make your custom tracks

3339
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
or whatever.

3340
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And it was pretty awesome.

3341
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
So hopefully it's the same one.

3342
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
That was a pretty awesome version of the Bond theme.

3343
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Lots of liberties taken

3344
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
and it looked pretty hard.

3345
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Not

3346
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
quite as kick ass on

3347
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
the rock band.

3348
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
We get some interesting

3349
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
things. Including

3350
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Spongebob Squarepants music.

3351
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Who'd have thought we'd see that

3352
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
in a rock band.

3353
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
But apparently we are.

3354
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The Spongebob Squarepants pack

3355
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
is actually going to be

3356
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
relatively cheap. It's going to be

3357
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
99 cents per song or 80

3358
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Microsoft points.

3359
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Those include

3360
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I Can't Keep My Eyes Off You, Best

3361
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Day Ever, and Where's Gary.

3362
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
And then other than that

3363
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Journey is going to be

3364
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
getting a song on there with Don't Stop Believin'.

3365
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And

3366
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I guess also joining

3367
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
that would be Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker.

3368
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And that's

3369
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
coming as well.

3370
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And then some other stuff.

3371
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Glass Vegas with

3372
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Geraldine and Come On Come On by

3373
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Von Bondis.

3374
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Not Bondis.

3375
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And that's pretty

3376
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
much it for this week though.

3377
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Spongebob, that's weird.

3378
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Yeah, but Journey. Freakin' Journey's coming

3379
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
out. So who cares? That's amazing.

3380
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
They could have put a better song in there though.

3381
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
You know what, I actually agree. I think Don't Stop Believin'

3382
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
is way too cliche. And especially for a rock band.

3383
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
You should have put it by

3384
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Wheel in the Sky. Yeah, Wheel in the Sky

3385
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
would be awesome. But you know,

3386
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
whatever. I'll take what I can get. I mean,

3387
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
who isn't going to want to bust out with Don't Stop

3388
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Believin' at a party, right? I just see that one as being way too easy

3389
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
even on Expert. Yeah, probably.

3390
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Who knows. Anyhow,

3391
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
this is the part of the show where we like to open up the old

3392
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
mailbag and read some of your emails

3393
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
that you send to us every week at Mailbag at

3394
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. So let's get into it.

3395
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
First email comes from J-Rod.

3396
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Hey OLR crew, I'm emailing

3397
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
to try to get your stance on this guitar hero versus

3398
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
rock band war people are in.

3399
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I still don't see any differences between rock bands

3400
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
that download content and a guitar hero disc.

3401
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
It's both companies

3402
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
putting out new content to the player.

3403
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I don't even own guitar hero

3404
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
but I at least think it's a good idea to let

3405
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
people without an internet connection actually be able

3406
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
to play new songs. Look at rock band

3407
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
on the Wii. Would you seriously

3408
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
be happy owning that when

3409
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
you see what's on the other platforms?

3410
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Then people complain, well,

3411
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I only want three of the songs. I don't want to pay

3412
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
$50 for the whole game.

3413
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But then don't complain at all when they have to

3414
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
buy a new Wii track pack plus

3415
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
um, I'm sorry

3416
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Wii track pack for

3417
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
a few songs just because

3418
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
it's the rock band title.

3419
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
People say Activision is running

3420
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
the series into the ground but putting out

3421
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
more content but isn't rock band doing the

3422
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
same thing just not with a physical

3423
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
disc? I don't see

3424
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
how a disc makes any amount of difference

3425
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
in the equation when it's still

3426
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
more songs and more content coming

3427
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
out by both companies. Again

3428
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
nobody made such a fuss

3429
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
with the ACDC pack or with the Wii track

3430
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
packs the way they do with Activision.

3431
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Um, the only one I would

3432
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
say is the ACDC pack because that wasn't

3433
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
available online but all the rock band

3434
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
track packs are just for people that don't have

3435
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
internet connections and some random

3436
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
stuff that's available for download content.

3437
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
You do not need to buy it. It's not

3438
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
its own, you know, I mean it can be its own

3439
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
game which is fine but

3440
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
it's not basically

3441
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
you know, it's not required. It's not like

3442
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
a Guitar Hero Metallica or something like that

3443
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
where you're only going to be able to get those tracks

3444
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
through that disc version. So I don't

3445
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
really see the harm in releasing that because it

3446
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
gives people an option that don't have the

3447
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
internet connection to be able to

3448
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
actually download some of these tracks.

3449
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And it's completely optional. Now the ACDC thing

3450
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
yeah that's no excuse. That

3451
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
you did have to get through that and that was

3452
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
also an exclusive through Walmart so

3453
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
And it was one band.

3454
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And frankly a band I'm

3455
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
not interested in. Shock and awe I know

3456
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
they're a great rock band but just not my

3457
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
type of thing. But look at like

3458
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I was

3459
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
going to say look at the stuff that they're doing

3460
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
though with Guitar Hero right

3461
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
now. They've got like Guitar Hero Metallica

3462
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
they've got Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out

3463
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero

3464
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
greatest hits. All stuff

3465
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
that's not necessarily available on

3466
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
their service and granted greatest hits are

3467
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
some of the older songs that were in the older games

3468
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
but I mean they could easily

3469
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
release that as you know download content

3470
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
for world tour. They don't need to have

3471
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
it's own game and really it's not

3472
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
adding anything it's just a reskinned world tour

3473
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
just you know

3474
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
now with whatever band

3475
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and I think it's kind of lame

3476
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
that they don't even have like a track import

3477
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
function that they do with like rock band.

3478
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I do know of people

3479
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
who actually

3480
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
do not use live at

3481
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
all who

3482
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
don't you know bother

3483
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
with it who don't play online

3484
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
so for them Guitar Hero actually is a better

3485
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
option really.

3486
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
But to finish out the email

3487
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
cause he actually did go on with a little

3488
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
bit more. In the end if you

3489
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
ask me it all comes down to people crying about

3490
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
switching discs. Are you kidding me

3491
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I own both rock band games and don't have

3492
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
rock band 2 imported because it takes me

3493
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
6 seconds to switch a disc.

3494
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I play a few songs I want on one game

3495
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
then play a few songs I want on another game

3496
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and some download content. If you have friends

3497
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
over in the whole place just shuts down

3498
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
because you have to switch a disc

3499
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
tell them to take their ADHD medication

3500
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
before they come over next time. And that's the thing

3501
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
with rock band you can import that stuff so you don't have

3502
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
to switch discs it's all

3503
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
you know you can dump it to your hard drive. He completely has the point of what he just

3504
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
said. Well

3505
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
the whole I don't know. The whole point of what he just

3506
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
said is that it takes 6 seconds to change a disc.

3507
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Yeah well and here's the thing

3508
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
it's all optional no one's forcing you

3509
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
to buy Guitar Hero or

3510
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Rock Band so if you want it you want

3511
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
it cool if you don't want it then don't buy

3512
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
it. But don't feel that you're forced to actually

3513
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
buy this stuff cause you know

3514
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
as soon as you start buying every single release

3515
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
it comes out just because you want to

3516
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
be able to you know have

3517
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
you want to support them so that they release

3518
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
you know whatever band you're waiting for or whatever

3519
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I think that's a horrible reason to do it.

3520
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Well to finish the

3521
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
email cause there's still a little bit more on this

3522
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
what happens when the Beatles game comes out

3523
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
because I'm sure you won't be able to import that into your

3524
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
library. Are people going to be bitching about that?

3525
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That's all.

3526
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Honestly I think it comes

3527
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
down to personal preference. I think Rock Band

3528
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
plays better than Guitar Hero

3529
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
in fact I think Rock Band plays

3530
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
a hell of a lot better than Guitar Hero

3531
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
it just seems generally programmed

3532
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
to be more responsive so I have a better time

3533
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
playing that. And in defense

3534
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
of importing your Rock Band

3535
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
One tracks it actually if you

3536
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
want to mix and match

3537
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
bands from both modes especially

3538
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
when you can create your own setlist

3539
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
it actually

3540
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
it gives you more freedom to

3541
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
combine it the way that you want to.

3542
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
But hey whatever sinks

3543
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
your battleship. Well the thing

3544
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
also with the importing on the Beatles

3545
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
version I think that was a special deal

3546
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
that they had with I don't know who owns it

3547
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I think it's Apple or something

3548
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Apple Music that you know they didn't

3549
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
want it to be imported into Rock Band

3550
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
and it's not technically a Rock Band game

3551
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
it's just kind of like Rock Band presents

3552
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
the Beatles it's their own game

3553
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
it's their own kind of thing going on there

3554
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
so that's

3555
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
going to be kind of like an exception but if

3556
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
no ever comes out there's a

3557
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Rock Band Metallica

3558
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
or something like that then yeah

3559
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I'm pretty sure that we'll have

3560
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
import

3561
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
functionality and that kind of stuff and then

3562
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
honestly I don't see them actually doing that I would see

3563
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
them releasing it as like an album you can

3564
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
download because I think that they

3565
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
would get a lot more hits because a lot of people

3566
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
well I don't like this song

3567
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I'm not going to buy Guitar

3568
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Hero greatest hits because it only has a couple

3569
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
songs that I want on it well if you

3570
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
could download those songs individually at least you sold

3571
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
those two songs you know whereas someone

3572
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
might just avoid the package altogether if they can't

3573
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
separate them it's all about

3574
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
choice as Microsoft would say

3575
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
well

3576
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
the next email is actually

3577
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
a short one and I think this is addressed to Rob really

3578
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
because I don't think either of us were really boycotting

3579
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
and he pretty much already

3580
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
answered it but I'm going to read it anyway that's fine

3581
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
now that the boycott is over what

3582
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
are you most anxious to try out if you haven't

3583
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
already discussed it

3584
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Bit.Trip Beat was one I was really looking forward to

3585
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I also want to go back and check out

3586
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
probably one of the Commodore 64 downloads

3587
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
just because I want to see how well those came over

3588
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I'm still kind of holding out for Impossible

3589
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Mission I would like to be the one I would get

3590
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
but I'm not opposed to going back and getting one of the other

3591
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Commodore 64 greats like Last Ninja

3592
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
or Pitstop 2 even just because

3593
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I have memories with that one

3594
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
as far as the WiiWare games I feel so far behind

3595
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
on a lot of those I don't even really know where to begin

3596
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
but

3597
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I know Bit.Trip Beat was one I was definitely looking

3598
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
forward to personally as well as the Gradius

3599
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Rebirth which were the two I picked up right away

3600
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
after my boycott was over

3601
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
that's really it I might go

3602
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
back and

3603
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
thinking about maybe getting some obscure Neo Geo

3604
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
games but I don't know I don't want to go too crazy with the

3605
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
money spending either it's very

3606
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
easy when you're not actually

3607
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
giving away tangible

3608
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
cash but you're hitting a button that

3609
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
drains it out of your bank account you know what I mean

3610
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
that's something you got to keep yourself in check with sometimes

3611
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I used to buy

3612
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
like every single Xbox Live Arcade game that came

3613
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
out and I really had to stop doing that because

3614
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
some of them were crap

3615
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
but yeah I got to watch

3616
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
out with going too crazy

3617
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
on the Wii but I'll buy good stuff as it comes out

3618
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
as I notice it

3619
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
there was another music game

3620
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
that had come out that I want to go back and check out

3621
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
that I missed and

3622
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I don't remember the name of it maybe somebody in chat

3623
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
will speak up but I distinctly remember there was some other

3624
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
type of beat game that had come out

3625
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
previously on WiiWare that I wanted to check out

3626
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Last email

3627
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
This is from Spazinator

3628
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Hi everyone

3629
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
at OLR I have a few questions for you three

3630
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
to mull over I'll try to keep

3631
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
this email as short as possible seeing as most of the ones

3632
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I've sent were a bit on the long side

3633
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
one regarding PSN's

3634
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
high velocity bowling PS3's version of

3635
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Wii bowling have you folks noticed

3636
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
any problems with the game? Gameplay

3637
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
in and of itself

3638
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
seems fine to me but I can see

3639
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
how a lot of people may have a problem

3640
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
with the game specifically the characters within the game

3641
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
so the characters are basically stereotypes

3642
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
ranging from Latinos to

3643
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
70's Black Panther-esque

3644
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
characters and even

3645
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
a gay flight attendant

3646
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
if it weren't for the stereotypes this would be a great game

3647
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
but as I'm actually

3648
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
embarrassed to say that

3649
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
as is I'm actually

3650
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
embarrassed to say that I have this

3651
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I don't even remotely resemble any of the stereotypes

3652
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
yet I find myself offended for the people

3653
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
that the stereotyping characters are

3654
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
supposed to poke fun of what is your position

3655
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
on this am I just overreacting

3656
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
or is there some cause for

3657
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
concern?

3658
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I have a quote I'd like to say

3659
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
about this

3660
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
don't be offended for other people

3661
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
please I'm

3662
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
going to quote one of my favorite comedians

3663
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Henry Cho for

3664
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
using the term

3665
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
oriental to refer to himself

3666
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
and someone says oh no it's Asian American

3667
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
he says well excuse me for offending myself

3668
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
don't be offended

3669
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
for other people if they're going to be offended

3670
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
let them be offended you don't worry about it

3671
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
if you're not doing the offense

3672
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
then don't freaking worry about it that's what I have to say

3673
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
you know you're

3674
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
you didn't make the game

3675
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
you bought it and you didn't know

3676
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
that it was in there you know

3677
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
just

3678
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
roll with the punches fucking deal with it

3679
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
it's there it's you know

3680
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I personally I crack

3681
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
up as hell at redneck

3682
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
stereotypes seriously and I

3683
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
can say that's all my family

3684
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
you know I know that not everyone from Alabama

3685
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
is stupid and inbred but

3686
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I still laugh at Larry the cable guy

3687
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
cause that's a parody

3688
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
you know I

3689
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I don't see what the big deal is his name isn't

3690
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Larry and he's not really a cable guy exactly

3691
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
it's parody

3692
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
perpetuating a stereotype for satire

3693
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
uh

3694
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I haven't played the game I don't really

3695
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
want to make a comment on something I haven't really seen

3696
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
first hand but it doesn't sound like it's

3697
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
as long as it's there's a line

3698
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
there's a real fine line a real

3699
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
fine line between poking fun

3700
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
and maliciously

3701
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
you know hurting

3702
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
people and I doubt this game is trying to maliciously

3703
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
hurt people if that makes sense

3704
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
um but I don't know I'd have

3705
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
to see it it's a bully title how

3706
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
could it be malicious unless

3707
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
it's just over the top

3708
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
with you know

3709
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
if the characters just look that way

3710
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
and may have a little bit of dialogue that's just

3711
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
that's just supposed to be fun

3712
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
you know

3713
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
people need to really I think

3714
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
just toughen up and get the hell over it

3715
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
and you I

3716
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
this is my opinion again I'm not telling you what to believe

3717
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
but I don't think

3718
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
that one person has the right

3719
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
to be offended on behalf

3720
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
of another person especially

3721
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
if there's a chance that they're not offended

3722
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
that's just

3723
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
me

3724
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I doubt I would be offended

3725
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
by the little gay flight attendant or whatever

3726
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
in this game this is like every single

3727
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
game has those kind of stereotype

3728
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
characters because people can identify

3729
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
with stereotype characters you know

3730
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
um they're in

3731
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
movies I mean

3732
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
how many stereotype movies are

3733
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
out there I mean of just like

3734
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
all sorts of stuff it's

3735
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
just it's part of everyday life

3736
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
in the media unfortunately even in Austin

3737
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Powers we had Foxy Cleopatra

3738
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
and that was just a nod back to the

3739
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
70s movies you know like

3740
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
the what's her name Pam Greer

3741
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
you know

3742
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Bobby in chat says I'm offended on dark

3743
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
soccer's behalf about offended people

3744
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
they can

3745
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
bite my ass

3746
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
chew on that for a bit

3747
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
seriously

3748
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
68 makes an interesting comment I don't know how far we want

3749
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
to go with this but I'm going to open

3750
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
a whole can of worms here we go

3751
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
68 says by that same token

3752
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
everyone who isn't not

3753
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
straight shouldn't have voted no

3754
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
on prop 8

3755
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
or should I don't know he used bad

3756
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
grammar here should have that's

3757
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
not a matter of being offended

3758
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
that's a matter of a human rights issue that's

3759
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
different your

3760
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
that's apples and oranges right there

3761
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
it's a matter of

3762
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
taking something personally

3763
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
that doesn't apply to you

3764
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I mean if we were really you know

3765
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
this is something

3766
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
that was supposed to supposedly

3767
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
affect the entire

3768
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
population of California

3769
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
you've got

3770
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it would basically create new

3771
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
taxation it would change

3772
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
economic status

3773
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
it was a very big

3774
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
thing it's a big human rights issue

3775
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
there's a difference though between

3776
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
like I know people

3777
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
who

3778
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
may not particularly agree

3779
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
you know with the lifestyle

3780
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
who voted no on prop 8

3781
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
just because it was

3782
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
a matter of human rights

3783
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I don't know how far I want to go with this but I can just

3784
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
say you know it's like

3785
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
you know obviously the issue was very important to me and the

3786
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
result was very very very very very disappointing and

3787
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I even had some people tell me that you know

3788
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
they voted yes on it like

3789
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
I don't know they felt the need to confess they

3790
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
they voted yes on it because

3791
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
church or god told them to

3792
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
and it's so it's so frustrating because

3793
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
it's like think for yourself

3794
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
how would you like it if it was you

3795
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
it's not a choice alright

3796
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
god anyway sorry

3797
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I could go on all day about it

3798
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
different show whole nother Oprah

3799
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I will go ahead and plug my blog

3800
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
if anyone wants to know my

3801
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
opinion on this I posted the

3802
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
blog on darksacroix.com

3803
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000

yes please okay

3807
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
currently I have a relatively cheap

3808
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Sony Bravia surround system

3809
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
which I got from Target last year

3810
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
for the most part it serves its purpose and sounds

3811
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
good but there is one problem I've noticed

3812
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
unless I'm playing a DVD

3813
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
it's um and it's built

3814
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
in DVD player I won't get surround sound

3815
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
as is in terms of input

3816
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
the system has typical red white RCA

3817
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
jacks um mini plug input

3818
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
like what you'd see on headphones

3819
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
some kind of jack I'm unfamiliar with

3820
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
all I know is that it's the one

3821
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
iPods use for outputs

3822
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I guess um in essence

3823
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
is there a way to trick my surround

3824
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
system to accept stuff

3825
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
like my PS3 or

3826
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
360 surround which supports

3827
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
sound output and actually hear it in my surround

3828
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
sound and basically in my SOL

3829
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
any info on this will help a lot

3830
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
thanks um my recommendation

3831
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
is um

3832
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
to uh go on eBay and look

3833
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
for a hardened Karman receiver and just

3834
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
use your speakers and use that

3835
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
it sounds like your receiver doesn't actually

3836
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
have surround sound maybe Prologic

3837
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
um which would be why you

3838
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
don't have any actual digital or analog

3839
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
um you know

3840
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
surround sound inputs

3841
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
usually you would have an optical in

3842
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
um which you might see on the back of your

3843
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
PS3 or your Xbox

3844
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
360 on like the component cable and stuff like that

3845
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
or um

3846
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
sometimes a coax as

3847
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
well which would be kind of like your RCA

3848
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
plugs but they're orange

3849
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
so um

3850
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't know

3851
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
if you don't have either one of those you're probably not gonna

3852
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
really get true surround sound unless they

3853
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
have some sort of surround sound mode in it and

3854
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
it's gonna have to be Prologic which you're just

3855
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
gonna hook up through your um standard

3856
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
RCA red and white my initial thought

3857
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
with this was anytime you

3858
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
use a converter you're gonna lose some sound quality

3859
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
right you know so

3860
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
isn't that part of the problem too

3861
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
no it's just that he doesn't have an actual way

3862
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
to send the 51 signal

3863
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
over to his um system

3864
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
it's like my old

3865
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
tech support now suddenly look out

3866
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
twit it's like I had a was it

3867
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I had an old system

3868
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
that looked like it was you know 51

3869
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
it had the surround sound speakers it had a center

3870
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
channel and you know the left

3871
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
and right and the two rears and stuff

3872
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
um but it was not surround sound it was just

3873
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Prologic because there was no actual

3874
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
surround it did no surround

3875
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
sound processing uh tip from

3876
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Tigerclaw here in chat the surround receiver

3877
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
must have optical inputs to plug the PS3

3878
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
or 360 into it my receiver

3879
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
has one optical input and I have the 360

3880
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
connect to it and it's outputting 5.1 surround in the

3881
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
games

3882
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
act theft is calling this call for help

3883
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000

you can find a good used

3888
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
card and receiver for not that

3889
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
expensive

3890

3891
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
each old ones anywhere between

and you will never regret it

3894
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
they're fantastic have you tried

3895
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
rebooting your router

3896
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
did you turn this did

3897
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
you turn it off

3898
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
now wait a few seconds

3899
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
and turn it back on no

3900
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
seriously I watched the last

3901
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
episode of Supernatural where they were

3902
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
sort of put into alternate lives and I just the whole

3903
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
tech support thing made me twitch because

3904
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I've heard all this before and it was

3905
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
anyway I would I love whenever

3906
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I call Comcast to say the cables out and that's the first

3907
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
thing they tell me to do I'll be like okay

3908
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
okay I did it still nothing

3909
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
and I didn't do a damn thing I'm just

3910
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000

3911
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000

I say okay please allow me to say

3914
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
before we begin this discussion

3915
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
yes I have reset my modem I've

3916
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
reset my router I have done a repair

3917
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
on the system and I've gone through all my network settings

3918
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
it is not on my end

3919
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
okay we'll ping it from here

3920
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
that's always what happens

3921
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
can you try opening the call

3922
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
can you do a ping

3923
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I don't know anyway forget it let's move on

3924
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
enough tech OLR

3925
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
although I do have something

3926
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
to add but I'll do it in last minute stories

3927
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
this may be cool

3928
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Taito

3929
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
guess what Taito is doing

3930
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
they are still doing

3931
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
more first person shooters in the

3932
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
arcades you know

3933
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
they did the half life 2 survivor

3934
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
and now they've got one called

3935
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
cyber driver which is

3936
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
a take on

3937
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
another first

3938
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
person shooter game but it's supposed to have five on

3939
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
five networked play and a different

3940
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
game system so you can see

3941
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
your battle damage in game

3942
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
so it's supposed to be pretty

3943
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
the screen capture looks pretty cool

3944
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
but I'm like meh

3945
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
because first person shooter

3946
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
is high boring

3947
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
unless they're call of duty

3948
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
but it could be cool

3949
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I know

3950
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
well

3951
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
something else that's

3952
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
interesting

3953
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
this kind of goes back

3954
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
to all this

3955
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
stuff we've been talking about alternate services

3956
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
that are going to be not necessarily competing with

3957
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
consoles but

3958
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
are

3959
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
well level 5

3960
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
from the many games

3961
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
that they have put out

3962
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
has announced a new

3963
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
digital distribution service that will be launched

3964
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
in japan in june 1st

3965
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
and it's called

3966
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
roid

3967
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
like roid rage

3968
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
but what's interesting though is

3969
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
one of the first games that they're putting out

3970
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
looks like earthbound

3971
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
not necessarily earthbound

3972
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
might be part of earthbound

3973
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
but looks like earthbound

3974
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
how exactly does the game

3975
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
look like earthbound is it just like

3976
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
sprite based modern

3977
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you know like set in kind of

3978
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
city type thing looks

3979
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
very earthbound-esque like the sprites

3980
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
look very similar and they're wondering

3981
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
could it be an earthbound game

3982
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
like maybe an earthbound 4 or something like that

3983
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
who knows

3984
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
well

3985
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
interesting I guess we'll see maybe this is something

3986
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
we'll get more details at in a few months

3987
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
and roid for those who may not have heard of it

3988
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
is actually kind of like

3989
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
a little bit like that zebo

3990
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
thing that we were talking about earlier

3991
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
it's its own platform

3992
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
actually looks like one of those

3993
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
the imac ones that they have

3994
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
the little compact ones

3995
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I don't know it's interesting

3996
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
it's cute

3997
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
and I really dig the font

3998
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
that's kind of interesting when the first thing you notice

3999
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
about a game is the font

4000
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
no the game the little

4001
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
disc thing no I'm just messing

4002
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
it's cute

4003
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I looked at the screenshots it did look a little bit

4004
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
cute so

4005
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
alright anyhow one more story for you guys

4006
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
then we're going to open up the skype line

4007
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and it has to do with

4008
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
other rpg series

4009
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
full of fanboy wank we've talked about earthbound

4010
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
a couple times tonight but we have yet to

4011
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
address the wank that is final fantasy 7

4012
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
and of course

4013
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
how many final fantasy 7 fanboys

4014
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
did not get the chance to fap to

4015
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
advent children well advent children complete

4016
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
is apparently the

4017
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
final end of the

4018
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
advent children saga meaning that there

4019
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
is no more special

4020
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
editions or directors cuts or you know

4021
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
hidden scenes or any of that advent children

4022
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
complete is the end of the line

4023
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
which by the way did I not also read somewhere

4024
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
this week that they did confirm this for the US in June

4025
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I want to say yeah but not the cool

4026
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
version with the final fantasy 13

4027
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
demo don't

4028
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
but if you want if you're willing to

4029
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
settle for the one without it or don't want to deal with the

4030
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
import or what have you you can at least get it there in June

4031
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
yes I'm not willing to settle for that so

4032
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
import that bitch

4033
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
however here's the thing

4034
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
final fantasy 7 however as a whole

4035
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
not done

4036
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Nomura has actually come out and said there is

4037
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
still ideas for the next

4038
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
product in the compilation

4039
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
of course why don't you just do the final

4040
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
fantasy 7 remake and then everybody will

4041
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
be the next one coming

4042
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
do you think

4043
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
you think for real I think that final fantasy

4044
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
7 remake is just something that will all

4045
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
only live on in that singular tech

4046
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
demo and in fanboy wank fantasies

4047
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I think final fantasy 7 will be

4048
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
released on Playstation Network around the time

4049
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
final fantasy 13 shows up especially

4050
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
with the other final fantasies being confirmed for

4051
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
the virtual console I think that's just a matter

4052
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
of time and there'll be

4053
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
plenty of wank and new wank

4054
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
as more people discover the series for the first

4055
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
time

4056
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
but I don't think

4057
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
that final fantasy 7 remake is gonna

4058
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
happen but I'll tell you what all they

4059
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
would have to do is add like

4060
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
tiny little things to

4061
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
final fantasy 7 when they re-release on

4062
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Playstation Network and

4063
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
millions millions sold

4064
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
through Playstation Network millions

4065
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
just say you're gonna up the graphics

4066
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
slightly and just put like fucking smoothing on

4067
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
it or something and it'll sell zillions

4068
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I want a new remake

4069
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I actually do want a new

4070
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
remake wank wank wank wank wank

4071
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
seriously well keep in mind

4072
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
final fantasy 7 is actually one of my favorite RPGs

4073
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
ever it was

4074
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
one of the first ones I played on the Playstation I

4075
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
bought the game before I had a

4076
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Playstation if that's any indication

4077
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
so I could play it at my friends

4078
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
house I want final fantasy

4079
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
6 to get the love

4080
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
and adoration first before final fantasy 7

4081
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
gets it but final fantasy 7

4082
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
was really

4083
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I want to say a milestone

4084
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
in the title and the fact that it brought

4085
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
it into the

4086
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
new realm of 3D

4087
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
seriously and I

4088
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
enjoyed the story I love the characters

4089
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
except for Aerith who I was glad was dead

4090
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
dead dead dead dead

4091
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
after the first disc

4092
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
and then they announced

4093
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
final fantasy 7 Aerith's return

4094
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
you know what I actually would not

4095
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
mind seeing so you can kill her again

4096
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
is them putting in the quest that they took out

4097
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
for the US version where you go back and talk

4098
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
to her ghost

4099
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
hmm

4100
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
that I would like to see actually a fully

4101
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
complete version I think that would be cool

4102
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Bobby's in chat saying I bought my Playstation

4103
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
1 for final fantasy 7 me too

4104
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
you may not know this but me too

4105
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I couldn't afford the system but I damn well knew enough people who had

4106
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
one and I bought the game

4107
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I made myself broke because I was working

4108
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
in an arcade but still

4109
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
it was super

4110
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
cool

4111
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I was like oh my god it's 3D

4112
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
and now I'm like oh my god it's blocky

4113
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
alright

4114
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
well we'll see what is next

4115
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
in store for the final fantasy 7

4116
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
sequels upon

4117
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
sequels upon sequels so

4118
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
alright anyhow

4119
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000

whatever

4128
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
on your behalf

4129
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I am offended for you why

4130
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I don't know I was just gonna say that

4131
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
hey what's up it's Bobby not much hey Bobby

4132
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I'm glad you called because you know

4133
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
you have us on your show every week

4134
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
and yet you know we don't get to hear from you

4135
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
all the time usually because you go to bed

4136
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
probably by this time

4137
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
but we got to the Skype line

4138
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
before midnight eastern tonight so I'm glad

4139
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
to hear from you what's up Bobby what do

4140
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
you think of the show tonight

4141
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I like the show from what I heard I had to go

4142
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
do other things unfortunately so I'll have to listen

4143
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
to the archive but no I actually had a specific reason

4144
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
to call in and specifically

4145
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
talk about this on your show because I

4146
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
heard about this on your show several weeks ago

4147
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
ok and it's

4148
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
regarding iPhone games

4149
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
and to preface this a little bit

4150
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Apple really takes their user

4151
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
interface and their user experience

4152
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
very seriously when you get

4153
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
into the iPhone developer program there is

4154
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
like this document you have to read through

4155
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
that says this is the user experience

4156
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
we expect for

4157
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
every user of our device

4158
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
and there's one game that

4159
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
completely breaks this user experience

4160
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
and I am very shocked

4161
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
that it's available on the App Store

4162
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
and it's one game that your

4163
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
roommate Rob recommended

4164
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
on this very program

4165
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
oh really and that would be the

4166
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
role playing game he was mentioning a couple weeks ago

4167
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
right, ARVALE

4168
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
A R V A L E, ARVALE

4169
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
it has a lite version and so

4170
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I played the lite version because you know before

4171
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I bought the full version and he probably

4172
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
hasn't seen this because he said he bought the full version

4173
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
so you probably never saw the

4174
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
egregious insult

4175
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
to humanity that

4176
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
ARVALE does

4177
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
it's strictly against Apple's

4178
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
user agreement so basically

4179
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
when you're playing a game on your iPhone or an

4180
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
iPod touch what do you expect to

4181
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
happen when you hit the home button

4182
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
the big square button you're gonna

4183
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
go back to the main menu

4184
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
exactly that's what you would think right

4185
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
right and that's exactly

4186
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
what Apple wants all of their

4187
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
developers to do it it has to do it within a certain

4188
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
time frame so you have

4189
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
like literally like three to five seconds

4190
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
maximum to

4191
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
all your stuff save everything and go back to the

4192
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
home menu well ARVALE

4193
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
decided that is the perfect time

4194
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
for them to try to tell you to get more

4195
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
money in the lite version

4196
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
of ARVALE when you hit the home button

4197
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
it loads up Safari

4198
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
so it goes to the menu and then

4199
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
it loads up Safari which then

4200
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
closes and opens up the app store

4201
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
to a non active

4202
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
URL

4203
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
so it goes to the home page of the app store I think

4204
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
they wanted to actually have it

4205
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
pop up the full version of ARVALE so you

4206
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
could buy it but this happens every

4207
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
single time you close the app

4208
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
interesting I'm on

4209
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
an iPod touch so I don't know if it does that if you

4210
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
get a call because I mean

4211
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I don't have the phone portions or anything

4212
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
oh god that would annoy me

4213
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
but yeah so when you close the app

4214
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
it takes you

4215
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
to Safari first

4216
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
which then closes immediately

4217
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
and takes you to the app store and it winds

4218
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
up that the URL it gives the app store is not a valid

4219
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
URL so it just goes to

4220
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
the featured front page of the

4221
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
app store interesting

4222
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
no I mean you know

4223
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
since John isn't

4224
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
as into the games as the rest

4225
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
of us are he probably didn't even ever really

4226
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
notice this or maybe just kind of you know put up with

4227
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
it because he enjoyed the game or what have you

4228
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
but that's fascinating why do you think Apple

4229
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
you know aren't these things supposed to be

4230
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I don't know but then again the Apple store is

4231
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
swamped with these types of games

4232
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
so whatever review process they

4233
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
have can't be that thorough

4234
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
so I suppose that's why this type of thing didn't

4235
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
get caught but is it interesting that the game is

4236
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
still on the store

4237
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
after all this

4238
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
it's not that they're not thorough because

4239
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
they would have seen this because it does take

4240
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
several weeks to get approved to go on the app

4241
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
store once you submit it I'm not

4242
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
exactly sure how much I can divulge of

4243
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
it because there is like an NDA involved in stuff

4244
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
but it does take a couple weeks and they do go

4245
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
through and make sure that you're following

4246
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
their user interface guidelines there's

4247
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
several things you cannot do

4248
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
in a game one of which

4249
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I believe I can go ahead and say is

4250
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
you can't have any buttons on

4251
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
the UI that you can't

4252
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
use so you can't say this

4253
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
button is disabled in the free version you can't

4254
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
do that they will reject your game and they do find

4255
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
that so

4256
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
they do go through and make sure that every

4257
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
in the game

4258
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
in the light version of the game is usable

4259
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
you cannot have any feature that's there

4260
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
but not usable

4261
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
so they go through at least that much because I know

4262
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
a lot of people have complained about getting their stuff

4263
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
sent back because they don't follow

4264
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
these user interface guidelines so I have no

4265
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
clue how RDL lite got away with

4266
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
when you close the game it opens

4267
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
up to other applications I don't know how they got it

4268
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
but that being said I did not play it

4269
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
again I deleted it right then I didn't

4270
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
bother trying any further so I don't know if it's any

4271
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
good or not. Interesting

4272
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
huh that is a pretty shady

4273
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
thing to do though with that

4274
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
that's unfortunate but yeah I know

4275
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
he had the lite version because he was playing it for a little

4276
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
while so

4277
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
but maybe some of us kind of expect

4278
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
that that's what the free games are going to do and it's over

4279
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
if we haven't played so it's interesting to have that insiders

4280
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
perspective that they're technically violating the agreement

4281
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
weird

4282
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
I wonder if anything's going to happen

4283
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
yeah I mean I hope

4284
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
so I should probably report them and stuff but I mean

4285
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
the iTunes reviews don't even mention it

4286
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
there's a

4287
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
then it like opened up three other apps

4288
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
one

4289
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
but like this game is awesome

4290
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
all of our JRPG and stuff so

4291
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
yeah I don't know

4292
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Bobby you're cutting in and out of there a little bit I don't know what

4293
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
that was all about but

4294
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
maybe yeah maybe it's just

4295
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I don't know maybe I have no

4296
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
idea it's so weird that people would not call that

4297
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
out in the reviews either

4298
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
now I kind of want to download it to see

4299
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
if it happens with me too

4300
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
we'll see well they

4301
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
updated it so I

4302
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
you know there's no

4303
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
it's a mindset

4304
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Bobby's cutting in

4305
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
and out really bad Bobby

4306
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
can you still hear us

4307
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
are you guys able

4308
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
to hear me yes we can you're just cutting in and out

4309
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
we have a lot of lag issues going on I don't know what's

4310
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
up with that weird

4311
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
but yeah maybe I don't know could it be that the

4312
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
new patch

4313
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
they put out maybe cut this off

4314
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
maybe

4315
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
hmm interesting

4316
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
so what's this about you guys coming more like

4317
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
FNG with live game play

4318
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
is Loki going to be taking a part

4319
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
of the receiver now no I don't think this is something

4320
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
you can expect every week just when we have something

4321
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
to show you know this is a little special because

4322
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Loki you know I guess

4323
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
thinks he's the second person ever to

4324
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
attack the game like this I'm sure there's many other people

4325
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
the second person that's actually posted on the internet

4326
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I see so you know

4327
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
not a lot of people I guess we could say have done this

4328
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and he wants to kind of show this off and maybe if we have another

4329
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
special game that we want to show

4330
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
like a Tatsunoko vs Capcom kind of thing

4331
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
we're doing fucking excitebots

4332
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
when that comes out but I'm telling you

4333
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
excitebots hell yeah

4334
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I don't think you can expect this from us every

4335
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
week no I just like tossing

4336
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
cards we don't have a switcher to switch back and forth from

4337
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
the game to the camera and all that stuff so

4338
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
it's one or the other we don't have the fancy

4339
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
little set up that you

4340
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
three camera set up that you have at the

4341
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
gaming arena as soon as we don't have the camera

4342
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
right now this is what

4343
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
you're going to have to get and it's not a video

4344
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
show and I don't think any of us want it

4345
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
to be a video show right now I think we're all interested

4346
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
maybe in doing well some of us are interested in doing video

4347
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
content for the site but not

02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000

4361
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
deathwishing what's on your mind

4362
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
uh I've been really pissed off

4363
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
since not last Thursday but the Thursday

4364
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
before that why is that

4365
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
uh well if you didn't know when the

4366
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Call of Duty map 1 came out

4367
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
there were billing problems

4368
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
did you guys hear about that at all

4369
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
no but again admittedly I don't think

4370
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
any of us are rabid Call of Duty players

4371
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
so fill us in on what's up

4372
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
put it this way I bought Microsoft points

4373
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
during this time with a points

4374
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
card

4375
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
and uh I come home

4376
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I come home right just walking home cause

4377
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
gas uh

4378
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
and uh I'm really excited I enter

4379
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
the code in I get my points right and I'm like

4380
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
cool I'm gonna get the maps it says points are added to my

4381
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
account click the button buy the maps since I have

4382
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
insignificant funds

4383
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
I'm freaking out wait a minute are you on Twitter

4384
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
no I'm not on Twitter

4385
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
okay so okay somebody on Twitter

4386
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
on my Twitter and I'm sorry I think was having this

4387
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
exact same problem so yes I do

4388
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
remember hearing about this because like didn't

4389
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
something break down with like the billing service

4390
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
or something that night and a bunch of people tried to redeem

4391
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
their points they didn't get them okay somebody on

4392
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Twitter was complaining about this exact same thing you're

4393
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
complaining about now that's why I asked this

4394
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
so okay yes I did hear this

4395
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
and I've been talking to Microsoft for

4396
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
since then and they

4397
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
first they told me 5 to 10 days and then after that

4398
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
they told me uh I was

4399
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
gonna get a call and I got the call saying I gotta wait

4400
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
2 to 3 more days after that

4401
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and which and then the Saturday was supposed to be the

4402
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
third day you know which they said I was supposed to

4403
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
get the points still no points I tried

4404
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
calling and now like they're not taking

4405
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
my call it's

4406
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
wow it's like a bad breakup

4407
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
or something now they're just ditching your call

4408
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and that's like 20 bucks man

4409
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I could have done a lot with that like

4410
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
yeah

4411
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
so you never did get the points

4412
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
you're still waiting never got the points still

4413
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
waiting wow they're lucky I'm

4414
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
a patient guy too I'm

4415
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
wondering if it's more than I mean

4416
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
it's gotta be more than just you I should figure out

4417
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
who it was on Twitter and follow up with them too

4418
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
but there's a bunch of people on the Xbox

4419
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
forums that were complaining too well I'm sure

4420
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
some people receive compensation some people

4421
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
still haven't huh so this doesn't

4422
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
have to do necessarily with Call of Duty

4423
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
specifically it's just that it

4424
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
broke Microsoft server somehow

4425
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
well in a way it does have to do with Call of Duty

4426
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
it's due to all the people wanting to

4427
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
play Call of Duty I see

4428
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
huh

4429
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
well I did you were you

4430
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
ever able to get the map pack like did you invest

4431
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
the points later no I still haven't gotten it yet

4432
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
good for you holding out because there's

4433
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
there's some people that are too passive probably

4434
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
myself included that would have just ended up

4435
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
spending the points when the building was fixed I've been playing Call of Duty 4

4436
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
and got it anyway

4437
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
burnout paradise

4438
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
act deft and it says

4439
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Major Nelson covered this in his Twitter maybe it's the

4440
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
person you think it is Rob

4441
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
no I know Major Nelson was responding

4442
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
to it but I distinctly remember there were people on

4443
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
my Twitter like that too it's Major Nelson

4444
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
who took it and he's just sitting in his bathtub

4445
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
wiping his ass with 20 dollar bills

4446
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
with points

4447
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I somehow doubt

4448
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
that the poor guy has to look I do

4449
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
not envy what Major Nelson does okay

4450
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
because he has to take the heat of the

4451
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
entirety of the internet and it's not him

4452
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
that's screwing up you know it's

4453
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
sometimes a computer error or something

4454
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
that's true he gets paid to do it

4455
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
but you know I don't envy him

4456
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Major Nelson's not really a person he's just like

4457
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
the voice on the computer in Star Trek

4458
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
that's all he really is

4459
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
and what you see is just a hologram

4460
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
he doesn't exist

4461
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
it's all a lie

4462
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
like the cake

4463
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
computer error

4464
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
that's what you're going to find out

4465
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
on our very last episode of

4466
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
OLR because someday it has to happen folks

4467
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
there will be a final episode of OLR

4468
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
and that's when the twist is going to be it was all

4469
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
just a dream

4470
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I just

4471
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
we need to get this problem out there that there are

4472
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
people out here that paid money

4473
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
and not just me I mean other people

4474
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
that have wasted their money

4475
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
and there could be kids

4476
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
you know that don't have there could have been kids

4477
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
buying this stuff they don't have that much money

4478
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
you know

4479
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I know there's definitely a problem out there

4480
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
it's weird that I haven't seen this on a lot of game blogs

4481
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
but then again if I see Call of Duty 4 in the headline

4482
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
or Call of Duty whatever

4483
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I'd probably scroll past it

4484
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
just because

4485
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I don't play those types of games myself

4486
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
alright well thank you for helping to get the word out

4487
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
by the way about Final Fantasy 7

4488
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
it's very emo

4489
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
and I did not like it

4490
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
10 was better

4491
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
out of curiosity how old are you?

4492
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
me?

4493
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I am

4494
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
17

4495
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
see there's something about that particular

4496
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
see I was like 19

4497
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
when the game came out

4498
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
so I don't know if it's something about a generational thing

4499
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
but I notice a lot of younger people

4500
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
like your age and young 20's

4501
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
have a lot more hate for Final Fantasy 7

4502
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
and don't understand what makes it so freaking great

4503
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
but then again

4504
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I replayed it actually recently

4505
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I know I know but it doesn't stack up to today's games

4506
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
what I'm saying is that at the time

4507
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
it was the shit

4508
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
this is again

4509
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
this is why I bought a Playstation

4510
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
but again it's not for everybody

4511
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I mean I admit that

4512
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
and I don't think Final Fantasy 7 by any means is like the greatest game ever made

4513
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
or any of that so

4514
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
you know

4515
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
many sequels makes me angry

4516
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I like 7 and I like 10

4517
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
it is possible

4518
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
but I also liked 11 for a little while

4519
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
alright anyhow Death Wishing we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls

4520
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
but thank you so much for calling and have a great week okay

4521
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
screw you Microsoft

4522
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
bye

4523
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
hope that stuff gets worked out

4524
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
that sucks that Microsoft is just kinda like

4525
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
a responses thing that's kinda shady

4526
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
in my opinion that's just kinda weird

4527
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
um I think we'll do like one more call

4528
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
guys then we're gonna wrap up cause it's like getting

4529

4538
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000

hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio who's this

4540
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
take 2 is it actually working this time

4541
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
yes it is hi how are you

4542
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
this is Jason I'm 23 and I'm an addict

4543
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
oh I mean I'm a Final Fantasy 7

4544
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
fan did I get that right

4545
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
close enough what's on your mind buddy

4546
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
no anti fan wank about

4547
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
scratch tonight

4548
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
yeah you know I saw the story in the thread

4549
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
and then I kinda you know

4550
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
but here's the thing is that I figured we kind of

4551
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
already talked about it a couple weeks ago

4552
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I love how everybody is describing the controller

4553
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
and I have a fucking picture of it it's awesome

4554
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I know I kind of feel like we already covered it

4555
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
like that this new thing didn't really show us anything we didn't

4556
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
already know or did you catch something we did not

4557
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
which is possible

4558
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I think it's more the fact that I probably

4559
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
didn't catch it because you guys probably

4560
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
talked to it on a night that I went out to the hockey game

4561
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
and so I didn't I missed the part of the show

4562
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
that you guys talked I am just

4563
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
weeks behind with this crap aren't I

4564
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
it's fine it's fine I tried to

4565
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
break up DDRS you already covered it in your gaming

4566
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
week I'm trying to bring up this it's old news

4567
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
well then

4568
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
don't worry about if you're covering something we've already

4569
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
covered or not tell us what you think because this show

4570
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
is all about the user interaction

4571
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
anyway you are a long time Bamani

4572
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
fan obviously I met you through

4573
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
such avenues as DDR Freak and all this stuff

4574
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I know you're a Rabid2DX fan what do you think

4575
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
of Scratch? Where every gamer

4576
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
has a voice I

4577
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
it's I have the

4578
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
same feelings for it that I do for Rockband

4579
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
I've said this many times before and I'll

4580
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
continue to say it I've played a lot

4581
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
of Guitar Freaks I've played a lot of Drummania

4582
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Guitar Hero was really fun

4583
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
and then Rockband blew everything right

4584
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
out of the freaking water

4585
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
it's a great game

4586
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Rockband 2 didn't change very much

4587
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
but it's a great game

4588
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I've

4589
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
loved the Beatmania series I have played one of

4590
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
each of them original Beatmania

4591
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
original yes Beatmania

4592
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Gameboy as Black Wolf showed off

4593
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
on Friday Night Gaming two weeks ago

4594
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I've obviously played lots of

4595
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
2DX and I've played a couple Beatmania 3's

4596
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
including some songs with the foot pedal

4597
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
the thing that's different with Scratch

4598
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
is that I'm not looking

4599
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
forward to it to the majority of

4600
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
the song list because based

4601
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
off what the trailer revealed for the artists

4602
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I don't care for a lot of those I don't care for

4603
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
a lot of those artists

4604
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
and I'm hoping they bust out some really good

4605
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
electronic music not gonna happen

4606
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
because it's scratching

4607
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
that's why there's not a lot of scratching

4608
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
in electronica but they are trying to

4609
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
feature stuff that would work with that

4610
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
something to put

4611
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
in perspective as well and

4612
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
as much as this hurts to say this game

4613
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
was not made for you and it was not made for

4614
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
me and it wasn't really made for fans of

4615
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Bamani who are kinda ticked off that

4616
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Beatmania never really took off here

4617
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
because of what some would argue was a

4618
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
poor first showing

4619
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
even though DDR had a poor first showing as well

4620
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
and it really grew and took off from there but

4621
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
this game was not made for you and me

4622
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,880
this game was made for folks that want to have an authentic DJing experience

4623
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:41,160
with a certain genre of music that may not be our preferred genre yeah and the

4624
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:45,760
American DJ scene is a lot different than overseas scenes I'm pointing more at

4625
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:50,000
like UK and European very true Japanese very very true they're gonna put stuff

4626
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,800
in it as long as you can scratch to it I mean that's basically gonna be it and I

4627
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:57,880
hate you know reading that everyone's like oh it's such a ripoff of Beatmania

4628
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:02,280
yeah it the interface is similar and like it way it's played is similar but

4629
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:06,300
the whole scratching stuff is totally different than what they've done in

4630
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:10,400
Beatmania. Beatmania is just another way to hit another button whereas this is

4631
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:15,400
actually detecting real-life scratch techniques using the crossfader and

4632
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:19,140
stuff you're doing the same techniques it's like skate you know where you're

4633
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:23,040
doing techniques that you you can actually do except this you're actually

4634
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:27,560
performing them how you would if you did this on a turntable a real turntable it

4635
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:31,400
would be it sound exactly the same and again it's hard to say without playing

4636
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:35,400
it yet but I would say it's very similar to how a lot of people when they first

4637
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:39,920
saw Guitar Hero were like oh it's just guitar freaks but then when you actually

4638
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:45,440
play it you're like but it's so much better what made well that's kind of a

4639
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:49,040
bad comparison only and the Guitar Hero did play the same it just looked a lot

4640
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,960
better because it had the whole 3d landscape and had a solid scrolling and

4641
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:58,280
way better tailored to the masses yeah absolutely and I completely understand

4642
02:36:58,280 --> 02:37:01,800
that it's just kind of disappointing to the same man at the same time because I

4643
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:06,840
would really love a DJ sim but again I'm not sure that I'm gonna be a big fan of

4644
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:10,760
the soundtrack and that's unfortunate all things considered look at the big

4645
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:13,680
picture though if this game does really really well in this controllers out

4646
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:17,000
there and it penetrates the marketplace it does open the door for the get type

4647
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:21,260
of game you want in the future so Konami can release beat revolution just to have

4648
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:25,600
a go the whole bundle for 20 bucks two months later after its release you know

4649
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:31,640
in a weird way yes and yeah and I think the thing everyone's like getting all

4650
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:36,400
like a big-ass boner for fucking you know DJ here and we don't even know

4651
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:41,640
anything about it yet they have a teaser pages like oh my god it's epic it's a

4652
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:46,160
teaser page it doesn't show anything it's like really know what it's like

4653
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:50,600
scratch oh wait I mean all it's gonna be is mixing music the other mashups yeah

4654
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:53,760
that makes me interested in it because you know I kind of like doing that kind

4655
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:57,000
of stuff I'm really interested in scratch because I've seen what the

4656
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,960
controller looks like it's fucking awesome so you know I I don't know I

4657
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:07,240
it'll be really cool to see when it comes out you know people I'm sure gonna

4658
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:12,640
say oh it's you know such a ripoff the color wise but the colors match the

4659
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:17,440
colors of the Xbox 360 controller they match up to what they are on the

4660
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:20,480
controller because you're gonna be able to play this with a controller if you

4661
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:23,360
want you know for two-player or something like that so you know you

4662
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:26,200
don't want to buy another pad or something you can do that with like I

4663
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:32,040
think the analog six and stuff but it's gonna be pretty awesome and it just it

4664
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:35,500
really comes down to the song list and the marketing behind it they've got a

4665
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:39,520
good marketing team it's the marketing team is the guitar hero too you know and

4666
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:44,120
I think it's gonna be really awesome and you haven't seen everything on it yet

4667
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:48,480
and they're really gonna start revealing a lot starting pretty much in April and

4668
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:51,720
onto the release which was originally supposed to be in June but now I hear

4669
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:59,200
sometime in the summer so you know I I have to reiterate and I know you were

4670
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:03,120
talking you were you targeted more than people who are complaining at it for the

4671
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:05,960
sake of complaining I really am looking forward to the game Rob you're

4672
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:09,480
absolutely right it's oh it's gonna open the door to a lot of good things guitar

4673
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:14,120
hero open the door to be sold off to be turned into rock band by the same by

4674
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:18,320
similar companies and as I already said at the top of this that was amazing yes

4675
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:22,280
the progression that's gonna happen three years down the road stands to be

4676
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:26,480
excellent absolutely awesome and if I don't like the first game and the second

4677
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:31,320
game has a better soundtrack great absolutely great baby steps Jason we got

4678
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:34,680
to wrap up and go so we can wrap up the show but do you have any other parting

4679
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:39,040
thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm trying to think of something witty and

4680
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,880
nothing's coming to me so I guess not Jason what are we gonna hang out again I

4681
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:45,000
haven't seen you in like five years you know it's funny I was reading the thing

4682
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,560
the stuff about e3 coming around again and I kind of want to make that as a

4683
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:52,400
trip this year I think you should but I don't want to drive that long and I

4684
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:56,400
probably would be driving and not to mention with the new with the new house

4685
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:00,480
and whatnot all money situation saving blah blah blah I know I'm trying to work

4686
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:04,760
on it we have some other ideas and I just need to have some steel deals yeah

4687
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:08,800
seriously I think our tickets down the southwest because we're going down there

4688
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:15,280
for Nellie's birthday and for e3 is like $59 $79 we were ridiculous I flew to

4689
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:20,120
Burbank for 69 and that's like cheaper than what it cost me in gas and you guys

4690
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:23,620
would definitely be flying again to LA this year and not road tripping like we

4691
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:27,360
did yeah I'm how does I do yet I might be I might be road tripping I haven't

4692
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:30,920
decided yet it depends because I don't know how much my husband comes with me

4693
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:33,360
then I'll be road tripping I don't know how much I want to get into my personal

4694
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:36,600
life but I might be going to Vegas right after for a personal engagement so if

4695
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,120
that's the case I'm gonna fly because I can't take oh I know what you're talking

4696
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:46,200
about the reopening that I can't believe that that's cool anyhow Jason we gotta

4699
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:57,280
kind of a chicken on roller coasters but hey oh it's Disneyland there you go

4700

4707
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:33,560

4718
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:21,600
that much but I'm sure some of our listeners let us know the mailbag who's

4725
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,800

4726
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,880
was it I have to graphic 16 I'm giving it away

4727
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:02,520
Loki did you have anything tonight or yeah I had a few things okay they're

4728
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:07,040
first off there's Star Trek DAC we heard a little bit about it was teased on DVD

4729
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:10,600
release that they had for the Star Trek series it's actually going to be an

4730
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:15,680
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network title a little bit similar to what we saw with

4731
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:21,400
what was it the Bellstar Galactica thing so that's gonna be good or bad I'm not

4732
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:23,560
sure how you can take it but supposed to come out around the same time as the

4733
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:27,920
movie so within the next month or so Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was announced

4734
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:31,520
actually I think last week and there's some more information coming out about

4735
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:36,480
that the game of course is going to be a kind of a port or I don't know what

4736
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:40,960
Ninja Gaiden black was to Ninja Gaiden say or Sigma the first one it basically

4737
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:44,800
they're gonna take Ninja Gaiden 2 and they're going to add a bunch of stuff in

4738
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:47,800
there including there's going to be dead or lives

4739
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:52,440
Ayane in there as well they're gonna bring back the chick from the first game

4740
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:59,600
I think and there's also the female warrior from Ninja Gaiden dragon sword

4741
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:06,120
which is on the DS so that's kind of neat file front is shutting down so no

4742
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:12,400
more patches and demos from that site which is too bad speaking of iPhone

4743
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:16,320
games nobody nobody boy has been announced to be coming to the iPhone

4744
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:23,520
that's scary there's another thing to they're saying that nobody nobody boy I

4745
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:33,240
guess she was saying that in order to get to the end of I guess Pluto it would

4746
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:36,920
take a hundred twenty years of the current rate right now so I don't know

4747
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:39,640
if we'll ever see the end of this game or if they even program the end of this

4748
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:44,760
game and then rob kind of alluded to it a little bit ago that we're gonna be

4749
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:48,840
seeing some Final Fantasy tiles on the virtual console including there's I

4750
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:53,000
think the cell phone gave me that had was sequel to Final Fantasy for the

4751
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:57,160
after years as well which is pretty sweet and of course one that I know Rob

4752
02:44:57,160 --> 02:45:00,200
was excited about Hello Kitty online has been announced to be coming to the US

4753
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:03,240
how did we miss that on Cheryl tonight I don't even know maybe I'm waiting for

4754
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:07,680
the game to come out itself and one other iPhone app that I saw a little

4755
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:16,080
thing on apparently there's an iPhone fart app that had apparently yippy

4756
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:25,280
apparently the iPhone phone app aromatic and there that's the maker of pull my

4757
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:29,320
finger apparently they're in negotiations to sell dispute pull my

4758
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:34,440
finger once upon a time I guess was an application on the iTunes Store and

4759
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:40,720
apparently was being overtaken by I fart which is now done two hundred thousand

4760
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:47,840
dollars in sales since its release and now they're I guess saying that it's

4761
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:55,960
been kind of ripping off of the one of the other I guess and there's some

4762
02:45:55,960 --> 02:46:03,200
patent lawsuits I guess I don't know really it's a farting app for the iPhone

4763
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:06,920
do we really need this no we don't answer your question

4764
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:10,720
all right let's go around to your base final thoughts we can wrap up and get

4765
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:19,040
the hell out of here for tonight dark soccer and my final thought is wine is

4766
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:25,520
tasty did it help to chill the glass Rob I didn't show long enough this is my

4767
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:29,160
favorite one I did I can definitely tell leaving the bottle open really ruined

4768
02:46:29,160 --> 02:46:36,160
the way it was yummy on Friday your final thought my final thought is and

4769
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:40,840
this is just kind of a PSA but just remember that this Wednesday happens to

4770
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:46,680
be the first day of a certain month namely April which people like to pull

4771
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:51,240
pranks and announce fake things and whatnot so just be wary of anything

4772
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:55,360
that's being announced next week as there's a very likely chance that's

4773
02:46:55,360 --> 02:47:00,040
gonna be fake and most people if they have legitimate to announce they're not

4774
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:06,120
gonna do it next week so just be aware I got a thought for the contest of giving

4775
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:11,320
shit away if we wanted to like take those things those Saturn in the

4776
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:16,600
turbo graphics and take them to e3 and get like Bobby and Scott and all them to

4777
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,560
sign it then they might be worth a little more cuz they have all of our

4778
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:21,880
signatures on it and how often are we all under one roof

4779
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:26,560
hmm I might be Scott was on TV years ago I mean his autographs were something

4780
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:32,200
right I don't know the only one left of us on TV too that's true we were on the

4781
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:38,720
local news that all right I was a Wow expert on the news a few months ago all
